19200111
int	double
the thing is the parameter store can only store values of type double but the code which will be calling this function is a big messy pile of c that was converted to c++ so there are places where it can cause problems or at least spurious warnings to just dump a double in where an int or long is expected

stdout	fflush
it s not documented - that i know of - but it appears in this case scanf causes stdout to be fflush

19201263
stdout	fflush
you shouldn t count on this behavior however and you should fflush stdout when printing a prompt string

19201301
std	ostream
it is necessary to reset the stream s stream buffer because the destructor of an std ostream will flush the stresm buffer it calls pubsync

typedef	struct
i have tried and am having difficulty using struct typedef to give each pthread these characteristics so i can say for example flight.flytime and use it throughout the program

19201694
udp	tcp
however perhaps a better approach would be to include data in the message such as the process count - unlike tcp ip udp offers no guarantees about whether messages will be received so receiving the message once would not necessarily mean only one process is running it might mean that the second message simply didn t reach you

19201699

19201936
for-loop	loops
my last part is the for-loop and if loops i have it stating if gettemp is greater than 0 add to the gettemperature arraylist but i think this is wrong because gettemp does not have temperatures assigned to it

19201966
hash	salt
the problem why you cannot hash the information like a password is that the salt would be unique and the hash function would therefore result in uncomparable hashes-values

19201966
hash	salt
if we could do without a salt we could use a hash function for your purpose

19201966
pbkdf2	salt
if your business information has enough unique information entropy you could do the hashing without a salt and use bcrypt or pbkdf2

19202435
queue	fifo
it basically generates valid moves breadth first implemented with a fifo queue and then puts the new peg disk configurations states in a dictionary with the format state previous_state

19202453
put	get
because java follows the broken c convention that every case needs to have a break or get mixed up with the code below it you need to make sure that you put break s everywhere

19202454

getter	setter
without the object template with just a regular object in javascript without the getter setter combination the program functions fine but i d like to be able to use this to have the script manage callbacks

19202730
width	height
try giving the parallel operation more work to do by looping of the width instead of by 8 chunks of the height

19202730
width	height
i would not do both width and height in parallel you then will likely run in to the opposite problem of not giving each iteration enough work to do

19202735
explode	implode
i can insert into a single row by using and then your standard insert query even though the formatting is a bit strange with the quotes and i ve tried both implode and explode they don t work - but i can live with that for now

19202736
apache	nginx
instead of hot fixing consider having a reverse proxy in front of your play application apache and nginx are good alternatives

google-chrome	firefox
...and revealed that google-chrome adds around the font name if that name has spaces in it firefox does not

19202924
min	max
by the way there s no min max preferredsize set on this jlist

19202926
mouseup	mousedown
you can just get time of mousedown time of mouseup and calculate difference of them

19202941
int	chars
need to write method complete that takes two parameters â a chars and an int

19202941
int	chars
the method should return a string which contains the chars parameter repeated n times where n is the value of the int parameter .for example fill z 3 should return zzz

19202965
for-loop	loops
i ve tried several things like a for-loop within a foor loops

octal	binary	octal	hex	hex	binary
hex octal and binary literals do not work

19203202
int	boolean
to make this idea work you ll need to create an an array of boolean values which are all initialised to false to indicate whether a value in the second int array has been used or not

19203214
getter	setter
this allows you to easily and simply define a private field and provide simple or complex getter and setter while saving space by not having to define whole methods

19203214
getter	setter
java does not have anything like this and from what i can see the general consensus has been to suck it up and define complete getter and setter methods for private variables

19203214
getter	setter
with this implementation you can define simple properties that only require getter and setter

19203220
squash	merge
this question is very related to git rebase interactive squash merge commits together

as far as generic json serializable deserialization and adapter code is concerned please watch and examine this code very carefully as it does exactly what you are asking for with similar models i generated above

19203362
integer	unsigned
moreover getversion may return the version number using some particular format it could pack version major number and version minor number in the same unsigned integer

given your comments i think you could still do the same as my initial suggestion except weight the ranks - i don t see how that won t be valid even if some of your original ranks are in descending order and some in ascending order........but if your rank is to the left of the name you can t use vlookup so i would switch to sumifs although index match would also work so this formula in h2 copied down gives a combined rank assuming weights of 0.6 0.2 0.2 adjust as required

int	chars
another thing is that chars 32 consumes much more space 32 bytes 256 bit where an int 10 only is 32 bit long

19207349

debian	linux
my code run very well on linux debian 7.1 and i can read and write data from to device

19210719
put	get
i think probable reason thats its taking time is because the images would be of at least 1 mb size further you can change to thumbnail and retrieve it and also if still taking time you could put lazy downloading which is done when we take image from the server basically what it does is it loads the text and shows image when we get the image

int	chars
the letter chars add and increment to the value just fine they show up as a b c etc. but the problem i am having is that when i push_back the int value it doesn t actually push_back an int value but an ascii value related to the int that s my guess -- it returns emoticons

on linux we build and link against the versions distributed with the centos rhel distribution which means we link against release builds whereas on windows we maintain our own third-party library packages and on windows we build two versions of every library - a release version that links msvcr100 and msvcp100 and a debug version that links msvcr100d and msvcp100d

19212338

addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	addition
a simple way to understand what s going on is to think that the recursive descent parser generated by antlr will use multdivexpr non-terminals as building blocks for the additive expr non-terminal therefore applying the grouping to multiplication and division before considering addition and subtraction

19212661
integer	unsigned
i need to store a very large number as an integer in a c program unsigned long int is still too small i need a very large data type that will still work with the modulo operator

disk	ram
the workaround is to let gm write the image to the ram disk in many linux distributions you get ram disk for free for windows there are various solutions available

19212668
disk	ram
all you need to do now is to have your java code reads the converted image from the ram disk

19212668
disk	ram
even directly comparing with ram disk approach to bufferedimage the size of bufferedimage is often 10 times larger than a byte array of a jpg image file

19212668
disk	ram
so if all you need is to serve images instead of doing additional processing in java the ram disk approach is indeed faster also uses less memory

19212704

int	chars
notice how the 3 is a chars not an int

19213353
post	get
you should be able to add a submit button to the form to post or get the data response back to the action

19213360

what i see is when i open the app with the new topbar and tabbar is the hide command does not seem to be hiding the header and footer causing them to show while the loading screen is still showing this happens in both ios 6 and 7 then they will seem to hide only after the few seconds once the app is loaded

19214008
margin	height
once i log into the app the topbar and tabbar seem to be cut off like the are the right height but the margin inside the bar is set to like -50px so the bar itself gets pushed up and cut off

19214008
hide	show
to double check this i tried it in ios6 and it does work what i see in ios 7 is the splash screen show up for about 1 second then goes away to reveal a white screen and the header and footer then loads up my webview completely ignoring the hide manually command

int	chars
anyway now i need to basically switch between multiple different cases of exact chars arrays essentially equating certain chars arrays to certain int and i m having difficulty determining a good way to do this as a newbie

19215209
int	chars
since all i am doing is basically a lookup based on the content of the chars array i initially tried an unorganized map mapping a the contents of the chars array as the key to an int but it gave me a type error chars doesn t work as a parameter and chars and such just don t work which might just be because i don t know what an appropriate syntax for that would be but whatever

19215209
int	chars
then i figured i could just convert that to a string and do it that way but converting a chars array to a string to be put into a table to be equated to an int intuitively sounds moronic and converting a chars array into a string seems to be a surprising amount of hassle

19215209
int	chars
i also figured i could just set up a switch or a bunch of else ifs to check for the chars array s contents and set the int but my google-fu is failing me on the syntax of this as well and it also seems kind of silly given that actually using switch doesn t seem to work either

19215234

so i m trying to use javascript to say hey if b post-preview is in the url then show hide this element

19215235

19215340
post	get

google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
it works fine in safari and firefox but only loads 1 in 10 times in google-chrome

19231739
oncreate	onstart
note both oncreate and onresume along with onstart will be called when starting your app from scratch

19231743
post	put
one last thing i ll note is make sure you are doing a put request for this call and not a post as that s a common mistake i see here

19231758

i have tried and get same issues as this answer post upgrade ubuntu - now postfix connect failed to database

19231927
hide	show
i have a link in a div which also in another div but the textarea and the paragraph are in another div so that s why i am having problem on how to show and hide elements in a completely different markuped div from a completely different markuped div

19231955
google-chrome	firefox
as it turns out i had invalid html on which firefox and google-chrome gave me a pass

19231991
children	parent	hide	show
then use your id class to reference them for the show or hide methods rather than navigating the dom via parent sibling and children

19232011
hash	md5
i use the md5 hash algorithm as a checksum for the data i send to ensure the data is correctly transmitted

19232011
hash	md5
to perform the md5 hash algorithm i have to convert the data to bytes

19232018
ant	maven
better use a build tool like maven or ant

19232075
width	height
then you also need to change any code that calculates points in your path purely from the width height use width+origin.x or height+origin.y so when you shift the origin of your rectangle all the points in the rectangle shift as well

19232078
iboutlet	ibaction
note if you are creating the ui in code there is no need to declare any of the elements as iboutlet since that and ibaction are just keywords for ib to know what properties and methods to pay attention to

19232117
post	get
so i created a fb app i suspected i will need to do this at the begining and created an access token but then i could not find any example how to send an access token together with get request i only found an example how to send access token with a post request using curl

19232187
factors	mean
i mean time complexity o 8 n 2 k 8 n 2 and the difference will be in a lower k factors

19232196
post	get
as of play 2.1 there are two ways to get at post parameters

19232359
oncreate	ondestroy
this behavior looks weird only if you are sure you are not destroying your service somewhere in the activity even so what i usually do to make sure that only one instance of my service is running is flagging the service itself using a static flag that keeps track of oncreate and ondestroy this way independently if the activity would like to start my service i have the validations in the service itself

19232366
post	get
currently i m getting data back from my php script and the status of the ajax call is 200 ok so it definetely works but i m just unable to get the correct value for the current comment which has been clicked on in order to post it to the php script

19232407
put	get
now if put is userid i want to get the count of rows of table rows for each month of all app for each factor month wise for the last 6 months

19232426
width	height
here the slider controls the width and height of the circle

19232426
width	height
there are two hidden sliders that control the width and height of the rectangle

19232426
width	height
in this case the width of the rectangle is twice the width and half the height of the circle

19232444
carrierwave	minimagick
note that my environment was rails 4 on ruby 2 using carrierwave and minimagick as well as activerecord-session_store which i ll explain below

19232464
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
the 1.2.0 update wasn t sufficient for me when using safari or firefox google-chrome was working just fine all the time

19232464
firefox	safari
the problem with safari and firefox was that the django backend didn t send the csrf-cookie in the http response

19232468
hide	show
you could do something like the following and show the hidden tr elements and hide the pager div

19232472
for-loop	arrays
at the end of the for-loop id like to .add item object to the arrays list

19232546
width	height
you could use the new css units vw vh viewport width height for this

19232546
width	font-size
so h1 will have font-size 5.9 of the viewport width

19232546
width	font-size
that being said using viewport units for font-size in the above way is problematic because when the viewport width is very narrow - then the rendered font size will become too small and vice-versa

19232546
width	font-size
so let s say we want to apply the above technique such that the minimum font-size is 16px at a viewport width of 600px or less and will increase linearly until it reaches a maximum of 32px at a viewport width of 1200px

19232586
simulation	sampling
x is simulation data only where f is the frequency of the signal and fs is the sampling frequency

19232593
centos	linux
as we have cpanel linux server centos 6.4 we have set it up to use nginx on port 80 using

19232629
apache	nginx
initially i simply restarted psa plesk service nginx and apache

19232635
equals	gethashcode
note i ve overriden equals in the departmentmanager class but not gethashcode ideally you should do a custom implementation of that

19232655
execvp	fork
so basically i have written a c code for a shell that handles terminating the command with and input output redirection using or using pipes and fork execvp

19232708
try-catch	exception-handling
the try-catch reference in msdn has some guidance and examples on exception-handling in async methods and states the completed task to which await is applied might be in a faulted state because of an unhandled exception-handling in the method that returns the task

19232743
width	height
the only thing i had to do was specify an increased height and width to the dialog so the contents displayed better

19232780
rss	feed
i am trying to poll an rss feed using mule studio but have been unsuccessful polling the information using the http outbound-endpoint in the mule application

19232855
children	parent
two sibling elements are in the same stacking context but their children elements are in a new stacking context so if you have two sibling parent with z-index 1 and one of them has an immediate child with z-index 1 and the other has an immediate child with z-index 2 the latter will have the higher z-index because its stacking context is 1-2 versus 1-1

19232855
children	parent
however if for example you have two parent sibling elements where one has a higher z-index than the other no descendant of the parent with the lower z-index will ever have a higher z-index than children of the parent with the higher z-index even if you set the former s children to z-index 500 or something like that

19232862
google-chrome	firefox
if you want your app to work in firefox or i believe google-chrome this isn t possible

19232901
post	get
i have read numerous post on here but cannot get items to add to a landscape screen the correct way up and in the correct position

19232913
google-chrome	safari
if you use the developer console in google-chrome safari you can view all loaded javascript in the resources tab

19232943
vsto	add-in
i just finished writing an update to a previous vsto add-in to 2010-excel

19232986
bmp	png
maybe then you d like to convert the huge bmp file to jpeg or png format

19232990
integer	unsigned
every ipv4 address is essentially a 32-bit unsigned integer and we create an easy-to understand representation of this number by splitting it into 4 separate 8-bit numbers 0 to 255 for what is called dotted quad notation

19233001
put	get
the closest i ve been able to get is this i just guessed where to put the data as it s not documented anywhere that i can find

19233042
httpresponse	request
i am trying to perform a simple get request using apache httpclient however it seems as if all the code after the httpresponse response client.execute get

19233090
put	get
you should put the result on the heap to ensure it does not get destroyed between the time your thread exits and you store it in your main thread

19233158
versioning	upgrade
so if you struggle with using aforementioned omnifaces cdi features in an ear with multiple wars make sure you upgrade weld to at least versioning 2.3.5

19233188
move	drag
i would like to drag and clone sortables from the grey list box into the yellow boxes and have the cloned child li s be able to drag and move within the yellow lists boxes without cloning

19233214
put	get
this piece of code is working perfectly when i run it on my local machine.it creates the excel file at the specified location.but when i put the same code on my iis server and the run it from the server the file does not get exported anywhere

19233223
division	multiplication
1 the conversion back and forth will cause unnecessary multiplication and division operations

19233254
hide	show
i have a hidden div which show and hide on click inside the div there s a form

19233318
oncreate	onstart
when you call getactivity in the context of an activityinstrumentationtestcase2 all the usual life cycle methods get called oncreate onstart and onresume

19233329
nullpointerexception	runtimeexception
the fact that you re seeing different outputs at each execution is because system.out.println writes on system.out printstream while the runtimeexception s like nullpointerexception are write in system.err printstream

19233338
put	get
you need to use the attribute might not be size to get a list view the out put of

19233360
post	get
i am trying to submit a post form and then redirect the user to another page but i can t get both to happen

19233360
post	get
i can either get the redirect or the post but not both

19233362
division	multiplication
no multiplication or division was necessary just int amount

19233393
children	parent
i wrote this jsfiddle to show you a way to proceed based on css classes to identify parent .l0 and children .l1

19233419
int	chars
long if t is long or to an int if t is byte short chars or int

19233419
floating-point	integer
floating-point value is rounded to an integer value v rounding toward

19233419
int	double
which is of type double is converted to an int because of the cast

19233419
int	double
because your method is declared as returning a double that result is widened from int to double with the following rule

19233454
equals	gethashcode
i m trying to implement gethashcode for an object that i have overridden equals on

19233473
hide	show
the logical one use client validation to enable the submit button and a few other client handler validations to show hide warning labels near the fields that have to be filled

19233527
portrait	landscape
for example if an iphone is in portrait orientation and a picture is taken the resulting image will appear to be rotated to landscape

19233621
children	parent
this will stop from bubbling event to parent and rest of children

19233661
fileinputstream	objectinputstream
now in the deserialize method i used fileinputstream to read that encrypted byte array decrypted the byte array using decrypt method and than used objectinputstream to get my arraylist back from the decrypted byte array

19233749
post	put	getter	setter
to put itin a nutshell you have a class per real world entity i.e class user comment post etc and getter + setter that check the validity of the data

19233760
equals	gethashcode
if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each

19233760
equals	gethashcode
compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not

19233760
equals	gethashcode
you are presumably returning 0 for many unequal objects and although this does not break the tenant if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values if too many objects return 0 then you will not fulfill for the best performance a hash function must generate a random distribution for all input.

19233760
equals	gethashcode
derived classes that override gethashcode must also override equals to

19233760
equals	gethashcode
therefore you re implementation of equals should also be posted to make sure that the gethashcode is valid

19233774
uiview	uiwindow
you may be able to do this by chaining the frame of the keywindow you can get this with uiwindow is a subclass of uiview

19233804
udp	tcp
it can support full 1-64k udp or tcp port ranges with dozens of simultaneous clients

19233808
maven-shade-plugin	pom.xml
i think the best solution is the maven-shade-plugin create a pom.xml add those 2 libraries as dependencies and configure the maven-shade-plugin

19233835
hide	show
i m basically trying to find a way to show one path element and hide all other paths wait a second show next path element and hide all other and so on to make it look like a flip animation

the json api result includes each post s id but that of the rss feed when converted by the ajax google api does not contain the post id

19233972
google-chrome	firefox
it works in firefox google-chrome and ie 9

19234004
width	height
the program scans height width and thickness of the frame

19234021
post	put
i know this is an old post but i had the same issue as i wanted to execute my lazylist and put them into the appfabric cache

19234026
implements	extends
it s quite powerfull in extends classes or implements interfaces in runtime so many popular frameworks like spring or hibernate use it

19234048
unsigned	short
note that reading and writing int long long long short and the unsigned variants over the network typically require byte swapping

19234068
google-chrome	safari
safari 6 webkit and same as google-chrome ----webkitformboundaryfhuxvjbzwo2jkkna 38

19234095
getter	setter
the reason why you d have getter and setter is so that you can potentially introduce logic into them in the future

19234095
getter	setter
if your code already uses getter and setter instead of just accessing the fields straight than putting logic into your getter setter won t break other programs that use your code

19234115
vim	sublimetext	vim	emacs	emacs	sublimetext
if vim isn t your cup of tea both emacs and sublimetext have plugins for dealing with cucumber feature files

19234139
width	height
for example here is my code please look at this two children elements they have max possible height and width

19234141
single-quotes	double-quotes
the sql statement even as a java string must enclose sql strings with single-quotes not double-quotes

19234144
backtracking	greedy
the secret is to use the greedy possessive modifier this basically turns off the need to backtracking and hence also turns off the recursion

19234150
rss	feed
i don t believe the console has an rss feed

19234150
rss	feed
there s a handy chrome extension by google in fact here which you can use to pull rss feed out of pages that might not necessarily tell you they are there

19234155
getter	setter
if you re asking why it s good to use setter and getter which i assume you are it s good for a couple of reasons

19234182
division	modulo
you can compute the row and column using division and modulo

19234263
uitableview	nsindexpath
with uitableviewcellselectionstylenone you can still use - void tableview uitableview tableview didselectrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

19234317
spaces	delimiter
note also that a spaces is not the only possible token delimiter

19234339
post	get
when i try to post the value to my url i get an error

19234348
range	minimum
i need to find the minimum and maximum of all the columns so that i can include a slider using which the user can select a range

19234348
range	max	range	min	min	max
if i have a slider for column 1 min is 1 and max is 8 and if i choose the range value as 8 i need to display only the a3 row

19234394
sudo	passwd
the problem is when i start hadoop using sudo bin start-all.sh from hadoop home dir it keeps asking me root passwd as shown in the snapshot before it starts datanode before it starts secondarynamenode etc

19234417
vbscript	jscript
vbscript has the typename function but i ve not been able to find a suitable counterpart in jscript

19234443
hide	show
i can put my show hide div around the entire table and that works

19234443
hide	show
finding that i thought i could just create multiple form tables and show or hide them as needed but that looks bad because there is a lot of space rendered between form tables and i don t know how to get rid of it

19234483
width	height
if the height changes adjust the #highlight_lose if the width changes update sad_smileyface

19234483
margin	height
if the height is at least decalred which yours is set the parent container as position relative just to make sure you should be able to use margin auto

19234483
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
other options include doing your method by setting the margin to negative half the height and width

19234507
maven	m2e
i am using m2e to import an existing maven project

19234540
textview	imageview
but i would do it like this place the badge as an imageview and a textview above your button so you can easily edit the text of the textview

19234556
highcharts	highstock
im my case including only highstock s file worked for highcharts s as well

19234556
highcharts	highstock
i have many charts highcharts s or highstock s possible to be included on same page and i just call highstock.js once and it works for both

19234563
width	height
you won t need the width and height on the divs assuming they contain actual content

19234577
getter	setter
in most cases you re properties should be private and you should expose getter setter when necessary

19234585
hide	show
store the ranges in javascript and write a method to check the user value against those ranges and hide show the respective row

19234605
min	max
since it s c++ you can use std min and std max functions from header

19234617
google-chrome	safari
and this is the main page displayed by ipad safari and google-chrome

19234644
textview	imageview
so the main activity contains one imageview too show the current state of the game a textview for displaying the word to guess and at the bottom a keyboardview for the input

19234673
accelerometer	gyroscope
for the accelerometer gyroscope and magnetometer use a cmmotionmanager

19234693
rtp	rtcp
another option is to pack the raw h.264 data into rtp rtcp packets which is again a protocol designed for streaming

19234715
hide	show
server side table row show hide

19234715
hide	show
client side table row show hide

19234715
hide	show
for client side show hide you would give the tag an id

19234715
hide	show
client side table row show hide for extension library form table control

19234729
onresume	onpause
register unregister the receiver in your onresume onpause

19234785
onresume	onpause
the events onpause onresume .

19234787

then you remove all empty lines with grep and you have to sort the names in order to remove duplicates with uniq

19234816
google-chrome	firefox
have a look at the navigation in google-chrome and firefox

19234816
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome its rendered slightly to the right however in firefox it seems to render correctly

19234858
floating-point	integer
the function itself was fairly easy to write but i can t seem to understand haskell type rules for division i.e i want to divide an integer by a larger integer and get a floating-point result

19234891
children	parent
you change your parent flow to have a boolean input that you check in a decision state the value of this input to decide if you need to go to search include null value in this case so you don t have to change your children s code or execute as a result of your approve transition

19234892
google-chrome	firefox
i need to support ie google-chrome and firefox

19234892
google-chrome	firefox
without basic auth works in ie 10 google-chrome and firefox taking care of older ies by xdomainrequest object

19234892
google-chrome	firefox
with basic auth works in ie 10 only fails in google-chrome and firefox

19234892

i would love to get a solution here that works in google-chrome and firefox with basic auth

19234948
min	max
min 2 max object.size 2

19234959
subtract	add	next	except
one is similar to what you already tried except that because we actually want to round down to the next lower natural number we would subtract rather than add

19234975
folder	directory
note that you don t have to install foo libraries to the system instead you could just install them to a local directory either your built folder or a general location like modules install etc

19235024
put	get
what i want to do is get the 3doorsdown from the url and put it in the target page

19235024
post	get
i don t know how to post and get data from url in php

19235075
zsh	tcsh
mathworks recommended using a different shell instead like tcsh or zsh

19235098
serializable	deserialization
error during serializable or deserialization using the json

19235180
post	get
until my pull request get accepted on github i post the snippet of code illustrating the use of a simple incrementor

19235184
ready	each
the main goal is to get the union intersection of each row against all others so that later on i can just pull out the related rows ready to go

19235214
listview	gridview
i have a listview gridview bound to a collection

19235233
maven	pom.xml
when you do use maven you will need to identify the groovy directory as an additional source directory in your pom.xml

19235233
maven	pom.xml
if you do not when idea re-imports the project re-syncs to the pom.xml it will drop the groovy directory as a source since by default maven does not consider it a source

19235238
implements	extends	inherited	properties
an example from the jdk of where inherited was chosen over composition is the properties class which extends hashtable when all needed was to use a hashtable internally and implements a suitable interface

19235243
stdout	stderr
this will completely detach the process from your current shell stdin stdout and stderr

19235260
post	get
the server is already up and running i can make get requests and some query s but what i cannot figure out is how to pass a bson file to the curl in order to make a post request

19235274
addition	multiplication
in the case of perl there is actually a c program that looks at certain data structures opcodes and depending on certain flags does addition multiplication branching or comparision

19235322
width	height
the idea the glob struct holds the image width height and pixel data which is a pointer to an array of r g b values

19235326
typetraits	tr1
tr1 s was copied wholesale from boost typetraits which provided alignment_of only because there was no standard way to get at that value in 2005

19235326
typetraits	tr1
that s why wasn t in boost typetraits and that s why it wasn t copied into tr1 in 2007 and that s why it wasn t grandfathered into c++11

19235368
integer	fractions
what is the type of your factorial it seems to be something that has an integer as an result and not something that implements the typclasses integral and fractions

19235416
width	height
and then bind them all up inside one div and set border width height padding and other properties to give it a kick start

19235421
post	get
if you don t get it yet post your whole code so i can see it

19235427
box-sizing	border-box
only requires box-sizing border-box

19235437
opera	google-chrome
this encoder bases itself on the webp image format which is currently only supported in google-chrome perhaps the new opera too but i haven t checked

19235446
post	get
and the solution for my problem is to enables both http get and http post on server

19235447
post	get
so i get the post data on the modal

19235464
width	height
when the â zâ key is pressed your keylistener must change the size of the window from full screen size to half size half the width and height of the screen or from half size back to full size

19235486
min	max
it seems maybe having a max percentage and min px css are causing rendering conflicts

19235486
min	max
if you remove the min and max width and simply say width 50px you should get the desired result per my understanding

19235489
implements	extends
public class mainactivity extends sherlockactivity implements isidenavigationcallback

19235501
hash	salt
the main goal is to do a one way not decryptable secured encryption so using hash or not using salt or not that s what i m hoping to learn here

19235515
hide	show
currently i hide and show the content of a div like this

19235543
asterisk	freeswitch
i suspect asterisk and freeswitch will be closer to what you want

19235543
rtp	sip
ser derivatives such as opensips and kamailio are oriented towards the sip signalling and i m not even sure they offer any video functionality other than supporting the set up of calls that use it and possibly proxying the rtp

19235564
width	height
also you need to set the box-sizing property so that paddings are included in width height calculations

19235577
width	height
let s say you have a class called user with the fields user width and height and you want to convert the following json string to the user object

19235585
getter	setter
what happens here is that first the measurementvalues getter is called then the array indexer s getter is called but the setter is of the value property

19235585
accessor	properties
you re two properties accessor away from the measurementvalues setter

19235630
box-sizing	border-box
using the css box-sizing border-box

19235633
python-mode	ropemacs	python-mode	pymacs	ropemacs	pymacs
i actually took the time to get pymacs and ropemacs and python-mode all working independently before finding that little gem and now i rely on it entirely for all my python based customizations

19235636
onchange	onblur
i tried replace onblur to onchange it works but only for single choice

19235643
width	margin
the issue is most likely some margin padding on the article elements causing the width of each element to exceed 50 and so not being able to fit 2 in a row

19235643
width	border-box	box-sizing	border-box
one way to solve this problem is to use box-sizing border-box which means that border paddings are included in the width value

19235682
folder	directory
i extract this and place it in the same directory as my base xsl so that exsl.xsl and my base xsl are in the same folder

19235739
subtraction	addition
the nice thing about 2 s complement arithmetic is that addition and subtraction work the same no matter whether the operands are signed or not

19235740

strcpy	malloc	strlen	strcpy
in practice this could lead to computing strlen huge_string as some small value like 1 malloc ing the wrong amount of memory and then performing strcpy into it causing a buffer overflow

19235858
int	double
the big difference i see is that one stores int s the other double s on the stack

19235872
google-chrome	firefox
after a search on the web i found this solution which works fine in google-chrome but it is inefficient in other browsers such as firefox

19235878
wsimport	xjc
for the record the reason i am trying to eschew wsimport for stub generation is that both wsimport and xjc fail to properly generate java code for the schema files i have to use - which are numerous and rather complex - and despite using episodic compilation i still hit what may likely be bugs in jaxb code generation logic see here and here and overall i have the impression that this technology is not very solid when it comes to complex schemas

19235910
put	get
in my controller i would like to get the values for the checked boxes and put them in an array

19235961
portrait	landscape
this button is clickable only when it is on portrait not when the app is flipped to landscape

uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i ve tried this on a uiviewcontroller without the uitabbarcontroller and it works perfectly

19235991
nhibernate	queryover
as far as i understand p exists in the original scope but stops existing by the time it gets down to the nhibernate queryover command so since linq references objects by name it doesn t actually know what i m talking about anymore

19236447
post	get
the post method insert some rows in a table while the get method fetch the inserted data in addition to some more data from db

19236447
post	get
the issue i am facing is the get method needs to get executed immediately after the post method

19236447
post	get
but the post method is not yet completed and the get method is invoked

19236447
post	get
is there a way to pause the get method till the moment the post method is complete though the get method is invoked from the client

19236448
bash	zsh
what is going on when bash zsh does the following

19236548
put	get

19236596
int	chars
it seems i cannot use any type of data other than chars int

19236628
ssl	https
in order to test the most basic ssl https i am uncommenting the following lines in start.ini

19236629
for-loop	loops
when you use break inside an if statement it will break out of loops that directly encloses it in this case the for-loop

19236648

i am using css to hide all the ul that are inside the main menu ul and show the nested ul when hover over the main ul li s

19236685
children	parent
and here is a screenshot of the html where i m rendering all of the data for the parent and children collections

19236730
put	get
also i have no clue what to put here because i just cannot get my y

19236730
width	height
if you ve anchored it with the first call you don t need to set the x and y just the height and width which you should be calculating as a function of the screen density by the way

19236734
margin	height
since i can t see your code check your line height margin and padding on those list items

19236782

19236842
int	chars
you are going to have to do some impedance matching return int 0 1 or chars t and f

19236849
jedi-vim	python-mode
note that the python-mode vim plugin seems to conflict with jedi-vim therefore you should disable it before enabling jedi-vim

19236868
try-catch	exception-handling
it is possible to almost mirror this behavior in c# is by putting a try-finally statement inside the try block of the try-catch statement with the catch block that throws the exception-handling but that would be a problem if for example the finally block is supposed to contain code that disposes a stream writer that is supposed to log the exception-handling

19236868
try-catch	exception-handling
as far as i know the only way to force control to pass through the finally block is if the re-thrown exception-handling is handled by the catch block of an enclosing try block if you took the code above and placed it inside the try block of another try-catch statement

19236917
width	height
i can only get byte array width height stride but i also need pixel format type like how many bits per pixel rgba32... to create some kind of bitmapsource

19236918
for-loop	loops
because the declaration of the for-loop is the same as any ordinary variable declaration it s equivalent to placing it outside loops much different to how the lua for-loop works

19236993
docx	xlsx
i am not sure why i experienced this with docx and not xlsx since they both have their streams consumed before the save

19236994
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
the three most notable things in this repeater are a checkbox a dropdownlistfor and a textbox

19236994

i have tried everything i can think of to get at the post back data but it all turns out the same - by the time the webforms give me any visibility to the data it s gone

19237019
inherited	properties	hide	show
it depends a lot on what you are wanting to accomplish but since you are adding the myview to a window i am assuming that it is inherited from a ti.ui.view which means that you can set the visible properties which can hide show the view

19237028
put	get
if i put the nslog inside the for-loop i get it correctly

19237029
width	height
define containerw and containerh width and height of your gallery to avoid getting pictures outside of where you want them to be

19237060
versioning	upgrade
most people update to the latest versioning of ios pretty quickly and the number of users stuck with an old versioning of the os who are unable to upgrade is going to steadily shrink

19237066
squash	merge
think cherry-picks and squash merge and rejected changes and widely-disseminated hotfixes and multiple pull sources

19237120
mp3	ogg
mp3 is pretty much your best bet since while ogg is provided for all platforms those platforms may not support it

19237139
profiling	instrumentation
you can run instrumentation in xcode 5 by clicking the project popup- edit scheme...profile - instrumentation and choose allocations or leaks then profiling your app then stop instrumentation click the info button in allocations and enable nszombie detection

19237140
pbkdf2	hash
if wanted to generate sha256 hash then you d have to drop the iterations and length property as those are specific to pbkdf2

19237167
hash	md5
now instead of basing the hash in the asn.1 der representation of the subject as it does for md5 it first calculates the canonical representation and then based on that it calculates the asn.1 der and then uses that as the input for the sha1 algorithm

19237170
bash	zsh
time is builtin in both zsh and bash

19237175
mathml	mathjax

i know how to receive one chars boolean int and double

19237263
int	double
and i want to call malloc in such way that i can then have b a double array of int

19237286
free	malloc
and don t forget that for every malloc a free must be called to free this memory

19237516
int	chars
i m trying to convert a int number to an array of chars without using string operations

19237523

19237662
comparator	comparable
i wrote comparator as i am implementing comparable but this error pops up upon entering in the first student

19237692
hash	salt
via the tutorial usernames are stored in a separate table named members along with their numerical id email hash password and salt

19237694
coalesce	isnull
basically you have to ensure a function cannot return null so wrap hashbytes in isnull or coalesce

19237697
scatter	graphing
parsing the logs into a db format for easy querying was simple enough however i m currently wondering what the best kind of graphing to use would be if i m looking for clusters of data - if say one user is performing a lot of requests one after another with different timestamps for example this may present a fairly constant but low line on a line graphing or scatter diagram but i d like to make it more visually obvious that the user is making regular requests during a period of time

19237710
textmate	sublimetext
angularui have written plugins that offer full angularjs and optionally angularui ide support for sublimetext 2 3 and textmate text editors

19237764
fast-forward	merge
the merge that you did previously resolved as a fast-forward merge meaning that it just took your branch and pasted it on top of master with no merge commit

19237764
fast-forward	merge
if you ve already pushed but are very adamant in recovering the history that xyz was merge in you can still achieve this but the solution is not very clean and it might be easier to live with the fast-forward merge

19237764
fast-forward	merge
you may want to edit the commit message at the end to say something like reverting fast-forward merge of xyz

19237764
fast-forward	merge
your repository is now at the state it was before the fast-forward merge kind of

19237868
children	parent
id is the identifier of the location parentid links it to a parent and children contains all of the children locations of the parent location

19237913
free	malloc
a4q1 94887 malloc error for object 0x100100a38 pointer being free was not allocated

19237925
free	malloc
allocate a new structure with malloc fill it in and hand it to the server thread which needs to free it before it dies.

19237961
postgresql	mysql
i also just stumbled across this and the following seems to do the trick for me on mysql and postgresql

19237963
google-chrome	firefox
on google-chrome the top three images are shrunk down in size but not on firefox or explorer

19237974
folder	directory
i used the directory that the bat file was located in as the svn reporitory folder use dp1 is you want to pass in the directory as a parameter

19237996
textinput	textfield
the inputs have a label textfield background color under the label quad and an input textinput

19237996
width	height
some are different width height multi-line single line etc

19237996
textinput	textfield
i have created a class file that extends sprite and built all the components of the textinput textfield quad textinput so my other classes screens can just create a new instance of this class passing custom values

19238004
eigen	intel-mkl
i have tried to use the intel-mkl to do eigen decomposition but when i use the mex interface there are some errors

19238054
put	get
i know this is not the correct way to go about this because i was getting seg faults so i know i need to have an array then create a new array twice the size that allocates more memory so that i can put the values of the first one into the new one and then delete to not get memory leaks

19238102
post	put
you can refer to a blog post i put together for the detailed instructions

19238126
min	max
you could also use min max to get the first and last date values

19238140
google-chrome	firefox
tested in google-chrome and firefox

19238152
google-chrome	firefox
ps if you re on a mac using firefox combined with multiple canvas renderings will boost your cpu usage compared to google-chrome

19238194
cpu	affinity
some how the cpu affinity has been changed

19238204
rss	feed
the rss feed gained by adding _rss 1 to the end of the url of the ebay search results page produces tiny images

19238204
rss	feed
my only idea is to use the search results pages of an ebay search tool that returns larger images like rumma.ge or browsepic.com then use yahoo pipes to create an rss feed from that

19238206
int	double
according to the docs st_geomfromtext requires text int not double precision

19238238
post	get
the server will only get contacted when the user post the whole form

19238314
margin	height
mdn and w3school seem to be suggesting that height doesn t include margin padding border

19238319
free	malloc
also free the memory which is allocated with the malloc inside function

19238324
disk	ram
indexes are managed the same way the collections themselves are they are stored on disk but hopefully if you have enough ram cached in memory

19238345
hash	salt
in addition all passwords should be concatenated with salt a random sequence of digits before being hash

19238345
hash	salt
the salt value should be stored along with the hash in the database

19238345
hash	salt
if you have only one hash the hacker can examine all the rows and find rows that occur the most frequently because the same password + the same salt always renders the same hash

19238345
hash	salt
use a decent one-way cryptographically secure hash with a user-specific salt

19238345
hash	hmac
the addition of application-specific pepper which is the same every row and must be cryptographically random and held in a secure location tranforms the hash into an hmac hash-based message authentication code which is even better

19238346
width	height
i have tried to do so with setting width and height in the css but it has no effect

19238347
fwrite	unistd.h
that being said what might be the actual problem is that the arguments you are passing in on that line don t look like they are for fwrite they look like arguments to write which is also defined in unistd.h

19238373
qsharedpointer	qscopedpointer	qsharedpointer	qpointer	qscopedpointer	qpointer
qpointer qsharedpointer qscopedpointer are all your friends

19238401
int	double
i have problem with my c++ console app when i tried to output double that calculate from vector int it show me 0

19238419
dictionary	map
use a dictionary hash map as you split the list store the items in a lookup dictionary

19238423
int	double
it looks like it contains int s and if that is the case you need to cast to double

19238427
maven	pom.xml
i can google and find out what maven dependency to include in the pom.xml file

19238463
daemons	launchd
as for memory bandwidth what i m having now is a naive idea which is to launchd a simple daemons to consume the memory bandwidth while profiling your application by simply repeating accessing the main memory be sure to consider the existence of cache

19238495
firefox	safari
it looks like you re adding the name as a element -- firefox and safari both add 1em margin to paragraphs by default so that may be your problem right there

19238568
bash	zsh
in bash or sh that is fine but in zsh i don t want that as which is a built-in that is already aware of aliases and functions

19238579
getter	setter
just now i thought of a solution using getter and setter functions for each variable

19238633
touchesbegan	touchesended
your sizinghandle class should override touchesbegan withevent and touchesended withevent and forward those messages to their delegate

19238668
puts	putchar
this uses far fewer calls to putchar only one printf could use puts per line preserves most of what you were doing

19238685
libs	buildpath
then if for a particular project you need to use a specific jre right click on that project and then go to buildpath - libs - - edit and pick you jre

19238715
post	get
and request method get post .

19238754
dropbox	skydrive
create a google drive skydrive dropbox account and leave it there

19238777
post	get
i have a restful api service and i want to get the parameters and headers in a post request

19238779
int	chars
x has an int value as it is a chars of non-zero value therefore the expression would evaluate true

19238779
int	chars
not to be confused with 0 as 0 is a chars and has an int value

19238783
hide	show
so when it s time to show hide buttons from server-side the buttons never get show though a verified user has previously been authenticated

19238783
post	get
however i using jquery and functions to communicate with the php server so it can t use the url to get post the sid automatically as it normally would

19238814
getter	setter
this way you can get the one instance of the class edit its fields using getter and setter

19238821
for-loop	arrays
in an effort to create infowindows for markers inside of a google map i have used an arrays to create disposable objects inside of my for-loop

19238835
versioning	upgrade
you are using a very old versioning of bootstrap 2.1.1 which is not compatible with jquery 1.9 versioning there are many deprecated features removed in this versioning including the .browser extension which is used by bootstrap - if you cannot upgrade to a new versioning of bootstrap for the time being you can include the migration plugin to fix this problem

19238864
clang	llvm
it s possible but not worth it to cross-compile for that platform considering you need access to a mac anyways to get the libraries and header files you need to patch gcc and clang and llvm etc

19238864
deb	dmg
there s also cpack which lets you generate deb rpm nsis windows and dmg mac installers packages

19238879
getter	setter
it will mean that you will only ever have one instance of you class thingymabob and you can access its properties as you normally would via getter and setter

19238914
int	chars
this sounds like a simple fix you have to read int not unsigned chars

19238914
int	chars
since your image uses unsigned chars all you need to do add is some temporary int for the read

19238919
inherited	properties
whether you use a predefined or custom cell you can change the cellâ s background using the backgroundview properties or by changing the inherited backgroundcolor properties

19238927
stdout	stderr
i m assuming you re invoking the other program through either processbuilder or runtime.exec both return a process object which has methods getinputstream and geterrorstream which allow you to listen on the output and error stdout stderr streams of the other process

19238930
ssl	https
this is exactly why https ssl exists

19238949
versioning	upgrade
using postgresql versioning 7.4.30 upgrade to 9.2 in process

19238949
versioning	upgrade
i tried this same command in test db which is now upgrade with versioning 9.2

19239023
width	height
then limit the calculation for width and height of the buttons you are using and trigger events if they exceed the threshold

19239093
division	multiplication
also the first one uses division while the second one uses multiplication

19239093
int	double
but as these values get larger the conversion from double to int might begin to overflow causing undefined behavior

19239096
getter	setter
suppose there is a user defined class myclass that has a setter and a getter function

19239136
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsitem
but when i call scale on the qgraphicsview containing it the size of the qgraphicsitem changes as well

19239241
spaces	delimiter
i am trying to use strtok to parse a string delimiter by spaces

19239257

i would like to get images with a width larger than 1919px and put it in another folder

19239277
mouseout	mouseup
finally the mouseup and mouseout handlers stop the drag operation by clearing the isdown flag

19239313
for-loop	arrays
after that calculate distance between my current location to all of the coordinates using for-loop and put the result into an arrays too

19239320
min	max
it s possible to utilize html5 validation mechanism with some javascript to dynamically update min max attributes

19239320
range	max	range	min	min	max
both min and max could be applied to the respective fields for enhanced ux if browser implementation of a datepicker respects range limitations by disabling dates outside of the desired range

19239370
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
the code works perfectly on new google-chrome firefox safari

post	get
because the notifications require data such as username for message notifications or a article title say your following an author and they release a new blog post one notification would need to pull username form users table and then also the title of the blog from the blog table this causes my page to lag even on localhost which i m guessing would get significantly worse once uploaded and tested in the wild

19251704
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox we have no problems what so ever but with ie the cookie and session are not being read i have read that the now unused p3p policy is still enforced by ie when cookies are used with iframes so i have set content headers through iis and tried to set different cp values as well but this has changed nothing

19251755
google-chrome	firefox
this is not exclusive of firefox i be experienced similar problems in google-chrome and ie

19251838

qtcpsocket	qtimer
issue is that the qtimer and the qtcpsocket inside commshandlerip class are in the main thread even if you move commshandlerip

19252722

my decidedly non-scientific survey suggests that asterisk is used very widely under the hood of many modern pbx devices not avaya nortel and other old-guard but they usually wrap the asterisk service in vendor-specific management layers

19252870
hide	show
i made a switcher to hide or show specific parameters and made this code for it

19252897

19253188
post	get
google chrome will not make arbitrary post requests like it does get requests

19253188
post	get
you can still use get requests for users to retrieve an html page that might have forms that allow them to do a post to activate your various services but the resource url that the user hits to do something that has a side effect should only do that side effect if the user post to the resource

19253188
post	get
in a django view you can detect if a request is a get post or other method by using request.method attribute

hide	show
if you collect the child i that is clicked it helps later to decide which div to show hide

19253286
children	parent
consider for example a table called parent and a table called children

19253286
children	parent
the children table must have a parent by definition

19253286
children	parent
so you would create a foreign key constraint from the children table to the parent table on some column like parentid

19253286
children	parent
this prevents rows from being entered into the children table which do not have a matching parent

19253286
children	parent
likewise it prevents parent from being deleted if they have corresponding children

19253286
children	parent
so if you wanted to return the children of a parent by name you might do something like this

submit	submission
the best solution is store the email addresses to be used in a table email_address_table and each submission in a seperate table sent_table then everytime a visitor hits submit before it saves and gets sent sent_table it checks what was the last email address that was used in sent_table and check which one is next in the list in the email_address_table saves and sent it that way you can be sure to get an even distribution

free	malloc
which means that the address you pass to free is no longer the same that was returned by malloc which is an error

19253892
int	double
another efficiency improvement - you might also consider using fixedpoint int arithmetic for the distances where you decide upon the range of values and rather than use an an explicit decimal point storage as in float double scale your fixedpoint number by an implicit value which would factor out of the distance calculation

width	height
i get the blob using urlfetchapp.fetch photolink but the image has not necessarily the right size so in the html code i use width and height attributes for now with fixed values see code below but i d like it to be automatically resized with the right ratio

19257264
width	height
to achieve that i need to know how to get the original size of the image height and width but i just don t know how to get it without inserting the image in an intermediate document which would work but i find this approach a bit weird and unnecessarily complicated.

19257270
free	malloc
also consider using malloc for creating your array because the way you do it now your array will be created on the stack which has finite capacity and will be free when function that creates it returns just like regular automatic variable

19257273
hide	show
the first div is a intro page with a button to hide first div and show second div.second div is the main content of the page

19257282

i didn t find a way to send curl request trought this method sending raw data put data instead of post

19257302
int	double
you can think of an int as a class and int double

19257302
int	double
as a way of constructing an int from a double you have a const reference to that int which was constructed from a double

19257335
super	self
however in the constructor for rectangle the call super self.__class__ self is going to return the superclass of msquare so it calls the constructor for rectangle again

19257349
maven	pom.xml
i have a pom.xml profile set up that calls maven 2.2.1 assembly to create a custom artifact that we ll upload to a third-party vulnerability assessment tool

19257436
matlab	simulink
i have to prove to my client that fortran is faster than matlab simulink

19257436
matlab	simulink
all charts that i found compare matlab simulink x fortran but do not specify if the matlab code is compiled or not using matlab coder toolbox

19257440
asterisk	pbx
some excellent examples of goertzels are in the asterisk pbx dsp code

19257441
int	double
when you convert the double to an int the result is an rvalue of type int

19257442
folder	directory
after search here in the forum i found solution to my question i have root folder and i want to find the newest file from each directory under the root folder

19257445
int	double
a reference to an int cannot refer to a double

19257445
int	double
therefore in the marked line a conversion from a double to an int takes place and the result of conversion is a temporary rvalue

19257496
post	get
i m trying to load data from the nodes in my xml file to get them to post in a listbox

19257500
button	checkbox
in docusign you have the ability to add grouped radio button as well as checkbox the difference between them is that with grouped radio button one and exactly one selection must be chosen however with checkbox any number of them including 0 can be selected

19257500
button	checkbox
if the parent tab is a checkbox radio button optional signature or optional initial use â œonâ as the value to show that the parent tab is active

19257523
jar	war
i have put the jar connector to war web-inf lib folder and added a library build path

19257534
matlab	simulink
now if you use matlab coder or simulink coder for simulink to generate c code from your matlab code then it is likely that you will get a speed up compared to interpreted matlab code

19257547
typedef	struct
i have a typedef for a struct in sampleheader.h that is similar to

19257569
many-to-many	many-to-one
this allows it to prefetch many-to-many and many-to-one objects which cannot be done using select_related in addition to the foreign key and one-to-one relationships that are supported by select_related

19257591
int	double
well the reason is actually is a reference type which can refer to an object of type int only not double so a temporary object of type int is created out of the expression i which is double but the temporary object cannot bind to so it gives compilation error but as soon as you put const there it compiles fine because a temporary object of type int can bind to

19257639
put	get
i am not entirely familiar with the process behind the mp.queue but it involves pickling the items on the queue between the put and get processes

19257648
put	get
now the value get s directly put into the query instead of as a string what i think you want

19257659
google-chrome	firefox
on google-chrome and firefox i m able to upload a picture to the server via these steps

19257660
getter	setter
it seems the issue is because of weird setter getter of basemodel which is extended by paymentdetails

19257671
width	margin
if you d like the text centered in the div remove the width on the li tag and make the margin

19257692
opera	firefox
sounds like firefox and opera are following the spec and webkit is not.

19257713
int	double
on a compiler where it throws an error if you cast it to you would see undefined behavior since you are reading an int from a double s location

19257724

when i start the server using . apachectl start i manage to get the server running to serve http as well as php pages but when i try to start ssl for https using . apachectl startssl i get the error below

19257823
folder	directory
basically you create the .git folder wherever you want then set the git core.worktree config to the directory that should be versioned

19257902
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
if it is empty at first insertion you will not enter the for-loop but copy the temp arrays it will go into loops at next insertion with length 1

19257935
interpolation	splines
i am trying to interpolation the following function using the matlab function splines

19257953
post	get
in another post i found out that sometimes ui run cycles are so busy that they don t get to refresh completely so i used a solution that partially solved my problem now every request rises the hud but pretty much half the times the app crashes

19257994
getter	setter	accessor	properties
and because you implemented both the setter and getter you have to manually synthesize the properties at the beginning of the implementation usually you don t have to do this anymore but if you implement all of the custom accessor you have to manually synthesize

19257999
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i m trying to add a child view controller to a uiviewcontroller contained in a uinavigationcontroller with this code

19258002
for-loop	loops
basically python needs objects that it can loops through to make a for-loop so if you wanted a for-loop that would start at 0 and end at 10 you would do something like this

19258018
int	double
so i have the following function to read an extended extended double 80bit-precision double and output as a normal int

19258018
put	get
wich is called by another function any function but i will put here the actual code where i get the error

19258075
xdebug	xhprof
check the max_execution_time setting aswell and maybe inspect using a profiler xdebug xhprof if the command seems to hang

19258094
crypt	hash
you can t because crypt isn t an encryption function it s a one-way hash function

19258096
hide	show
however you should be able to show hide headings for each by detecting when the page is or is not in edit mode

19258096
hide	show
then you can show hide that heading like so in code behind

19258100
folder	directory
what i am trying to do is create a specific folder in the new directory for each user that has multiple files and move all associated files into that folder

19258106
min	max
i would use the setbounds method to preload the points from the disk based on the decimation algorithm you already implemented using the min max and maxpts in parameters

19258114
illegalargumentexception	unchecked-exception
also note you don t need to declare a throws because illegalargumentexception is an unchecked-exception so i removed it

19258126
uitableview	reloaddata
strangely other uitableview update correctly if i just call reloaddata

19258149
int	double
sample inputs are any double or int will be converted to double

19258187
put	get
if i put the r at the end of the progress display other messages all terminated with n would visually override the progress display and get mixed up with remains if they are shorter than that

it works fine in firefox safari and google-chrome on both windows and mac but it does not want to work in ie8

19258366
joptionpane	jdialog
it is a jbutton if you follow my suggestions above and make your own jdialog and don t use a joptionpane

19258411
hash	md5
the only way to find what the encrypted version is is to md5 hash combinations of characters until the results match

19258431
comparator	comparable
however for sorting lists you have collections.sort which can rely on both natural order if elements implement comparable or a custom comparator

19258492
post	get
in any case for a login method you probably should use a post request not a get request

19258518

19258727
vbscript	vba
this is vba code but it could easily be tweaked to run as a vbscript

19258733
put	get
first if the item you pick as the pivot happens to be the smallest in the collection you ll get infinite recursion -- it ll put all the elements into the upper partition but when it attempts to sort the upper partition it ll get the same elements in the same order put them all in the upper partition and repeat indefinitely

19258739
google-chrome	safari
this problem is only occurring in webkit browsers google-chrome and safari

19258739
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
works fine in firefox but breaks in google-chrome safari

19258753
vlan	packets
setsockopt msocket sol_socket so_priority would set the internal sk_priority for the packets in the kernel ip stack not the vlan priority

19258828
for-loop	loops
it turns the for-loop into an endless loops for whatever reason

19258832
children	parent
a have a double layout being a framelayout parent with two children layouts that can be altered between visible and not visible

19258832
hide	show
when your user clicks the button hide the cameralayout and show photopreview

19258854
for-loop	loops
and when you declare loops variable i it occupies the next place in memory as was the last time a variable was declared before you got to the for-loop - which you happen to get to when you index to a memory location you are not allowed to access but you did anyway

19258858
mapply	tapply
i d like to figure out a way to do this with sapply tapply mapply etc

19258905
put	get
to get more sophisticated you will need to utilize some tricks i have put into my debug project at

19258912
tolower	toupper
also look at the functions std transform and std tolower or std toupper to convert your string to upper or lower case so you can reduce the number of expressions

19258928
std	ostream
change your tactics if i really wanted to side-step the problem because it isn t your code create a new class called my_error_stream or something that extends std ostream that way you can use it like std cerr which is a std ostream

19258958
portrait	landscape
if i take a picture in portrait the image returned is taken in landscape

19258958
portrait	landscape
when taking it in landscape the result will be a portrait image

19258958
portrait	landscape
i have no idea why the photo is taken in landscape instead of portrait and vice versa

19258993
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade php versioning and it works

19259000
union	distinct
union also performs a distinct so if without the pk you have multiple occurences of the rest of the columns these will be reduced to one

19259000
union	distinct
try union all which doesn t imply distinct

19259013
children	parent
then iterate over the dictionary and for each node look up its parent and add it to the parent s children

19259017
client-side	server-side
you are correctly sending the extra form data client-side but i believe your server-side implementation is not correct

19259027
folder	directory
hard to say exactly given the amount of detail you ve provided but surely the deployed application will be at least have a configuration to the root folder of the directory structure it s going to use

19259027
folder	directory
all depends on how configurable you need it to be but at it s simplest a default to say mydocuments or some folder under appdata if nothing there.otherwise the root folder of the directory structure out of app.config

19259039
d3.js	leaflet
i d like to use d3.js + leaflet with the albers usa projection

19259039
d3.js	leaflet
i used mike bostock s d3.js + leaflet demonstration as a starting point found here

19259053

for example h is the height of the image w is the width how can i do this pseudocode

19259076
cashapelayer	calayer	uiview	calayer	uiview	cashapelayer
i have a uiview whose layer has 2 sublayers one is a cashapelayer and the other a calayer

19259076
cashapelayer	calayer
and here is the code that creates and starts the 2 different animations self.drawinglayer is the cashapelayer and self.pencillayer is the calayer

19259101
google-chrome	firefox
i have a very basic code that just won t work on firefox but works fine on google-chrome

19259101
google-chrome	firefox
and it works just fine on google-chrome but not on firefox

19259110
stopwatch	chronometer
i am working on implementing a stopwatch by using a chronometer and a textview

19259115
hash	md5
on demo sales the 2checkout md5 hash will fail to validate because the returned hash is computed using a 1 for the order number

19259141
google-chrome	safari
problem is that it works in google-chrome but not in safari or ie

19259143
std	ostream
although it isn t whining about your cout line now it will when you fix this error because it doesn t know how to do a on a std ostream and a fraction

19259150
post	get
you can get pip on windows following this post

19259151
union	distinct
as geomagas pointed out there s an implicit distinct with union but since the same tables and fields are involved you can just use an or instead

19259157
button	checkbox
i tend to use this approach because it also works for multiple checkbox or radio button groups as well

19259204
for-loop	loops
to change a for-loop into a while loops you have to break it into three parts initialize loops variable write a while test and update loops variable inside the body

19259231
gridview	repeater
by the way this technique works in all web-databound controls like repeater gridview etc

19259235
google-chrome	safari
without seeing your page it is possible that the two browsers have slightly different viewports and safari fits everything in the viewport and google-chrome does not

19259363
fadein	fadeout
the second is in the nature of the functions fadein and fadeout

19259368
inherited	properties
the reason that #id works normally is because the properties is inherited

19259374
mouseup	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown
on mousedown i save the mouse coordinates create a new div with size and bind event handlers for mousemove and mouseup

19259374
mousemove	mouseup
on mouseup i unbind the event handlers for mousemove and mouseup

19259374
google-chrome	firefox	mousemove	mousedown
it seems to work good in firefox and even ie 10 but in google-chrome sometimes the mousemove event fires only 2 or 3 times after mousedown so the drawn div doesn t get resized

19259397
box-sizing	border-box
i also added box-sizing border-box

19259404
opera	safari
when safari implemented webfonts version 3 they decided to go for the .svg and opera followed

19259410
put	get
i have it working but i put the jar on the server to get it to work

19259458
dlsym	dlopen
why not dlsym for this structure symbol the reason i am not so keen on adding this structure as a dynamic symbol is that i am writing an api to read the version information which i plan to have contained in a separate segment which will ultimately determine if i should dlopen this so file at all

19259462
post	get
i created 4 http requests a get one for login page a post one for logging in a post one again for ajax results and another get one for selecting results

19259474
bash	tcsh
i recently moved from tcsh to bash and have been adjusting to the different tab completions

19259486
asterisk	ivr
setup an ivr with asterisk

19259492
fadein	fadeout
the handler is executed for every time you click and scroll down the page so you are pushing a ton of fadein and fadeout calls onto jquery s animation queue

19259500
inherited	properties
however re-declaring a protocol properties in the interface of a class that inherited from a class that declares conformity to this protocol does not lead to the properties being automatically synthesized

19259500
superclass	subclassing
one must either re-declare the property in the basest class that declares conformity to the protocol or add an synthesize statement within the superclass or in each of the subclassing

19259557
directx	gdi
it is fully up to date and makes directx work almost like the standard gdi

19259565
free	malloc	toolchain	newlib
apparently your active gcc toolchain newlib stubs don t support use of low level dynamic memory allocation malloc free etc.

19259568
apache	lighttpd
i m moving from apache to lighttpd and need to setup similar rewrite rules

19259585
width	height
i m not sure that you even need to re-configure the height or width constraints for the image views

19259624
post	get
edit you can do the same thing with get requests if you need to just swap out post for get this can be useful if you need to support rest over jsonp

19259626
google-chrome	firefox
i m having an issue with font-face in my site with two browsers firefox and google-chrome

19259626
opera	safari
if i type the uri in the browser it download the font without problem so the font is there opera and safari displays the site with the right font

19259626
opera	safari
i know the font is there and my css shouldn t be that bad because it works in safari both desktop and mobile and in opera

19259630
spaces	delimiter
a pretty safe delimiter to use is a single spaces especially if you take care to ensure that any spaces within a url are properly -encoded as 20

19259644
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in both google-chrome and firefox

19259662
for-loop	loops
this uses the relatively obscure else clause on the for-loop which is not executed if loops exited due to a break and assumes that the word lengths are all equal - testing for non-equal lengths is of course straightforward

19259681
put	get
everything reads and writes just fine but when i publish the project and put it on iis i get an error message saying that the oledb provider isn t registered on the local machine

19259699
disk	ram
to avoid getting database or disk is full in the first place try this if you have lots of ram

19259699
temp	tmp
it means the temp directory is full. i have 256g of ram but only 2g of tmp so this works great for me

19259716
xslt	xquery
certainly that s the way most apis present them as well as xquery xpath and xslt

19259722
width	height
x y for center and width height for axes

19259742
width	height
my main view controller contains a view with an instance of mybutton specified in ib with a width and height of 100

19259776
whenever	capistrano	capistrano	rvm
i m deploying an app that uses capistrano whenever rvm

19259776
whenever	capistrano
these solutions include setting in .rvmrc configuring schedule.rb to use the proper capistrano route and using an alternative whenever gem

19259776
jobs	cron
checking crontab -e whenever is successfully creating the cron jobs

19259783
put	get
where can i put these files so they don t get stored with the test results

19259791
asterisk	ivr
setup an ivr with asterisk

19259853
floating-point	fixed-point
i would guess that it was made a floating-point type rather than fixed-point because of indecision regarding the number of digits that should be to the right of the decimal

19259881
post	get
having the same issue you can still get the content by requesting the post specifically when you request a blog via

19259883
strtol	atoi
so i have known for a while that std atoi has been deprecated and it s been recommended to use std strtol instead

19259942
int	chars
you can declare an int and enum and byte and chars and short or in java 7+ a string

19259947
folder	directory
by placing the nuget.config file in solutions above any .sln files we are taking advantage of the fact that nuget will recursively navigate the folder structure upwards from the current working directory looking for a nuget.config file to use

19259948
put	get
if you put a pointer in a firstprivate clause then each thread would get a separate copy of the pointer variable but initially all copies would be pointing at the same place in memory

express	node.js
i ve been trying to create a node.js app with the express framework in webstorm 7

19260155
daemons	systemd	daemons	launchd
and actually i would recommend integrating with your platform s daemons management tools like upstart or launchd or systemd or a cross-platform one like runit rather than depending on any daemonization code including that in twistd but i would need to know more about your application to know what to recommend.

19260159
qslider	qwidget
i have added the qwidget with a qslider on it

19260159
qslider	qwidget
i m showing the qwidget witha qslider on middle click

19260163
hide	show
i have some this js to show and hide a div which is okay if i use a parent div but i would rather reorder

19260194
int	double
the point is that you change your class so that it can be used for other types except double for example int float etc in the same way

19260230
ant	maven
i know you can do so by using maven or ant but i don t want to add a 2nd build system into our project

19260230
ant	maven
would appreciate not turning this into an ant or maven debate.

19260231
integer	unsigned
finally when you convert that to an unsigned 64-bit integer the usual modular arithmetic rules entail that the resulting value is 0xffffffff80000000

19260231
integer	unsigned
similarly converting to an unsigned 32-bit integer gives the value 0x80000000

19260245
integer	unsigned
converts this signed negative value to the type of addr which is unsigned long through integer conversions

19260270
for-loop	loops
and if you are wondering what type of loops to use the for-loop is rarely useful

19260279
realloc	malloc
try realloc instead - but first allocate current with malloc

19260285
google-chrome	safari
safari then behaved like google-chrome

19260313
put	get
for the get function since it only returns and does not change the value you should put the keyword const behind it

19260322
pop-up	dialog
the authentication dialog pop-up but as soon as i have entered admin s3cret the dialog comes back blank again not letting me in

19260336
centos	linux
as far as i can tell npm doesn t like the following format on centos and possibly other flavors of linux

19260349
width	height
each cell takes up the whole width and height of the uicollectionview

19260359
superclass	subclassing
i think you wonna override the superclass method and to do this the method on subclassing must have the same signature of superclass method

19260389
g++	gcc
now you can link with this archive using the -ltest option ltest is shorthand for libtest you created with gcc or g++

19260395

i am trying to scan a user input ascii chars as an int and show the ascii code for the entered chars

19260534
int	chars
i am trying to scan a user input ascii chars as an int and show the ascii code for the entered chars

19260534
int	chars
you should read a chars and display it as an int

19260535
int	chars
i also suggest you make all int int even if they will only take a small value such as month unless there is a technical reason you need them to be chars

19260547

google-chrome	firefox
when i helped redesign my company s website my supervisor and i found that our stylesheet rendered properly in google-chrome but not in firefox

19260551
folder	directory
using a simple php command and assuming that your gecko stylesheet will be stored in a folder called css in your site s main template directory here s how you can detect if the browser being used is firefox which will then force the gecko stylesheet to launch before the page is even loaded

19260554
apache	nginx
probably the best way to solve this is to run a hhvm server for each domain mean each domain you need a different root folder and use apache or nginx as proxy

19260610
post	get
well the problem is when my program execute a post aparently the post don t execute correctly because compared with a complement of firefox called poster the content of the packets and number of they are distinct and ocasionally the server responds correctly my program can t read the reply and resend the post petition even 3 times and only get the error clossed connection

19260621
jar	war
-webservice war this has 2 lines of code and only call the principal jar

19260657
getter	setter
i believe the reason for the explicit getter and setter is not only to follow the convention of entity framework pocos but also i believe when you explicitly use getter and setter you are telling the clr the class member is a property vs a public variable

19260682
queue	fifo
this queue orders elements fifo fifo

just wondering if there is an easy way to check if a post variable is not empty and compare with x could put that in a function or use and but i more looking for a elegant way

19260737
rational-numbers	fractions
you are trying to convert a rational-numbers all floats are rational-numbers to another rational-numbers all fractions are rational-numbers

19260744
floor	sqrt
for trial division you need to check all of the primes less than or equal to floor sqrt n either by doing a lot of unneccessary checks against composites or by building up a list of primes as you go akin to the sieve of eratosthenes and often called that by cs types but i don t think it s strictly equivalent

19260771
solaris	bsd
it s a similar story for other linkers the bsd linker as used by mac osx uses an order file specified with -order_file the solaris linker uses a map file specified with -m and so on

19260806
qsort	bsearch
for qsort and bsearch which can be implemented portably this would just be a nuisance and hideously ugly

the numbers for height and width are total bs for this

19260866
post	get
i do not get any syntax errors in the code below but when i compile the code i get the msgbox cant post status instead of the output from main.p x .status 0

19260866
post	get
the x and 0 can be any number and i always get the cant post status box

19260940
for-loop	loops
while working with blocks it can be hard to understand what is happening the problem is that you are creating the file inside a block and that block is in a for-loop so lets say that when you make your first request i 0 then your request can take a while to give you the response which means your loops will continues will not wait for your first request so when i 1 maybe your first request is not done yet so your first file was not created yet

19260958
button	checkbox
as of right now the checkbox button works with no issues but when i go to click the save button an error message appears in the cs file at this line

im trying to execute a .air file on a linux box ubuntu from the command line and disregard the gui

19261155
for-loop	arrays
i see that there s already any accepted answer but i think that this is a case where using a for-loop with proper index variables will be more convenient than the for-loop that works on arrays and collections

19261164
udp	tcp	sctp	tcp	sctp	udp
i should also point out that i need an ipv4 6 compatible solution preferably for that works with sctp sockets though i m fine with udp or tcp solutions for now

19261190
int	chars
you will recall from your introduction to java that an int is equal to a chars which makes the use of the -1 convenient

19261190
int	chars
maybe i m just having a blonde moment of sorts but i m not understanding in what context an int could be equal to a chars when making comparisons

19261203
rss	feed
so then i got some sort of object array of json for that rss feed

19261215
notepad	scite
i have not tested this code because i am on a computer currently that does not have scite or python however i ve created this code on a notepad

19261219
int	chars
languages usually have a special chars type to distinguish between just a number and a number that refers to a chars but inside it s still just some sort of int

19261237
int	chars
in java chars is a more specific type of int

19261237
int	chars
i need the cast there so java knows i want the chars representation and not the int one

19261237
int	chars
you can look up the int to chars mapping in an ascii table

19261286
openssl	crypto++
i ask because i want to compile and use an encryption library like openssl or crypto++ an arduino due with a 32 bit arm processor

19261295
int	chars
what your professor is referring to the fact that chars are just int used in a special context

19261295
int	chars
a string of chars is really just a sequence of int for example tuv would be 84 followed by 85 followed by 86

19261295
int	chars
the chars type is an int internally in the jvm and is more or less a hint that this int should only be used in a chars context

19261295
int	chars
because of this read returns an int instead of chars so as to allow a -1 which is not a valid chars code

19261296
int	chars
a chars in java on the other hand represents a unicode chars and is treated as an int in the range 0 to 65535

19261300
getter	setter
in the getter setter you would do something like

19261301
int	chars
since chars cannot be negative a number between 0 and 65 535 and an int can be negative the possible values returned from the method is -1 to signify nothing left to 65 535 max value of a chars

19261338
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
they are able to connect through sockets and use objectinputstream and objectoutputstream to send the object packet back and forth

19261377

versioning	upgrade
for some of them gem install rdoc to upgrade to the latest versioning of the rdoc package itself has helped

19261509
pull	push
here s one way you can do it using async push pull sockets

19261509
pull	push
on the broker side just create the push pull sockets to communicate with the java services layer i m not a c++ programmer so forgive me

19261509
pull	push
using push pull works for this approach but the ideal approach is to use router on the server and dealer on the client for full asynchronous communication example here

19261515
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
i have a mentor that told me that instead of editing the height or width of the li tag that i should just edit the padding or margin of its content like lets say the a tag or p tag until i reached the desired size

19261525
folder	directory
i d also delete the build directory or whatever the shared folder is if you re not using a relative derived data path as one possible explanation of what you saw is that a cached version of your compiled code was not showing the error but then all of the sudden it was invalidated

19261548
superclass	subclassing
i have superclass a which is extended by subclassing b1 and b2

19261552
button	checkbox
clicking the button again should toggle the checkbox off again but it doesn t

19261552

for some reason to uncheck the button you need to click a different element than was required to check the checkbox

19261557
elasticsearch	kibana
i searched on the internet but could not find much information about installing and configuring logstash elasticsearch kibana on a windows server

19261565
int	double
because the int arithmetic will not work out perfectly a bit of fiddling around will be necessary but the end result can be made to be statistically correct modulo the characteristics of the prng being used and it will execute almost as fast as a simple unweighted selection of n options one shift and a couple of comparisons extra at the cost of a vector occupying less than 6n storage elements counting the possibility of having to almost double the number of slots

19261579

postgresql is amazingly functional compared to mysql and that s why i ve switched

19261792
int	chars
it varies from computer to computer how accurate numbers int is.you know in the real world int is infinate they just keep counting.char also has a size.in utf _16 let s just say it s 16 bits i will let you read up on that so if chars and int both take 16 bits as the professor says they are the same size and reading 1 chars is the same as 1int

19261792
int	chars
by the way to be politically correct chars is infinite as well.chinese chars french chars and the chars i just made up but can t post cause its not supported.so think of the code system for int and chars

filtering	grouping
when that flag is set the ldap query will search nested grouping by using a filtering with the ldap_matching_rule_in_chain rule which searches the user s grouping recursively

19261863
int	chars
if you do so though you ll need to change the values in your case statements to match - since you re no longer comparing chars you ll need to change them to int too change 0 to just 0

19262040
integer	unsigned
your minimum value is -40 which is signed integer and you are treating as unsigned integer as last parameter of setdlgitemint and getdlgitemint method is false

19262058
ng-switch	ng-include
you can change its content in several ways ng-include ng-switch or mapping different controllers and templates through the routeprovider

it also depends on the browser it appears ok in google-chrome but in firefox you can see this clearly

19262088
width	height
inside each callback this refers to the dom element which does not have the width or height methods you need to call those methods in the jquery wrapper for the element

19262118
post	put
im trying to integrate a twitter post into my powerpoint keynote presentation and i cant i want to find a better way than just a screenshot which would mean having to photoshop off the edges and put a drop shadow to look good last part not so important

hash	md5
but if you hash the output of sha512 with md5 it would shorten the hash from 128 hex characters to only 32

19262229
jar	manifest.mf
option 1 you need to ship java commons library along with your jar and mention classpath relative to your jar in your jar s meta-inf manifest.mf

19262276
ubuntu	centos
frankly speaking this example works well on my pc ubuntu 12.10 but my project will finally transfer to a centos server

int	chars
you can convert a chars to an int by subtracting 0 from it

19262287
aggregate-functions	sum	min	max

hide	show
you can also target the object you d like to hide and show

19262350
hide	show
here when you click on anything that has a class of collapsible the next div will hide and show

19262383
hide	show
an option is to detect the window width on page load and then add the use bootstrap s .collapse method to show hide the .accordion-body

19262419
rss	feed
i am trying to fetch the rss feed document from rss.news.yahoo.com rss topstories using ajax extract the values associated with the titles tags and echo them to the screen

19262574
shadowing	named
the problem is the babysitter is shadowing the class instance field of the same named meaning that anything your assign to this variable will have no meaning out side of the constructor leaving the instance field as null

19262603

multiplying	add
if you really have to use math.random you need to multiplying and add

19262854
subtract	add
i m kind of assuming that with even numbers you actually meant whole numbers though in which case you can ignore that. then if you don t want the range to be 0- x but y- x you just add y to your outcome make sure to subtract y from x before the multiplication or your range will be y- x+y

19262855
width	height
as you can see the height and width of the file_loader class enforce the dimensions of the placeholder image and of the transparent input file element overlay

19262855
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i ll point out that in google-chrome firefox safari this font-size trick is unnecessary as the whole file element is clickable there

19262935
int	chars
since these chars correspond the ascii alphabetic chars int values are one byte in utf-8 and any individual byte of a multibyte chars will never match the int value of one of these chars it looks like checking the int value of the byte is the fastest and safest

19263008
put	get
if you re really sure that the slowdown is the unique index checking i suggest you have your pre-processing code write out its result as binary data to a file which you load instead of the obj file -- you can just copy-paste your pre-processing code to a command-line utility put the resulting file in your project and then use nsdata to get its contents and set your vbo to the data

19263059
put	get
for example if they just put their finger over the microphone then the recording would suddenly get quieter

unsigned	short
regarding your unsigned short to signed int conversion that is covered by the regular value-quaified promotion

19263119
unsigned	short
in other words because the value of your unsigned short falls within the coverable domain of signed int there is nothing special done and the value is simply saved

19263124
svg.js	jvectormap
in fact utilizing the svg.js as a layer on top of jvectormap lets you do virtually anything that you could do with svg while substituting points with latitude-longitude coordinates

19263124
svg.js	jvectormap
you ll need to load jvectormap the jvectormap map file svg.js and svg.path.js plugin see in the page header

19263131
int	double
since td and att both are int though you assign the result of following line to a double variable you will not get correct value

19263180
unsigned	short
this is an unsigned short representation of the number 65535

19263180
unsigned	short
simple promotion from unsigned short to unsigned int so u16tou32 is a unsigned int representation of the number 65535

19263180
unsigned	short
promotion from unsigned short to unsigned int has value 65535

19263322
hash	salt
when you generate a password hash if you do not specify a salt the library will generate and use one for you

19263322
hash	salt
you should store this salt with your hash password and use it back in your hashing for validating the user

19263322
hash	salt
if you don t do this everytime you try to generate a hash a brand new salt will be generated and used which means a whole different password hash will be computed

19263332
button	checkbox
6 now you can set outlets of each checkbox button in the interface builder using this link

19263334
mamp	wamp
personally i think wamp mamp lamp are great applications that can be used for production servers

19263370
post	get
in you post array you will get check array in which you will get multiple check value like this

19263405
unsigned	short
it s implicitly converted to unsigned short and the value is preserved

19263405
unsigned	short
the value of a is 0xffff which is converted from unsigned short to unsigned int

19263405
integer	unsigned
conversion of an integer to an unsigned integer type unlike conversion to a signed type is defined by the language

19263405
subtraction	addition
compilers don t actually generate code to do this repeated addition or subtraction

19263417
width	height
there is no direct way to get page height or width using php

19263492
puts	gets
puts will print data until it gets 0

19263545
int	chars
if the chars at the first address of your int is 1 then it s the low-order byte and your numbers are little-endian

19263564
int	chars
we all know that type int occupies 4 bytes while chars is only 1 byte

19263564
int	chars
that line just converts the int to a char.it is equivalent to chars c chars the lowest byte of num

19263571
profiling	benchmarking
this function looks like a faster solution - according to the timeit benchmarking it is about 50 faster according to profiling benchmarking it is about 40 faster

19263592
int	chars
so now you do the comparison using the if statement to found out whether the int casted to a chars is equivalent to the order of bytes used on a little endian system

19263654
int	chars
num gives the address of the int but the cast to chars restricts the read the de-reference to 1 byte size of chars

19263689
fadein	hide
you can reverse the logic using prependto method now hide and fadein are applied to the appended element not the ul element

19263736

firefox	safari
safari didn t even start java and in firefox the nested file could not be opened the message was that it wasn t found but my guess was that the browser wasn t allowing java to open it

19263931
int	boolean
one thing you can do however is not use a boolean but a bitset instead this way you ll only use 1 bit per number and thus you can probably cover until the max value of int

19263942
min	max
min and max are passed in via the call to check at the the of the function test with this call check t int.minvalue int.maxvalue

19263942
min	max
min and max aren t passed through the initial match call they are in scope and thus accessible in the case statements

19263995
google-chrome	firefox
i downloaded bn lunch from the site you mentioned and processed it with font-face-generator.com and test .html page it generated does not show characters in that font and yes i tried common digits and hebrew letters too on google-chrome or on firefox only on ie tested on win 7

range	max
however the max limit of range is stored in a vector and i want to use that vector as range limit instead of a specified number

19273923
onkeyup	onkeydown
to negate this you could have a check for onkeydown onkeyup onkeypress to check whether a keyboard action occurs prior to the click event firing and stop the click events code firing if a key was pressed

19273924
sorting	filtering
you re looking not for sorting your array but for filtering it - feel the difference

google-chrome	safari
on desktop browsers google-chrome safari this is working fine

19274885
implements	extends
tell me the purpose of these two words extends and implements

19274885
implements	extends
when an interface extends another interface its simply adding more methods to the list of methods that a class implements it needs to provide implementation for

19274900
filtering	grouping
i did this by creating my own click function and having a variable for each grouping of filtering then joining them together and running

19274980
ati	nvidia
if you re using a discrete desktop gpu nvidia or ati amd opengl buffers are allocated on the graphics card s memory and editing by calling glmapbuffer or vairants a buffer usually requires either copying the data from the gpu back to the cpu s memory or keeping a shadow copy of your data in the cpu which is sent to the gpu after editing

19274980
unsigned	short
did i need to create one vector of unsigned int one vector of short â

19274980

bazaar	fossil
bazaar fossil and monotone support this type of operation natively

19275022

jstl	taglib
as the comments in the file indicate it basically registers the sling sling cq cq and jstl c fmt fn taglib namespaces for use in the jsp

19275070
jstl	taglib
to access the properties within your own java taglib or bean you would just pass the appropriate object to your code using the standard jstl tags

19275203
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
move the print after the for-loop and don t reinitialize to an empty arrays inside of loops

19275343
super	extends	super	implements	implements	extends
nsobject is not implements that function - if you are extends nsobject never call super

19275377
onresume	onpause
the solution is to have field that you change on every activity onresume with and in onpause with

19275377
onresume	onpause
you may say that there can be problem because of delay between onpause and onresume but your app need to be designed in the way to start activity fast and not do long taking work on ui thread need to be done on background thread

19275405
implements	extends
as others most succinctly stefan beike have said no you can t use extends when you mean implements

19275405
implements	extends
what you can do if desired is to add an in-between abstract class which implements your interface and then extends that class

19275405
implements	extends
but it can be a purely abstract class if all you want is to use extends where implements would otherwise be called for

19275437
scheme	racket
i want to my vim setup to color my parentheses as is default in the racket ide for scheme

19275519
maven	m2e
i m trying to import an existing project on eclipse using maven plugin m2e

19275538
getter	setter
now setter is reused and extends doesn t mandate it to be overriden but as per requirement any method can be overriden also as getter in our case

19275538
implements	extends
so a class can extends other class for reusing functionality and a class can implements an interface to enforce some functionality that a class must provide by itself

19275538
super	extends	super	implements	implements	extends
now why interface extends interface i am also not sure may be its because sub interface will extends the methods of super interface and it will enforce implementation of methods in super interface on class that is implements the sub interface

19275538
super	implements
as super interface does not enforce implementation on sub interface so implements can not be used

19275572
maven	pom.xml
file - import - existing maven project - browse to your directory the one with the pom.xml and select your project in the projects window

19275573

the issue was that you always need to wrap any filtering sorting attributes in a data table with an h form tag

19275877
shadowing	named
note usage of this helps you to avoid shadowing problems as well when the named of the input params and class attributes are same

19275915
super	implements
or you could make the super class generic and the implements class

19275931
put	get	post	get	post	put
to do that i created a subclass of nsoperation for each http method get post put delete 4 operations

19275931
put	get	post	get	post	put
for a given entity these operations have to be run in a specific order so i created a 5th operation subclass which contains the synchronization sequence basically an operation that creates multiple get post put delete operations in the appropriate order and adds these operations to a queue created by the operation.

19275932

19275976
getter	setter
see ref here at defining getter and setter and run the following example in your browser s console responses from js start with

19276008

use .text to get the word and simply put it behind the url rather than using if statements so it will be faster

19276051
cvs	svn
i second the other recommendations to use some sort of source control system like cvs svn git etc to check files in out for working on different workspaces pcs

since the figure goes from 0 to 1 on both axes with the origin at the bottom left you re making a rectangle of width and height 1 starting from the very top-right of the figure

19276202
min	max
count the number of items in the array and randomly pick one using the min and max settings of rand

19276229
ivar	subclassing
but that s not possible because the subclassing can t access the _infoimageview ivar

19276249
post	get
then for the sort order mentioned above you can get the number of post that sort before the post in question with the following query

19276261
pop-up	dialog
now i am no longer getting the error when i click on link to display the modal dialog it displays the pop-up for a sec then redirects to home page

19276264
implements	extends
note that java.util.queue isn t displayed by this because java.util.deque extends it - so if you want all the interfaces implements you d need to recurse

19276308
post	get
the method can be get or post which is the way in which the data is sent

19276314
post	get
i have following jquery i m trying to post some data using getsubscribeformdata to razor chtml function but when i do request email from razor function i get null

19276496
min	max
the solution is to use min and max for the field of the child collection to be ordered by

19276549
children	parent
the problem with my current query is that it only grabs the children categories and does not work for parent categories

19276587
hide	show
when it fires hide the progress and show the content

19276587
hide	show
or you can show full progress for a split of a second and then hide it

19276632
width	height
you can make the image auto resize to the max width of the boundary by using max-width 100 and height auto

19276656
free	malloc
don t mix malloc and new first because of stylistic reasons and then because you should never delete a â malloc -ed memory or free a new -ed zone

19276691
sqldatasource	objectdatasource
you only use the datasourceid if you re using a sqldatasource or objectdatasource control for your binding

the user should control whether they want to use the mouse or keyboard

19276797
mouse	keyboard
advanced users will use the keyboard and beginners will use the mouse

19276809
children	parent
all the documentation that i have read seems like you still need to define the parent data manually and the ajax calls are only for lazy-loading children nodes

19276819
versioning	upgrade
you need to upgrade the versioning of itext to versioning 2.1.7 minimum

19276843

19276935
post	get
i hate to drag up and older post but i am at a loss as to how to get this to work

19276969
int	boolean
you have to use return for any methods of the type int string and boolean

19276970
multiplying	add
i suppose you could multiplying a by 100 and add in b and unroll the table into a long row

19277046
range	max
use range instead of max to calculate y

19277076
stdout	stderr
anyway this function is used on openvms to allow stdout and stderr redirection on vms

19277080
pow	math.h
just be sure to use pow in the math.h module

g++ gcc 4.1.2 20080704 red hat 4.1.2-46

19277125
inherited	properties
it is hard to tell from the lack of context but this appears to be a duplicate of syntax for resolving incompatible properties type on inherited delegate

children	parent
now what i want is to flatten the parent and children into a single array

19277189

19277277
free	malloc
now for your use of malloc and free

19277277
free	malloc
never use malloc and free

19277277
free	malloc
in the example you ve posted here i see no reason that compels the use of malloc and free

19277277
free	malloc
belief mixing new delete and malloc free in a single c++ program does no in itself invoke undefined behavior or make your program otherwise ill-formed

19277329
width	height
add constraints to pin the contentview to all 4 corners of the scroll view and pin it s width and height so 6 constraints between the contentview and it s superview - 2 more than usual

19277329
width	height
note that the width and the height can be pinned to something much larger than the normal screen size which is probably why you are using a scroll view to begin with

19277329
uilabel	uibutton
add all of your other views you want in the uiscrollview uibutton uilabel etc

19277329
uiview	subviews
- i m just going to assume uilabel from here on so i don t have to type as much but any kind of uiview subclass will work as subviews of the contentview not directly as subviews of the uiscrollview

19277329
width	height
add constraints to pin the contentview to all 4 corners of the scroll view and pin it s width and height

19277329

its just nice quicker to see your initializers in the same spot where the initializer string containing your min max is

19277946
aggregate-functions	sum
this question is because i m having some doubts after being warned about these heavy aggregate-functions like nested where constraints and sum etc. not being ideal in a document store variant

19277964

19278544
internationalization	translation
i use base internationalization to do i18n for my project this is the related translation in my storybaord.strings

19278547
fgets	fgetc
moreover although fputs and fgets operate as if by performing sequences of fputc and fgetc calls respectively it is not specified what conversions they might perform between char values in memory and the underlying unsigned char values on the stream

19278547
integer	unsigned
that arises directly from the integer conversion rules which specify that integer values are converted to unsigned types by adding or subtracting the integer multiple of target type _max + 1 needed to bring the result into the range of the target type supported by the constraints on representation of integer types

19278548
gruntjs	grunt-contrib-watch
in the end i settled on serving up js files and building them when they changed using gruntjs grunt-contrib-watch and grunt-contrib-coffee

getattr	setattr
on model instance initialization if an inheritable field is empty and corresponding parent s field is not do setattr self field_name getattr self.parent field_name

19278650

it solves my problem because dragdrop.dodragdrop is only called when the move is considered a drag not when it s simply a selection of the item check uncheck the checkbox

19278652
int	chars
operator does not exist int chars varying

19278715
stdout	stderr	stdout	fflush	stderr	fflush
alternatives to using stderr include calling fflush stdout or modifying the stream

please remove the leading slash from your rule assuming it s in .htaccess instead of httpd.conf

19279617
fflush	gets
and the thread gets stuck from 5 to 10 minutes on the fflush method

19279632
getter	setter
in order to access the instance variable we need to define the setter and getter for that instance variable

int	boolean
function reportsectionexists byval intindex as int byval intsection as int as boolean

19279723
ubuntu	centos
additionally the requirements page holds some links to more specific information for builds on ubuntu centos windows and os x

19279757
width	height
note the constructor for elementposition takes 0 or 4 parameters x y width height

19279765
width	height
because you are not taking into account the height and width of the tooltip itself

19279765
width	height
calculate its height and width and minus this off of the top and left values

19279786
dom4j	xom	jdom	dom4j	jdom	xom
there are libraries that build on the xml apis jdom dom4j or xom which are easier to use than the raw apis

put	get
i open the designer and put up some controls on the forms or widgets but i get problems on how to include the form i made in my python codes

19279906
google-chrome	firefox
i also wrote up some basic code that i ve used in the past for a firefox plugin but the problem is actually implementing it into my google-chrome plugin and executing it

19279957
put	get
either you put your private key onto that cron server to get access to bitbucket might be a bad idea or you create a new key pair and use that to allow access for your repo is better unless you experience some limitations of your bitbucket account like too many users if that key counts as a user - on the other hand you could limit this key to be only allowed to read not write

19279964
build.gradle	gradlew
when i try to run . gradlew build.gradle from terminal i have been getting following error

19279990

19280046
folder	dir
i have following dir structure following is my include folder specified in php.ini

19280050
getter	setter
most important thing is that though the instance object contains the instance variable the instance object cannot access it why because by default the instance data is private so in order to access it we need to define the getter and setter for those instance variable

19280061
return-value-optimization	nrvo
the cost of copying a vector of shared_ptr with 2 elements is going to be low enough that you won t care and with nrvo and return-value-optimization it could be completely optimized out even in c++03

19280061
return-value-optimization	nrvo
in c++11 if nrvo and return-value-optimization are blocked for whatever reason it will only do moves

19280090
post	get
you can get comments of a post by using wp_comment_query

19280095
implements	extends
when you create a thread either you need to extends thread and start it as new mythread1 thread4 or implements runnable and do new thread new myrunnable1 thread4

19280095
implements	extends
implements of runnable is the recommended pattern since it allows you to extends other classes

19280125
portrait	landscape
that is including ipad in landscape mode and most desktops but excluding ipad in portrait mode

19280156
for-loop	loops
the other answers have already covered the equivalence between a while loops and a for-loop

19280157
viewdidload	viewdidappear
whereas viewdidappear occurs later in the runtime than viewdidload so at that point your datasource is valid and you re able to reference that index in the nsarray

19280166
superclass	subclassing
i ve found quite a few questions about superclass calling but all work from subclassing of other classes not object itself

19280215
postgresql	mysql
one of the notable changes i ve made was that i m postgresql instead of mysql and that i m running everything in virtualenv

19280234
post	get
by the way if text comes from a post or get input don t forget to sanitize the input

19280266
inherited	properties
for rendering a full webview then you ll need to add a custom binding - or inherited and provide a custom properties - in order to call loaddata when the vm changes

19280271
postgresql	mysql
how you do that will vary depending on the db engine ms access sql server oracle mysql postgresql etc. where the table physically resides

19280281
vim	emacs
right now i am trying to use the evil plugin in emacs so that i can have the editing capability of vim with the extensibility of emacs

19280377
dictionary	map
and again most rest frameworks allow you to map json to an object or a simple dictionary

19280379
fadein	fadeout
the fadeout function supports a callback function that is to say when fade out is complete the callback function will be executed so you don t need to use settimeout to wait before calling fadein

19280395
google-chrome	firefox
i have it working the way it should in google-chrome firefox and ie

19280402
int	chars
i need some tip on how i cant read these numbers to keep them in int format not chars

the docs explain that resident memory is the amount of physical disk ram that mongo uses

19280495
int	double	int	chars
value types include struct s and all primitives - int double chars etc

19280511
int	double
int is a value type double is an array which is a reference type

19280515
imperative	declarative
because of the declarative vs imperative nature of angular abstraction of the library is going to be tricky in the view templates

19280529
for-loop	loops
if you don t know what an iterable is it s something you can loops over in a for-loop like a list. so it looks at your first argumentâ a random integerâ and tries to use it as an iterable

19280551
ip-camera	rtsp
i need to catch rtsp stream from my ip-camera for convert and streaming to site

19280567
width	height
according to doc imshow it s either a color map or a range of width height but neither of these make sense to me since the vector is empty

19280597
appdata	denied
access to the path c users.. appdata local temp mpwgheuv.lqw roles messageboard_webrole approot default.aspx is denied

19280597

i opened the temp folder and noticed during packaging the above directory gets created and then removed instantly

19280602
bionic	glibc
1 it uses the bionic c library and dynamic linker instead of a more traditional set such as glibc

19280602
x86	mips	x86	64bit
2 android is typically run on an arm or 32-bit x86 processor or in rare cases mips while your desktop linux library might be either 64bit or 32-bit x86 code

19280602
debian	linux
alternatively if you have something for a compatible architecture but the wrong libc it may be possible to write your own loader to get it into memory in working form on a secured device or on a rooted device it is possible to run a more traditional linux userspace typically debian derived in a chroot

19280603
put	get
when i put mapview in dealloc the problem get solved

19280617
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in ie firefox - but not google-chrome

19280681
folder	directory
that modelresource name is the directory folder for the models in xcode

19280681
folder	directory
the storefilename is the name of your .sqlite file in the documents folder directory this is not in the bundle

19280691
int	double
i needed int s but it would be a quick change to accept decimal or double

19280699
maven	pom.xml
if create new quickstart maven project then pom.xml file causes an error

19280702
width	height
what happens is that when you don t explicitly define the size of the canvas using its width and height attributes the canvas defaults to size 300 x 150

19280702
width	height
you need to set the width and height on the canvas element itself

19280741
mouseleave	mouseenter
i do this by applying a class to the div on mouseenter and remove it on mouseleave

19280760
range	minimum
with the empty bracket imshow will display the range between the minimum and maximum value

19280903
qthread	qtcpsocket
i create the qtcpsocket in the run method of the qthread

19280930
filesystems	hfs
i wrote this script and ran it on osx 10.8 mountain lion on the default case-insensitive hfs filesystems

19280952
hide	fadeout
you can switch fadeout with hide

19281056
mouseleave	mouseenter
a. a mouseenter occurs after which the popup fades out on a following mouseleave and is deleted or

19281065
atoi	strtok	fgets	strtok	fgets	atoi
here is a simple example using fgets strtok and atoi

19281093
put	get
a real test to get a timeout exception would be to put in your php script a sleep or wait whatever the function is called in php for a time that is longer than the timeout threshold you have defined in your store proxy

19281119
mouseleave	mouseenter
i have two methods mouseenter and mouseleave which i would like to use to uniformly show a string associated with any random user control i set it up for

19281131
maven	pom.xml
in this case you can rearrange the project so that maven likes it or you can tell maven where to find your web.xml in the pom.xml

19281144
fast-forward	merge
it says except in a fast-forward merge see above the branches to be merge must be tied together by a merge commit that has both of them as its parents

19281174
submit	submission
what you can do is put your function code inside submit block and put return true after setting up the hidden field so your hidden field will be set before submission

19281226
strcpy	strtok
instead of directly assigning strtok return to your bidimensional array copy the contents with strcpy

19281253
strcpy	strncpy
and then you should write the lines you read in that memory with either strcpy or strncpy

19281263
hash	md5
right after that md5 hash of the file is computed again using the same function as above

19281278
puts	gets
i m trying to make a class which takes the maximum number that a user puts in and adds the integer before it until it gets to 0 however when i run it the numbers get larger and larger until it crashes

19281286
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i m adding it to a uiviewcontroller that is part of a uinavigationcontroller

19281298
hide	show
you should be more descriptive in your original question but from what i ve picked up from your comments you want to hide and show them based off the preview

19281385
superclass	subclassing
in this scenario java does not know which type of subclassing you would like to return if you call a static method on a superclass

19281438
prepare	execute
to insert a lot of date into a mysql database i would start a transaction and then create a prepare statement and just loop through all the items and validate them straight away and execute the prepare statement

19281509
cos	sin
for example you can type in sin x x or even a comma separated list such as sin x x cos x x to plot multiple functions on the same graph

19281550
getter	setter
so your user model would only consist of the properties + getter setter and methods that use these properties in some way business logic

19281591
sorting	filtering
imo paging like sorting filtering represent the internal state of a view widget and shouldn t be presented via routes

19281604
put	get
also i cannot get page to work in chrome version 30.0.1599.69 m it ignores anything i put for the margins large or small

19281615
width	height
this causes your element to grow by 2px in both width and height

19281667
hide	show
if you re looking for an alternative consider using show and hide with your fragmenttransaction so that your fragments stay attached but are instead just hidden

19281672
google-chrome	firefox
this works in google-chrome but in firefox i get event is not defined

19281680
express	node.js
i m building a basic blog in node.js express using mongodb w mongoose orm

19281695
updatepanel	scriptmanager
the aspx page is in this order body tag form tag scriptmanager tag an updatepanel named upmain then the main panel named pancontent

19281696
requestfactory	gwt
currently in my application we are using gwt requestfactory

19281696
requestfactory	gwt
note i am beginner in gwt requestfactory

19281703
post	get
i have option for selecting the page to use setup and it uses the pages slug as the rewrite slug for the custom post type i just can t figure out how to get it to display the archive instead of the page content

19281762
google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari
i have a series of notifications set up like this and everything works great in google-chrome opera and safari

19281798
switching	screens
this leads to a notification upon connecting arduinp to the android device from where you can turn off the external hardware and switching back on screens keyboard

19281800
loops	while-loop
i am sure that it skips the while-loop as i have tested by trying to print out a sentence inside the while loops which is not executed neither is the rest of loops

19281822
onclick	onchange
also the in-line event-handler attempting to use onchange and subsequently using onclick in my update is poor-practice since it leads to obtrusive javascript which is difficult to maintain so we re moving the event-handler into the javascript itself after giving the relevant element an id by which to easily target it

19281881
post	get
it s only when i use post that i get the error

19281881
post	get
debugging the methods throws the break point in the get but not in the post so i don t think it s ever being called

19281893
google-chrome	firefox
my goal is to have this work for ie google-chrome and firefox

19281900
vb.net	vb6
i asssume tmpvar is variant in vb6 and object in vb.net

19281901
getter	setter
how about this it defines a function that takes a string and returns a getter setter function

19281901
getter	setter
if you wanted to have a getter or setter with custom logic in it before either event then it would be easiest to just define them separately

19281903
min	max
the key to solving issue was looking at the scrollspy source and figuring out that the min max settings can be functions not just static values

19281903
min	max
so i set the min max settings to functions that return a value based on the current size of the growing content

19281903
min	max
this way when the user scrolled the content would grow and the scrollspy min max settings would adjust appropriately

19281915
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
moreover inherited breaks encapsulation and makes your subclassing dependent upon the implementation details in the superclass which can make your code fragile or more difficult to maintain

19281915
superclass	subclassing
remember that changes to the superclass can create side-effects in their subclassing that are dependent upon the implementation details in the superclass

19281932
width	height
and i want that background image to have a 100 width and the rest of the image for the height for whatever maintains aspect ratio for height

19281942
int	double
assuming credtotal is a double and knowing credits is int the above would yield with respective values assigned

19281978
min	max
i have two edits boxes on a form one for a min value and the other for a max value that the user needs to enter

19281978
min	max
one possible error is that the max value is less than the min value

19281978
min	max
however even if the user wants to enter a 5 in the min box and a 100 in the max box it brings up the error message even as the user is entering the 1 of the 100 in the max box if he has already entered a 5 in the min box

19281978
min	max
here is my code i catch other errors too but only max min error seems to be affected

19281988
preorder	postorder
the preorder and postorder traversals are sufficient to reconstruct the tree assuming the nodes are uniquely named

19281988
preorder	postorder
x is an ancestor of y iff x precedes y in the preorder and is after y in the postorder

19281988
preorder	postorder
the descendants of x always immediately follow x in the preorder and precede x in the postorder

19281988
preorder	postorder
so once we know we re interested in producing the subtree rooted at x we can extract the preorder and postorder traversal for the subtree rooted at x

19281989
implements	extends
ok in your screens gamescreen and another delete extends game only leave implements screen

19282007
post	put
based on the wordpress template hierarchy assuming you re using a custom post of type foo you want to put your archive code in archive-foo.php

19282016
children	parent
if i click on a parent row i call for it s children via ajax

19282016
children	parent
when i get the children i want to show a table for for every children under the parent row

19282016
children	parent
if i first click parent row #1 it will show the correct children but when i click parent row #2 both child lists will contain the same items

19282016
children	parent
when you click expand on parent row #2 both children lists contain the same items

i referred to the tutorial below and later realized it is wrong way of declaring struct using typedef

19286744

i ve come across similar issues here regarding the combined use of background-image and background-color with transparency but i guess my scenario is a bit different with form fields in play

19286761
typedef	struct
the former declares a tag-less struct type and a typedef name personaldata for that struct type

19286761
typedef	struct
the latter declares a struct type struct personaldatastruct and a synonymous typedef name personaldata for that struct type

19286761

19286917
typedef	struct
since struct tags and typedef names are in different namespaces not to be confused with c++ namespaces there s no need for them to be distinct

post	put
there seems to always be some confusion as to when to use the http post versus the http put method for rest services

19286984
post	put
in some cases one can use the put for a create while in other cases a post will be required

19286984
post	put
the ambiguity lies in the definition of an http put method versus an http post method

19286984
put	get	post	get	post	put
according to the http 1.1 specifications the get head delete and put methods must be idempotent and the post method is not idempotent

19286984
post	put
based on the above idempotent definition my take on using the http put method versus using the http post method for rest services is

19286984
post	put
the use of an http put method versus an http post method should be based on the idempotent aspect of that operation

19286991

google-chrome	safari
after much googling and stackoverflow searching i can attribute this to being an issue with the way image dimensions are calculated within google-chrome and safari

19287297
google-chrome	safari
the issue is that in google-chrome and safari the images are not yet visible as they appear within a scroller and the overall width of the scroller cannot be worked out in these browsers and generates a series of white space

19287297
google-chrome	safari
i ve tried preloading the images externally before this script runs however google-chrome and safari will only run them occasionally and the preloaded images never seem to make it

19287726
children	parent
the children should not expand to fill the parent

19287726

hash	salt
you should safe a hash-value salt of the password hash the user input too and compare the hash

19288106
getter	setter
if character is written the way it is because you want x and swipe to be truly private although as both have both setter and getter i m not seeing much reason for that you might want to use the pattern that s going to be the basis of es6 s private properties which unlike the pattern you re currently using is friendly to shared prototype objects

children	parent
as long as you destruct the parent all of the children will get deleted

19302684
qobject	qwidget
technically you could make just a qobject be a parent of a qwidget but it breaks down the assumptions that widgets have about their parents so don t do that

qobject	qwidget
a qwidget can of course own qobject s

19302684

next	document.write
i realize this is an old post but for future readers consider using innerhtml in lieu of document.write and also i recommend changing to that way as you add more images you don t have to worry about changing the number next to

19303052
width	height
the dimensions of the images are different from what is declared in the js height and width

19303052
width	height
i notice that if i use height 826 width 1600 which scales the images proportionally the images are setup similar to what your image shows

when oozie runs your script it can run it from either node1 or node2 remember -- you put your script job.properties workflow.xml into hdfs which is distributed across node1 and node2

19303140
hdfs	oozie
the important point is that any script you run via oozie must only reference paths and files in hdfs

so please use animate or slidedown or slideup method

19303242
pop-up	dialog
you may be able to find pop-up blockers or customize the one you have that will block new dialog regardless of the cause - but this will mean that on some sites that innocently make use of them you will need to manually allow their pop-up

19303250
stdout	stderr
print the results to the terminal either to stdout or to stderr using fprintf 1 ... or fprintf 2 ...

19303265

19303279
stdout	stderr
this is directing stderr to stdout and then directing stdout to nul

19303279
stdout	stderr
stderr is getting the address of stdout before we set stdout to null

19303283
google-chrome	firefox
on a side note i think you have a nice animation i don t think you should worry about ie as most people are using google-chrome or firefox

comparator	comparable
the node class linearnode and the element class golfer both implement comparable and override the comparator method

19303331
opengl-es	glkview
the overall gist of it glkview does all of the framebuffer renderbuffer and viewport setup and presentation for basic opengl-es drawing including all the extra framebuffer juggling for multisampling if you want that so that all you have to do is issue drawing commands

19303331
opengl-es	glkview
if you re using glkviewcontroller and only making opengl-es calls from the glkview subclass or delegate drawing method you shouldn t have to worry about crashing due to gpu use in the background

it doesn t seem to matter what datatype or contenttype i enter if any or if i run it as post or get

19303420
comparator	comparable
note that the java sorted collections don t require elements to implement comparable since you can provide a custom comparator for any of them but in the case of this assignment it s probably fine to require that .

they expose only setter methods not getter

19304481

calculate the md5 hash for each uploaded part of the file

19304527
hash	md5
md5 hash of that result.

19304533
getter	setter
javascript also allows hosted functions to be evaluated inside almost any expression getter setter type conversion higher order builtins and this may complicate things if we allow serialization inside of those functions

i copied the text to windows notepad++ i m in a vm and then back to sublimetext 2 in ubuntu and the illegal character went away -- it converted fine using js2coffee

19304815
free	malloc
i find it a bit insecure cause on the first example small malloc even after you free the allocated memory you ll still be able to use the pointer and use that memory without getting a seg fault as it will be inside your data section and this could lead to hard to detect bugs

19304815
ubuntu	linux
update with specs ubuntu 12.04 32-bits gcc version 4.6.3 linux kernel 3.2.0-54-generic-pae

19304831
spaces	delimiter
split using spaces as delimiter

19304874
min	max
maybe not the simplest approach but you can for example use a subquery to get the min and max date per domain_id and use regular joins to get the corresponding lines

19304889
alarmmanager	wakelock
reading your edit i presume you found out yourself if you want to make sure that your service is started when using alarmmanager you better take the detour of first sending to a receiver and acquiring a wakelock there

19304892
put	get
when i put the exact same code in our sbx environment i get a 204 but with the following headers

19304952
daemons	systemd
i want to create communication between two java daemons which are hosted on one operating systemd

19304969
post	get
the authentication would be on per request basis so the token would be passed on the request as get parameter not post as the rest api uses it

19304985
division	modulo
the modulo evaluates to the remainder of the division of the two integer operands

19305030
gnupg	pycrypto
i m trying to use a key generated via gnupg with rsa encryption this part is changeable gnupg and pycrypto aren t to encrypt a file but i m having trouble actually importing the key

19305040
cmdlet	start-job
the start-job cmdlet is creating a job but it doesn t wait for that job to complete it simply starts it on its merry way

19305048
stdout	stderr	bash	subshell
my understanding is that when i execute a script inside a bash shell using syntax like a subshell is started and the code runs in that shell with stdout and stderr output being printed on my shell stdin is taken from my shell

19305058
box-sizing	border-box
add box-sizing border-box

19305099
onclick	onsubmit
someone recommended a javascript onclick event but i would instead recommend using onsubmit

19305099
submit	submission
this will be on the form itself rather than the button and this encompasses the real event that you want to disable the button with submission as well as other events that could possibly trigger submit

19305138
vbscript	jscript
note that the constant names found in shellspecialfolderconstants are available in visual basic but not in vbscript or jscript

19305161
int	chars
with int you are getting the ascii representation of the chars as an int

19305252
many-to-many	one-to-many
i would eliminate all those many-to-many relationships and replace them with one-to-many relationships

19305271
daemons	launchd	system.in	system.out
then if one daemons process is launchd from another they can connect by system.in and system.out

19305326
post	get
everything works fine i m able to make get and post with no problem except when the browser has no language set in its configuration tools - internet options - language

19305345
width	height
i am using both flexible width and height

19305359
int	double
every operation with double and int or with two double creates double

19305359
int	double
6 however this will not work because first math.round is devided by 100 and it creates int so the result of this operation is rounded down and after then casted to double

19305364
int	chars
but i don t see why you are asking about pointers since you are just comparing integrals with integrals chars and int are both integral types

19305387
int	boolean
after all they really were focusing on the copying aspect not the boolean to int mapping

19305394
nsurlconnection	nsoperationqueue	nsurlconnection	nsoperation
so it seems to me that the view controller itself cannot hold any reference to the download operation which i m thinking would be a subclass of nsoperation that would handle nsurlconnection stuff nor could it be the owner of the nsoperationqueue to which the operations get added to

19305420
google-chrome	firefox
the alignment for the items in my top menu works in google-chrome firefox ie7 by using s but in ie10 the last element is slightly unaligned vertically

19305492
getter	setter
they have only getter and setter and they are not modified anywhere else so nothing touches the two words between the logs

19305495
floating-point	integer
strings floating-point types and integer types could largely be used interchangeably and trying to assign a floating-point value to an integer type would round it somehow i forget the exact details

19305495
floating-point	fractions	floating-point	integer	integer	fractions
it s important to note by the way that even vb.net regards a conversion from a floating-point value to an integer type as being successful if rounding the floating-point value to the nearest integer would yield a value which is representable in that type even if the floating-point value had a non-zero fractions part which got dropped during the conversion

19305547
post	get
http 1.0 302 s worked as you d logically expect post foo 302 d to bar implied that you d get post bar

19305627
implements	extends
i m trying to make a map of objects that both implements and extends

19305628
express	node.js
recently i put my interest in node.js and learned a great about it and quickly move to the express framework

19305694
children	parent
intuitively one would think that the overhead for a normal talloc allocation is quite high because a header must contain a pointer to a parent children tags etc

19305721
implements	extends
you should create your own class that extends the jpanel and implements myinterface as you too suggested then use

19305753
children	parent
the parent item 2 is properly checked since all children are checked the root node has a dash to indicate that something is checked lower down

19305766
post	get
i checked this in all browsers - the fields with empty missing name are missing in post get request from browser

19305800
ssl	https
http https seem to be syntactically identical and the port is correctly set to 443 the real difference seems to lay in the additional ssl tls layer maybe i need to add this somewhere

19305810
implements	extends
i never had to do this but as you suggested you may go ahead and create a new class or interface based on your need implements extends the interfaces classes you need and then use it in your map

19305817
int	double
i believe this happens because once converted to thing type erasure kicks in and its no longer a thing int or thing double but a thing _ and hence the following method overloading does not work

19305817
int	double
you could work around this with macros i believe although that would preclude calling funcs.f on anything the compiler didnt know for sure was an int or double

19305841
width	height
tested this as working on device assuming your entrydetailsheader style sets match_parent width and wrap_content height

19305844
superclass	subclassing
i wan t to make a method declaration in a superclass called dataitem so that all subclassing that implement that method must have a return type that is of that implementing class

19305875
sse	avx
a better solution along the same thought would be using sse avx for an even more efficient copy

19305875
memcpy	strcpy
note the difference between strcpy and memcpy see also here

19306007

they will end up in the directory from which you run the program nested in the folder that are shown in the original archive contents

19306030
button	checkbox
i would try setting the height of the checkbox icons to be equal to the button height then centering the checkbox background image vertically

19306037
min	max
this causes the number to go back on the scale from max value back to starting poing which is the min value

19306049
hide	show
check box all which is supposed to show all the rows hide all of them

19306054
min	max
in above query for the column zeroyear previously i did min _year but as you can see in the comment from andriy m instead of min right function is max

19306060
hash	md5
to generate a md5 hash for an nsobject or a subclass of nsobject you need to convert it into something that s easily hashable but still represents the state of the instance

19306060
hash	md5
then you can easily retrieve the md5 hash just by calling the md5hash method

19306066
int	double
casting the int to a double cannot magically make decimals appear out of nowhere

19306092
int	double
d and n are both int so d n is an int that you are casting to a double and then multiplying by 4.0

19306099
rtl	vhdl
annex j of ieee std 1076-2008 the lrm references ieee std 1076.6-2004 ieee standard for vhdl register-transfer level rtl synthesis wherein case statements are supported and a case statement alternative the actual choice and associated sequence of statements may specify sequential statements including case statements

strstr	substr
at present i am extracting the table using string functions strstr substr etc

19306181
folder	directory
folder inside your app are symlinks to folder in the shared directory

19306209
fadein	fadeout
i believe calling your fadein method from inside fadeout s callback should work just fine too

19306218
pull	push
unfortunately as per my comment above there is no pre-packaged equivalent to the push pull and streaming subscription services that ews supports

19306267
typedef	struct	calloc	malloc
regarding your desire to have room for two struct because you typedef d your struct you can simply do something like this but i am going to change the name you used from struct to name the whole point being that when a struct is created as an array you do not need to use calloc or malloc to create space for them it is done as shown below.

19306285
int	chars
otherwise the answer to your question is tinyinyt 1 which is fastest then both chars and int 1

19306292
strdup	malloc
or better yet remove the malloc at all strdup takes care of allocation itself

19306324
floor	sqrt
the other suggestion keep repeating until x stops changing does not work either because for non-perfect squares x will alternate between the floor and the ceiling of the root â because of integer mathematics the term n x will alternate when x is slightly smaller or slightly larger than sqrt n

19306324
ceil	sqrt	ceil	floor	floor	sqrt
it does not suffer from inefficiency n 2 or ambiguity floor sqrt n or ceil sqrt n

19306341
nsmutablestring	nsstring
the obvious case here is that there is the immutable mutable distinction -- a copy of an nsmutablestring returns an nsstring which you should treat as immutable

19306345
mp4	webm
safari only supports mp4 format if you only provide ogg or webm this could be one reason for the error

19306346
children	parent
edit you can use float left to give the parent div the height of the children

19306352
width	height
fyi - the portrait images have a max height of 664px with varying width

19306373
hash	hmac	hash	salt
pepper is a secret key added to the password + salt which makes the hash into an hmac hash based message authentication code

19306373
hash	salt
a hacker with access to the hash output and the salt can theoretically brute force guess an input which will generate the hash and therefore pass validation in the password textbox

19306393
skaction	skscene
right guys i have scroll view in my skscene running from a skaction with the following code -

19306407

19306608
mouseup	mousedown
a click event occurrs when both mousedown and mouseup events take place

19306648
children	parent
if you really don t want to delete a parent as long as it has any children check with appropriate code if the parent has children or not in order to decide if remove should be called

19306653
int	boolean
it keeps telling me that i m comparing a boolean to an int in my if statement

19306676
int	boolean
afterwards it will compare the first result boolean with the last element int thus giving an error

19306676
int	boolean
you can t compare a boolean to an int

19306682
google-chrome	safari
gecko google-chrome 30.0.1599.69 safari 537.36

19306690
post	get
what i m trying to get is a page that displays 20 users per page will have pagination with the fallowing info it should show only users that have more than 2 post published

19306690
post	get
what i was thinking was to use a custom query where i should combine a select the users table inner joined with usermeta table for the specified user role to get only the user ids for the needed role and all this query inner joined again with post table from which to get only publish post with the post_type cpt and count the returned rows

19306690
post	get
i don t know how close i m with the above but this is what i could build to count all the post of a specific role users in only one query to this i then would like to add the count for the post in the above categories i can hardcode the terms ids for the categories so there is no need to get other tables in this ecuation except wpdb- term_relationships

19306698
int	boolean
the expression evaluates to boolean thus you cannot compare it to another int

19306751
int	chars
i check for the third to last chars and if its comma or dot i assume it as an int separator

19306759

19306851
copying	overwrite	versioning	upgrade
that s a note poorly explained though not to overwrite the original file engine-xx.ear but to rename it as engine-xx-orig.ear and store it aside to have it if something goes bad with your upgrade before copying building the versioning from a fix pack to that same location

19306915
post	get
using a rest client extension for chrome the post goes through fine but when i attempt the same thing with httparty i get a 403 forbidden

19307031
hide	show
when the countdown is started i want to hide the set button and show the cancel button

19307057
int	chars
i think this is not the most secure way to do it if you really want to hide string into an image you will probably use a specific pattern to change a pixel every 10 pixels the idea is simple convert your image to an array of int loop through the array and every 10 pixels change the value to the ascii chars number

19307081
subtraction	addition
sometimes i would like to delete or yank 200 lines and i dont want to have to do the subtraction and addition to figure out how many lines down my text is

19307119
stdout	stderr
basically you need to handle stderr in the same way as stdout

19307119
stdout	stderr
you can make your script only print to stdout by redirecting stderr at least for that one command to stdout

19307119
stdout	stderr
if you want any error in your script to be sent to stdout you can globally redirect stderr to stdout by adding this at the top of your script

19307119
stdout	stderr
now running job.sh with various redirections shows its printing to stdout and stderr

19307119
stdout	stderr
running script.sh shows its only printing to stdout even though job.sh is printing to stderr

19307163
for-loop	arrays
i m using a for-loop to compare the username and password the user provides with the usernames and passwords that are in my arrays

19307170
imperative	declarative
it s unnecessarily imperative and rac offers many more declarative ways to express what you re trying to do instead of how to do it

19307199
strlen	strtok
your code doesn t include string.h for including the prototypes of both strlen and strtok

19307199
strlen	strtok
well without including string.h the compiler assumes the two functions you re using strlen and strtok look like this

19307218
int	double
simple types like int double and are ok

19307261
svnadmin	svnlook
this invalid relocation destination error might be avoided if the repository uuid was copied to the new repos using the svnlook uuid and svnadmin setuuid commands but when i upgraded my working copy to 1.8 i got this error when trying to relocate my working copy to the new repo

19307261

19307429
put	get
if i put an input n i would get the following

19307436
submit	submission
for validating forms or confirming form submission i recommend handling the form s submit event rather than the button s click event

19307436
submit	submission
then let the submit handler from above handle the form submission

19307494
vbscript	vba
i will leave the code the way it is so that it will work for both vba and vbscript

19307829
identifier	ambiguous
but usually notâ or if it is available unless the user has gone out of his way to explicitly set it to a useful timezone identifier it s going to be an ambiguous abbreviation like pst

pull	push
it causes extra maintenance and afaik there s no way to pull new changes to our repo through github s web app - someone would need to pull then push from the desktop

19307893
fast-forward	merge
which i figure is good this should be an easy fast-forward merge

19307915
submit	submission
if validation doesn t succeed you can just return false from submit to avoid submission the form

19307978

otherwise you need to clear the interval with clearinterval i but first set i using the return value of setinterval

19308738
setinterval	settimeout
you re going to want to go with settimeout instead of setinterval

19308785

width	height
presumably this requires factoring in the width of the window because as the window width decreases the text wraps more becomes longer and requires a larger height value

19308950
folder	directory
for reasons that are overly complicated placing the directory inside the webroot folder is not an option

19308973

now my understanding is that is an anonymous function which takes an int x and returns a boolean

19309248
for-loop	loops
i am trying to assign the output of a for-loop to a variable or dictionary but as of right now i can only get it to print the first iteration of loops and it s not even in the right format

next	except
for since the next bit set following the rule will be the middle bit except for

19309344
ceil	floor
then we can split the bitvector into two parts each independent of each other and so we can calculate the number of bits set using f floor n 2 + f ceil n 2 - 1 as illustrated below

19309350
put	get
i get the property in my spring mvc controller and then put it into the model

19309389
int	chars
but in your case no need to check for chars just restrict for int

19309393
getter	setter
the property doesn t have to have getter setter so it can be completely hidden from the rest of your application other than as a filter criteria

19309427
maya	blender	quad	blender	quad	maya
most models you find will come rendered in quad by default so you can either load it up in a 3d program like blender or maya and convert the mesh to triangles ctrl+t in blender or change your parser to handle quad

19309489
post	get
you could try using sprintf with instead of little less unsecure because will look in both post and get and various of others

19309503
fontfamily	font-size
when specifying shorthand property using font font-size must precede fontfamily and both are mandatory the ones in angle brackets and not in square brackets atleast

19309537

i m trying to get my rss feed to load in my dynamix text box in flash as2

19309568
squash	merge
but if you use git merge --squash topic you get instead a new commit let s label it s for squash

19309568
squash	merge
it s not a merge at all it s just taking all the changes from topic squash them into a single change and adding that as an entirely independent commit

19309568
squash	merge
the squash version does not write to .git merge .git merge_head and .git merge_mode

19309568
squash	merge
so basically you have your choice a real merge two or more parents on the final commit or a squash same tree-combining mechanisms but only one parent on the final commit

19309579
width	height
a way to make sure that the view will display the entire bitmap you re giving it is to set the layout params as the width height of the bitmap

instead of buying hosting though you could simply host on your localhost to do that look into using something such as wamp or mamp for mac

19309673
sorting	filtering
for sure it can render a grid backed by server-side pagination sorting filtering

19309689
opensuse	linux
my experiment env is opensuse linux 11.4 gcc 4.5.1

19309724
button	checkbox

so then i figured the input would probably be as a chars rather than an int

19309763
post	get
i make a form in symfony and in controller i get the post values but when i get values if variable not exist it shows undefined variable here is my controller

19309765

the field is numeric it has no alpha chars it has a min value of 1 and max value of 9999 a min length of 1 and a max length of 6

19309766
public	protected
modifiers like public private protected are part of keywords

19309770
google-chrome	firefox
it would be great if someone can help me figure out why this behavior is differs in google-chrome and firefox

19309773
public	protected
the default access modifier is when there is no access modifier given that is not one of public private or protected

19309793
width	height
height 30 and the divider image is of width 11

19309824
screens	tablet
possible solutions to target mobile devices include media queries using max-device-width to target smaller feature phone and smart phone screens sizes and or using categorizr.js detects mobile tablet desktop tv via browser user agent and adds the appropriate style to the html tag

19309838
post	get
i can t seem to get the express bodyparser function to work when sending a post request with an image attached with the content-type header set to multipart form-data

19309839
kerberos	ntlm
one alternative is to forget ntlm and use kerberos mod_auth_kerb but many people find that too complicated to setup

19309858
public	protected
if you don t mention any access modifier public protected or private then compiler consider it as a default access modifier

19309865
put	get
it is said that get put delete head are idempotent operations you can invoke them multiple times and get the same state on the server

19309870
int	chars
using int arithmetic where is the ith chars of the string n is the length of the string and indicates exponentiation

19309893
public	protected
p.s. since php 5.0 was released some time in 2004th class s variables should be defined using public private or protected instead of var

19309898
children	parent
so i need to query the database to retrieve an unmodified duplicate of the parent instance and its children

19309991

19310066
google-chrome	firefox
i found a solution of using canvas this works well in firefox but in google-chrome it generate security error

19310133
int	double
i know that int long and double are hopelessly inadequate for holding the 300+ base 10 digits of 2 1000 precisely so some strategy is needed

19310154
children	parent
multicomboselection extends uinamingcontainer and as such has parent children properties - has references to component tree

19310223
range	minimum
obviously the design only works within a certain range and would require some design decisions with media queries to change the layout once those minimum and maximum width constraints are met

19310303
g++	gcc
if you are using gcc g++ but i guess other compilers have similar option you can use the option -e to see how the .c .cpp file result after the pre-compilation phase also #include

19310347
nunit	moq
using nunit and moq i keep getting a null result

19310369
calloc	malloc
also in c you don t cast what is returned from calloc malloc only if you are compiling with a c++ compiler but then you should use new instead

19310377
put	get
to access get vars you put something like this in your controller

19310386
int	double
note that i also changed val to be a double as int can only hold int

hence the second two values of the tuple are the same as the first and second but with the width or height of the mask img2 added on

i ve seen this post mysql get row position in order by but it doesn t have a sum in it and i can t get it to work with sum

19318997

19329685
folder	directory
if you use . test.txt btw the just says i m doing a string literal it removes the need for the escape character so you could also do . test.txt and it would write to the same place it will write the file to the current working directory which in most cases is the folder containing your program

19330183
nsindexpath	reloaddata
also if your code calls reloaddata for any reason even keeping the nsindexpath may not make any sense -- if your underlying model has changed at all the model record associated with the user s click may now be at a completely different nsindexpath or may not exist in the data set at all

19330230
versioning	upgrade
so upgrade jquery to a newer versioning and it should be fine

19330373
post	get
if you have access to html jsp code than use http post instead of http get that way you can hide the request parameters

19330375
for-loop	loops
since you have will be set to 1 everytime the for-loop is ran so it will run infinitely and will never go out of the for-loop and run the while loops a 2 nth time

19330375
for-loop	loops
since you are not doing anything with the in your for-loop just do your while loops and it will iterate over all 4 rows

19330394

19330477
int	chars
if you have function declared as int foo chars int

19330481
nscoding	nssecurecoding

19330490
hide	show
to do validation one approach i like to take is to have an error element declared and just show hide it when needed

19330513
disk	ram
p.s. also mongodb uses memory mapped files which are mapped to virtual memory not physical ram and flush data to disk every second without journaling

19330588
int	chars
i m not sure why you are using separate arrays one for chars between a-z and one for their int values

19330588
int	chars
you can easily cast the user s chars inputs into an int

19330633
min	max
that is matcher.group state compared to the string it should be min max or normal is not returning true and the same goes with matcher.group vis

19330711
audiotoolbox	avfoundation
vlc 2.1.x appears to use audiotoolbox and avfoundation

19330720
temporary	tablespace
you are doing something that requires more temporary space than the temp_mv tablespace can accommodate

19330720
temporary	tablespace
realistically this either means that you need to reduce the amount of temporary space that your process requires if for example you have inadvertently done a cartesian join on two large tables because you are missing a join condition you are running too many parallel slaves etc. or you or the dba need to allocate more space to the temp_mv tablespace or you need to organize your processing so that other pieces of code that are using large amounts of space in temp_mv are not running at the same time your code is running

19330720
temporary	tablespace
if you have multiple temporary tablespace you may also need to change your processing to use the other larger temporary tablespace

19330731
children	parent
each of these categories can have parent items or children items and so on

19330742
integer	unsigned
restricts size_t to be a synonym for an existing unsigned integer

19330742
int	chars	unsigned	short
this means that for the concern of c89 in general size_t is the same as a preexisting unsigned int type what in c89 implies one of the unsigned chars unsigned short unsigned int unsigned long

19330742
integer	unsigned
2 size_t is an unsigned integer type

19330742
integer	unsigned
since the integer conversion rank of signed long int is the same that unsigned long int this implies that the range of values of size_t is contained in the range of values of unsigned long int

19330761
children	parent
we can create the parent node and link it to the children at the same time

19330802

as a suggestion you may use a hashmap instead of treemap to enhance the performance of your method since the put and get time in hashmap are o 1 constant time while treemap s are o log n

19330821
post	get
for content running in adobe air when using the navigatetourl function the runtime treats a urlrequest that uses the post method one that has its method property set to urlrequestmethod.post as using the get method

19330948
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
you are using a uitabbarcontroller within the uinavigationcontroller and your uitabbarcontrollers are connected from there to multiple uinavigationcontroller so i can see why it is so confused

19330948
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
then connect your uitabcontroller to the separate uiviewcontroller not uinavigationcontroller

19330948
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
just don t have uitabbarcontrollers and uinavigationcontroller where you really want uiviewcontroller

19330960
min	max
it s better to replace the array with a hash table.then there is no need to find min max just start putting your numbers in the hash table as kyes checking before each put whether that key is already there

19330960
range	max	range	min	min	max
note that the array approach cannot handle numbers in a large range say min -2 63 max 2 63 even if there are just a few of them

19330995
ubuntu	linux
i downloaded the adt bundle for linux on my ubuntu 13.04 and when i tried to run the eclipse application it either didn t do anything at all when i clicked it or it said that it didn t know how to run executable files and asked to search the ubuntu software center for a possible application to run it

19331206
int	double
this inplies that you shall not mix double and int for this

your using opacity to hide and show the nested tags

19331343
hide	show
you can fix this by doing display none to hide and display block to show

19331378
width	height
so the kludge to get around that is to for horizontal stack view include two more zero width views or zero height for vertical stack views

19331378
width	height
hardcoding values for the sake of completeness i ll note that you could simply specify specific values for a b c and d as well as the width and height constraints

the tmp pear temp directory exists but tmp pear temp pthreads doesn t

19331890
move	drag
updating ui starts with hiding the selected item and show a detached row with the same value as the hidden item this will show that the selected item is ready to drag now move the detached row over the list view based on the touchmove event when the user takes the hand ie the touchup event or any other event that happens while dragging get the current row at which user touched last remove the detached row and do the data updation and invalidate the expandable listview this will redraw the list based on the new set of data and the user will get a feeling that the item is dragged and dropped in the list

the pattern requires that the composite object takes ownership of the children so as long as the parenting has been done you can be assured that the child qobjects will be destroyed when the parent is destroyed

qlayout	qwidget
the parent is actually the qwidget that the qlayout is the child of

19332239

stateless	stateful
both jsf and cdi containers have their own annotations and ways for referencing beans on the web page but ejbs just have the stateless or stateful and therefore can t be referenced on web pages which means that the jsf container must always be annexed with ejbs because i assume that mixing ejb and cdi containers is absurd as they are almost similar but for this point i wish someone to tell me if i m wrong

onchange	onblur
if so it doesnt support the onchange but onblur

19333886

19334376
setinterval	settimeout
i believe settimeout and setinterval also allow this type of function call too and i also believe that the interpreter adds the parentheses behind the scenes anyhow which brings us back to a function call is not a function call without the parentheses

atoi	atof
i used _rdtsc to time atoi and atof and i noticed they were taking pretty long

19334562
atoi	atof
inside the loop i obviously use my atof and atoi to notice the above

19334562
atoi	atof
however what i also noticed is that when i did my investigation before the loop just calling atoi and atof twice along with my user-written equivalent functions twice it seemed to make the loop execute faster

19334562
atoi	atof
the loop processed 150 000 lines of data each line requiring 3x atof or atoi s

19334562
atoi	atof
i am using atoi on the 4th element in the r messages and 5th element in a messages and using atof on the 4th element in the a messages

an http get or post from a form is all you need

19334672
maven	pom.xml
i right click and ran the pom.xml file as maven build

19334695
maven	m2e
if you install the maven to eclipse integration plugin m2e eclipse will automagically add the project dependencies to the project s build path and download them in the process

19334760
min	max
if you need something else like max min etc you can use that instead in the query

19334764
atoi	atof
the most likely explanation is that because you are calling atoi atof so often it is being identified as a hot spot and thus being kept in the level 1 or level 2 processor code cache

19334784
interpolation	splines
i am new to python and programming and working on the wave peak detection algorithm on my splines - interpolation plot

19335149
avr	microcontroller
i would recommend a microcontroller approach msp430 avr or one of the many arms

19335149
x86	mips
there are plenty of arm avr msp430 mips etc and x86 but i wouldnt go there for this until later instruction set simulators that would avoid the cost of hardware and also avoid the cost of damaging the hardware and having to buy more it happens even with lots of experience even better writing your own instruction set simulator...vba some nds simulators working your way up to qemu

19335205
nsurl	nsstring
you should use nsurl object instead of nsstring when you want an element to be treated as a url

19335226
superclass	subclassing
subclassing should be used to add functionality to a superclass

19335231
atoi	atof
i m guessing the reason why you see such a drastic improvement for atoi and atof but not for your own simpler function is that the former have a large number of branches in order to handle all the edge cases

19335236
firefox	safari
i have tried ie 10 firefox 24 safari 5.1.7 - the function in all these browsers works as expected

19335286

so my expandablelistview looks like sorry i can t post images i have less than 10 reputation .in group item layout file i have one textview one imageview like this

19335688
google-chrome	firefox
in spite of browser google-chrome firefox is always used

19335711
for-loop	loops
it might be possible to remove the for-loop but it is doubtful that that will increase speed since you have just a single loops and your calculation time is anyhow dominated by the multiplication of the big matrices

19335715
put	get	post	get	post	put
access-control-allow-methods get put post delete

19335715
post	get
because the spec says get and post are implied

19335720

for an infinite loops use a while-loop

19335720

there is a way to do that using wxpython and pygtk

19335839
unsigned	short
my query is how unsigned short int differ from unsigned int in the scenario of data holding

19335845
for-loop	arrays
initialize baseviewcontroller above for-loop and then store the arrays value inside the object of baseviewcontroller

19335861
width	border-box	box-sizing	border-box
the box-sizing border-box property prevents padding from adding onto the width that is the default behavior anyway

19335880
folder	directory
but before that i completly removed .m2 directory from users username folder

19335882
comparator	comparable
of the arrays class in its implementation navigates through the array argument a following the binarysearch algorithm and converts the elements of a into comparable and invokes comparator key until it either finds a match or runs out of possibilities

19335882
comparator	comparable
i m stumped by the implementation however if it s the case that the method will always cast the elements to comparable and furthermore will throw a classcastexception if it encounters an element that does not implement comparable would it not be clearer for the api user that the method will take into account the comparator of the elements of the array only and not the comparator of the key be more foolproof by preventing compilation where an invocation was made where the type of the array was not compatible with comparable and also execute more efficiently if the method were defined as

19335889
put	get
is it possible to get the name of the files in a directory and put them in the menu

19335993
getter	setter
grailscxfendpoint automatically excludes all the getter and setter

19335993
getter	setter
mixing grailscxfendpoint with webservice is also no solution as it exposes the getter and setter again

19336016
width	height
now i want to change the height and width of this paragraph so it only shows the begining head of the paragraph and then when i hover over it it displays the full paragraph

19336046
unsigned	short
when occurs x being unsigned gets a modulo or wrapped value of 65526 op sizeof short is 2

19336046
unsigned	short
unsigned short int is guaranteed to cover at least the range 0 to 65535

19336046
unsigned	short
unsigned int is guaranteed to cover at least the range of unsigned short int

19336046
unsigned	short
as unsigned short int is in some implementations smaller than unsigned int

19336082
int	double
then the compiler knows that myfunc takes an argument of type double and therefore can and will implicitly convert n from int to double before passing the parameter

19336082
int	double
so all it can do is pass the double argument as a double and when printf runs and sees the d it ll interpret it as an int and things will start going horribly wrong when it misinterprets the bit pattern and in this case probably the size of the argument as well throwing it off for any other arguments which come after it

19336236
post	get
based on other post about this i am supposed to declare the static member but when i try to do this i get the following error

19336315
width	height
i am trying to create a simple css transition that changes the height and width of a square box

19336315
width	height
the width seems to be changing with animation but the height does not animate

19336332
width	height
to transition both width and height you must change the transition setting like below

19336332
width	height
as mentioned in godfrzero s answer if you want to transition only height and width but not any other property s value change don t use the all method

19336380
children	parent
parent entity part relative to the relation with children

19336380
children	parent

the edit div has set width and height bit is then modified with something like

19336519
postgresql	mysql
the tests were done in postgresql so some of the queries do not even run in mysql but at least half of them do run and efficiency would be similar in many of them

19336560
action-filter	onactionexecuting
if you don t want to create an action-filter see here and place the attribute in each action you can create a controller that inherits from the base mvc controller and override the onactionexecuting or onactionexecuting method to provide common behavior for all actions in a controller

19336570
implements	extends
so ok you really need a hierarchy you could create a inheritance of interfaces where some interfaces extends others and some ejb implements that interfaces

this happens because the browser by default sets the width to 100 for all the block elements but this is not the default behaviour for the height

19336736
int	chars
on so i encountered an answer on a question how to store chars in int like this

19336751
for-loop	arrays
ok - if you replace your current for-loop with this your nfloat arrays should end up with the right numbers in it

19336775
int	double
the bitwise operators in javascript work with 32 bit int a double is converted to a 32 bit int when used with a bitwise operator

19336781
firefox	safari
i ve come across this very weird issue where safari web browser displays the website a bit differently than firefox

19336783
int	chars
there is one problem though if data has been declared using chars rather than unsigned chars the signed will be promoted first to a signed int and you end up setting many more bits than you intended

19336824
put	get
when i send names it is not empty 100 and put this code in a method and called it after the i get the names

19336838
int	chars
the best is to declare an unsigned chars array for data and then cast each data elements to unsigned int before the left shift

19336865
awt	swing	awt	slick2d
i suggest you start with game development by using java2d awt swing then moving on to either slick2d or libgdx though i do suggest libgdx because it s still being developed

a qpointer is a weak pointer to a qobject

19346983

it can be thought of as a generalization of qpointer to non- qobject classes

19346983

19350079
hide	show
i use the event binding to show hide the list when the mouse is coming in or out

19350079
hide	show
you could massage this to work the way that you want it to on when to hide the list vs when to show it but the general idea is to use event handlers that are built in to knockout

19350081
prepare	execute
you can merely prepare the js that will be execute at client side within your php code at server side

19350101
width	height
if i change to the screen width and height then the image is drawn in some odd position in the lower right hand side of the screen

19350264
onclick	onsubmit
i have tried using onclick and onsubmit

19350288

it will then slide the current visible screen up and hide it and then show the screen corresponding to the li for example if the li is home then it will slide the current existing screen up and hide it and then it would should the #homeslide screen

19350315
content-disposition	content-type
i thought i could use request.body.read or request.raw_post however the payload has all this metadata inside it like content-disposition and content-type

19350334
hide	show
you could put it into a div which you will hide show when you add remove content but that won t really work with using empty before inserting content

19350348
utc	isodate
i understand that this could be something related to isodate and utc i am in utc+1 but i a bit annoyed that my dates are saved with one day difference in the collection and requires me to convert to localtime any time i fetch some data with dates

19350398
google-chrome	firefox
also google-chrome has a great tool that allows you to edit css on the fly which i find more useful and quicker than using firefox s extensions

19350519
folder	directory
the reason removing -rpath solves this issue is that when loading the required modules for libmicroxml the loader first searches lib as the default first directory since no other directory was specified and since the modules in this folder are already loaded there s no conflict

19350537
cpython	pypy
if your sole concern is not wanting to make sure the rest of the program works with pypy rest assured virtually all pure python code works with pypy with the sole exception of cpython implementation details

19350590
haskell	ocaml
i found great recommendations for haskell and i think it would be good to have something similar for ocaml

19350593
post	get
post a comment if you get stuck with converting this to java or with adjusting it for the other three quarters of the circle

19350611
udp	tcp
i don t think so because tcp basically simulates a stream by breaking up your data into smaller packets and sending it while in udp you have more control over the whole process

19350617
viewmodel	caliburn.micro
a property from viewmodel which binds to combobox using caliburn.micro

19350628
width	height
on my picture box the images shown always appear in a specific height and width shown below

19350628

qsort	bsearch
the same applies to the function pointer arguments required by qsort and bsearch

19350719

the proper way to do this sort of animation with texture coordinates mapped to geometry is to use an authoring tool such as maya 3dsmax or blender

19350721
onmouseover	onclick
currently the onmouseover and onmouseout events work properly but nothing happens onclick

19350736
udp	tcp
the behavior of udp and tcp varies in much more than just that

to put a formal answer to this post -

19350895
ready	each
in the end i simplified my solution to use one menuloader object which has an array of hashes for each image to be drawn containing x y imagepath ready flag

19350895
ready	each
i set an onload event for each image to set its respective ready flag to true

edit just to clarify what i mean by scrambled data subsetting the data frame after my code i get output like the following where the normalized values clearly belong to another factors group

19350966

19350996
division	multiplication
if you look at the denominators for the fractions you can see that making a common denomination would allow you to do the division just once at the expense of more multiplication

19350996
division	multiplication
if you are sure that a floating point multiplication is better than a floating point division then

19351010
cpu	processors
processors 4x xeon 2.67ghz cpu

int	chars
i have a feeling this has to do with the fact that it reads in the chars as an ascii int but i m really not sure how to fix this

19351056

i currently have my primarydomain code first set up like this this doesn t have the decorators that specify min max length etc.

it doesn t use get post it uses delete

19351133
post	get
i was wondering how i could post the variables from the js function and get them with php saving them to a php variable without user interaction - this is the most important part it needs to be done automatically

19351144
width	height
set the dimensions of the containing div specifically to the height and weight and then set the css class of the image to be height 100 and width 100

19351149

my c and c++ compiler are gcc but it seems that since mavericks gcc and g++ links to clang which is not supported by cuda

19351251
int	boolean
you are switching on boolean type and your cases are using int types

19351257
width	height
by setting a width of 100 on the image element itself the browser will take care of the height scale automatically

19351260
int	boolean
switch ison switching boolean and want to case with int case 0

19351263
wmic	findstr
you can functionally put the findstr tests in the wmic where clause by using the like operator with as the wildcard

19351293
rss	feed
in head of page html there s a link for sites with rss atom feed something like this

19351293
client-side	server-side
it s can be done in both server-side and client-side but in server-side there s more benefits like database searching before parsing page html and testing routines

19351293
google-chrome	firefox
firefox by default has an option to get page feed previous versions of google-chrome has such functionality but it s removed by google and google way

19351334

the gallery div has a red draggable box and the canvas and body are both droppable that will accept that box

19351353

strings even individual chars are not int

19351366
post	get
i used the following post and sample code as a guide and was able to get it working

19351423
free	calloc
i know that s not the preferred way to declare calloc free but it s for simplicity of output below.

19351423
clang	llvm
then you run clang -o3 -s -emit-llvm alloc.c with clang llvm 3.3 you get

19351423
free	calloc
so it seems that clang has special case code for calloc free

19351423
calloc	malloc
perhaps some annotation i could put on the definition of one of my own functions that would allow llvm to optimize away allocations just as it can for calloc malloc

19351462
firefox	safari
but works fine in firefox and safari

19351839
tcplistener	tcpclient
you could use tcpclient and tcplistener

19351857

my second though was that you could have somemodel extends a class or implements an interface wherein you values would be set as properties or constants

19351861
minimum	max
i want to limit the minimum value the user can enter to the max stream size minus the higher order bit in order to prevent overflow

19351910
pop-up	dialog
after conversion to pdf when i click on print in the tool it should not go to default printer to print the physical file nor should it display the dialog box asking for printer to choose rather it should pop-up a custom dialog box indicating file being saved in the network drive

19351927
min	max
set max to 0 and min to something huge like integer.max_value

19351935
hide	show
this way you don t have to hack around with the activity s context or fragment managers hide and show methods

19351948
put	get
that is actually what your application or whatever is requiring the ndays value could do instead of pulling a pre-calculated value you could put that expression in the query that is used to request the number of days left and thus get rid of ndays

openstack	ceilometer
take a look at the openstack ceilometer project

before i make my game responsive the mouse drag works fine and perfect the character move followed the dragging but the moment i applied responsiveness the mouse drag seems to be offset which my character does not follow the finger accurately

19352259
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
then you could use this overload of array.sort to sort only populated values in the arrays and you could change your foreach loops to a for-loop that iterates only over the values that have actually been entered

19352270
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i m trying to make a bunch of image links from an svg spritesheet i have but i m running into cross-browser problems between google-chrome and safari and firefox

firefox	safari
to fix this i can subtract 2 from each of the background-position y-values but then i have problems because they re now wrong in safari and firefox

19352301
min	max
assign the first element of the array as the max and min .

19352305
children	parent
the easy way i can think of is make a parent div then use siblings to fade in or out all the children using

19352306
width	height
if you added width and height to your tags that would solve the issue

19352377
vbscript	vba

that suffix is used by rcs and cvs for their internal version control files

19353154
cvs	rcs
yes it s a bit odd to have rcs or cvs internal files in a git repository.

19353154
cvs	rcs
some kind of rcs or cvs interaction is the most likely explanation for the error but there could be other causes

to care of the activities while functioning in the background you must use the onresume onpause ondestroy and such methods effectively

19353618
yacc	bison
if there s any chance you ll ever implement the grammar you probably want to know that you want the right recursive form for a recursive descent parser but generally prefer the left recursive form for a bottom up parser such as many generators such as yacc bison byacc etc. produce

19353625
children	parent
i have parent and they have a one-to-many relationship with children

19353625
children	parent
i want to use the database to populate a list of the parent and populate their children

19353805
margin	text-align
tried text-align center and margin auto both doesn t work and i do not want to used to use the margin hack for centering

19353810
ienumerable	iqueryable
i haven t time too play around with the idea but i m guessing that one could create a more generic extension method which would allows the same technique to be expanded to any object of type iqueryable or ienumerable

19353810
post	get
if i get a chance to do just this i ll post what i come up with

19353841
width	height
on the inner circle than am assigning top and left properties with a value of 50 and than am using margin-top and margin-left and deducting 1 2 of the height and width

19353841
width	height
as i already said am deducting exactly half the total width and height so this also includes the border of your element which is set to 2px which makes your element 64px in height and width respectively

19353874
width	height
now i need to convert this photo into 5 height by 4.5 width in ios7

19353874
width	height
the image size that i get from above code is nearly 4.445 width 7.889 height

19353878
put	get
you ll have to change a bunch of it depending on a where you plan to put the code - where how you re going to get the function params from

19353912
children	parent
now the children will be included to the parent object

19353942
viewdidload	viewwillappear
there are lots of topics in so discussion this problem within the content of a view controller or a view and the solution seems to be to detect screen size in viewwillappear not in viewdidload

int	boolean
note you can do this with boolean int etc

19354057

19354080
children	parent
since the children have no height the parent gets no height either rendering the children invisible

19354080
children	parent
apply those properties to the children and give the parent overflow hidden or whatever method of clearing floats works best with your layout and it ll work just fine

19354082
postgresql	mysql
with out looking at the type of queries or the complexity it is difficult to say if mysql or postgresql will work better for you

19357770
daemons	systemd
some daemons script called periodically by the operating systemd would update its internal database and afterwards copy the database file to a certain location

19357775
integer	unsigned
obviously the 0 is meaningless here a shift over zero places typically does nothing although it could have forced an integer to become unsigned if javascript made that distinction

19357796
width	height
its width and height are 50 pixels each

19357834
express	node.js
i have an nginx server load-balancing several express node.js servers

19357899
lxml.html	beautifulsoup
using an html parser like beautifulsoup or lxml.html is a better idea

19357899
lxml	beautifulsoup
another point in favor of beautifulsoup is that sometimes beautifulsoup can parse broken html by inserting missing closing tags for example when lxml can not

19357899
lxml	beautifulsoup
in contrast to the multitude of functions provided by the beautifulsoup api lxml mainly uses the xpath mini-language for navigation

19357899
lxml	beautifulsoup
lxml is also much much faster than beautifulsoup

19357899
lxml	beautifulsoup
so if you are just starting out beautifulsoup may be easier to use instantly but in the end i believe lxml is more pleasant to work with

19357909
int	boolean
you can also employ the fact that mysql converts a boolean result to an int 0 for false 1 for true automatically when in a proper context like an arithmetic one so this would also work

19357958

the fullscreen api is enabled by default in google-chrome 15 firefox 14 and opera 12

19357960

19357965
for-loop	arrays
as the header says i was tipped by some people that if i wanted to print the sum of everything in an arrays of numbers i should use the above-mentioned parameter for a for-loop code will follow if further explanation is needed

19357978
google-chrome	firefox
this is the case in all major browsers including but not limited to internet explorer 10 google-chrome 30 and firefox 24 - as all of them have the same behaviour i don t think it s likely that it s a bug

19357985
for-loop	loops
this is the advanced enhanced for-loop also called the for-each loops which iterates over each element of the list provided on the right hand side of the assigning each value iteratively to the variable on the left of the

19357987
post	get
you then submit this value to the site php as a form post or get

19358021
for-loop	arrays
i have implemented several solutions which are working including iterating using a for-loop and a solution using an nspredicate but both of these methods involve multiple iterations through an arrays

19358026
for-loop	arrays
the usual way to step through all the elements of an arrays in order is with a standard for-loop for example

19358100
min	max
depending on whether you want result to be non-negative or non-positive you can switch min and max in the following statement

19358149
width	height
the blue size is what i get if i set the size of the imageview to width matchparent and height 0 with weight 0.5

19358149
width	height
2 width height

19358149
width	height
this works as i already said on some devices gt-i9000 and amazon kindle hd but on a nexus 4 the images that have a much bigger height than width tend to occupy the whole damn screen

19358190
kramdown	coderay
you can use kramdown with coderay on github pages

19358192
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
my text file contains several line and i am trying to split each line to arrays and display all lines into a text box using a for-loop or while loops

19358259
post	get
first i would like to know why he tries it with a get command instead of a post command but if a get command is somehow necessary can t see why it would be he should really pay attention to the following actually he should stop what ever he is doing and make sure it is done the proper way

19358259
hash	salt
the first a passwords needs to be hash and salt so from the moment the enter button is pressed the text in the password box needs to be encrypted so it does not show as plain text in the url

19358273

19358376
google-chrome	firefox
this issue happens on ie 9 10 tried only these but not in firefox and google-chrome

19358420
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
just a hint when working with indexers in arrays type objects when you use and for loops you should always use the arrays length as the upper limit of the for-loop like so

19358421
factors	matrix
while malloc and map_anonymous give quite similar results i get a roughly factors 10 penalty when computing my matrix when it is backed by a file

19358428
for-loop	loops
there are many things that could be changed in your code but to answer just to your problem i would change loops to use a simple for-loop so you could access directly the items in the listbox and change the text for the matched items

19358433
children	parent
however when using jquery .on to add a .click event to all future children of a parent element the parent is highlighted on click instead of the child

19358483
ready	each
currently i loop through p looking for each name and if found parse it and add it to another array splice the row out of p and break 1 ready to start searching for the next of the 5000 names

19358501
versioning	upgrade
i am using opencart 1.5.2.1 planning to upgrade to the 1.5.6 versioning with a new template but am worried to loose any data in the site

19358503
superclass	subclassing
in other cases it might be a good idea to create a subclassing of uiviewcontroller that creates this gesture and handles it and then use that as a superclass for any controllers that are pushed on.

19358512
children	parent
here you have two methods for button clicks - moving up down between siblings children parent

19358523
for-loop	arrays
you are running two fast enumeration as for-loop of same arrays

19358523
for-loop	arrays
if you want to compare the co-ordinates then excecute for-loop of different arrays

19358523
for-loop	arrays
and also you can add directly to mutable arrays if same for-loop only you are using

19358540
whenever	capistrano
you should have this in config deploy.rb to make whenever work with capistrano if that s the case

19358569
put	get
it s pretty neat with commands like mkdir cd put get

19358603
width	height
hi in above function i am making a variable that has html elements in it and i want to know the height and width of the tmp variable becasue the content gets updated dynamically my problem is i can get the width of the variable tmp by using width method and i am getting height 0 by using height method

19358605
folder	directory
you normaly have to do that after downloading the logback distribution place the files logback-core-version.jar and logback-access-version.jar under jetty_home lib directory where jetty_home is the folder where you have installed jetty

19358614

19360875
rsa	aes
typical modulus sizes might be say from 1024 to 4096 bits. to encrypt a long message with rsa one would normally use hybrid encryption first encrypt the message using a symmetric cipher like aes using a suitable mode of operation and a randomly chosen key and then encrypt the aes key with rsa

19360875
rsa	aes
the point is that in both cases the rsa operation itself takes a fixed amount of time regardless of the message length and thus for sufficiently long messages most of the time will be consumed by aes or the hash function not by rsa itself

19360893
width	height
making the position absolute is puttinf the element out of flow so they don t occupy any height or width of the document

folder	directory
however the main directory of the program holding package.json and node_modules is the folder where foo.js is located

19361360
post	get
the first option is to only redirect on get instead of post - see if this is sufficient

19361471
width	height
use css to set both the width and height of the image to 100 and the image will be automatically stretched to fill the containing div without the need for jquery

19361471
width	height
that way if your users have javascript disabled the image will still be stretched to fill the entire div width height

19361582
mouseleave	mouseenter
the best approach is to create a user control container then hook all the child controls mouseenter and mouseleave events so that you can properly detect when and where the mouse is at all times

19361582
mouseleave	mouseenter
then if it enters your container s bounds you can fire a custom mouseenter event and when it leaves mouseleave event

19361596
onclick	onchange

19361840
pdfsharp	migradoc
one way is using pdfsharp to call addpage for each new page and draw a rectangle in the color you like before calling renderpage to draw the migradoc content

19361840
pdfsharp	migradoc
here s a sample that draws nine migradoc pages in thumbnail size on a single pdfsharp page

in general you really should know what hex and binary mean

19363447
hex	binary
hex is effectively just a shorthand for binary

i do have knowledge in iphone development but never dealt with sqlite before all my apps were enterprise lever where i talk to restful server to post and get data and all the sql stuff is at server side

19364127
goto	break
no break no goto

19364127
goto	break
it serves the same purpose as break and goto in this case but the technique seems to be clean at least to me

19364486
blast	bioperl
you can probably use a blast parser like those in bioperl to manipulate your data

19364532
google-chrome	firefox
i m pretty sure this is not a phantom whitespace problem because it works in google-chrome and ie and it did work in a previous firefox not to mention that it works if viewing the page source

19364536
put	get
you get the same effect if you put them on separate lines

19364551

google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in google-chrome version 29.0.1547.76 m firefox 24.0 and ie10

19364855
children	parent
yes the build_phase of the uvm executed in top-down order because the children don t exist until they are constructed within the build_phase of the parent component and the uvm recommends using the factory create method instead of calling the constructor new directly

19364855
children	parent
the build_phase is also executed top-down so that the parent can provide override setting that the children will use when they execute their build_phase

19364864
width	height
and then specify the custom height and width that needs to be applied to your html element eg

19364864
google-chrome	firefox
but it worked for me in firefox google-chrome explorer 10 hope it works in older versions too

19364874
devise	sorcery
secondly is devise more superior to sorcery

19364882
dynamicmethod	reflection.emit
your first option is reflection.emit especially dynamicmethod

19364882
dynamicmethod	reflection.emit
you can think of this as being essentially a type-safe wrapper around dynamicmethod generation with reflection.emit

19364923
solaris	aix
other options would be solaris hp-ux windows or aix for example

19364939
inject	interceptor
alternately you can write all your storage logic in a request interceptor - you can inject anything and everything in there as well so storing your calls and re-requesting can also be done at that stage

19364974
filesystems	ntfs
only reason for the for command not enumerating files in name order is that the filesystems is not ntfs

19364974
filesystems	fat
fat filesystems enumerate files in drop order

19364994
integer	fractions
cint and converttoint32 both do rounding to the nearest even integer when the fractions value is 0.5

19365159
octal	binary
i ve been trying to code a program that will convert an octal to binary and then hexadecimal but the problem is that i m getting the wrong answer

19365196
google-chrome	firefox
both google-chrome 30.0.1599.69 and ie10 seem to have no problem but firefox 24 does and only when using an ip address rather than the name

19365196
google-chrome	firefox
so it seems that firefox does not look relative to the path of the html document but rather the server when using an ip address to access whereas google-chrome and ie10 do look relative to the page regardless of using a name or an ip

19365196
google-chrome	firefox
i have found that coding the links with the folder name does seem to resolve the firefox ip address issue however it messes up google-chrome as the folder name gets added anyway in the network path seen in the console

19365197
int	chars
int getadresses chars int arr 128 int x

19365198
width	height
the arc width and height values are also bindable

19365212
filesystems	ntfs
in ntfs filesystems -

19365273
folder	directory
also the desktopfolder will need a reference in the targetdir directory element which will very likely contain other folder such as programmenufolder as you require like this

19365290
postgresql	mysql
you can try openserver mongodb memcache mysql postgresql

19365367
button	checkbox
in text fields i m entering some data and by clicking the first button i m calling second activity that displays a listview with checkbox

19365395
hide	show
since it seems like you only want to show one date and hide the rest you can create a custom filter for that date

19365417
multiplying	subtract
the important realization to make is that all of these matrix operations dividing multiplying adding and subtract exist for any field not just the real numbers

19365417
addition	multiplication
if you are unfamiliar with the term field it just means a group of values which allow for multiplication negation inversion addition etc

19365417
addition	multiplication
we can define the addition and multiplication tables as follows

19365443
octal	binary
when converting 0-3 from octal to binary you need that leading 0

19365443
octal	binary
currently your code changes octal 10 to binary 0100 which is incorrect you ve turned 8 into 4

19365445
hide	show
video.js adds a class to the wrapper element that you can use to show hide your controls

19365509
devise	cancan
you can try to use djangoâ s builtin permission framework instead of cancan and devise

19365551
google-chrome	firefox
i played around in jsfiddle with this for a bit using internet explorer firefox and google-chrome and this combo seems to work the best for me and provides consistent results across browsers

19365559
uiviewcontroller	uipageviewcontroller
what i did in a very similar situation permanent navigation bar with two exchangeable uiviewcontroller was to use a uipageviewcontroller

19365596
submit	submission
in this example the outcome is overidden if it is valid as this page has nowhere to submit to - instead of submission it will alert that it is valid in real life it will just carry on submission if valid

19365649
rspec	capybara
i haven t included capybara or selenium so as i understand it rspec should be using rack-test to run this example

19365670
spaces	delimiter
by default spaces is one of the delimiter

19365704
post	get
once you set-up all informations in setting your post will automatically get posted to your account

19365707

update to get your values from a form you cannot put form action to js but rather use js to get the values from a form

19365727
filtering	grouping
so far i am filtering the grouping in the userscontroller arraycontroller with the following

19365772

rss	feed
i have a java project in eclipse where i download the cnn technology rss feed then use sax to parse and get the number of items in the feed

19365840
post	put
from what i saw on other post the pixel values should be put in a matrix and then changed based on my algorithms after that the new values should go into a new matrix hsi

19365866
width	height
concerning the right and bottom side simply add some pixels to height width

19365870
client-side	server-side
but do read some more on server-side vs client-side languages and how php works at the back

19365896
put	get
what i want is when the searchbox get focus there will be a default string search that when the user upon writing something the whole string search will be replace with the string the user put in

19365940
exponent	modulo
thanks to erickson for his help i can convert the public key from rfc4716 to a java public key using the exponent and the modulo as biginteger types passed to a keyfactory with the rsapublickeyspec

19365955
post	get
i currently have to post some data to a url and i will get a video back if all the data is valid

19365957
free	malloc
under the hood malloc also keeps some housekeeping information about the memory it has given you most importantly its size so that when you call free it knows things like how much memory to free

19365971
for-loop	arrays
since every input asks the same question you should use a for-loop and an arrays of inputs

19366012
strcpy	strncpy
in limited circumstances you can use strcpy for this but ideally you should use strncpy instead to ensure that you cannot overflow from one field into another

19366080
x86	64bit
if you want your program to work on both 32 and 64bit then use the x86 version

19366088
post	get
objects with the property disable do not get returned in a post get

19366088
post	get
from everything on the page then submit the post get

19366107
put	get
from site a the user will get an embed code that will be put in site b so basically i have access to the both sites

19366117
daemons	systemd
i have a daemons that backs up some systemd files before it does anything else and restores them afterwards

19366174
hide	show
basically a mytogglebutton gets fired from the mainpage which will trigger a datastatebehavior to go into a show or hide state to respectively show or hide the childview1.xaml

19366174
hide	show
that datastatebehavior is binded to the boolean canshowview while the mytogglebutton is binded to an icommand named buttonchecked which has a relay function switchvisibility that will reverse the canshowview boolean to show or hide the view

19366201
google-chrome	firefox
i have a modal window on the index.php that displays if there s no cookie present and of course i do my dev in google-chrome so i can find out the bad news right at the end lol and it works fine there but the facebook like code doesn t display at all in ie or firefox

19366203
super	extends
at this point it s super simple and only consists of 3 files per following the instructions listed on this question rails extends activerecord base and using railties to self-initilize

19366206
google-chrome	firefox
everything works fine with firefox and google-chrome

19366385
leaflet	tilemill
but that process would require a. moving of feature geometry in a gis program and b. fooling tilemill into using the wrong projection as it creates tiles for you to use in leaflet

19366398
hash	salt
i m planning to recreate hash on client-side using this salt

19366490
cpython	pypy
if you are using the cpython or pypy implementation of python then the global interpreter lock gil will prevent more than one thread from operating on python objects at a time

19366525
min	max
you should be fine if you calculate your max value based on min and step something like.-

19366531
for-loop	loops
it never enters else loops because in your code but your for-loop won t reach that value

19366533
viewdidload	viewwillappear
however it appears that poptorootviewcontrolleranimated doesn t execute the viewdidload viewwillload or viewwillappear methods so i am stuck as to how to reload.

19366555
min	max
your max value is 112 and your min value is 26

19366605
children	parent
as far as i can tell the primary effect of declaring a relationship between parent and child classes is that parentobject.child will now reference the entries linked to the parentobject in the children table

19366652
google-chrome	firefox
tested browser firefox google-chrome

19366659
radiobuttonlist	requiredfieldvalidator
you can use requiredfieldvalidator to validate radiobuttonlist

19366669
min	max
if min is always less than max then you can also do

19366766
hide	show
so i can do something like this which currently doesn t work capybara finds the current .slide before it is hidden instead of waiting for the current slide to hide and new slide to show

19366816
post	get
the right way to get the post id in a custom wp_query is

19366831
super	extends	super	abstract
however a few of my classes extends a shared abstract super class

19366888
queue	fifo
the requests will be queue up and processed in a fifo manner

19366899
division	modulo
maybe your reference can not handle signed numbers correctly -413 59 and throw result of modulo simply 59 because of it to avoid division with signum combined from both numbers

19366901
post	get
on the home page though if i include a youtube link for instance oembed does not work when i get the custom post type content through the variable

19366904
background-image	background-color
background-image sits on top of background-color so you aren t seeing the change

19366918
x86	64bit
download and install the x86 version of qt unless you have a really good reason for the 64bit version

19366955
public	protected
when you exlude public and don t have anything else there like protected or private this is called package protected

19366955
public	protected
this should explain the differences to you in java difference between default public protected and private

19367020
for-loop	arrays
do your for-loop first to split the data into 3 different arrays then pass those separate sources to jquery

19367064
put	get	width	margin
i know margin 0 auto and adding a width works but when i put it for the menu control i can t get it working

19367064
width	margin
funny thing is when i create a label and place it in a placeholder margin 0 auto and width auto works in centering

19367066
stateless	stateful
personally i try to not conflate my dataâ stateful objects of mostly generic types with no functionality tacked unto themâ on the one hand and my librariesâ stateless collections of named pieces of functionalityâ on the other

19367088
post	get
if you only specify resources post your get request would match the one for get post id look at the output of rake routes show action of postscontroller with product_list parsed as the id parameter in the request uri

19367113
aggregate-functions	sum
the normal order by approach should work even with aggregate-functions like avg or sum

19367224
post	get
if there is area of code you think i need to post to get a better picture let me know i ll be happy to add it

19367253
folder	directory
copy the entire py folder under androidwebdriver4python to merge the same one in root directory of androiddriver for python

19367283
put	get
personally i d just put its functions as free floating c-style ones - maybe in a namespace somewhere so that you get some kind of classification

19367354
for-loop	loops
but in your case i would use a for-loop instead a while so you don t need to declare loops variable before

19367371
post	get
and again go to mycoolsite post edit 17 i get this form tag in the markup which is missing the 17 from the action

19367389
for-loop	loops
however there is a better way to loops through the list of urls in your case using a for-loop

19367389
post	get
might i also suggest that you use python-requests it is excellent for sending requests via common http protocols such as get and post

19367391
post	get
you should post your code in order to get a straight answer since there are too many things to look into when discussing memory usage

19367392
post	get
please let me know where my post and post body gets validated fine but my date named sdate does not get validated please let me know if i need to add any attribute for form.sdate ... field

19367436
put	get	post	get	post	put
i then read thru the array get the quantity from our system using the sku and post put the inventory_level using the associated product_id

19367454

the in front of the password indicates it is using an md5 hash

19367738
int	chars
also i m not too sure why int are used to store chars

19367763
hash	salt
this salt then will be appended to a string that needs to be hash

19367763
hash	salt
then i can append that salt to a string that needs to be hash

note though malloc and calloc are not guaranteed to allocate anything

19367972
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to latest rails 4.x because asset pipeline changed between versioning

width	height
the reasoning for this is simple only properly positioned elements will allow their children to inherit height and width attributes

19367990
getter	setter
will generate a setter named setstatuslabel and a getter statuslabel and a _statuslabel

19367990
getter	setter
there will be no variable named statuslabel when you use self and . syntax you are really calling the setter getter and not accessing the variable directly

19367990
getter	setter
and you can override the setter getter name like this

19367990
getter	setter
although i see no real reason for changing the default names of either the setter getter or variable name.

19368022
strncmp	memcmp
if it s not an ascii string you are looking for use memcmp instead of strncmp

19368101

folder	directory
2 from the new local git directory i want to push all files folder to github

19368208
pull	push
if you have multiple repos they should all push and pull from the same place presumably the remote github repo

19368208
pull	push
so when you use repo #1 you push your changes to github and then when you go to use repo #2 you pull from github

19368208
pull	push
normally i would use an ssh connection to my server and this works for push and fetch pull

19368208
folder	directory
2 from the new local git directory i want to push all files folder to github

19368208

when i put the expression in parentheses show f 0 +1 things get even stranger

19368482
grepl	substr
alternatively if the substr field might occur in some other position relative to description and perhaps in either upper or lower-case version it might be simpler to just grepl twice and use boolean operators to combine the results

19368489
width	height
specifically you need a center x center y width and height

19368542
division	modulo
this allows the summation of multiple random numbers without fear of overflow - and the final modulo division ensures that the number you end up with will be approximately uniformly distributed especially if you ended up making a large number of calls to random

19368690
width	height
for example do something near to circle int width int height and in the c4workspace attribute two numbers that define the size of the circle

19368722
width	height
that can be done by using the height and width options

19368783
onclick	onchange
4 you have a long way to go since now your code makes no attempt at calculating anything you should hardly use onclick on an input element to start the calculation rather onchange on it or onclick on a separate button element

normally properties on the parent scope from ng-repeat would be accessible without this through prototypical inherited of the scopes

it uses display none to show and hide the tweets

19369311
min	max
assuming k1 is positive no reason not to make k1 positive since flipping the sign doesn t really change the problem since k2 can be shifted appropriately then we have k1 max rate + k2 776.37 and k1 min rate + k2 -397.95

intersect	contains
removed workingdevice to add in devicestoupdate direct vs indirect logic taking the union then doing contains for all elements is the same as doing intersect once

i believe using integer unsigned is reasonably database independent but possibly not 100

19369358

also i m a bit disappointed in geoff s answer in that it seems to completely disregard the fact that an unsigned integer while using the same amount of storage space holds a different set of data

spaces	delimiter
the string extraction process should be take the third sub-string delimiter by spaces and extract sub-string that ends in or spaces

int	chars
short byte or chars values may also be used as index values because they are subjected to unary numeric promotion â 5.6.1 and become int values

19370255
integer	unsigned
or store the intermediate result of arc4random in an unsigned integer

19370279
integer	unsigned
i suspect the problem stems from the fact that arc4random is returning a u_int32_t an unsigned 32-bit integer between 0 and 2 32 -1 but doing a calculation only appropriate for signed integers

you might have a look at butterknife by jake wharton which is leaner than roboguice for views injection

19370463
hide	show
also you can simply show or hide elements by using the visible data-bind

19370502
unsigned	short
these are traditionally called short integers or half integers and require the hu qualifier in printf or similar functions rather than just u which stands for unsigned int whose size depends on the target machine.

19375337
salt	md5
by the way with an appropriate function like password_hash there is no reason to generate the salt on your own this function will do its best to generate a safe salt and it will use a slow key-derivation function bcrypt which should be used for passwords not sha- or even md5

i think the answer 1 function checkprime int number can improved but purely on preformance basis consider the fact that prime numbers cannot be even.so if add an extra check to see if number 2 0 will reduce a lot of iteration of the for-loop and for the remaining i think iterating loops from 2 to 9 is enough rather than 2 to n

as you see in my code above integrationtest was dependent upon cleantest thus when i called gradle clean build integrationtest it ran units tests first via build task as unit tests runs by default with the build step in gradle and then integration tests via integrationtest task therefore while running integration tests it called cleantest task which wiped out ut folder which i have mentioned in a common gradle script init.d commmon-some-name.gradle file like i mentioned it folder for reports results directory

if the initial value of j is outside the range 0 to a.length inclusive-exclusive then the only solutions either use a modulo or division which being the same operation are the same speed or a loop of subtraction which will essentially accomplish the same thing as modulo on a very old processor which is slower than the built in operation for modulo on any current processor i know about

from the comments others made you also have a group by which is used when doing aggregations such as min max avg etc such as total sales per sales rep per month per year etc

19389802
sqlconnection	sqltransaction
the sqlconnection sqlcommand and sqltransaction all need to be in using blocks to make certain that any resources they use will be cleaned up with the block is finished whether or not an exception is thrown

19389809
bindparam	bindvalue
i tried bindparam and bindvalue same results

19389862
folder	directory
however the roles ghost folder name can change and hard-coding this won t let you run the playbook from another directory

19389878
width	margin
it positioned absolutely with a width of 100 and a margin of 26 so it s breaking out of the page

19389896
google-chrome	firefox
i mention firefox in the title because my current implementation works perfectly in google-chrome and ie but not in firefox

19389896
google-chrome	firefox
like i stated above this works in google-chrome and ie but in firefox what happens is that when more than one checkbox is selected and you select a checkbox in the other group only one of the previously checked boxes get deselected

19389919
inherited	properties
to make my solution portable i am adding custom properties through properties manager so that i can define global paths for includes that each project in the solution can inherited from

19389920
checkstyle	jacoco
sonarqube ships with a java quality profile that combines findbugs jacoco checkstyle and pmd

19389930

they do not render on ios for google-chrome nor safari

19389943
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
it works perfectly in google-chrome safari and firefox but in ie the popup only appears when i hard-refresh the page

19389960
width	height
you can then use the width and height of the form to position your control in the center appropriately

19389978
ubuntu	linux
today i had updated my ruby and rails versions using rvm on linux ubuntu

19390099
nsis	uninstaller
i want to know is there any way using nsis by which i can uninstaller the program by invoking control panel s uninstaller option or finding the uninstaller for the program and using execwait to run uninstall.exe and then simply delete the shortcuts

19390136
stdout	fflush
i placed a system.out.println right before the native call on the java side and a printf as the first line of the native function where the program crashes being sure to use fflush stdout directly after

19390177
flask-admin	flask-sqlalchemy
i m using flask flask-sqlalchemy to store user data in a sqlite db and flask-admin for its file admin feature

19390241
width	height
this is a basic question but if you want to have a responsive width you can use percentage for width or height

19390295
put	get
when i put in a value that does not match i get a stack trace

19390305
post	get
i have implemented the method shown in these post and i see the server object listening on the correct port but i cannot get the client object to actually make the remoting connection

19390355
children	parent
here is my object structure so far a parent named dendogramvo and a child class named children which also has a children list

19390427
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
you might have to add pre-condition checks to your constructor and setter methods which check the values given a throw a suitable exception nullpointerexception or illegalargumentexception if the values passed to them would result in the restrictions being broken

19390489
width	height
setting width 100 isn t exactly a great answer because it doesn t account for height and could overflow the element in the y direction off the window

19390489
width	height
this solution resizes the element once on load and also on resize checking the aspect ratio of the window and determining if height should be 100 or width should be 100

19390491
accelerometer	gyroscope
acceleration and gravity sensor is just the sum of accelerometer gyroscope and magnetometer

19390520
width	height
make sure you define the height and width of elements that are being manipulated

19390560
ssl	https
when both domains are in the ssl cert list your cname can redirect with https

19390618
width	height
what i have done is to attach a changelistener to a nullfield that takes all width and height but the fieldchanged method is never called

19390649
super	implements
it is then my job to implements the various things such as data blocks i-node blocks the super block etc

19390709
rfcomm	l2cap
bluetooth sockets is a simple abstraction for communicating over bluetooth rfcomm or l2cap on other platforms

19390731
hide	show
i create an instance of secondaryframe and then use a menu item to show and hide it

19390735
portrait	landscape
the problem is that it all works fine in with a uiimage that is passed in that is in landscape orientation the image is cropped as expected however if the image passed in was taken in portrait then the resulting image the cropped result in scalednewimage is rotated 90 degrees on its side which i don t want

19390735
portrait	landscape
it is as if the portrait image is being worked on as if it s in landscape - and so the function cropped what should be a portrait orientated image in landscape instead of portrait

19390735
portrait	landscape
this isn t so apparent if the crop area is square however if the area to be cropped is a landscape rectangle then it s cropping it along the length of the portrait rather than the width

19390780
subtraction	add
my add months works but my subtraction formula isn t working and causing errors

19390781
daemons	systemd
like a stop or start an daemons or reload config of daemons but without use systemd or popen

19390782
min	max
i would recommend checking the min and max values and read the values back between them

19390807
memset	malloc
you read 12 bytes from the socket convert it to int and malloc that many bytes you store that into size and then you memset the message buffer just malloc ed for size 1024

19390815
google-chrome	firefox
i never had this trouble with canvas and i tested it with google-chrome and firefox same result

19390828
children	parent
- full_tree - dict with parent and children

19390862
google-chrome	safari
similarly it also must function equally well under safari and google-chrome which are living breathing browsers that upgrade themselves

19390878
put	get
it can get confused and the magic line above makes it work if you put it in enough in the right place

19390881
google-chrome	safari
editor s note about posters... in mozilla the border does not break past the bottom edges and displays as desired however in google-chrome and safari the bottom flows past the edge and i ve played with every margin scenario but cannot seem to get it to agree between browsers

19390897
cpu	processors
as alternative for computing the core frequency please refer to finding out the cpu clock frequency per core per processors in the answer there there is a recipe which does t rely on mperf msr register

19390932
migrate	upgrade
migrate that data to a new key so you don t upgrade again give away free stuff

19390977
autocomplete	typeahead
you might want to think about changing how typeahead works any further because you are trying to use autocomplete in a way that probably isn t that intuitive to a user

19391042
ubuntu	debian
running 3rd and 4th command on my debian 7.1 helps so i think the same can help on ubuntu as well

19391048
google-chrome	firefox
firefox extended this to support applying svg filters to html elements too but google-chrome has not yet implemented this

19391067
excel	listobject
i have an excel template which i am opening which has a pie chart bound to a table listobject and i want to insert rows into the table

19391071
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
the svg displays correctly google-chrome and safari but on firefox there are gaps in between the vertical repetitions of the pattern as shown below

19391154
post	get
only slight drawback since this is using the fields parameter you have to specify other fields of the post object you want to get as well â id and created_time are included by default as you can see but others as f.e

19391171
implements	extends
when looping through object properties it will try to look through the mutators defined under class.mutators - extends and implements -

19391171
implements	extends
it does not specifically pluck extends implements because it was built to be extendible and to allow you to add your own custom mutators eg

19391171
implements	extends
particularly things will break when implements is before extends as implements will actually .

19391202
folder	directory
instead i re-installed everything only to realise the the libraries were not in the install directory plugins folder

19391236
int	chars
the output from fgetc is either an unsigned chars value returned as an int or eof

19391245

every time i update my drupal website to amazon-web-services elastic beanstalk all files that were uploaded to public folder are lost

19391354
button	checkbox
but whenever i press the button i can only get true which is the original value of the checkbox thought i unchecked it

19391382
width	height
today i stumpled upon the same problem and i found the new relative unit vh css 3 very helpful in this case it works like percent but relative to the height of the viewport use vw for relative width

19391406
google-chrome	firefox
it is also proper browser behavior firefox is just stricter about it than google-chrome is

19391432
versioning	upgrade
you can look at that versioning and if it is from before the release of your update to free with iap you can choose to give the user the full functionality without the user needing to purchase the upgrade again

19391433
mousemove	mousedown
you can prevent the mousemove event if you are not in a mousedown event

19391444
google-chrome	firefox
but when i test in google-chrome or firefox the .parsexml does load xml

19391444
google-chrome	firefox
i don t understand why jquery is working in ie 8 and not google-chrome or firefox

19391495
button	checkbox	textarea	textbox
not to mention all the required questions textbox s dropdown s radio button checkbox and textarea s

19391498
hide	show
i was validating the mouse hover state within a second .hover method which it was redundant and buggy and confusing so i moved the settimeout cleartimeout functions within the first .hover method used to show hide the title on mouse hover

19391498
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
it seems to work consistently in firefox google-chrome opera safari and of course ie

19391510
google-chrome	safari
you can use css media queries to easily sniff out webkit browsers like google-chrome and safari

19391528
int	double
op may want to use double rather than int

19391536
bbedit	textpad
i know how to compile and run with terminal but it would be far more convenient to compile or run directly from bbedit like you can in textpad for windows

19391587
addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	addition
addition subtraction multiplication division the whole lot

19391590
maven	m2e
make sure your project is being managed by m2e as a maven project

19391601
jboss	weblogic
if a backend server java c# hosted on iis or weblogic or jboss or anykind is going to be required this server and the oracle server would be differents

19391609
pull	push
whenever i clone an existing git repo or push pull from remote using my ldap credentials i get the error

19391671
accelerometer	gyroscope
this is frequently done on software side - so linear acceleration orientation and gravity power consumption is usually the sum of the accelerometer s gyroscope s and probably also the magnetometer s consumption value

19391671
accelerometer	gyroscope
apparently the qualcomm linear acceleration sensor uses the accelerometer and the gyroscope to calculate the value while google s version also considers the magnetometer

19391685
opcache	apc
if you d really want to make it unreadable and inaccessible use apc or opcache

19391685
opcache	apc
of course as soon as you restart php apc opcache the server you d have to upload everything again execute each script to fill the cache again and delete everything

19391704
.htaccess	httpd.conf
enable mod_rewrite and .htaccess through httpd.conf and then put this code in your document_root .htaccess

19391746
google-chrome	firefox
in my experience google-chrome and firefox for desktop both work great with multiple sequenced .wav files embedded in audio tags

19391746
google-chrome	safari
unfortunately mobile safari seemed to be unhappy with more than one audio tag playing at once and google-chrome for android had similar limitations

19391747
setcontentview	findviewbyid
it has errors at the setcontentview and the findviewbyid lines

19391758
stdout	stderr
to redirect stdout and stderr to dev null thus discarding the standard output and standard error completely

19391783
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
currently google-chrome firefox safari ie10+

19391813
ng-app	ng-controller
we also have an ng-controller attribute on the html tag and i tried moving that to the body and leaving the ng-app attribute alone on the html tag but the result was the same

19391813
ng-app	ng-controller
the html tag still has the ng-app myapp attribute plus the ng-controller basecontroller attribute

19391818
post	get
webapi is going to give preference to your get and post tags first and foremost

19391818
post	get
it will always try to identify at that point with a rest verb in this case get and post which is what it displays

19391866
intersect	contains
however this query will return even polygons who doesn t contains area123 but also those who are inside those who intersect a bit etc

19391943
onclick	onchange
add onchange to your select rather than onclick to each option

19391966
post	get
if you had something like has_many users then you would indeed use the pluralized .users and you d get a collection of user objects in the same was as topics.posts gives you a collection post objects

19391977
range	max
then the correct subset of intervals would be 0 10 11 15 and 20 30 making the max non-overlapping total range equal to 10 + 4 + 10 34

19391981
fortran	ada
many languages have some kind of exponentiation operator r matlab basic latex and unix s bc use 3 2 ada cobol pl i python and fortran use 3 2

19391992
put	get
i have put this file under the same package but i get the error

19392019
completionhandler	nserror
api messagewithcompletionblock start count count filter image completionhandler customresponse output nserror error

19392068
int	chars
it stores chars not int

19392086
hide	show
jquery hide show

19392098
keydown	keyup
i want to use features such as closebrackets.js which are activated via keyboard events such as keydown keypress and keyup

19392155
implements	extends
they all extends the org.apache.commons.cli.parser and only implements the flatten method

19392173
packets	multicast
i have tried the following client code which works ok i can multicast a packets to it without the multicast socket timing out

19392173
multicastsocket	sockets
multicastsocket creates a multicast sockets bound a port selected at random by the host s underlying os bound to the wildcard address 0.0.0.0 all network cards

19392173
multicastsocket	sockets
multicastsocket int port creates a multicast sockets bound to a specific port but on every ip address

19392173
multicastsocket	sockets
multicastsocket socketaddress sa creates a multicast sockets bound to the specified ip address which could be any ip address even an invalid multicast address and port

19392173
packets	multicast
it would be perfectly feasible with this option to bind to the ip of a particular network interface however no multicast packets would be received because they would not be destined for the specific ip address of the network card which is why i never saw them arrive on the code example

19392173
packets	multicast
it is possible to also bind to a valid multicast address but in this scenario only specific packets whose destination matches the bound multicast address would arrive at the socket regardless of calls to joingroup

19392173
multicastsocket	sockets	packets	multicast
now the calls to joingroup do nothing to the sockets itself but issue an igmp request to the underlying network system to ensure that routers the os itself etc actually start routing the specified multicast packets up the hardware and through the network stack and finally to the java multicastsocket itself

19392199
children	parent
on the server side the createentity method of both parent and child entitysetcontrollers gets executed but the parent argument has an empty collection of children it ignores the content-id reference to the new child entity from the request

19392214
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
in the case of class files dataoutputstream datainputstream objectinputstream objectoutputstream and java.nio

19392220
strlen	strcmp
this will compile but it cannot be processed by some string functions strcmp strlen etc resulting in run-time errors

19392236
jar	war
i have a system consisting of multiple web applications war and libraries jar

19392254
fgets	getline
out of interest i would prefer using fgets because getline is not in a standard c library

19392281
postgresql	mysql
note apparently sql server does not have a limit clause like that which you find in oracle mysql postgresql sqlite...etc etc

19392357
children	parent
select the children within the parent container with a wildcard

19392376
put	get
if you recommend me using a hyperlinkbutton instead do you have an example if i put one in i get the following error

19392377
punctuation	words
the match is in the group named words - the entire expression matches the final words and optional whitespace some punctuation

19392377
punctuation	words
any trailing whitespace punctuation will not be part of the words group

19392411
mutators	setter
mutators generally means the same things as setter

19392411
mutators	setter
and a mutators or setter would be

19392425
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
learn about inherited to understand superclass and subclassing relationship

19392436
children	parent
i am trying to add a child entity to a parent s children navigation property but calling savechanges afterwards has no effect at all

19392463
mutators	setter
we use setter and mutators as interchangeably

19392463
mutators	setter
below are some examples of mutators or setter

19392484
hide	show
since you are using jquery to manipulate the show and hide after the dom has loaded jquery doesn t know those elements exist

19392537
post	get
get and post add option

19392538
int	chars
the same thing would occur if you used an int pointer and a chars pointer -- since they have different sizes adding one to the same address will give you different addresses

19392580
google-chrome	firefox
the same page works perfectly in google-chrome and firefox

19392594
google-chrome	firefox
i want to avoid instancing a selenium object and raise a firefox google-chrome process just to get the redirected url

19392600
post	get
it is hard to tell from your description which routes you actually need but if you are submitting a form you most likely just want a get route for initially loading the form and a post route as a location for the form data to be sent do

19392630
post	get
a get request is different from a post request

19392663
min	max
so for example if you want one row per name number but have various values for status startdate enddate then you will need to say something like min status min startdate max enddate

19392675
installation	upgrade
my installation of gae told me i should upgrade

19392714
moq	typemock
you should consider using one of the mocking frameworks out there moq typemock etc.

19392763
keydown	keyup
in resume you need to use the keydown and keyup events

19392870
put	get
i am trying to get data from a class registration information and put it into an xml file

19392968
put	get
i am don t know how to get the program to put the information in to the other file

19393003
range	max	range	min	min	max
i want the y-axis range to go from min mdata value to max mdata value with an interval of 10000

19393053
post	get
but i have a problem in filter its post by date get all post by a specified date

19393054
viewdidload	viewwillappear
from viewdidload and add the following to viewwillappear

19393068
width	height
use w h for width height etc

19393069
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this problem doesn t occur in ie11 and firefox but is present in opera and google-chrome

19393074
ng-view	ng-app
solved my moving ng-app to body instead of head and got rid of div ng-view

19393119
children	parent
i need to sort this list so that no children ever precede their parent in the list can use xslt 2.0

19393121
put	get
it all works except when i try to get the name with getname and draw it always prints the last collection put into the array

19393128
int	double
the first class i have accepts 8 parameters string string abbrev string int int int int int double

19393130
hash	md5
like other answers you should also use md5 in where clause and need to add full data comparision to account for the possible collisions of hash

19393139
fadein	fadeout
the problem is the pause between the last div s fadeout and the fadein for all of them is 15 seconds three times as long as it takes each div to leave

19393142
post	get
i am trying to get my app to pull all post created on a specific date

19393161
submit	submission
by the time the submit event has fired it s too late to prevent the form from submission

19393161
submit	submission
you should bind to the click event on the submit button and use event.preventdefault to stop it from submission

19393163
firefox	safari
interestingly i don t encounter the same warning in firefox or safari even though as far i can tell they are using the same phishing database although in safari preferences it says google safe browsing service is unavailable

19393187
viewdidload	viewdidappear
bool isfirsttime make sure to set it to yes in your viewdidload and pass it to setnavigationbarhidden in viewdidappear

19393198
hide	show
your app looks at what choices the user has made does some logic to determine which choices to show the user next hide the part of the dom containing the current page s choices and reveals a part of the dom containing the correct choices creating the illusion of showing the next page

19393199
hash	md5
you can take advantage of hash index by storing the md5 values of interested column and create hash index on that column and also search by that hash value

19393207
google-chrome	safari
try this right here from safari or google-chrome or what have you in the inspector s js console

19393261
next	except
as the viewport scrolls the next items are realized this is why you cant use smooth scrolling with virtualization except for .net4.5 where pixel scrolling was added

19393264
width	margin
why not just have a max-width of 1170px or so with 20px of margin on each side or something so that as you resize your browser window the container width scales smoothly instead of having a big jump

19393264
width	margin
at 992px screen width i have only very little margin on each side 11px

19393272
division	multiplication
element-wise multiplication and division . not the matrix versions

19393282
width	height
so i know the original x y width height rotation angle new bounds rotatedwidth rotatedheight and the pivot x y relating to original object

19393294
min	max
at the moment i am using random rand min max

19393297
hide	show
any ideas on how to go about creating it are welcome but i m sure it will involve divs jquery to show hide and css for borders items

19393343
mockito	jmockit
i used to rely on mockito until today i have a final class with some static methods so i ve to switched to jmockit

19393356
hash	md5
the index you created is perhaps best described as a b-tree index of the md5 hash of the three columns rather than an md5 index of three columns

19393356
hash	md5
in order for postgresql to use the index your query must be for md5 hash

19393390
appfog	cloudfoundry
appfog and cloudfoundry support auto-reconfiguration for node.js applications

19393433
requestfactory	gwt
if that isn t happening sounds like a bug in gwtp or possibly requestfactory though that seems less likely since it is part of gwt

19393473
getter	setter
the reason you might want to use the first is if you need to do something more complicated in the getter setter

19393546
width	height
so as you can see without being hovered the box width is 100 height of 80

19393546
width	height
when hovered it is 225 height 100 width

19393550
backbone.js	zepto
im using jquery or zepto and backbone.js

19393572
width	height
while you can use an img tag with just src and alt values you should really also specify width and height or it can slow down the rendering of the html page either waiting for the image to load before layout or recalaulting layout when images are loaded depending on the browser and other factors

19393572
width	height
since cloudinary knows the original image dimensions and the algorithm used to generate the resized image it makes sense that the final width and height of a resized image are possible to detect but i can t work out how to do so using any of the libraries available

19393579
put	get
if you really want to get the value including the variable then put your values in an array put it in json and parse it in your jquery

19393592
post	get
you may try this get the last post by category name ad then get the featured image using it s id

19393618
post	get
first of all i would get the postid using the get recent post function

19393618
post	get
this will allow you to get the post id

19393651
nsstring	nsdata
transforming nsdata to nsstring reviled that the result is html

19393656
google-chrome	safari
i tested in google-chrome and safari with no luck

19393731
glut	glew
just trying to draw a point using glut and glew for opengl version 4.3

19393737
pop-up	dialog
this will work to pop-up the dialog once or twice but then fails from then onward without an error

19393744

put	get
you can put it on the ul if you get rid of the width on it

you are using find on children instead you can use just find .good on parent unless you want to specifically avoid finding any .good which is directly under

19405664
post	get
also you can get the category of a post using the built-in wordpress function

19405713

just add a width to your container div so the margin s know where to start and stop the centering

19405878
post	get
there is a good tip in the how to get only modified items from wpf data grid post here but i prefer to use a duplicate collection and just compare them to find the changed elements you d need to implement the equals method for this to work

19405901

it takes some extra time to create the class with right extra decoration then framework will push pull xml to pojo

19406153
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
tested in ie8 ie10 firefox google-chrome safari

19406208
margin	height
do the same with the height to find the top margin then simply scroll your div to that position using jquery s scrolltop and scrollleft

19406229
children	parent
one solution would be for the children to require the parent directive and for the parent to optionally require the parent directive

19406232
addition	multiplication
i assume that is parsed correctly because the two operators have different precedences meaning that associativity does not come into play and that your grammar correctly implements precedence although you should note that is a more standard example for showing that multiplication has higher precedence than addition since simple left-to-right parsing of gives the same result as your parser

19406232
associativity	operator-precedence
grammar-based solutions to operator-precedence and associativity are often pretty nasty see a grammar for python for evidence so you may want to check out top down operator-precedence parsing for a more flexible and expressive alternative

19406247
hash	md5
md5 hash looks like a23b34c45d56a23b34c45d56a23b34c4 and you can t distinguish it from myrealreallooooongpassword111222

19406266
fadein	fadeout
you could use the fadein and fadeout with a interval in ms

19406269
fadein	fadeout
use fadeout and fadein jquery functions and pass the number of milliseconds as first argument

19406280
octal	hex
printf will still do the padding but also convert your string to hex octal format

19406281
setinterval	settimeout
you can use settimeout in place of setinterval like this -

19406319
ienumerable	ilist
but one is often better off working with the ienumerable rather than ilist as the linq above is lazily evaluated it doesn t actually do all of the work until the enumerable is iterated

one with nsurlsession for ios 7 and one with nsurlconnection for ios 6

19406428

opera	firefox
this will work in webkit-browsers in firefox or opera bart will be too big

19406527
width	height
the problem is image-container can grow larger than the image in either height or width and i don t know of a way in css to find out which it is thus i have no way to consistently place scale the navigation-link s in respect to their parent div

19406527
width	height	opera	firefox
firefox and opera set max-height and max-width to auto if the parent element doesn t have height and width set

19406582
nsurlconnection	nsurlsession
if you can t use nsurlsession because it s only supported in ios 7 and you can get the same functionality using nsurlconnection which works in both then just use nsurlconnection

internationalization	localization
i have implemented the normal rails process for localization internationalization

19407157
width	height
working backwards the outermost div with the style attributes hard-coded for height and width 100px appears to have a computed style that i would expect

19407157
width	height
we can see 100px for height and width

19407157
width	height
we see 100px for height and width

19407157
width	height
the div with class parent appears to lose all width and height information from it s content and so the user sees nothing in the browser as the size for these div s essentially becomes 0px and the content is hidden

19407157
width	height	children	parent
the question i have is why does the width and height not get inherited from the children of the div element with the parent style class

19407181
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i did modify the bootstrap css to only have styles needed to make modal work and it works fine on google-chrome safari firefox ie 9 10 just not 8

19407201

aoldvalues then in a loops do a continous inireadsection to populate anewvalues loops over each of them with for-loop compare aoldvalues to anewvalues and do something on change

i need to include both width and height because it s a single-page site meant to fit the viewport only no scrolling down and the elements need to be appropriately placed on the screen

the website is working fine in google-chrome firefox safari opera and ie10 but in older ie versions like ie9 it looks very strange

19407521
width	height
you can bind on mousemove event and compare cursor position with window width and height

19407525
width	height
a work around would be to get the height width of the screen and do some simple maths to calculate 80 of the screen

19407525
width	height
you can get the width and height like this

19407531
packets	multicast
ip multicast gives you the ability to send a single packets which is picked up by multiple interfaces if they are subscribed to that multicast

google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
i am developing a system with javascript which i want to let it work only on common web browsers like ie9 firefox google-chrome safari opera ...

19407553
try-catch	exception-handling
another important point about this exception-handling is that it is a checked exception-handling and you need to provide explicitly exception-handling handling while using methods which can possibly throw classnotfoundexception in java either by using try-catch block or by using throws clause

19407581
hash	md5
from what i can tell tls 1.1 requires the contents of the certificateverify message to be a digitally signed value using the concatenation of two hash algorithms md5 and sha1

19407639
int	double
you should use int cents not double dollars to keep precise decimal rounding

19407640

19407718
children	parent
i would suggest splitting your query in two separate ctes - one for parent one for children and than joining them at the end

19407718
children	parent
in your idea - you are running into infinite loop because when second union part for children is applied to first union part found parent you get the original value again

19407740
profiling	debugging
you can debugging via usb with flash builder as long as you have the device s udid included in your development provisioning profiling

as to the other aspect of your question it seems likely that you want to use floating-point and not integer division

19408206

in portrait mode would be fine but in landscape the button disappears

with regards to your second question you can t send complex objects over get requests as there s no request body to hold the values you will need to use a post method to do this

19408301
post	get
so i was thinking to instantiate them upon initial request to any post or get method

19408362
post	put
by definition a complex type expects a post create or a put update

19408375
width	height
i m trying to use jquery s toggleclass to click on a div and have that div expand to a height and width of 100 in other words full screen

19408375
width	height
the following code toggles to 100 height and width but it doesn t toggle back to the original size

19408386
google-chrome	firefox
you should use watir-webdriver instead which can control google-chrome firefox and others

19408397
for-loop	if-statement
note that the for-loop can unravel to three sequential if-statement

19408409
google-chrome	firefox
the following code prevented me from pressing back on google-chrome and firefox

19408568
for-loop	arrays
in the following code i have called to open the file successfully now i just need help in figuring out how to pull the data that is stored in two separate columns one for city one for zip code and store them in two arrays to be acted upon by the for-loop

19408576
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
this is an ie specific property and is not supported by other browsers like firefox google-chrome opera and safari

19408652
ng-include	ng-controller
ng-include can t be on the same element as ng-controller

19408704
ssl	https
i have an issue where the following rule works without ssl however when i change to https the rule doesn t work at all

19408706
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i ve tested in google-chrome ie9 safari firefox and node

19408751
google-chrome	firefox
tested on google-chrome and firefox

19408756
inherited	properties
however my properties are within inherited into t as a base class

19408760
inherited	properties
i would suggest rather than simply using entity classes as your model you look into creating composite models which contain the properties you require i typically implement common functionality within a base view model and inherited from that

19408776
hide	show
when the user resizes the browser down to the size of a phone viewport and the columns collapse down into one column i d like to hide the column headers and instead show labels next to each field for each row

19408789
ng-include	ng-controller
it seems to have to do with you mixing 2 things on the same tag - it has both ng-include and ng-controller on it

19408798
int	chars
endianess becomes an issue primarily when you have for example an int you ve received over a network connection as an array of chars s

19408798
put	get
in such a case you have to put those char s back together in the right order to get the original value

19408820
serializable	deserialization
with a dictionary of 100k entries with an array of 4k integers each serializable takes 14 seconds and deserialization 10 seconds and the resulting file is 1.6gb

19408832
width	height
the rectangles are supposed to have a fixed height and width as well so when you click on a specific area it will draw a 10 x 10 rectangle and it will remember all the other rectangles already drawn and keep them drawn in the same place and also how do i paint it the arraylist if there is one

19408832
implements	extends
public class game extends canvas implements runnable

19408870
mdpi	hdpi
according to the documentation android os will assume your dimens.xml is created for mdpi and scale accordingly for hdpi xhdpi etc.

19408870
mdpi	hdpi
however whenever i remove the values-hdpi folder from the project to allow android os to scale it up to hdpi the sgs4 just runs mdpi values

19408895
qmainwindow	qwidget
setwindowtitle is not applicable as my ui is a qmainwindow not a qwidget

19408929
mouseover	mouseenter
mouseover fires whenever the mouseenter or leaves child element while mouseenter fires only when the mouseenter the dom element two which the event is bound

19408929
mouseover	mouseenter
we see here that the mouseenter and mouseover events are both behaving badly or at least not like the well-behaved jquery versions and that click isn t firing at all

19408931
gridview	formview
but it is not limited to formview and gridview

19408950
width	height
the center could either be a repeating image or just the background color in width the height of your image

19408966
folder	directory
because a user can change the program files path in enviroment variables or he she may make a directory program files x86 in c i will not use the detection of the folder but the enviroment path of program files x86 with the variable in windows registry

19409007
inherited	properties
however my properties are within inherited into t as a base class

19409010
post	get
i am trying to get a detail view attached to it that would show the detail view the post clicked on

19409018
mdpi	hdpi
is created for mdpi and scale accordingly for hdpi xhdpi etc.

19409025
stdout	stderr
i m working with subprocess package to call some external console commands from a python script and i need to pass file handlers to it to get stdout and stderr back separately

19409031
int	double
you should however probably be using double literals instead of int literals 32010.0 instead of 32010 - or better yet double constants

19409105
put	preflight
before my code makes the put request it sends the cors preflight options request first as you can see from the capture above

19409155
concurrenthashmap	blockingqueue
or collections.synchronizedmap map c and we can also use java concurrent api like concurrenthashmap or arrayqueue or blockingqueue

19409156
apache	nginx
usually you ll have a connection pool from your application server apache nginx etc. to your database

19409203
width	height
note that the cordova 3.1 documentation states ios 7 issues remove the values width device-width height device-height from your meta tag viewport attribute

19409207
gridview	rowdatabound
everything has been working fine until i placed the following code in my gridview rowdatabound or databound event

19409263
google-chrome	firefox
i ve been testing it in firefox google-chrome and ie since those are what are used on campus

19409290
folder	directory
my folder in the directory are and should be displayed like

19409296
post	put
on 3 buttons at the end of each of my post page i would like to put a hover color when people are clicking on one of them

19409299
post	get
particular for http methods other than get or for post usage with

19409316
bash	zsh
the following should work for sh bash ksh and zsh

19409355
disk	ram
beware that this approach may cause problems with large files because each file is read completely into the ram before they re processed and written back to disk

19409357
folder	directory
for a ui black box test i need to verify a certain ui interaction which results the opening of a certain directory via process.start some folder

19409380
express	node.js
use regular express routing for an example please see group rule-based authorization approach in node.js and express.js

19409382
doc	rtf
with the way it s coded right now i think it s opening a new instance of word opening the rtf txt document in word saving as a word doc and repeating

19409408
uicollectionviewcell	uipangesturerecognizer
i created a uipangesturerecognizer in a uicollectionviewcell subclass

19409438
min	max
basically it generates a number between the min and max

19409442
ddms	adt
i opened ddms by opening adt - perspective - ddms

19409442
ddms	hprof	profiling	debugging
in the ddms i find my device got recognized and online as well.however the debugging update heap dump hprof file cause gc update thread start method profiling stop process etc everything got disabled

19409475
pull	push
you have to think the other way around which information should maven push to for my test instead of how can i pull information from maven

19409493
temporary	tablespace
temporary tablespace is used mostly for sorting and hashing data

19409493
temporary	tablespace
for example if you are sorting or hash-joining a 50gb table you will need about 50gb of temporary tablespace

19409493
sorting	filtering
some things to look for are merge join cartesian or perhaps if there are some filtering that are applied after hashing or sorting instead of before

19409497
int	chars
the int 1 is not equal the chars 1

19409500
post	get
this will work for both get and post

19409507
subtract	add
i would like to to rapidly add when left button is held and rapidly subtract when right button is held

19409526
syntastic	youcompleteme
i am using vim with the plugins youcompleteme and syntastic for autocompletion and syntax checking

19409548
put	get
the concurrent way 100 threads get their value immediately none is put on hold

19409550
rank	percentile
i m trying to write a percentile rank function in r but am running into trouble with the rank and length commands due to missing values in the vectors

19409586
width	height
maybe it s the size of the text it contains or the total height of the controls for the current width whatever

19409595
put	get
i wish to get the last number from each line and put the modified back in

19409605
gif	png
i ve a script that converts a ppt file to a folder of images jpg png gif but they re static images

19409618
min	max
this will stop the windows headers from trying to define the min and max macros

19409634
try-catch	exception-handling
the tryraising extensions just wrap the delegates in a try-catch and logs any exception-handling while they do not re-throw it isn t part of normal program flow for them to be responsible for catching exception-handling

19409644
range	max	range	min	min	max
when this location is found 5 rows are inserted and in those rows the stdevp min max and average are calculated over the range of that block of data

19409647
width	height
in the actionscript is method getrect and getbounds which returns the minx miny width and height of the object

19409647
width	height
if shape is polygon then all coordinates x y are 0 also width and height are 0

19409647
width	height
i was expecting that x 100 y 100 width 100 height 100

19409647
width	height
if shape is text then i get x y of the shape and correct width and height - which is ok unless shape is rotated

19409650
typedef	struct
the thing is that there are many typedef for struct and callbacks in the header file but it is not complaining about them in the wrapper file only about the functions

19409677
folder	directory
so because the icons are in images folder on their server images ui-icons_cd0a0a_256x240.png you should create a similar folder called images in the same directory you have your css so in your case it would be styles

19409696
cpu	processors
1 - the cpu goes to a privileged mode further hardware interrupts are disabled normally a bit in the processors flags register and execution jumps to the interrupt handler

19409735
hash	md5
we had this problem last week - the problem is that your assets will be compiled to have md5 hash on them whilst your standard css will still be looking for their standard names

19409749
apache	nginx
setting up a proxy with apache nginx

19409763

19409772
qmainwindow	qwidget
qmainwindow has a setwindowtitle the same as qwidget because it is one see this question

19409855
for-loop	arrays
although this sort of nested for-loop is in-efficient and surely unavoidable the time required to create this arrays is very low

19409860
google-chrome	firefox
need use javascript get a asp.net label text below javascript works fine for ie and google-chrome but not firefox how to make it work for all browsers

19409882
mouseleave	mouseenter
for me the mouseenter and mouseleave events fire so i can handle them

19409902
int	chars
unfortunately for you the chars you passed in can be converted to an int 44 and there aren t 45 or more chars in your string hence the stringindexoutofboundsexception

19409903
charat	indexof
you should use indexof rather than charat

19409916
min	max
i would choose one of the other treatment options average min or max

19409931
nexus	artifactory
if you argument that an internet access does not exist you should start using a repository manager like artifactory nexus or archiva which is installed within the local network and only the repository manager needs the internet connection

19409962
width	height
see my code and explanation here in that code i do the same thing from the opposite end as it were i give the label a fixed width constraint but a flexible height constraint and by setting its own height the label brings the top of its text up against the top of itself and thus is able to display the text correctly

19410066
portrait	landscape
i wasn t able to access the launchimage files in images.xcassets so i created two new image sets background portrait and background landscape since there seems to be no way to put landscape and portrait images into the same set

19410084
getter	setter
on that class instance i can t get the fieldinfo for those members that have automatically generated getter setter int i above

19410106
realloc	malloc
i saw a solution where he recommended using malloc and realloc for each character taken as input but i think there s an easier way and then i found someone suggesting using

19410123
min	max
this would be relatively easy if i only cared about a single min and max for each group the problem is my requirement is to find the various boundaries

19410169
mousedown	mouseenter	mouseup	mousedown	mouseup	mouseenter
this also prevents the click event from firing because clicking down triggers a mouseenter after the mousedown and so when you have a mouseup event it s on a different element from when you clicked down

19410191
post	get
to get post like spotify you ll need to use the builtin music.listens action as documented here

19410263
google-chrome	firefox
quite recently within the last month something changed within google-chrome s and firefox s security settings such that it no longer runs this script automatically

19410272
fgets	getline
as others suggested you can use getline or fgets and see example

19410285
dictionary	map
depending on how many rows are being searched and how many lookups you re running and whether id s can be repeated in the lookup range there are a few other options such as eg creating a map of the lookup data using a dictionary or using match

19410285
dictionary	map
match beats the dictionary collection approaches for 100 lookups but the dictionary and collection approaches scale better for larger numbers of lookups since the map overhead is dependent only on the size of the lookup range and each lookup operation is very fast

19410294
integer	unsigned
ack_so len is an 8-bit unsigned integer which has a value range of 0-255 so 500 will overflow that value giving you 244

19410301
maven	pom.xml
do notice that if you are using maven the problem might be happening because of settings in pom.xml so you will need to change it so you wouldn t have to edit project properties every time

19410320
treeviewitem	datagrid
i created a style for treeviewitem that contains datagrid with controls bound to the items in the observablecollection

19410348
for-loop	loops
i am trying to get input from user with a for-loop but for example if user enters 2 as a noofsubpattern loops does not wait for the second input

19410355
min	max
using this information you could then group by rungroup and select the groupidentifier and min max boundarycolumn

19410399
lisp	scheme
this has nothing to do with functions i think the common lisp standard does not use the term procedures as the scheme standards do. being first class objects

19410445
google-chrome	firefox
modern browsers firefox 17 above google-chrome pick up the dom element with the given id automatically

19410450
google-chrome	firefox
i have map with multiple polygons it works just fine on firefox and google-chrome but not on ie

19410455
google-chrome	firefox
i ve also noticed that firefox asks if i allow page to use offline storage when google-chrome chromium doesn t

19410461
uitapgesturerecognizer	uigesturerecognizer
the way i thought to do this was to use 2 uigesturerecognizer s - a uitapgesturerecognizer and a uilongpressgesturerecognizer

19410470
kerberos	ntlm
turns out i needed to set the authentication type to ntlm rather than kerberos for the network in question but the main reason for the error is that there is a problem in versions 2 3 and 3.5 of the framework

19410485
equals	compareto
you should use the compareto method instead of equals when you care only about the number value

19410500
int	boolean
i create a hashmap will boolean and a hashmap with int

19410500
int	boolean
now i want a method to check and see if the values are empty all boolean are false and all int are 0

19410522
post	get
when logged in as admin get_posts seems to return all the post but when logged in as retailer role i created i only get the post that the logged in user created

19410569
spaces	delimiter
when you use runtime.exec string command the string is parsed using white spaces as the delimiter

19410572
post	get
when sending get post methods cross domain a preflighted requests is first send by options method

19410576
folder	directory
i opened xcode and renamed the project folder in the virtual directory

19410602
ng-switch	ng-include
ng-if ng-repeat ng-switch and ng-include all create child scopes

19410602
inherited	properties
since you are only setting a properties on an object and not a value directly on the scope it will use the parent scope s inherited object and update the value

19410608
cdr	cons
oh and i haven t changed all the car cdr and cons to our abstracted equals setfirst etc i will

19410623
put	get
i have put a breakpoint on the first line where it starts with str and the thing is that this event does not get triggered

19410703
rubygems	rvm
it looks like your rvm and rubygems environments are set up ok

19410705
width	height	min	max
kinetic.polygon does not automatically calculate min max or width height

19410705
width	height	min	max
the boundingbox was defined using min max width height properties that were added to the polygon

19410705
width	height	min	max
first this code returns min max width height when given mypolygon.getpoints

19410705
width	height
you can add properties to your kinetic polygon to get width and height

19410705
min	max
line which is really a polyline same solution as polygon get min max of all points

19410705
min	max
curves spline blob can be approximated by getting min max of all blob.getpoints

19410705
min	max
a more exact bounding box for curves is possible by plotting many points along the curve and finding their min max

19410737
mocha	node.js
i am writing unit tests for my node.js application using mocha

19410756
touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchesended
another approach altogether would be creating your own gesture recognizer subclass where you would handle touchesbegan touchesmoved touchesended methods to suit your needs

19410770
int	double
on the x64 jitter the string version returns the value with the rax register like any returned pointer value the int version returns with the eax register the double version returns with the xmm0 register

19410798
opera	google-chrome
on my 2013 nexus7 skrollr has no effect on opera and google-chrome

19410798
google-chrome	firefox
in desktop firefox and google-chrome it works fine

19410835
children	parent
as per your comment this can be amended easily to get a count of the parent and children

19410868
put	get
i know i can t just put two items into the but i can t figure out a way to get this done

19410874
getter	setter
is better to treat the attributes as public instead of using getter and setter

19410902
folder	directory
i have a directory containing a few hundred folder

19410920
gson	jackson
my preferred approach is to use gson but there s also jackson

19410964
width	height
within the instream-foreign -object i am assigning the svg width height to the values from the actual chart svg

19410968
int	boolean
java automatically converts between boolean boolean and int int

19410975
yacc	bison
read the bison yacc documentation and look at union or yystype

19410995
jar	war
i can explore inside the war and see that web-inf lib does not contain the jar in which both of the above classes reside grails-plugin-testing-2.2.4.jar

19410995
jar	war
the war still did not contain that jar and i got the same error

19410995
put	get
so i just put grails-plugin-testing-2.2.4.jar into the web-inf lib folder on the server and re-deployed and verified that the error above goes away but now i get another error on the server

19411010
webkit	blink
if you need to deal with parsing then you re going to be using a different html renderer such as webkit or blink

19411010
webkit	blink
there are a few frameworks for building native apps that use the webkit or blink renderer

19411015
hash	salt
during initial sign-up the ion auth code translates the user s password into a salt hash value but this won t work for the api calls which require their in-the-clear password for authorization

19411016
submit	submission
you can add onclick event handler to the submit button and include there all the javascript you need to perform before submission

19411052
post	get
use post as the method not get

19411068
width	height
this element by default is a block element and that will push the second button down according to it s width or height

19411081
button	checkbox
there is a button on the page and when it is pressed javascript creates a new checkbox with the same formatting as the one created in php

19411123
min	max
like it or not constructing a numericrangequery where min max is indeed the correct approach

19411125
draggable	droppable
in html i have a list of 10 draggable div s called piles and another list of 10 droppable div s called stacks

19411134
post	get
i tested this out and saw that using this method during a post request creates a trace very similar to the ones i ve been capturing when this issue has been happening but session does still get cleaned up properly

19411169
put	get
but i only get 10.169.130.48 not the string out put

19411178
put	get
you can even put that into your service manager s services and get it

19411186
rss	feed
i have an rss feed with the following structure

19411200
versioning	upgrade
we ve just upgrade to the npm versioning of jslint in windows and our ci won t fail on jslint failures anymore

19411201
identifier	ambiguous
part of the reason why cst is a bad choice for a time zone identifier is that time zone abbreviations can be ambiguous

19411241
width	height
don t forget that when using layout weights you need to specify 0dip for the width height depending on the orientation of the linearlayout

19411257
google-chrome	firefox
testing with firefox ie google-chrome shows that currently only firefox implemens and only when the select element is â œopenâ either focused so that the option list is opened or has a size attribute with a value larger than 1

19411261
put	get
i am able to put this code together to get player duration current time and to derive a value which i use to update the progress bar width

19411307
sudo	passwd
i would like to sudo on remote host but don t like idea of having plain passwd on command line like in code above

19411314
width	height
without fixing any height header footer or width left column

19411314
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
this is a totally responsive design and work well with all browsers ie10 firefox google-chrome safari opera mobile browsers

19411314
google-chrome	firefox
here s a working fiddle only firefox google-chrome ie10

19411339
children	parent
i have a function which checks the children on a tree given the parent id

19411341
lan	intranet
if it is going to be used inside a lan you can just create a intranet and run your webapp there

19411395
umbraco	examine
if you are looking for a general way of matching similar words this is often called fuzzy search and can quite easily be done with umbraco and examine

19411432
integer	unsigned
uint defines an unsigned integer

19411432
integer	unsigned
uint value width allows you to define literals with values greater than 1-bit so from your example uint 0 max.getwidth creates an unsigned integer with max.getwidth bits holding the value 0

19411480
inherited	properties
therefore the derived function will inherited all properties from the base function

19411538
google-chrome	firefox
i am currently try to migrate a google-chrome extension to firefox

19411563
express	node.js
you can think of express as a utility belt for creating web applications with node.js

19411563
express	node.js
generally speaking sinatra is to ruby as express is to node.js

19411568
versioning	upgrade
what i am facing is i have llvm versioning 3.4svn installed on my ubuntu system and there is no cbackend.cpp file in this versioning as the file has been upgrade to cppbackend.cpp which converts llvm-ir to c++

19411586
google-chrome	firefox
note this does not work on firefox and ie but works on google-chrome

19411632

i ve been trying to create a container view controller which provides some overlaid views like uinavigationcontroller and uitabbarcontroller do for view controllers in ios 7

19411676
put	get
i ve put together a quick example at but there i was not able to even get the accessors called

19411710
post	put
guessing from the irb tag that you put on your post you want to help people using your code

19411740
google-chrome	firefox
on firefox and google-chrome everything works as planned

19411780
for-loop	loops
first you should use a for-loop instead of a while loops

19411788
google-chrome	firefox
i have tested it with jquery 2.0.3 and the browsers where firefox and google-chrome

19411864
inherited	properties
the children of the #works div will inherited it s text-align properties

19411871
ant	maven
in the meanwhile i would suggest you to go through the below link where you can do the same with a build tool like ant or maven

19411872
put	get	viewdidload	viewwillappear
it doesn t matter if i put the view in the storyboard or do it programaticaly in viewdidload or viewwillappear or if i put it in at a higher point in the story board and then move it to the back programatically i get the same result the scroll does not adjusts for the bars

19411900
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
works great in firefox safari but not in google-chrome not sure about ie

19411903
addclass	removeclass
not sure if i can do that because i m using addclass and removeclass but if there is a way with doing it all differently then i d love to know how

19411904
accessor	properties
i guess you are using properties as collection accessor in your mapping if so the behavior you describe is the expected one when your code tries to modify the collection

19411904
accessor	properties
if you want to use that pattern in your domain model you should change collection accessor to field with the appropriate naming strategy in order to tell nhibernate to set the backing field _employees and not the properties employees

19411910
uilabel	uitextview
i have a simple view controller that displays an uitextview and an uilabel

19411993
jtextfield	jpasswordfield
in addition take a look at creating a gui with swing things like jdialog jtextfield and jpasswordfield would all be worth looking into

19412014
google-chrome	firefox
it works well in google-chrome but it doesn t work in firefox or ie

19412014
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome it gives me the id of the element i m hovering with the cursor but i get nothing in ie or firefox

19412024
getter	setter
you can make constructors for the pieces you have and or do setter getter

19412143
pthreads	fork
1 i am assuming that by multiprocess you mean splitting up one program into multiple processes which is usually done with the fork method in pthreads systems as opposed to multitasking

19412143
cpu	processors
multicore means that a single cpu can have more than one core capable of executing tasks and has all execution units connected in some way depending on the architecture of the processors

19412148

currently i am using myfaces 2.1.12 primefaces 4.0 and omnifaces 1.5

19412213
rss	feed

19412213
rss	feed
i also tried mirroring this rss feed in google feedburner

19412218
mouseleave	mouseenter
if the mouseenter and mouseleave events are purely for stylistic reasons i recommend using css and hover instead

19412236
google-chrome	firefox
however hover is still a semi-flighty beast and depending on the order in which events are resolved it s quite possible that you only see it in google-chrome because it fires off the events differently than firefox and ie

19412271
width	height
i have fixed size of image let s say 300 width x200 height

19412315
floor	sqrt
therefore the result of not less than the mathematical value of floor sqrt n

19412315
int	double
for ieee-754 64-bit binary hereafter double all int up to 2 53 are representable

19412315
int	double
of course many int that large are not exactly representable in double anyway so you cannot pass them to sqrt in the first place

19412328
hive	hdfs	namenode	hdfs
i installed the cloudera cdh4 distribution on a single machine in pseudo-distributed mode and successfully tested that it was working correctly can run mapreduce programs insert data on the hive server etc. however if i chance the core-site.xml file to have fs.default.name set to machine name rather than localhost and restart the namenode service the hdfs enters safe-mode

19412328
namenode	hdfs
however if i try to read a file using hadoop fs -cat or try to place a file in the hdfs i am told the namenode is in safemode

19412370

i found it very useful in canceling out of a scroll at the very first drag move when the user is dragging in a forbidden direction

19412439
move	drag
i found it very useful in canceling out of a scroll at the very first drag move when the user is dragging in a forbidden direction

19412461
children	parent
then we can insert on child table so the only possible scenario is one-to-many first parent then children

19412494
put	get
i think the normal thing to do is to cook up that url and then rather than put in a document with an tag in order for someone to click on it actually launch an http get to that url directly from your program using whatever http library you like

19412525
jar	war
make sure to download a correct mysql jar and place it in your tomcat s lib directory or alternatively your war s web-inf lib

capistrano	bundler
oh and if you don t wanna use bundler as of yet remove the first line require bundler capistrano

19412615
int	double
that choice is made at compile time and has nothing to do with the values at execution time - the jvm doesn t decide to promote values to double because they overflow the bounds of int

19412680
folder	directory
initiate the key bindings on a open file f10 to open the directory you have set as the project folder ctrl+f10 to open the folder of the current file.

19412726
width	height
you may prefer background-size contain which fits the background image into its container rather than attempting to cover both width and height of the container

19412789
for-loop	arrays
next when you enter your for-loop you assign 1 to i which will allow you to enter into the if condition at the end of guess which will try to access element but this cannot exist because the arrays is of size zero

19413027
rss	feed
the first thing i would try is to limit the feed returned by the source maybe your rss query provider supports any argument for limiting the content by date id

add box-sizing border-box to #summary so that you can set both width 100 and left and right padding without the contents spilling over into the container

basically when dill serializable an interactively defined function it uses some name mangling on __main__ on both the serializable and deserialization side that makes __main__ a valid module

19414069
pickle	dill

.htaccess	httpd.conf
enable mod_rewrite and .htaccess through httpd.conf and then put this code in your document_root .htaccess

the biggest difference between the two frameworks is the persistent model in nhibernate objects are transient persistent or detached from the isession

19428402
persistent	transient
a transient object is made persistent using the isession s save method

19428416
width	height
using display inline fixes the width but results in false vertical size height

19428423
width	height
i used a combination of css and jquery along with hints on this page to create a fluid width and height using bootstrap 3

19428476

our portal runs on a secure server with https ssl

19428565
onclicklistener	ontouchevent
mdetailview gets events in his ontouchevent but does not fire onclicklistener properly but gesturedetector for example works fine

19428606
put	get
you could in theory get the mean or the mode of each of these distributions and put them into an image but vision.foregrounddetector does not provide this ability

19428648

anyway i would like to know the best practice in mvvm to save global values in concrete i m using caliburn.micro framework that can be accessed for all the viewmodel

19428656
spaces	delimiter
i have a spaces delimiter file like this

19428662
stdout	stdio
this syntax essentially says send stdout to dev null and send stdio 2 stderror to whereever the last place we were sending things to is dev null

19428676
put	get
so i ve put all drawables into a hashmap to get their ids later

19428697
width	height
i want to replace the width and height on all images from 120 to 150 and the last 3 digits in the src link on all images from 0-2-1 to 0-1-1 which loads a higher resolution version

19428738
width	height
this can be done by applying an affinetransform scale prior to drawing the image or by using graphics.drawimage x y width height imageobserver

19428760
serializable	deserialization
basically when dill serializable an interactively defined function it uses some name mangling on __main__ on both the serializable and deserialization side that makes __main__ a valid module

19428760
pickle	dill
actually dill registers it s types into the pickle registry so if you have some black box code that uses pickle and you can t really edit it then just importing dill can magically make it work without monkeypatching the 3rd party code

19428760
pickle	pprint
the reason pprint doesn t pickle well is that pprint does it s serialization tricks through using temporary file objects and reading the interpreter session s history.

19428780
width	height
so now when brouser resize image width i got new width calculate height and make it work

19428787
post	get
that documentation explain how the api give features to upload a files from computer using post or get method

19428844
google-chrome	firefox

the main benefits that you will get for soap rest communication are the fact that spdy can do http header compression reducing bandwidth and multiplexing - that is being able to send multiple requests on the same physical connection

19429106
jung	jgraph
the graph can be generated using jgraph jung

19429112
int	double
yes the int part of a double which represents an int will always be the double itself even at dbl_max

19429112
int	double
in fact any double greater than 2 52 will have itself as an int part because double of that size don t have enough mantissal bits to represent a fractions

19429112
int	double
for similar reasons not all int above 2 53 are representable as double s though when converted to double s they will still be int

19429112
int	double
finally the fractions part of any double less than 1 will be exactly itself and the fractions and int parts of any double when added will produce exactly the original double

19429139
ubuntu	linux
my linux ubuntu 12.04 process crash when i use ace_5.7.1

19429156
width	height
first issue is problem with height width and line-height

19429156
google-chrome	firefox
second issue is that the reason buttons and divs are different sizes in firefox and google-chrome is only because of the text size

19429156
google-chrome	firefox
for example if you have a text size of 15px well firefox makes a larger 15px than google-chrome does

19429156
google-chrome	firefox
since cufon is an external font it displays the exact same width on firefox google-chrome and every other browser

19429165
width	height
you can use the cli s #getboundingbox method to get the top and left edges relative to the chart container and height and width of a given chart element

19429169

getter	setter
since javascript doesn t have an equivalent to method missing the only way i could think of doing this was with getter and setter

19429650
getter	setter
each property has a getter and setter

19429650
getter	setter
the initialise method pins the getter and setter to the object

19429657

19429709
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
unchecked-exception runtimeexception comes to mind is a really exceptional case impossible or very hard to predict so it should usually not be contained and rather just signaled to the user with programatic fallback to last validly executed code branch

google-chrome	firefox
when i added the css style in the previous codes that works without any div the firefox and google-chrome debugger mode give me the error following error

many-to-one	one-to-many
what i see is two one-to-many relationships from the user side or two many-to-one relationships from the friends side

19430161
pop-up	dialog
my guess is that this same behavior occurs when the confirm your in app purchase dialog pop-up

19430167
outputstream	inputstream
whenever you want to handle the binary data then you need to use the inputstream outputstream classes generally everything that contains stream in its name

19430167
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
that s why there s a fileinputstream and a fileoutputstream those read from and write to files and they handle binary data

19430167
fileoutputstream	filewriter
a filewriter is basically a combination of a fileoutputstream with an outputstreamwriter

19430167
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
objectoutputstream and objectinputstream are special streams used for serialization

it is downloading as .part because that pop-up save as dialog window appears

19430959
queue	fifo
also use a linked blocking queue in this case which will act your tasks in it in a fifo manner

19430987

google-chrome	firefox
but the open in new tab doesn t show up in firefox and give a about blank page in google-chrome

19431034
floor	sqrt
it depends on how we re going to interpret floor sqrt n in the case that n is really large

19431034
floor	sqrt
first interpretation suppose that n is allowed to take on any integral value and that floor sqrt n is to be interpreted as floor sqrt convert_to_double n

19431034
int	double
second interpretation suppose that n is constrained to be a positive int that s exactly representable as a double

19431034
int	double
then a neat fact is that any divisor of n must also be exactly representable as a double n can be written in the form mâ 2 e for some nonnegative exponent e and odd int m with and any divisor of n can be written in the form dâ 2 f for some divisor d of m and exponent f with

19431034
floor	sqrt
so a trial division routine that goes up to floor sqrt n can t miss x

19431034
floor	sqrt
and just for fun here we re only worried about values of n for which floor sqrt n gives a value that s too small

19431034
floor	sqrt
if you re also interested in cases where floor sqrt n gives a value that s too large the first example occurs much earlier at

i believe that your credentials should be stored in a config file ini or json outside the webroot

19431625
width	height
thus the calculation ended in width and height being 0 and the setmeasureddimension call would then make the image invisible

19431625
width	height
so i made a fix for it if the width is 0 we run the calculation via the height instead

19431628
width	margin
just use a width instead of a set width and followed by margin 0 auto

19432686
width	height
i just want whatever styles we set in this it should be apply to mention height and width

19432800
hash	md5
this is supposed to be the md5 hash of the document data

19432812
toolchain	newlib	glibc	newlib
also you have to use the nacl toolchain one of either glibc newlib or pnacl

19432812
toolchain	newlib
i recommend trying pnacl now that it is available as that is by far the most cross platform version but if you run into trouble you ll probably want to use the newlib toolchain as it has better support

the only way a div can inherited a sibling height -without javascript- would by using using a table in html or table display properties in css

19433075
nhibernate	automapper
so for example your entity is account and with fluent nhibernate you mapped it to a table with a completely different name myaccountable how should automapper know about that it will simply do the mapping assuming the table name is equal to the entity name..

19433086
ciimage	uiimage
you need to set the inputimage to be the the ciimage from your uiimage

19433086

and you presumably want to convert that ciimage back to a uiimage

19433134
versioning	upgrade

19433428
onclick	onchange
that will work onchange and onclick with the submit button

19433467
equals	tostring
keep in mind that the compiler can only assume that t is an object so you can only perform basic operations like equals tostring etc

19433471
inherited	properties
usually a object is considered to be immutable if you can not change its properties including inherited properties from superclasses

19433472
google-chrome	firefox
on google-chrome and firefox the checkbox will become checked after clicking it this is the desired behaviour

19433601
base	fractions
similarly computers don t have an infinite amount of memory so they can t represent certain fractions exactly although these are different fractions as computers work in base 2

you want the keydown onkeydown or keyup onkeyup event just filter for the right key

19433736

one idea i am having is to put all the post data into object

19433749
maven	pom.xml
you should change code to read it from classpath as a resource instead of reading it as file maven executes java from your where your pom.xml resides

19433759
inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties
subclassing do not inherited static properties and methods

19433759
public	protected
if you use the protected access modifier instead of public classes can access static objects in their super classes via rate as if it were created within the class itself

19433759
super	extends	public	protected
the way superclasses work an object that extends a class has access to all public and protected objects in the super class

19433759
superclass	subclassing
you would access those methods within the subclassing like you would in the superclass itself

19433759
super	abstract	public	protected
now if you are looking to abstract things further you can set up properties within your super class with a protected or public modifier with a default value for all weapons

19433813

19433954
super	extends
even if it s not final when you ll extends it you ll realize that compiler requires an explicit constructor that in other turn is required to call super constructor which is impossible since that one is private

19433954
super	extends
another problem is that the static fields in super class still store object of that super class not your extends one

19433977
width	height
define height and width for #content

19434003
int	chars
if any chars is a digit test with str.isdigit turn it into an int using int and sum those

i am trying to make an application in which i have 7 pictureboxes and i want to drag drop one each time i click then move the mouse on the form

19434166
for-loop	loops
it it is not a very long operation where you need to update ui controls during loops then you just can use application.doevents inside loops to be able to use other controls as normally in the application when for-loop is working but i advise you that this will have a negative impact on ui performance but if it s not a long duration loops then you maybe would consider to use doevents instead introduce into multi-threading it s just an alternative not recommended but you can use it

19434203
fflush	gets
when i try this on two different nix computers with 7 different versions of python it s empty every timeâ the fact that after your script finishes the file gets closed and therefore fflush makes the problem harder to debug.

19434203
stdout	stderr
if the generated script raises an exception it will print nothing to stdout and will dump a traceback to stderr which you will read and ignore

19434203
stdout	stderr
either send stderr to stdout or print err err at the end

19434209
folder	directory
to be able to access tracker fdb eg to create a file the user needs the execute permission on all higher level directory upto the root otherwise the firebird user cannot know or check that the fdb folder even exists inside tracker

typedef	struct
where astreamdata is my user data struct typedef so i can use it as a class property and player is a static instance of the controlling objective-c class

19434423
min	max
the reason group by is not correct when applied to the whole table is that any columns you do not group by and that are also not the subject of aggregate functions min max avg count etc. are assumed by the server to be columns that you know to be identical in every row of the groups established by the group by clause

19434470
freemarker	velocity
if you have more complex files i would recommend templating engines like velocity or freemarker

19434487
vim	sublimetext
i have found that sublimetext is a great editor for ruby and rails projects it has great syntax highlighting out of the box vim keybindings available vintage mode a sweet package system to add functionality for other languages like sass or coffeescript and an excellent file browser that helps with complex folder structure that can happen in a rails project

19434499
awt	swing
swing is fine if you really want to build this functionality yourself and awt is also in java but it probably shouldn t be used independently of swing unless you have some special requirements

19434526
std	ostream
convert the std ofstream in the call explicitly to the base class std ostream helps in a similar way to the previous version

19434587
post	get
if it is a small app and you aren t worried about optimizing the number of database calls you can just loop over the post get array in php and do your updates based on the array key

19434628
uiview	subviews
i have uiview which have n number of subviews

19434649
ubuntu	debian

19434717
super	extends
normally in oop i would extends a class override its methods and call super methods like i want

19434734
width	height
so when it goes to a lower width the height proportionally decreases

19434829
width	height
if this is what you want then you need to add a height and width to each of the inside boxes

19434876
google-chrome	firefox
i am working in a web project using netbeans ide but when i deploy the application and browse it in some browser google-chrome or firefox or ... i navigate from the netbeans program to the browser in this situation will be very tired

19435122
super	extends
a super call represents a call to some method of the superclass so if class a extends from class b then

19435122
super	self
since the call to the super class constructor refers to the same object a not another object the message arrow should be a self message in which it calls to the constructor of the super class b

19435171
hide	show
you may want it to be transient so it stays on top of the master hide with it doesn t show up on the taskbar etc. and you may want to configure all kinds of other things

19435185
width	height
the template arguments specify the width and the height of the canvas in pixels

19435277
tinyint	boolean
there is no support for boolean bit or tinyint data types so char would be the best as it takes 1 byte

19435282
folder	directory
this is because the current directory has 2 folder called all and default hence it think refers to all directory in the current directory

19435288
hide	show

int	chars
in any normal c implementation the int promotions convert an unsigned chars to an int

19446597
int	chars
there is no conflict between saying that a chars may be used where an int may be used and the fact that your statement has behavior not defined by the c standard

19446597
int	chars
although you may use a chars in place of an int the rules about what may be printed with u still apply

19446597
int	chars
if using a chars results in an int appropriate for the specifier the behavior is defined

19446597
int	chars
if using a chars results in an int inappropriate for the specifier the behavior is not defined by the c standard

19446597
int	chars
discussion elsewhere on stack overflow concluded that an exotic c implementation might in theory conform to the c standard while having chars types plain signed and unsigned as wide as int types

19446597
int	chars
in such an implementation and int could not represent all values of an unsigned chars so an unsigned chars would have to be promoted to an unsigned int

19446609
division	multiplication
for lower levels ml you d change join to and calculation operator to multiplication instead of division

19446610

inherited	subclassing
here what happens a subclassing will inherited the behaviour of your base class

19446648
public	protected
so your subclass will reserve some space for them but you will not be able to manipulate those fields only by using methods public and protected ones

19446685
for-loop	arrays
firstly i worked out that i didn t need to go to the end of the players arrays in the first for-loop because those permutations are already worked out

19446688

19446888
integer	unsigned
i am not able to understand the addition of the signed and unsigned integer here

19446890
inherited	properties
the simplest answer you can not access the private variables of base class in derived class directly but yes this private objects and values are initialized in base class when overriding class object is initiated thus base class variables are inherited and you can access them using some properties or function if base class exposes them

19446923

19449584
range	min
you are then able to instantly find the min for any range by combining 2 preprepared answers

19449586
super	extends
now in the shape.accept method parameters can be made to be contra-variant that s why you see super with p and a return value co-variant and that s why you see extends with r there

in order to allow both arrays of int and double to be covered i have used a second view bound on the arraytopoint method

19451189

nsoperationqueue	nsblockoperation	nsoperation	nsblockoperation
nsoperation nsoperationqueue provide good ways of reporting doneness. at the simplest level you could wrap the code where you kickoff work in an nsblockoperation then add a completion block to that operation that signals something else when it s done and enqueue it to an nsoperationqueue for execution

this somehow gets the current playing song from zune and puts it in the registry this thing does not work with my sloppy title method since it changes the registry the instant the song changes

i have a child element with a width of 300px and a height of 80px i have a this child nested in a parent with a width of 0px and an overflow that is hidden

19452037
width	height
the only negative thing about it is the overflow hidden on the body which could be optimized further by either using javascript to determine the current window height width and setting it to that including on resize or something similar

19452097
versioning	upgrade
when set to yes wix sets the msidbupgradeattributesversionmaxinclusive attribute which tells msi to treat a product with the same versioning as a major upgrade

19452097
versioning	upgrade
for example product versioning 1.0.0.1 will upgrade 1.0.0.2998 because they re seen as the same versioning 1.0.0

19452097
versioning	upgrade
this attribute cannot be yes when allowdowngrades is also yes -- allowdowngrades already allows two products with the same versioning number to upgrade each other

however what i get in both google-chrome and firefox is typeerror ping is not a function

19452230
google-chrome	firefox
if it is a bug i find it very strange that it happens in both google-chrome and firefox since they have different javascript engine implementation different layout engine implementation etc

19452245
portrait	landscape
first you need to figure out whether you will use a different ui for tablet version besides the phone version if you use the same ui disign one pane or two panes just thinking about portrait landscape is enough otherwise you need use style and value-swxxx to arrange the layout files for tablet and phone

when i create the device and generate the code in the ide it only extends device which in turn only implements cf.deviceoperations

19452860
implements	extends
i would have expected an executable device to extends something that implements cf.executabledeviceoperations

19452860
implements	extends
if i change the implementation to c++ the generated code does extends an executabledevice_impl that implements these functions and i can use it to successfully load and execute a component from a waveform

19453652
allocator	stl
i personally do throw it if i use some custom allocator in stl containers

19453652
allocator	stl
the idea is to present the same interface- including in terms of behavior- to the stl libraries as the default std allocator

19453652
allocator	stl
you have no control over what those stl implementations will do if the allocator returns a big fat 0- it is unlikely to be anything you ll like

return-value-optimization	nrvo
the return-value-optimization nrvo now allows the compiler to omit creating a local temporary object copy-constructing the returned value in the memory slot from it destructing the temporary object and finally returning to the caller

19454278
return-value-optimization	nrvo
this means that the return-value-optimization nrvo only work for when you call a function to construct a new instance not when you assign it

19454278
return-value-optimization	nrvo
the following is an example of where return-value-optimization nrvo could be applied

superclass	subclassing
but i ve found in practice there s a strong tendency to get subclassing and superclass reversed

19454500
superclass	subclassing
i find it best to think about whether my proposed subclassing might better be a superclass

19454667
getter	setter
it s not the best practice to have a whole bunch of global static variables instead you should be more inclined to write getter and setter methods such as

19454674
post	get
p.s on one post i also found a solution which mentioned that the person was able to get the data after deleting the app from his facebook account and testing by adding it again

19454685
children	parent
if you want to move nodes around using ancestor keys you have to delete and recreate the entire child hierarchy of keys where as storing the parent in the node or the children keys in the parent means you just store different keys in properties

19454685
children	parent
if you normally walk down the hierarchy say url traversal you may find it more efficient to just store the children keys in a list in the parent assuming each level is not going to have too many immediate children as well as storing the parent key in the child

19454686
calloc	malloc
calloc and malloc are much much more low level than new and delete

19454686
calloc	malloc
firstly malloc and calloc are not safe because u use cast on type whatever you want and access of data in that memory is uncontrolled

19454686
calloc	malloc
you can end up writing on someone else s memory if you are doing some real low level programming you will have to use malloc and calloc

19454693
free	malloc
if you define your own everything it simplified to malloc free will go away

19454693
memcpy	malloc	free	memcpy	free	malloc
the compiler assumes that malloc free memcpy and so forth are all super-optimised and will use them only where safe - as described above

19459323
post	get
although both the post get return view in one piece of code that was my way of ruling out paging errors

19459436
postgresql	mysql
supports mysql sqlite and postgresql

19459460
width	height
here s a set of width height debugging tips

19459460
width	height
try tracing width height before and after setting it

19459460
width	height
otherwise if afterward they don t trace what you set then potentially the video1_btn class is doing something unconventional with the width height setters

19459460
width	height
try setting scalex scaley instead of width height

19459465
google-chrome	safari
to determine if it is a tablet or a phone the phone user agent for native android browser and google-chrome will contain mobile safari whereas the tablet will only contain safari

19459548
width	height
this code allows flexible height and width of img and also his container center vertically de text.just try with more large texts or images

19459553
getter	setter
by making all the member variables private and adding getter but not setter to each of them you re effectively making it so that other developers who use your api cannot accidentally update the values

19459553
getter	setter
the only advantage is that you can squeeze some other computations in your getter setter down the road if you decide you want to store the value differently

19459559
free	malloc
malloc and free are only concerned with allocating a number of bytes from the heap

19459616
lisp	scheme
i am new to scheme and lisp in general

19459642
folder	directory
cd d path of folder changes the current directory the batch will be looking at

19459713
folder	directory	folder	dir
-the second is because you have some problems in your path variable 1 namely the usr local bin directory comes before the usr bin dir and that could be a problem since in that folder there are some executables git related stuff that are present on both this is generally bad since the git placed in usr local bin that you or some packet manager have installed masks the default git that came with your os even if it is almost certainly not a problem with git it could become one in future for example even if most of the unix world is in the process of migrating from phython 2 to python 3 they are all still stuck to 2.7.x version of python and that is required for the os to work if you installed in usr local bin python 3 the system script would be executed with the new version and that is huge problem since python3 breaks backward compatibility and so python2 scripts won t run well they may as well not run at all

19459730
emacs	sublimetext
i m working with a file system in eclipse that includes .dat and .key files and would really like to be able to read them in the environment rather than keep an emacs or sublimetext window open on the side to read them

19459743
hide	show
i know how to create a with the menu the only thing that i need to know is how to create the show hide interaction with the mouse cursor

19459759
int	chars
however for a completely alternative approach that is a little cleaner and avoids reporting the same chars repeatedly you can use a map that maps chars to int counts of their frequency like this

19459759
puts	gets
it iterates each character c of the string and if the map does not contain that character already assigns a frequency of 1 or if it does contain it it gets the previous frequency adds 1 and puts it back

19459759
treemap	linkedhashmap
you can change it to linkedhashmap to preserve the order of first appearance of each character or treemap to sort it alphabetically

19459760
int	chars
the file with the single number contains an int and a newline two chars so when i bring the two files together the first two chars of file2 are overwritten instead of just added to the end

19459787
mouse	keyboard
the playsudoku function in the sudoku package also reads the current mouse pointer position in a graph and also reads keypresses from the keyboard has both options for a tk window or using getgrahpicsevent

19459828
width	height
this would submit the parameters w and h to your application containing window width and height

19459856
post	get
when i inspect the post request here s what i get

19459870
qtableview	qpushbutton
i would like add qpushbutton to my qtableview

19459883
post	put
you put this into the model you re working with in your case post and it will pass paeans for the nested model through to the corresponding controller

19459905
compare-and-swap	interlocked
i ve been reading about lock-free techniques like compare-and-swap and leveraging the interlocked and spinwait classes to achieve thread synchronization without locking

19459913
hide	show
another option is to hide the video player and then show it when it is ready to display

19459914
folder	directory
this application.yml file is located in a shared folder i m using capistrano and is symlinked to config application.yml within the current live app directory however i can only access the variables in the rails console and not the app

19459923
hide	show
another option is to hide the video player and then show it when it is ready to display

19459929
mouseleave	mouseenter
try mouseenter mouseleave instead

19459934
hide	show
there s no real way around this so i would suggest making a click to show hide control instead of relying on mouseover

19459954
button	checkbox
i want to make a public file serving page with a download link for each file and the possibility to check multiple files for download with checkbox and a download checked files button

19459983
getter	setter
whatever update that you are doing in the ui do it in progress update use global variables to pass values or use getter setter

19460000
spaces	delimiter
makes sure that there s a number after the spaces but it doesn t include as part of the delimiter

19460017
google-chrome	safari
i put together a quick non-production example here google-chrome safari only due to use of webkitmatchesselector

19460029
floating-point	integer
the only other thing you could potentially do -- if the only errors are errors of type a column is supposed to be an integer but sometimes a floating-point number slips in you could still use textscan and replace format specifiers with more generic ones

19460029
floating-point	integer
e.g. in that example you could replace d integer with f floating-point number

19460036
for-loop	loops
just having those definitions inside the for-loop looks a bit suspicious in itself since you increment both p and i during loops but you re going to reset them again on every iteration but it s not all that easy to follow the logic so perhaps that s what you intended

19460055
debian	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
recently i reinstalled linux ubuntu 12.04 and have been trying to install cuda using the debian package

19460125
implements	extends
first of all i have a basemodule that every module class extends from and this basemodule implements the getconfig method itself automatically and it is final so no module can override it

19460150
packets	pcap
i would like to decode the link-layer type and version of packets in a pcap file using python

19460154
post	put
i believe i could post to my server and then put the object on the amazon server but i would prefer to do it from the browser

19460154
post	put
i was planning to use angular file upload but it is hard coded to post not put

19460155
folder	directory
i prefer to keep my web directory as clean as possible and keep file uploads outside of public scope allowing me to change my method of serving the files without needing to move them -- ie moving from option 1 above to option 2 but if you want to store them in the web folder you can follow the symfony cookbook and store them in something like web uploads

19460320
google-chrome	firefox
so i want to run the same script with 2 or 3 browsers let say ie google-chrome firefox

19460322
fast-forward	merge
i don t think this will work with a fast-forward merge since there won t be a commit message

19460355
google-chrome	firefox
my problem is this - form elements can be resized and drag-and-dropped in ie but not in google-chrome or firefox

19460369
children	parent
also if that node has children you have to make sure they aren t removed just because their parent is removed

19460422
serializable	deserialization
to store timezone you need to store it separately with same json and use .withzone method after deserialization or just create serializable and deserializer

19460441
mouseleave	mouseenter
in a nutshell use mouseenter and mouseleave if you really need to

19460458
put	get
i need get only filename and put in javascript code

19460460
nsurl	nsstring
the nsstring nsurl are being sent as activityitems

19460466
width	height
from the captureframe function and setting the width and height of the frame to be captured in the mainwindow constructor

19460467
qtcpsocket	qtcpserver
i made a program that connects a qtcpsocket to a qtcpserver and it works fine on windows 7 but with windows xp it never connects and the program just closes

19460530
hide	show
i can add methods that would affect my dom element such as hide and show for instance without having to resort to modifying visibility of the dom element using css directly

19460591
for-loop	arrays
arrays index starts from 0 and goes till it s length -1 see that in your for-loop

19460593
for-loop	loops
you should also wrapp the code which is supposed to be inside loops into brackets without them only the next line after the for-loop condition will be executed

19460628
for-loop	arrays
since max index in arrays is arrayslength - 1 so change to in for-loop

19460681
textarea	textbox
if i select texta textarea and add data to it it will display a message below textbox currently textbox a in use and for textb currently textbox b in use

19460710
int	double
you can cast the int to decimal or double when assigning your variable then assign the label from the results

19460788
post	get
however i am finding it difficult to preserve that report data across get and post requests from the confirmation view

19460821
for-loop	loops
i believe using a do-while loops will fix it missing the 9 or a for-loop but i am unsure

19460863
minimum	max
i used a set filter for max number of charactures allowed but i dont see an a filter for minimum

19460876
realloc	malloc
if the string is too long to fit in the internal buffer at once use malloc to get a big-enough place to copy out the part of the string you have in the internal buffer then continue using the internal buffer to copy more of the string and then call realloc as needed

19460903
scrollable	panels
i am using css to create a web app like experience where everything on the page is always visible and only certain panels are scrollable

19460903
scrollable	panels
what i have done so far is apply a panels class to the thead and tfoot and then made the tbody auto fill the height and then make it scrollable

19460903
scrollable	panels
i have a jsfiddle that gets me close it also demonstrates the code i m using to create the fixed and scrollable panels

19460912
int	double
it works fine however when i change the int of rating to be a double i get the following error when updating the database

19460941
put	get
if i don t put any linebreak between one and the other such as all in one line then i get example

19461019
int	double
i m new to java and i m trying to make my numbers look good so i want to cast double to int but only if the double is something like 3.0 something that doesn t actually lose any decimals

19461042
spaces	delimiter
currently i believe that due to the spaces being part of the delimiter it doesn t work and i get the following error cut bad delimiter

19461072
prepare	execute
however you should still use top n because otherwise you would still execute and prepare the resultset for 10000 records on the db side although you may transport only the first n rows of those to the client

19461078
post	get
i used ajax to post or get data from my database sometimes nested ajax calls

19461176
apache	nginx
the only suggestion i have for you is to have your homepage served by something else such as an apache or nginx server which really does serve up just the bare minimum that you re after

19461176
apache	nginx
you can also speed things up a bit by separating out and loading from a cdn or your apache nginx server any resources not directly needed by meteorâ images additional css external javascript like librariesâ and having those preloaded by your non-meteor-hosted homepage

19461176
apache	nginx
i m not sure if it can be used to load javascript that s core to your app like templates but if your app is so large that you re thinking of splitting it up anyway then presumably there are parts of your code that you can separate into packages like your own custom javascript libraries which can then be loaded dynamically from your apache nginx server using meteor-external-file-loader

19461201
super	extends
i don t know why you have two but you could create a super or extends the jframe

19461206
width	height
now look to make the gallery height is dynamic don t miss with the height just give a width so that when u give the width for example 80 if there are more photos on the gallery it will flow left if the 80 was finished so the second row will go down and complete the gallery

19461213
int	double
i m trying to compute the division of two int into a double

19461256
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
i have tried using the latest version of safari google-chrome firefox and opera on my mac mini server

19461288
put	get
but when i put || between my statements i get syntax error on token invalid onlysynchronized

19461295
typedef	struct
is it not just as easy to do something like typedef struct ... a

19461317
build.gradle	gradlew
build.gradle root gradlew build file under gradlemultiproject folder

19461336
post	get
however the code below to get the activities post fails with ioexception 403 access not configured

19461344
hex	binary
if you re trying to convert the result of getint to hex you re barking up the wrong tree it s binary you would need to convert it to a string with integer.tostring getint 16

19461354
width	margin	pull	push
you push the sidebar to the center of the screen then use margin to pull it back by half of the width of the content plus the width of the sidebar plus any extra gutter you may want

19461374
put	get
make the database code into its own library put it in a gem get both apps to require the gem

19461378
int	boolean
the attributes oldvalue and newvalue are of type serializable so my int strings dates and boolean can be stored as well as several other hibernate objects

19461392
stdout	fflush
you should read about fflush stdout as it will help you with your debug statements

19461446
move	drag
i mean when i try to drag the side of the label to change its size the view controller move down making my label get displaced in the view controller

19461502
viewdidload	viewwillappear
if you want to log your navigationcontroller and tabbarcontroller you should do it in void viewwillappear bool animated and not inside void viewdidload

19461527
ubuntu	debian
if you want to have a distribution based on debian ubuntu i would recommend

19461535
filtering	grouping
problem this dumps the entire grouping db which might be attached to ldap etc. in an enterprise environment and then filtering them with grep to see if the user is there in somegroup

19461551
free	malloc
you should only free memory that is heap allocated with malloc or new and not space that is stack allocated like your fixed-size array declared

19461555
icmp	tcp
i mean for example scapy listens network traffic on eth0 and in case an icmp echo request packet from source ip 10.10.44.3 is received scapy sends an tcp syn packet to port 34 to ip address 192.168.2.1 using 8.8.8.8 as a source

19461564
width	height
for vertical alignment set the parent element s width height to 100 and add display table

19461576
maven	m2e
you could also install the m2e and the m2-wtp maven plugins for eclipse and run your build process from inside eclipse which should detect all the changes on the file system

19461579
openbsd	linux
it s certainly present and functions the same way on linux os x and openbsd

19461607
children	parent
can t update a parent url without reloading all children

19461614
client-side	server-side
for example apache struts works with the jakarta commons validator project which when configured correctly both provides server-side validation and generates javascript to do client-side validation

19461673
setattr	abc
so i am not sure how to get the function object for abc which i could in-turn bind with the class using setattr

19461680
google-chrome	firefox
i wrote the code in google s code playground and it works there but it will not work when i load the local .html file in ie firefox or google-chrome

19461689
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
first meg gets removed and loops increments i because it finished executing everything inside the for-loop so i will now be 3 and the arrays has been modified

19461691
put	get
just store your cookie with jessionid in client when your send subsequent request to server put the stored cookie in your request header field and send then you will get the same session in the server end

19461713
initializer	class-method
there is no need to initializer more than one instance of every such functional object with the same rationale that java class-method are shared among all instances of that class

19461722
google-chrome	safari
it will only work in google-chrome and safari for 3d transformations like this i believe

19461787
jasmine	sinon
the rest of the week you could use any of the javascript testing frameworks jasmine sinon etcâ to test the backbone portion and hope to get back to using ruby as soon as possible

19461793
pubnub	pusher
i would recommend you use either pusher or pubnub

19461803
textview	imageview
in the main fragment i would like to show a component textview or imageview if there is no connection

19461866
google-chrome	firefox
following code works well in ie google-chrome firefox not tested

19461876
public	protected
only protected and public methods variables can be inherited and or overridden

19461877
for-loop	arrays
also your should use the variant arrays approach instead of looping over cells in your for-loop

19461880
superclass	subclassing	public	protected
subclassing can only invoke or override protected or public methods or methods without access modifiers if the superclass is in the same package from their superclass

19461883
superclass	subclassing
if you want a subclassing to have access to a superclass method that needs to remain private then protected is the keyword you re looking for

19461935
width	height
to prevent this from happening you can allow the user to only change either the height or the width at a time but not both at the same time

19461935
width	height
when the user changes the height the width is automatically adjusted to keep the current aspect ratio

19461935
width	height
when the user changes the width the height is automatically adjusted

19461954
move	drag
first if you re trying to drag and drop the label but the view controller move instead then you might just be grabbing the view controller s background by mistake

19461963
post	get
i haven t gone into too many specifics here because you said you just wanted some ideas but most of this has come from another stack overflow post so check out that if you need some more concrete example code or just ask me and i ll expand on anything you get stuck on

19461977
post	put
hope this helps if you need more help for this you probably need to post some example queries and the model and probably put it on dba.stackexchange.com

19461984
width	height
you can use width and height and padding to keep the container as close to that aspect ratio as possible

19461991
hide	show
check this post - show hide image with javascript

19462018
concave	convex
this approach should work even at convex and concave corners

19462061
screens	hdpi
an old nexus 7 has the same screens size as a new nexus 7 but the old one has a resolution of 1280x800 which is 216 dpi or hdpi while the new one has a resolution of 1920ã 1200 pixels which is 323 dpi or xhdpi more pixels within the same physical area means higher pixel density in dpi

19462061
screens	mdpi
the image would be half the size on an xhdpi screens compared to an mdpi screens because the xhdpi screens has approximately double the pixel density

19462061
screens	mdpi
that s why menu icons for mdpi screens are 32x32 and those for xhdpi screens are 64x64 and both are in the appropriate drawable folder drawable-mdpi and drawable-xhdpi

19462061
mdpi	hdpi
and pick the most commonly used combinations which are small ldpi normal mdpi normal hdpi and normal xhdpi 81 of all devices

19462061
mdpi	hdpi
if you provide the same resource in the density dependent drawable folders you can lower the memory footprint for hdpi mdpi and ldpi devices

19462067
express.io	node.js
this is my first time working with node.js and i am trying to use express.io to save cookies

19462156
google-chrome	firefox
i do mean the one displayed on the tab in google-chrome ie firefox

19462159
nsstring	nsjsonserialization	nsmutablestring	nsjsonserialization	nsmutablestring	nsstring
nsjsonserialization only works on arrays nsarray or nsmutablearray dictionaries nsdictionary or nsmutabledictionary strings nsstring or nsmutablestring and nsnumber

subtract	add
i have a menu option with two options add and subtract

19462248
children	parent
you can clear all children of a parent with the jquery method .empty as in

19462262
move	drag
i am trying to use physics to allow a user to drag a sprite and have it move in the direction the user dragged it in when the user lifts his or her finger up

19462262
move	drag
for example if the user drag it hard or with force the body move faster in that direction

19462262
move	drag
if they drag it slow the body move slower in that direction

19462262
portrait	landscape
my game is in portrait mode not landscape

multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract	subtract	add
you need to finish the contract - that is - code out what the other four methods are going to do add subtract multiplying divide

19462291
bash	subshell
in bash both and create a subshell

19462292
accessor	properties
fast dynamic properties and field accessor

19462314
lisp	scheme
some common lisp and scheme compilers that compile to native code sbcl can identify tail-recursive code and perform this translation

19462341
hide	show
you must use asynctask class override doinbackground method to perform your databse fetch onpreexecute method to show your loading and onpostexecute to hide it

19462354
margin	font-size
while you can set all of these to 0 you ll still face some challenges when you set the display to inline-block coz that will add some space at the bottom of the element in such a way that it will show invisible margin after the element unless of course you use some combination of vertical-align set to top and font-size or line-height

19462365
folder	directory
as far as i can tell ksystemfoldertype will always be the system folder in the root directory eg system so you shouldn t have to search for it

19462387
post	put
after looking at several post the nicest solution was creating a transparent uiviewcontroller and on top i put my uiview and created a modal segue the when invoked it take control of everything allows only interaction with it and not with what s beneath

19462393
button	checkbox
there is yes and no button when i click yes then i want to uncheck the checkbox

19462407
16-bit	64bit
mattnewport s code actually sign extends the 16-bit operand to an int 32-bit or 64bit depending on the compiler model before shifting

19462414
hash	md5
you can also check md5 hash if available

19462622
udp	tcp
yes the nic offover just off ether ip tcp udp s checksum and udp checksum is checked seldom

19462638
hlsl	glsl
this means very little had to be done to existing shading languages like hlsl and glsl in order to expose multisample fetches

19462652
hide	show
we ll get hshell_windowdestroyed hshell_windowcreated also when only do hide show or set cancel ws_ex_toolwindow to any top-level unowned window with taskbar button

19462761
cos	sin
to rotate the vectors you do need to use trig functions like sin and cos like you have in your code

19462761
cos	sin
so the x of a given pvector varies with cos theta and the y varies with sin theta

19462795
post	get
and i can add select box by just change the type as but how did i get the post title value in option

19462821
folder	directory
this should remove all the folder and files you have created for both directory just run this script and it should remove them both completely

19462953
getter	setter
i have used a custom listview with a custom adapter and a itemsholder class with getter and setter

19462967
min	max
you are assigning to max and min before initializing elements of a

19462969
min	max
you re using to initialize min and max before itself has been initialized

19462969
min	max
initialize then set min and max to its value then proceed from there

19462975
int	chars
i m trying to repeat the middle chars in an inputted string coupled with a repetition int

19462976
min	max
set min max values to a 0 for simplicity sake

19462988
google-chrome	firefox
i am getting below error in page load event in ie not the google-chrome or firefox

19462991
wmic	findstr
first you would consider to convert the wmic output encoding from unicode to ansi to ommit unicode characters like empty echoes a simple trick to do this is filtering the output with find findstr command s after applying the output filter you just need to read the output with for f to split the string using the desired tokens value and delims delimitter

19463028
int	boolean
javadoc for method boolean iscolumnhidden int columnindex

19463050
division	modulo
modulo if you don t know gives the number of decimals given by a division problem

19463064
int	chars
here is a better approach for chars to int conversion

19463064
int	chars
every chars has an ascii code an int

19463064
int	chars
so when you have 2 chars and you try to get the distance between them the result is an int

19463087
sin	sqrt	cos	inverse	cos	sqrt	cos	sin

since and you will pass it to the node accordingly but before you will transform it so it is again by subtract 1 2 from the high components and then multiplying all components by 2 as the subnode is twice smaller in all dimensions to get position 0.2 0.2 0.2 which you will pass on...and so on

19473153
int	chars
if you had instead not divided by sizeof int the pointer would be advanced by chars units

19473192
subtract	add
to change time zones add or subtract an hour

19473192
subtract	add
so add 360 seconds to move one hour ahead subtract o go one hour back like this

19473199
width	margin
my first thought was to use the width of the chart container but the x axis is smaller than this one since y-axis and margin spacing uses space

19473243
for-loop	loops
so i m obviously stuck on how to display the distance in incremented form like how time is displayed i m not sure how to go about it and more importantly if a for-loop is the appropriate loops to use in this case

19473268
comparator	comparable
a dvdcollection class that sorts my array incrementally and a dvd comparable class that has the constuctor method and overwrites comparator

express	node.js
node.js 301 redirect non-www without express

19473316
vim	emacs
whenever i tab correctly and everything looks nice in vim i will get compile errors and i will have to go to an editor like emacs to check where the error actually is

19473336
calloc	malloc
the same applies to structs which are malloc ed in push you could use calloc instead of malloc to ensure that the blocks returned are cleared to zero or you should set the struct s pointers to zero explicitly

19473352
decimal	ieee
i realize that whenever one is dealing with ieee 754 doubles and floats some numbers can t be represented especially when one tries to represent numbers with lots of digits after the decimal point

19473352
int	double
clearly using a straight up int64 or some such large int datatype would be better but people still use double for large numbers every so often

19473367
thin	unicorn	apache	nginx	passenger	thin	passenger	unicorn
in production deployments of ruby applications there is typically a web tier apache or nginx and an application tier unicorn thin passenger

19473367

concurrency is far more limited in the application tier - most app servers can handle a much smaller number of concurrent requests 1 per process for thin unicorn

19473378
jedi	python-mode
i want to use python-mode and jedi for autocompletion in vim for python

19473387
width	height
note floating an element takes it out of the flow so you might need to add something like overflow auto to the parent - assuming the content is collapsing because a fixed height width isn t set

19473412
ng-view	ng-include
angular s built in template support is the best way to do this either using ng-include or you can use angular s routing and along with ng-view

now let s see after hide and show

19473466
free	malloc
i think if my memory serves me correctly that stroustrep in one of his books on c++ mentions that malloc and alloc in c afford the compiler rather than the programmer the option to free up or create memory in contrast to the object-oriented new and delete

19473514
udp	tcp
so conceptually while the tcp example needs a loop the udp example just needs an if statement

19473635
free	malloc	free	strcpy	strcpy	malloc
malloc allocates 100 bytes the strcpy populated it and the free deallocates it

19473656
for-loop	loops
for loops to be log n you would have to do math.pow 10 i in your for-loop

19473680
fadein	fadeout
you also need to wait for fadeout to finish before doing fadein

19473680
fadein	fadeout
so sequence fadeout set new text fadein

19473856
superclass	subclassing
if i create a subclassing object in the superclass it goes in infinite loop because i guess once subclassing object is created it keeps calling superclass constructor which keeps creating subclassing object

19473856
superclass	subclassing
if i declare the subclassing object in main i get something like cannot reference non-static member from static context because my superclass object is not yet initialized

19473868
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
the following code works differently on firefox safari and google-chrome

when you have an existing nsfetchedresultscontroller and add an object to the nsmanagedobjectcontext the nsfetchedresultscontroller is updated by evaluating the nspredicate and nssortdescriptor against the object rather than converting them to sql

19474303
pull	push
therefore you must pull those changes first to be able to push your changes

19474306
pubnub	pusher
for push you ll want to avoid using apns apple push notification service as message delivery is not guaranteed users can decline to receive push notifications and you ll want to either create your own sockets connection or use a push service like pusher or pubnub which provide reliable message delivery from server to client

19474306
pubnub	pusher
edit to be clear there is no reliable way to do this without using a a server to store the messages state b a third party service like pusher or pubnub to reliably deliver the messages between devices whether the other device is active or not and really you are then just using their server instead of your own

19474329
google-chrome	firefox
no currently there is no such solution on an android device in pure js html5 in android google-chrome nor firefox for that matter

19475365
int	double
that s because nextdouble nextint reads only the double int values and doesn t read the n that you press after the number is read so it will be consumed in the nextline

19475374
for-loop	loops
i also tried with a for-loop of iterators using in the code of loops but i still obtain a similar error

19475385
put	get
how do i put the assembly reference with the file so that i do not get this error

19475395
int	double
nextdouble and nextint only read the double or int values respectively but will ignore the invisible n at the end of each line

getter	setter
and the compiler will synthesize getter setter and instance variable if necessary

19475480
getter	setter
dynamic property indicates that implementation of setter and getter will be provided by some underlying code in runtime

19475480
getter	setter
there is no underlying code to manage your dynamic properties if your object is a subclass of nsobject so you are responsible for implementing setter and getter

19475480
getter	setter
change dynamic to synthesize to let the compiler create appropriate setter and getter for you

if you put the tab in the background you get an annoying 1 second gap between each pattern -- an extreme flaw in an api designed for advanced audio

19475900
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
use 2 for loops the first to fill the arrays using the random class to generate random integers using the next method of the random class and a second for-loop to iterate through the filled arrays and print the values entered into the arrays by the random number generator

19475910
children	parent
you might be using overflow hidden as a kind of clearfix in this case which is just a way to get a parent container to expand to the height of its floated children as floated elements are taken out of the normal page flow

this makes for a good read - the http verbs put post get etc. do not dictate how the server is going to handle the request you send

19476880
ng-show	ngcloak
the problem seems to be that compile gets called and removes the ngcloak directives and class this makes the controllers contents visible even though it shouldn t be because ng-show is false

19476880
ng-show	ngcloak
why doesn t ngcloak pay respect to ng-show

19476904
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
my solution is use a for-loop to read the arrays and use foreach to loops over the entire collection and assign them accordingly

after a lot of googling i ve found that most sources say that the dijkstra algorithm is more efficient than the bellman-ford algorithm

19482317
bellman-ford	dijkstra
surely there is some situation in which the bellman-ford approach is better than the dijkstra approach

19482341
bellman-ford	dijkstra
dijkstra is however generally considered better in the absence of negative weight edges as a typical binary heap priority queue implementation has o |e|+|v| log|v| time complexity a fibonacci heap priority queue gives o |v|log|v| + |e| while the bellman-ford algorithm has o |v||e| complexity

postgresql	mysql
moreover i found that dealing with regular expressions is more difficult in postgresql than mysql

19482759
postgresql	mysql
i could think of ways to accomplish it if i had more db permissions such as inserting the list to a table in the database plus using temp tables + if i could use regex like in mysql but i don t know where to start on postgresql with this

19483007
opera	google-chrome
this can be recreated on the simplest of examples compare what happens here in opera and google-chrome

19483007
opera	google-chrome
since opera is now blink based it should inherit google-chrome s exact implementation but this issue is not present in google-chrome

19483009
x86	y86
this is in y86 assembly architecture which resembles x86 but is missing a lot of instructions but this should make sense

getter	setter
i wanted to have the getter and setter in the abstract class so the implementation would be rather simple and clear

19483357

19483659
maven	m2e
the maven structure and m2e really annoy me .it is just dependency inside another dependency

19483757
oncreate	onstart
you have 3 separate tracking instances 2 in the oncreate and also one in the onstart onstop

19483757
oncreate	onstart
i would recommend removing both of them from the oncreate and just keeping the easytracker in the onstart nonstop that way you won t get redundant data but still get session lengths

19484023
short	base
i suspect that period lies in the past for the most able attackers on the planet and in the future for the average cracker but that whenever it occurs this era of history is a short one and therefore you don t want to base your website s security on the assumption that it is in the present for your actual attackers

19484023
hash	salt
a few seconds in an offline attack against a list of securely hash and salt passwords

post	get
http get request and http post request works differently

19484070
post	get

19484722
setinterval	clearinterval
setinterval calls the passed in function every 1000 ms until you call clearinterval

19484722
setinterval	settimeout	ready	each

addclass	removeclass
in your handler you can check using hasclass to see if which state it is coming from and then use addclass and removeclass to change the css class

19485218
box-sizing	border-box
since bootstrap is working with box-sizing border-box your best bet is probably to wrap the buttons within the col-xs-6 class and add a left padding to every div except the first one

19485244
coldfusion	railo
i can connect fine through adobe coldfusion but railo keeps throwing an error

19485252

19485261
post	get
if you are implementing parts of the resource on the server with multiple files and there are already existing files that get in the way of a successful post you d return a 409 and not create the collection resource and fail the whole operation

19485273
setcontentview	findviewbyid
most importantly here you will usually call setcontentview int with a layout resource defining your ui and using findviewbyid int to retrieve the widgets in that ui that you need to interact with programmatically

onresume called after onrestoreinstancestate bundle onrestart or onpause for your activity to start interacting with the user

19485375
width	height
to specify the coordinates within the svg image independently of the scaled size of the image use the viewbox attribute on the svg element to define what the bounding box of the image is in the coordinate system of the image and use the width and height attributes to define what the width or height are with respect to the containing page

19485375
width	height
now if you set only the width and height that will change the size of the svg element but not scale the triangle

19485375
width	height
if you set the view box that causes it to transform the image such that the given box in the coordinate system of the image is scaled up to fit within the given width and height in the coordinate system of the page

19485375
width	height
so if you specify that the element should have a width of 100 but a height of 50px it will actually only scale up to the height of 50px unless you have a very narrow window

note a very important difference between compareto and equals

19487775
equals	compareto
now i advise you to review the source code of both methods to conclude that equals is preferable over compareto that involves some math calculations

treemap depends on compareto while hashmap depends on equals

19487891
equals	compareto
so if you equals and compareto are not consistent than treemap and hashmap can behave differently

19487891
equals	compareto
hence it is good to have equals and compareto consistent to each other but it s not mandatory

additionally even if the enum couldn t contain values differing only in case that wouldn t mean you d either always want it to be case-sensitive or always want it to be case-insensitive

when i was using this debug allocator professionally i extended it so that it was threadsafe so that it could tell me what kind of allocator was doing the allocation malloc strdup new imalloc etc. whether there was a mismatch between the alloc and free functions what source file contained the allocation what the call stack was at the time of the allocation what the average minimum and maximum block sizes were what subsystems were responsible for what memory usage.

ready	each
that makes sense - the same problem will occur if you are using the jquery-turbolinks gem since it will cause any code inside your jquery document ready function to run on each page load

19499950
ready	each
the solution for this case is to place your document .on bindings outside of your jquery ready function so they aren t executed on each page load

19499953
int	chars
getting the frequency of each chars you can iterate through the string and increment an int

width	height
if there is no width or height then this will be the solution

19500228
width	height
always take on count that leaving the resize of an image to the os might cause huge amounts of memory allocated because the os will try to resize it based on the formula width height 4bytes the 4 byes are for argb of each pixel 1 byte per color or alpha so if your image is for example 1090 1920 it could easily become internally 8.3mbs even tho the actual image size is only a few kbs and if it tries to scale it it might double it s size too

ienumerable	ienumerator	ienumerator	idisposable
because the non-generic ienumerator interface did not follow that pattern code which uses the non-generic ienumerable interface is required to check whether each object returned by getenumerator implenments idisposable and call dispose on it if so

19500318
ienumerator	idisposable
this is less convenient and slower than would be calling idisposable unconditionally had it been inherited by ienumerator even if only 99.9 of ienumerator implementations would have a do-nothing dispose method calling a do-nothing method which an interface is known to support is faster than checking whether an interface supports a method

if it is exepcting absolute coordinates that is x1 y1 x2 y2 then simply add the width and height to the left and top coordinates

slider	supersized
i am running the supersized slideshow and it is working great but i need to refresh reload the page after it shows the slider

19508527
children	parent
if we cut a node from its parent we can just decrease the order of that node by one to indicate that it has fewer children than it thought it previously did

19508527
children	parent
it lets us do decrease-keys quickly in most contexts as long as the nodes aren t children of the same tree and only rarely do we have to propagate a decrease-key by cutting a node from its parent and then cutting that node from its grandparent

19508527
children	parent
since we only cut a node from its parent if it s already lost two children we can pretend that each decrease-key operation pays for the work necessary to cut its parent node

19508527
children	parent
typically you d represent a multiway tree either by having each parent point down to all the children perhaps by having an array of children or by using the left-child right-sibling representation where the parent has a pointer to one child which in turn points to a list of the other children

19508527
children	parent
the main operation we need to do on trees is a join operation in which we make one root node a child of another so it s perfectly reasonable to the pointers in the tree directed from parent to children

19508527
children	parent
if we represent the tree by having each parent node store an array or list of pointers to its children then we can t efficiently in o 1 remove a child node from the list of children

19508527
children	parent
each parent node stores a pointer to a single and arbitrary one of its children

19508527
children	parent
the children are then stored in a circularly-linked list and each points back up to its parent

19508527
children	parent
remove a child from a tree splice that child node out of the linked list of children for the parent node

19508527
children	parent
if it s the single node chosen to represent the children of the parent node choose one of the sibling nodes to replace it or set the pointer to null if it s the last child.

19508582
min	max
i also need to be able to get the min or max of children depending on whose turn it is

but then i decided it s a good idea to sanitize it with the prepare execute methods

19509441
free	malloc
don t forgot to free the memory which is allocated with malloc

19509455

apache	nginx
either through the grunt-contrib-connect task some other node.js server or some server that serves files apache nginx

19509497
hide	show
replace the word body with the element that you want to show hide when the button is clicked

19509522
sse	avx
another approach is to get down and dirty with sse and avx

19509522
multiplying	add
better still i think the latest intel x86s have a multiplying add instruction which is what is needed for correlations ffts etc

19509522
sse	avx
effectively there are some additional functions that map directly onto sse avx opcodes allowing them to be easily used in c code

19509530
int	chars
your code is comparing an int form the rand.nextint function to a chars

19509535
inherited	properties
for inherited properties this reinforces the default behavior for example

inherited	subclassing
my qualm with the inherited approach is btreedelbymerge is not a type of btree it s behaviour does not change by much and having a to create a separate subclassing for just one of its methods seems unnatural

19509636
int	boolean
this is the first argument and it is a function that receives a tuple of two int and returns a boolean

19509637
draggable	droppable
so instead of li i have initialized the draggable and droppable on a anchor tags

19509640
inherited	properties
what i understand is that there seems to be no specific advantage to the font-size inherited properties as the font size is inherited naturally

19509640
inherited	properties
ie7 and earlier does not support the inherited value so that is something you should know but it should not affect you for the font-size properties

19509640
inherited	properties
there are properties like margins which are not naturally inherited so the inherited value might be useful there

19509640
inherited	properties
anyway check out the css properties that are not inherited by default in order to know where to use inherited

19509700
folder	directory
i am asking this because you are pointing a media directory which is under static folder with the same level of your views.py file

hex	binary
wether you performa logical operation with a binary or a hex or a decimal number format doesn t matter because the output will be the same

19511536
hex	binary
however if you use hex represetation it has the advantage that you can more easily read the binary value in the source code then with dec

listview	gridview
one example here change background color of gridview row in a listview

19517015
try-catch	exception-handling
the beauty with throws is that the exception-handling converts into checked exception-handling thus every time any developer will try to use the first approach he will be warned to place a try-catch block before calling the method which has throws in its signature

19517018
int	boolean
you can use sharedpreferences to save any primitive data boolean floats int longs and strings

when you resize your browser smaller the background-images size adapts to the viewport s width not its height

19518010

equals	gethashcode
i think it s better to override equals and gethashcode methods of your someclass to compare id and name properties

19518038
int	chars
using monostring stringvalue1 instead of chars stringvalue1 31 and monoarray intarray instead of int intarray 2 allows the marshaling to work correctly

fseek	ftell
i think a better solution it will be phenomnally inefficient to continuously rewind and write to open file stream would be to track the file position of each record read using ftell and store it with the data you ve read - then if you have to resume then just fseek to the last position

19518357

expander	togglebutton
i suppose you should use togglebutton instead of button this allows you to handle ischecked state and as a result expand collapse underlying expander control

19518438
expander	togglebutton
as a result you ll be able to define datatemplate with togglebutton and expander within

19518482

19518907
folder	directory
and on any other folder in the var www directory like test when i enter localhost test instead of loading the index.php file it shows

19518942
put	get
to put it in the simplest terms your php page can still run with an include file not being retrieved where as if it s a required_once and the file it s trying to get doesn t exist or is not in the right directory the whole page will fail to load

19518973
rubygems	bundler
if you use bundler you can specify a local path a git repository or even another rubygems repository but never a specific http uri

19519040

sse	avx
let s look at 32-bit words with sse avx and avx-512

19519287
sse	avx	sse	avx2
this is true for sse but not for avx and maybe not even for avx2

19519287
sse	avx
the sse and avx code are both about twice as fast as the following sequential code

19519312
min	max
i m reading a table row that has in it the min and max dates on the table

19519312
min	max
using the min and max above the calendar should begin in datepicker1 with that date as the default and datepicker2 should have max as the most recent selectable date

19519312
min	max
once a date has been selected from one the other unselected datepicker would have a pre-determined window of 14 days from the selected one if datepicker1 was selected first if datepicker2 was selected first as its max or min date

19519312
min	max
i can enforce the max and min dates on the calendars when the page is loaded but can t make the new 14 day one apply when it is selected

it will remove variables altogether and hide them from the debugger since the variable is not there the debugger cannot show them

19519517

versioning	upgrade
my ubuntu is full updated on last versioning update upgrade dist-upgrade but when i try to do

19519652

background-position	background-size
so i used to make a kind of jquery plugin to combine both background-position fixed and background-size cover

19519710

to get around that you need to put the queries into a separate thread and send the results back to wxpython to update the display

19519745
google-chrome	firefox
tested in google-chrome firefox and ie

19519753
post	get
the rest verbs lend themselves well to what you are trying to do - get for getting the data post for creating the records etc

19519757
int	double
otherwise if any arithmetic argument corresponding to a double parameter has type double or an int type then all arithmetic arguments corresponding to double parameters are effectively cast to double

19519781
coalesce	nullif
but i need this coalesce nullif

free	calloc	free	strdup	free	malloc	strdup	calloc	strdup	malloc	calloc	malloc
you should only free memory you explicitly allocate with malloc calloc or strdup

19520112
free	malloc
you only free pointers to memory which was allocated with malloc

19520113
free	malloc
the basic rule of the memory management if you called malloc to get a memory you shoudl use free to release it when you do not need it

19520134
hide	show
since your javascript is included in every page it runs each time the page loads and therefore hide and then show the whole page

19520165
free	malloc
the golden rule malloc and free are always paired

19520167
subtract	add
i am trying to do write in a function to subtract a few dates then divide them together add 1 then 100 to get an overall complete

19520190
google-chrome	firefox

19520243
hide	show
probably you may select another strategy do not try to hide buttons but show only desired buttons instead

19520340
for-loop	arrays
the problem i m having is when calcroute is called as you can see most of the function is wrapped inside a for-loop so i can cycle through the function for each postcode in the queryparms arrays but the directionsservice.route method isn t executed as part of the rest of the function

19520353

19520572
nunit	mstest
you can use nunit mstest etc

19520579
httprequest	httpresponse
its easier to test unit testing you already have abstractions for httprequest and httpresponse and a lot of more you wonâ t find yourself doing wrappers for all the legacy web impl that are shipped with mvc

19520588
for-loop	arrays
the limits arrays defines the upper bound of each component -1 equivalent to n in a for-loop

19520595

for-loop	loops
to loops it use a while loops instead of a for-loop

width	height
the width and height attributes do not make the image load faster and the browser is not searching for those values

19522809
width	height
to answer your question there s no way to automatically generate these attributes aside from some server-side solution that retrieves the image width and height from the file and writes the attributes to the page based on that

19522809
client-side	server-side
however unless you re already doing other image processing generating a thumbnail for instance this is overkill and will likely waste more time on the server-side than you will save on the client-side

width	height
i ve tried changing the else to an if saying if the height width is at or over the canvas height width to set the height width to 0 but that didn t work either

int	double
it operates on double s returning double then you probably put the result in a 32bit int on your platform

19523753
int	double
the other part is accuracy if you just make an int equal to a double then you will likely encounter something like in this question

19523756
put	get	post	get	post	put
get can retrieve data but should not modify server side state use put to create a resource use post for mutation

19523756

hide	show
it would be nice if one could hide show each special comment separately

19524089
width	height
you have to remember that your canvas isn t cleared between each of your drawme calls - so while the width and height are properly adjusted after the first loop the whole area is drawn over and thus it appears nothing is happening

19524283

19524365
width	height
the size of a view is expressed with a width and a height

19524365
width	height
a view actually possess two pairs of width and height values

19524365
width	height
the first pair is known as measured width and measured height

19524365
width	height
the second pair is simply known as width and height or sometimes drawing width and drawing height

19524365
width	height
these values may but do not have to be different from the measured width and height

19524365
width	height
the width and height can be obtained by calling getwidth and getheight

19524399

versioning	upgrade
action upgrade our existing custom named instance to the versioning of sql we are currently using

19524897
versioning	upgrade
this logic is theoretically wrong if the installed versioning of sql was a later versioning than the one we are trying to install as we would be upgrading to an earlier versioning which would fail but this should never happen unless the user decides to manually upgrade our instance of sql which is beyond our ability to control

19524897

salt should be at least the same size as your hash function so for sha256 you should use at least 32 bytes

19526326
pbkdf2	salt
since pbkdf2 s standard recommends salt of at least 64 bits it s a waste to generate keys smaller than your input so use at least 8 bytes

19526326

discussed in all the links above especially the first salt should be saved along passwords but never reused elsewhere usually by appending it first in the resulting string salt hash or in another database column

when i debug step-by-step searcharea has good values so i think serializable deserialization are ok

19527330
children	parent
your naã ve approach looks ok except that you don t have a unique constraint on parent.name which means you could have duplicate parent names but would only return children matching the first id you find

19527330

which would return all parent whose name is name and all their matching children

int	double
the compare_any function will compare any type which is supported in this case int and double because we can pass a function pointer to it

19527639
int	double
for that reason it has to work the same way with regular types like int and double with pointers and with structs and the only way to get it to work correctly with all possible types is to have it deal with pointers to elements not with the elements themselves even when the elements are themselves also pointers

elements are sized using height and width attributes so

19528088
rational-numbers	zero
rational-numbers in rascal actually support infinity in the form of a zero denominator but that s more a side effect of the implementation than a real design choice so you may not want to count on it

to accomplish this i created a custom qgraphicsitem called node that defines its shape by returning a qpainterpath object

19528165
punctuation	words
words boundaries occur at punctuation not just spaces so if you use and or the perl-ish b and b which are more recent additions to gnu grep then you will also match words at the end of a sentence followed by a dot instead of a space

19528453
hide	show
from what i understood you need to show or hide a usercontrol depending on a property value in your page or in a session variable

19528581
setinterval	settimeout
use angular and ng-model its an easier way to do the data binding or you can remove the setinterval and use settimeout the time out function will be instantiated then when the timer runs out it will execute the code your setinterval will continually loop through the code without stopping thats why you are getting the refresh constantly happening you should bind the settimeout to the key up event that way you will have a little more control over when then events fire

19528581
setinterval	settimeout
setinterval is a loop that does not stop settimeout does not loop it will only fire once unless its re-instantiated

you could probably do png - svg - tiff conversion

19528691
noexcept	throw
if i have a class c that has a destructor explicitly marked noexcept false presumably because it throw for some odd reason and i m aware that you shouldn t and why then the destructor of any class that derives from c or contains a member of type c also becomes noexcept false

the difference is that in moonscript n classes cause n copies of the code you posted differing only by two lines each whereas if you implemented moonscript s notion of class manually you would probably use a function to define classes as is done in some lua oo libraries bacon newclass bacon would call the above code with the __name and bacon lines replaced appropriately

19528745
lua	moonscript
note that there several advantages to leaving the lua code duplication generated by moonscript in your lua files at least for oft-used operations class definition is probably not one of them but moonscript does way more than that

19528909
error-handling	try-catch
now it s working just like in the first example.the same applies to promises you can t use try-catch so you use rejections for error-handling

post	get
on the client side i post the form via ajax to the uploadandprocessfile action and then have a function that continually does an ajax get request to getfileprocessstatus

19529180
post	get
when a form is submitted the request is done by default with method get if the method is not specified as method post

19529193
getter	setter
you could for example simply give your pin class gettext and settext string text getter and setter methods as well as a getter method for the jlabel that returns it as a jcomponent and use those guys

19529256
children	parent
you can use display inline-block to avoid parent s text-decoration affecting its children

19529282
post	put
once they click on the post they want the single page will put all the images in but i am just struggling probably because i am thinking rather than doing to figure how i would do that

19529295
hide	show
i ve included an example which creates a custom tablerow named textpairrow inflates a layout with two textviews to show within the tablerow and adds showlabel and showdata custom attributes which show hide the two textviews

19529337
width	height
i didn t set any height or width for the images

19529356
integer	unsigned
i m allowed to use any integer unsigned operations including || if while

on a udp socket that error likely means you received a port unreachable icmp message in response to a datagram you sent

19529385
google-chrome	firefox
so i ve tested this in firefox as well and it works perfectly fine there but when i opened my website in google-chrome none of the js was working and i managed to find the chuck of code that is preventing it from loading

19529423
pubnub	pusher
i have looked at pusher and pubnub and their services seem very expensive and unsuited as they look at peak connections

19529423
pubnub	pusher
i would like to use an open source solution or something cheaper and more suited to my needs than pusher or pubnub

19529446
action-filter	onactionexecuting
for example an onactionexecuting actionexecutingcontext filter that has the order property set to zero and filter scope set to first runs before an action-filter that has the order property set to zero and filter scope set to action

though you should consider changing that to a normal for-loop for the arrays

19529511
rss	feed
feed has an rss nstring property

19529513
client-side	server-side

folder	directory
i got the compiler to make sure it spits tcads.dll into the bin output folder when compiling by adding it as an existing item to my project then setting it s build action to embedded resource and setting it to copy always to output directory

19529625
for-loop	arrays
won t do what you re expecting it to do as the for-loop will exit after printing 5 hi from dx d n every time the for is run the x and y variables will be incremented by 1 no matter what while the first will print 5 times hi from dx x n for each x value up to 5 which will be the correct behavior if you want to get the information of every pixel on a screen or of every index in an multi-dimensional arrays

19529671
getter	setter
normally when you create a custom attribute class any public property with a getter and a setter is automatically exposed to the person applying the attribute on the class so that the person using the attribute can specify the value of that property

19529671
getter	setter
i want a custom attribute class which exposes a getter and setter for a particular property but which does not allow this property to be specified as a named argument to the attribute on creation

19529676
debian	linux
running on linux debian os

19529691

19529695
stdout	stderr
make stdout empty with nothing in stderr

19529696
mp3	wav
the wave module can only open wav files so you need to convert the mp3 to wav

19529698
getter	setter
some versions of javascript also have getter and setter so properties may behave like functions even though their type is not function

19529737
maven	pom.xml
like the o.p. i have been fighting to find a maven pom.xml recipe that will allow me to pull in an official version of kafka from a public maven repository

19529748
getter	setter
as suggested by dtb in the comments you could use getter and setter methods instead but that probably wouldn t help you.

19529756
opera	google-chrome
it looks like web workers aren t available to you and aren t available in current versions of opera mini and the android browser but are in mobile google-chrome

19529756
put	get
they re a way to put some resource-intensive tasks in another thread so your main thread doesn t get held up useful to prevent the app page appearing to freeze for a moment

19529778
folder	directory
the other thing you can do is if there s an index.htm or whatever in the folder directory you can grep sed and cut your way through chaining wget to wget like so

19529801
min	max
you could almost certainly generalise to some min max monoid for your start and end args and combine it with ordering to get a one-liner but i ll leave that as an exercise for the reader

19529806
youtube	vimeo
fancybox media helper only support formats from popular video sites youtube vimeo dailymotion etc

19529820
ubuntu	linux
it is up to the people which create packages for linux distributions based upon openjdk redhat ubuntu etc to create rpms for the jdk and jre that include javafx

19529820
redhat	fedora
those software distributors then need to place the generated packages in their standard distribution code repositories fedora redhat network yum repositories

19529831
switching	screens
use css media queries to switching the image based on screens size

19529835
fast-forward	merge
if all goes well you will be able to then merge development into master which will act as a simple fast-forward merge

19529845
subtract	add
then you have to track accumulating rounding error and add or subtract accumulated error from calculated value if it reach whole unit

19529861
min	max
this requires digging in to the code to really understand but here s what i coded up to do something similar for max and min

19529903
hide	show
but jquery has its own show hide and toggle methods so you can simply use this

19529972
yacc	bison
if you re using a particularly old version of yacc that still has a fixed parser stack it may be a problem but recent versions of yacc berkeley yacc bison automatically expand their parse stack on demand so the only limit is available memory

chisel	verilog
currently there is not a well defined intermediate representation of chisel as it goes between the user source code and the specified c++ or verilog backends

19530063

however from what i ve read and carry over from clregion i understand that it should be possible to hit locationmanager didenterregion after the application is terminated

19530080
folder	directory
your terminal actually the shell in the terminal has a concept of current working directory which is what directory folder it is currently in

19530124

but mixing fgets with cout is a bit odd to begin with so just get rid of it and use cin instead

19530139
uilabel	uibutton
one simple work around is to use a uibutton with no title and to superimpose a uilabel

19530201
for-loop	arrays
if i were to implement it will be in the form of a for-loop that iterates through the arrays of char and assigns a value to each character in the arrays

19530325
sudoers	visudo
the command to properly edit sudoers is visudo

19530340
postgresql	mysql
this is mysql only i believe it can be adapted to others - certainly postgresql

19530346
superclass	subclassing
if you subclassing a weakly linked class and the superclass is unavailable then the subclassing also appears unavailable

19530393

what this does is trim any space chars off the input string and then parse it into an int

19530418
gridview	rowdatabound
i have a gridview to which i ve added a dropdownlist on edit in the rowdatabound event

19530420
ant	maven
the ant maven xjc command line all give same output

19530432

so the response to your question is that you can style scrollbars in ie webkit and opera but not in firefox

19530479
versioning	upgrade
i ve been using an older versioning of core plot and have recently upgrade to 1.4

19530522
spaces	delimiter
looks like in this case a fixed width reader is needed to inform the parser how to split the columns instead of just using spaces as delimiter

19530644
width	height
you may also want to keep the proper aspect ratio in the image uploaded by using 0 or nil as the width or height you want to be dependent on the other attribute

19530650

however if i need to add a new businessunit as well ef may put the inserts in the wrong sequence because it doesn t know that businessunitid is a fk to businessunit and i get errors from the database

19530763
imageview	picasso
i would like to keep the work to round the image in the ondraw canvas method in my circularimageview class as it is nicely contained and automatic as opposed to doing the process when setting up the imageview with picasso each and every time

ssl	https
the match specifies https but that site does not support ssl

19530864
cos	sin
that should work but if it doesn t try using cos for y and sin for x instead

19530905

int	double
so the compiler assumes it returns an int in eax and converts that int to a double

19530914
width	height
i want that image to shrink or expand depending on the browsers window height width

19530914
width	height
i can achieve this horizontally by using width 100 but the image div disappears entirely if i set height 100

19530914
width	height
i realise you must set body and html to have a height and width of 100 and i have done this to no avail

19530940
firefox	safari
i am also having trouble with the transition in firefox and safari if any one can also help me with that please

int	chars
currently you re casting the int to a chars so getting back unicode i guess while what you seem to be expecting is int as strings

19531209
for-loop	loops
but a for-loop is good when you want to loops through a certain number of items for instance all of them

19532178
post	put
in the app views post directory make a new file called index.html.erb then put the following code in there

19532204
implements	extends
so i don t quite get about a class taking a parameter as it wasn t in java but i d make a weak guess it s a bit like extends -inheritance- or implements

19532205

well a set of table cells will always fill to 100 width of the parent as well as 100 height of the parent which is usually determined by the largest child unless explicitly set

19532295
uicollectionview	uitableview
if you have control over all the child uiscrollview s you can implement uiscrollviewdelegate protocol but if you don t or your child uiscrollview is really a uitableview or uicollectionview then you can t really rely the uiscrollviewdelegate protocol but remember uiscrollview comes with a pangesturerecognizer and you can play with that

19532303
int	chars
still better to get in the habit of switching on chars or int since most other programming languages won t let you switch on strings

19532307
for-loop	loops
it looks like it gets to the last iteration of the for-loop and then gets caught in an infinite loops

19532337
spaces	delimiter
here is another method to do an index lookup on a spaces delimiter list of values

under this use case you need a template engine like velocity or freemarker to use a map-like data structure to render a string template there is no builtin module in java to do that

19532623
textview	imageview
it seems like what you were doing is creating a reference to another linearlayout which does not seem necessary to display the textview and imageview when you should just add those views to the categoryoption view itself

19532630
getter	setter
java beans are are plain java class with private attribute and public getter setter methods.

19532640
httprequest	httpresponse
core objects such as httpcontext httprequest and httpresponse

int	double
you don t want to do a double conversion to float then int because that can result in rounding errors

19532926
integer	fractions
also imo if you want the number to have two decimal places you should use float instead since the value of an integer cannot contain any fractions component and will always be like that

19532942
folder	directory
without going to the directory and checking the name of my .net folder

when talking about getter and setter in javascript you may be talking about one of two concepts

19533561
getter	setter
getter and setter as a concept like in any other oo language

19533561
getter	setter
in this case getter and setter are just regular functions so the value needs to be stored separately

19533561
getter	setter
this allows you to disambiguate the getter and setter from the property name since the getter and setter have the word get and set added to the name

19533561
getter	setter
in this case you need to store the property in another name so as not to share the same name with the getter setter

19533561
getter	setter
note that in the code above the value is stored in name but the getter setter is this.name which is a completely different variable

19533561
getter	setter
getter and setter as a mechanism in javascript

19533561
getter	setter
the syntax of getter and setter is similar to functions but introduces the get and set keywords in place of function

19533561
getter	setter

19540100
integer	unsigned
however endianness swap is often done with bit-shifting and masking and since unsigned integer types are most suitable for the job you cannot do it with floats the bit pattern is likely assigned to uint64_t before the operation

19540100
integer	unsigned
signed integer conversion doesn t have to be converted to unsigned integer first as bit operations work with them

19541001
stdout	stderr
then you have the stdin and stdout and stderr file handles pointers to some file which is an abstract data type

19541001
stdout	stderr
as you mention stdin stdout and stderr should be available in your program at startup after entering main ....

19541001
getchar	getline	fgets	getchar	fgets	getline
hence unless you fclose the stdin stream you can read it with getchar scanf getline fgets fscanf .

19541022
put	get
and to get the values for each one put this in a for-loop

19541041

19541174
ready	each
another thing i could do would be to check each file individually but a sum of all the files would be a rough and ready solution that should work

19541242
google-chrome	firefox
i ve seen this sort of setup used on various clients and platforms ie google-chrome firefox java clients on windows linux mac and it worked fine

19541334
uiview	subviews

19541418
factors	matrix
i have a 16x2 matrix with in the first column numerical values and in the second column also numerical values but actually they re position numbers so they need to be treated as a factors

hide	show
one possible solution is this scenario is to use a timer based hide function as show below

19541472

i know this is an old post but it was the first one i found when searching for how to find if a class can be resolved by ninject without actually calling get and risking an exception

19541543
implements	extends
public class mainactivity extends activity implements onitemclicklistener

19541605

for-loop	loops
i have it set up to check for a number then to go into the for-loop and loops through a series of rows looking for certain info

19541639
google-chrome	firefox
note that some solutions seem to work fine on google-chrome but don t work on firefox

19541697
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
i doubt having 5 for loops is ideal for performance especially as the very top for-loop is driven by another arrays fed into the service that can be anywhere from 30 to 200 items in length

19541703
accessor	properties
properties also generate accessor methods based on your stated intentions

19541704
width	height
and as you can see mucked around with the width and height manually but this gives me a red box in the upper left corner of the page with an empty scroll bar down the right hand side but again not what the examples show

19541728
google-chrome	firefox
on desktop browser like google-chrome firefox ie i am able to run my hosted html file using below url

19541863
hash	md5
the filename is md5 hash then we extract the first 6 characters in the string and build the folder structure from that

19541863
folder	directory
my understanding is that any folder you create on amazon s3 are actually just references and are not directory on the filesystem

19541871
google-chrome	firefox
this only happens in google-chrome or firefox ie is fine

19541907
ssl	https
however it s not possible to redirect an https url because of the priority between ssl negotiation and http headers

19541945
getter	setter
you can create a getter and setter for this wdoc use exchanger for it and don t forget make wdoc final

19541952
maven	pom.xml
open it in the maven pom.xml editor and the effective pom.xml tab will show you all of the required dependencies

19542146
google-chrome	firefox
under google-chrome firefox ie10 this code works just fine - getjson hits the url which is valid and is not cross domain returns 200 ok and returns the data which is passed through to the success function as you d expect

19542168
for-loop	arrays
the code should return all id s as arrays in addarticles t function and then using for-loop should return each id using selectarticle s function

19542198
subnet	packets
if you used a router instead of a switch it wouldn t work because the ips belong to different subnet and routers route ip packets not ethernet packets

19542213
versioning	upgrade
i ve just upgrade mysql with homebrew to versioning 5.6.13 and the problem is gone

19542214
jar	war
best practices if you have a web-application like mine and the classes for the webapp managed beans might be reused in other projects it is the recommended way the maven way to package these classes into a separate jar and make the war depend on this jar

19542214
jar	war
the jar is then packaged with the ear but not inside the war

19542220
maven	pom.xml
however without being able to access external pom.xml files i cannot perform these checks via maven dependency tree

19542228
octal	hex
gawk since version 3.1 supports non-decimal octal and hex literal numbers by default though using the --posix switch turns that off as expected

19542228
atof	strtod
the normal workaround in cases like this is to use the defined numeric string behaviour where a numeric string is to effectively be parsed as the c standard atof or strtod function that supports 0x -prefixed numbers

19542233
google-chrome	firefox
the code just rocks on ie and firefox but does not work on google-chrome

19542314
oncreate	recreate
in your activitya in oncreate you know if the activity is recreate or not by checking if bundle attribute is not-null

19542320
x86	64bit
for instance if wrapper.exe is compiled as x86 and you install it using the 64bit installutil the process cannot load the 32 bit wrapper.exe assembly and will throw a badimageformatexception

19542334
width	height
it looks ok on my pc if i remove the width and height

19542342
width	height
once you ve got the fontmetrics object you can use methods like charswidth getheight and getascent to determine the appropriate width and height of your string depending on what you mean by height see the explanation on page 73 here to understand some of the basics about font sizing in pixels

19542390
folder	directory
these thousands of files are being copied from your working directory to your server or more appropriately workspace s configuration folder for tomcat

19542451
nexus	artifactory
sonatype nexus certainly has this see artifact procurement jfrog artifactory seems to enable this as well through license control both as extras in paid editions

19542466
width	margin
i have 8px in chrome so your body s width is 100 + left margin + right margin which is of course more than 100

19542468

i would like to put them into a dropdown however cannot get this working

19542520
getter	setter
for our pure data classes we don t use getter or setter

19542520
getter	setter
when refactoring old code i would like to be able to quickly replace typically eclipse-generated calls to getter setter with direct field access

19542545
width	height
given that i know the width height format etc

19542549
google-chrome	firefox
i ve done this in firefox and google-chrome but ie8 is not responding to get the svg element so now i can t to get the byte code from the given div element

ssid	wlan
netsh wlan set hostednetwork mode allow ssid networkname key netpassword

19542610

19542638
compass	singularitygs
i am not sure what i am doing wrong but just copying singularitygs and breakpoint to the compass.app extension folder creates error on compass.app as well as the compass command line execution

19542656
google-chrome	safari
it works perfect on google-chrome and safari

19542668
accessor	properties
however if you want to create a new instance of someobject dynamically when accessing someobject.obj or you want to return an existing object based on conditions that shoul be re-evaluated every time the properties is accessed you will need to use a function or an accessor

19542692
free	malloc
you are trying to free an address that was not returned by malloc

19542692
free	malloc
the address that malloc returned via new is x and the address that was passed to free via delete is virtual_derived

19542790
stateless	stateful
it s definitely confusing when you move from a stateful to a stateless world

19542806
lisp	scheme
just as a matter of playing stupid lisp tricks i d point out that in scheme the analog to

19542814
getter	setter
es5 specifies getter and setter via the get and set keyword or the object.defineproperty function so you can make functions behave like properties think innerhtml

19542857
width	height
the widget provider file defines width and height as

min	max
i would like to have all of these properties displayed in a propertygrid with the addition of a subcategory class for each one which contains 3 properties - min max and step numeric values

19568895
min	max
this means that the user should be able to input a start value min end value max and a step value to the main property grid

19568895
min	max
from there i need to retrieve the user input values for min max and step and create a list of variations

19568895
min	max
if the user inputs min 10 max 20 step 2 then i should be able to retrieve those values in the code behind and create a list of possible inputs for the main property which will be 10 12 14 16 18 20

19568895
min	max
the initializing values of min max and step should be as follows

19568895
min	max
min main property default value max main property default value step 1

19568895
min	max
from there user should be able to change the min max and step properties

19568895
min	max
in that case i do not care if the user is able to change the main property 6 or not since i will need all the variations between min max with the particular step

this algorithm produces values in the half-open range min max

19571817
range	max
that is max is outside the range and simply denotes the boundary

19571817
range	min
since we re talking about range of integers this range is equivalent to the closed range min max-1 .

19571817
range	min
note that rand max-min + min is just a generalization of the rule you ve apparently already learned that rand n produces values in the range 0 - n-1

inherited	properties
i am using display properties inherited to flag the menu option as not selected

19572808
stdout	stderr
what s happening is that you re redirecting stderr to stdout s filehandle perhaps dev stdout

19572808
stdout	stderr
however stderr is still pointing to dev stdout

19572808
stdout	stderr
to ignore all output first redirect stdout then redirect stderr to stdout

19572808
stdout	stderr
or more simply since you re using bash specifically redirect stdout and stderr together

19573615
super	abstract
if it needs a model then it should be in the parameter list or if the objects state depends on the model and execute can only be run with a model then theexecutor should be an abstract class that holds the model and each subclasses constructor should call super model

19573676
hide	show
you can store the state of you divs show hide in a cookie and reevaluate the cookie on page load refresh

19573783

int	double
on the last one even though you want an int display of the number you can not use the d option with a double

19574808
google-chrome	safari
looks like this workaround works in google-chrome and safari but not in ie8 9 10

19574809
for-loop	loops
well if _ uses native .foreach then that s easily order of magnitude slower than for-loop but still your problem is 4 nested loops right now so you might not even need the additional 10x after fixing that

19574821
for-loop	loops
i originally had all three of the if statements inside the nested for-loop but my instructor suggested that i move the first two of them to the outside loops because the first two if statements don t utilize the variable j at all so there is no need to have them inside the nested loops

19574834
google-chrome	safari
i had the same problem in safari and google-chrome the only ones i ve tested but i just did something that seems to work at least i haven t been able to reproduce the problem since i added the solution

you have capture the mousedown and mouseup events

19575011
mouseup	mousedown
next catch the mouseup event and compare the coordinates of with the mousedown state

19575028
public	protected
you can always use a test class which inherits from your own class where you expose a public method to forward the call to the protected one and use that for your test

19575038
free	malloc
and a typical malloc or free takes some dozens of microseconds

19575038
free	malloc
of course you ll want to be careful to avoid memory leaks by free -ing appropriately the malloc -ed data

19575038
free	strdup	free	malloc	strdup	malloc
you might consider using boehm s conservative garbage collector then you ll code gc_malloc and gc_strdup instead of malloc and strdup and you won t bother free -ing data

19575073
bytearrayoutputstream	inputstream
as you seem to not suffer from resource restrictions you can stream the data to a bytearrayoutputstream and then forward the resulting byte array or some inputstream or data source based on it

19575083
button	checkbox
i have a html source code which has a text box and upon typing in it and on clicking the submit button gives you the input text like a to-do list .i want that text along with a checkbox

19575101
firefox	safari
something you should consider though is that older browser versions require the prefixes namely firefox 3.6 and safari 4

19575124
google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari
it doesn t work in google-chrome opera safari or ie10

19575176

19575278
128bit	64bit
i need to modulo this 128bit number with a 64bit number

19575321
fgets	atoi
the usual advice on exactly how to do this is to use fgets or something similar to read the lines and then process the contents using atoi or sscanf or something similar

canopy	ptvs
python tools for visual studio ptvs will typically automatically detect canopy and show it as python 2.7 64-bit

19575436
canopy	ptvs
you can check to see if it is detecting canopy by selecting environment options in ptvs

19575436
canopy	ptvs
if the python interpreter ptvs is finding is not canopy then it sounds like you have another version of python installed

19575436
canopy	ptvs
the upcoming canopy 1.2 release in a couple of weeks will include more complete integration with ptvs and visual studio that will automate this and remove the need for canopy to be the default python environment

19575459
post	get
i expect the page to post back to the server asynchronously and my save function should get called the break point never gets hit

19575479
width	height
well if you know the dimensions of the image you could divide its width and height by 3 your number of rows and columns and this is your zone dimensions

19575479
width	height
you then could take the mouse s click point relative to the top left of your picture and then divide its width by the zone with and its height by the zone height and then get its integer floor value you could get which region it is

19575485
invokerequired	begininvoke

19575645
subtract	add
i m trying to have the function ripit not my name take this list of dewey decimal numbers and add or subtract from those numbers if certain conditions are met all numbers between 100 and 200 add 100 as in first else if statement and return the answer when the button is clicked along with a text notification or alert that says this has been changed

pow and sqrt return double - read about c math functions and passing double

19576192
free	malloc
also you need to free the memory you malloc ed array

19576217
versioning	upgrade
i would upgrade to the latest node versioning and see if you can reproduce locally if so the first diagnosis was correct then search your code for path.exists and replace it with fs.exists which should fix the issue

19576253
portrait	landscape
my app utilizes both landscape mode and portrait mode and the user can switch between the two at will

19576274

instances	transient	persistent	transient
the nature of spot instances is they are transient so no you can t make the instances persistent

19576405
folder	directory
i think your only issue here is that you were grabbing a new file from a new directory and putting it into a folder that didn t exist yet i could be mistaken

19576419
post	get
then it will be called regardless of get or post

19576431

19576499
hide	show
if you go the manual route you can just use show and hide like below or use setvisiblelayers like this

19576499
hide	show
a simple show and hide in your layer logic would be

19576516
integer	unsigned
for an 8 bit integer 1000 0000 signed this is -128 while unsigned this is 128

19576529
hash	md5
with either solution if you desire to know if the file is the same in both places you can use an md5 hash on both ends to find out

19576573
width	height
and simply flip the height and width values as needed since bounds will always be in portrait orientation

19576573

19576726
hide	show
and than you can hide other jpanel and show this jpanel with setvisible function

19576756
runtimeexception	classnotfoundexception	nullpointerexception	classnotfoundexception	nullpointerexception	runtimeexception
the nullpointerexception is caused by your appalling practice of ignoring the eofexception that is thrown if the file is empty and indeed all ioexceptions classnotfoundexception runtimeexception etc etc etc

19576792
hide	show
if you have multiple sibling divs that you want to hide show on click you could give them all the hidethis class and replace the with

19576823
submit	submission
another way would be to have the legacy code after submission spit out a form with the data in it and some javascript to trigger submit on page load

19576824
integer	fractions
dividing by an integer causes any fractions to be truncated

19576838

the first provide a very simple nfa dfa implementation in python with conversion from nfa to dfa

19577320
nfa	dfa
the second site provides a long discussion on nfa vs dfa including numerous code examples mostly in c and links to external libraries that i know little of

19577320
nfa	dfa
the third and fourth links provide the source code of two regex engines implementation developped by the second article s author including parsing from regex to nfa then conversion from nfa to dfa

19577320
nfa	dfa
otherwise i would mention that most real world regex engines use nfa not dfa because of some extended features that simply can t be performed with a dfa

19577325
switching	screens
this is the flow of switching between activities 1 - 2- 3 - 2 black screens

19577369

could also use box-sizing border-box or conflicting absolute positions

19577416
slideup	slidedown
the big change you ll see is on the two lines with slidedown and slideup

19577480
division	modulo
in doing this you will need to re-implement the indexer so you can use division and modulo to find the correct indexes into your backing store

19577484
post	get
i tried manually manipulating and sending the data via the post function but since i need to redirect the page upon submission that results in a post request followed by a get request

19577495
ant	maven
that particular code is designed to be built with ant instead of maven

19577495
maven	pom.xml
you need to write a little pom.xml file for it so that when you build it on your computer with mvn clean install maven will generate a .jar file the artifact and put it in your local maven repository .m2 directory

19577501
post	get
my test is almost word for word out of the post i can t get it to work for a full date time string

int	chars
glcolor3ub is the version for unsigned chars in c c++ that is a 8-bit int without a sign

19577620
int	chars
glcolor3b is the version for chars which is a signed 8-bit int

19577633
floating-point	fixed-point
no matter which function you use unless it is glcolor3f ... they all do fixed-point to floating-point unit conversion

19577633
floating-point	integer	floating-point	fixed-point	integer	unsigned
during fixed-point to floating-point normalization the range of the integer data type is mapped directly between -1.0 signed 0 unsigned and 1.0

19577657
children	parent
if you are not able to leverage linqtosql entity framework or some other custom querying method and you must load all the parent and their children in the database per the manor you suggest then your first option is most likely superior

19577657
children	parent
in the second option you ll have as many queries as there are children plus the query for the parent

19577692

a row in your listview contains three views one imageview and two textview s if your cursor has two rows then the viewbinder will be called 6 times

19577733
filtering	grouping
i want to create a filtering for list view where i want to show all the records created by user grouping

19577733
filtering	grouping
how can i create a filtering to display all records created by only the grouping members

19577739
post	put
as for the benefits of closures i can t put it any better than stack overflow legend jaif from this post

19577761
width	font-size
next you d have to define a class for all drop down items and then make their font-size smaller and apply the same width as menu items so they aren t slightly larger than the menu items

19577775
put	get
with that code the attempted_path was set from the put request so the first redirect tried to do a get on the uri used by the put in this case

19577775
put	get
it looks like that will still do a double-redirect on timeout but for a put it will use the request.referrer in this case so should get set correctly

19577789
daemons	systemd
os is win7 64 on amd64 platform with 4gb of systemd memory so it show not be a memory issue and there are no gradle daemons running when i get the above stack trace in eclipse juno

19577797
google-chrome	firefox
edit apparently this works in google-chrome not in firefox

19577815
google-chrome	firefox
i ve found a strange difference in behavior between google-chrome and firefox and am wondering if anyone knows what is going on

19577879
for-loop	arrays
it would be neater to build an arrays of the urls and echo from within a for-loop later

19577904
google-chrome	firefox
i was having this problem on firefox but not google-chrome and at first i saw several references to making sure your server recognizes the svg mime type as mentioned in these articles

19577933
move	drag
i have multiple instances of this carousel but when i click and drag one of the carousel all the carousels move

19577981
children	parent
this is a normal real word scenario and it s quite frequent you can imagine a football team you can have some game stats associated to player s children some associated to the team parent but also some other information like tickets sold for each game different dimension that cannot be associated to a specific player but the for sure have more detail than just at team level

19577996
ssl	https
i have a cloud service saas application that is running on azure using https which ssl certificate is expiring soon

19578045
gridview	rowdatabound
and your rowdatabound event for the gridview would be

19578083
range	max	range	min	min	max
i m planning to settle for just taking the min and max values then breaking the range up into n say 10 buckets of size max - min n

19578088
singleton	facade
the workaround is to use your extension method class as just a facade to a regular class and all the static methods in your extension class just call the real class probably using a singleton

19578130
draggable	droppable
what should happen is when you drag a color from the draggable container into the droppable container it should update the text which is linked to the scope object items

19578138
pop-up	dialog
my keychain access dialog window pop-up and wants the id_rsa password

19578278
comparator	comparable
if you do not then you can either have card implement the comparable interface or what seems like a better solution since you may not always want to sort by the same criteria create a comparator class for cards

19578278
comparator	comparable
so in this example since the list is what needs to be sorted since card does not itself implement comparable you can create a comparator and pass both the list and comparator into the collections.sort method

19578328
spaces	delimiter
assuming a word is a group of characters delimiter by spaces then inputstring.split will produce an array of words which you can then count

19578355
copying	overwrite
this ensures that you don t waste time trying to copy files that were there when you started and also ensure that you don t accidentally overwrite a file that is created after you start copying things across

19578393
subtraction	addition
there is also a flaw in your addition and subtraction code

19578393
subtraction	addition
you need to consider how to do rational addition subtraction see rational addition subtraction

19578402
put	get
i am not sure why...its pretty weird i can t seem to get it work if i put the image file in other folders

19578424
put	get
like in webbrowser control we can put code behind mouse click event and get the mouse position etc

19578431
fadein	fadeout
i am trying to fadeout a div and load data into it through .load and then fadein on the div

19578438
put	get
the problem is that i had to move all network connections to threads so i need to wait until i get this data to put it on the spinner

19578447
spaces	delimiter
use the split method of the string class to split the input string on the spaces character delimiter so you end up with a string array of words

19578447
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
then loops through that arrays using a modified for-loop to print each item of the arrays

19578486
charat	indexof
string charat indexof length substring touppercase

19578499
put	get	post	get	post	put
it will get all the post items first time and if a query put in search box and submitted it will return a filtered queryset

19578499
post	get
for non-filtered queryset the next page will get the next two post without any problem but for filtered queryset i can see the queryset is correctly reflected by see less pages but the next page gets me the second page of non-filtered queryset not the filtered queryset

19578502
hash	salt
this article discusses the correct approach secure hash and salt for php passwords

19578502
scrypt	pbkdf2
do not invent this from scratch you must an industry standard and strong method such as scrypt bcrypt or pbkdf2 and before using them you need to study how they work and make sure you re implementing them properly

19578517
width	height
this fixes the measurement of the width and height of the textview space available for the text

19578521
setinterval	settimeout
as long as updateweather doesn t have severe performance issues and the interval is short settimeout won t be a product and i believe you mean setinterval not settimeout for recurring checks

19578574
capitalize	toupper
state 2 if input is a character output capitalize using toupper

19578581
int	chars
home fatima learning_image_transport src my_publisher.cpp in function â int main int chars â

19578602
google-chrome	safari
this looks like a bug in google-chrome and safari but google-chrome is the focus of this question

19578606
int	chars
you can print letters by casting the int values to chars and adding the appropriate offset for the ascii chars you want

19578619
google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome ie the content is positioned correctly but safari is interpreting the styles differently see

19578619
google-chrome	safari
any explanation as to why safari is displaying things differently than google-chrome

19578625
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i tried to reproduce the error on google-chrome firefox ie and ios safari and everything worked fine

19578700
int	chars
that converts the chars line to an int value gets stored as an int

19578700
int	chars
converting it into an int using atoi will make you truncate values atoi will stop reading from str as soon as a non-numerical chars has been read

19578741
put	get
we may want to put the call to get in a method like getfirstoflist list but we just learned that such a method can t exist because it would accept two totally unrelated types

19578741
put	get
and you can put any number you like in a but you ll only get object s from it

19578764
for-loop	loops
note that you could use a for-loop with a range call instead of a while loops here to loops c times

19578771
button	checkbox
use actionlistener instead how to use button checkbox and radio button

19578781
qobject	qwidget
overload qwidget resizeevent and qobject timerevent

19578826
box-sizing	border-box
you can do this with box-sizing border-box

19578843
profiling	debugging
you can user debugging api or profiling api unmanaged to be able to examine what s happening in runtime

19578844
children	parent
when i try to visit the parent resource the array for children is empty

19578865
hash	salt
you could use bcrypt password.create passing it the email to generate those hash along with a unique salt

19578865
hash	salt
now you don t have to worry about using a fixed salt as bcrypt has already stored it with the hash for you

19578881
for-loop	loops
in my opinion your problem is more suited to using a for-loop than a while loops

19578920
httpconnection	downloading
in my crawler i have threads downloading a static distant page using httpconnection

19578939
put	get
now i put this code use parse.com do not get any kind of error the code always super clean but when i go to make the run the table does not show me any data as if it were connected to the cell or as a custom class if there was no reuse identifier instead both steps have been made .

19578980
viewdidload	viewdidappear
see difference between viewdidload and viewdidappear for an explanation

19579002
google-chrome	safari
fiddle is here - tested in google-chrome and safari

19579002
google-chrome	safari
looks like safari aligns the before pseudo-element to the span element whereas google-chrome seems to align it to the text within the span element which is centered

19579014
int	chars
the purport of this code is to show how the echoing and buffered input outputs work and in the code they have a type int declared for as i understand chars

19579014
int	chars
i m not on firm footing with type casting as it is and this int chars discrepancy is undermining all notions that i have regarding data types and compatibility

19579024
put	get	post	get	post	put
however the only accepted methods in a form are get or post so you wouldn t want to submit a form if you wanted to make an ajax put or delete request

19579038
int	chars
putchar similarly takes an int argument when you d think it might take a chars

19579040
integer	unsigned
the timeout for waitforsingleobject is actually a dword which is an unsigned 32 bit integer

19579040
integer	unsigned
infinite is defined as 0xffffffff but -1 mapped into an unsigned type wraps and becomes this value in most integer representations

19579049
google-chrome	firefox
sure time it with developer tools in firefox or google-chrome

19579057
int	chars
getchar returns an int type because it is designed to be able to return a value that cannot be represented by chars to indicate eof

19579136
for-loop	loops
in this case i think it s best if you use while loops rather than for-loop

19579137
hide	show
you can check that bool everytime the app is launched and show or hide respective screen based on that

19579150
put	get
when i put a form inside a telerik tabstrip the form elements are not get rendered in the html

19579178
getchar	fgetc
the getc fgetc and getchar functions return int because they are capable of handling binary data as well as providing an in-band signal of an error or end-of-data condition

19579178
unsigned	short
there is a little bit more to this because in the design of c values of short and char type signed or unsigned undergo promotion when they are evaluated in expressions

19579178
int	chars
in classic c before prototypes were introduced when you pass a chars to a function it s actually an int value which is passed

19579178
int	chars
when we call this as func c where c has type chars the expression c is subject to the usual promotion and becomes a value of type int

19579178
int	chars
a parameter of type chars actually passes through as a value of type int

19579178
int	chars
another legacy is that chars constants like a actually have type int and not chars

19579178
int	chars
but as far as data manipulation in the processor was concerned they were thinking of the values as being word-sized int values that chars processing is essentially data manipulation based on int

19579181
snap.svg	raphael

mouseover	mouseout
i have a div with a mouseout and a mouseover event which change the div s opacity

19579240
ant	maven
if you want to use checkstyle findbugs or pmd and have them fail your build you will have to depend on an external build tool like ant maven or gradle

19585930
memcpy	memmove
i understand that memmove and memcpy difference is that memmove handles the memory overlap case

19585930
memcpy	memmove
in libgcc the memmove is similar to memcpy both just go though one byte and byte so the performance should be almost same even after optimization

19585930
memcpy	memmove
someone has measured this and got this article memcpy memmove and speed over safety

19585930
memcpy	memmove
even i don t think the memmove can be faster than memcpy but there should be no big difference at least on intel platform

19585930
memcpy	memmove
so in what platform and how memcpy can be significantly faster than memmove if there is none why providing two similiar functions instead of just memmove and lead to a lots of bug

19585930

apart from -webkit-padding-start being nonstandard the difference is that when writing direction is right to left -webkit-padding-start puts padding to the right effectively gets converted to padding-right

19586210
hebrew	persian
so the padding would be on the left of the start of text in western languages but to the right of the start of the text which runs from right to left in arabic persian or hebrew texts

19586229
verilog	hdl
and also if possible the model object name in verilog hdl

to make the code pop-up as a modal dialog

19586339

in onmeasure of viewb i collected viewa s width and height immediately and then called setmeasureddimension

a c compiler that provides ieee 754-compliant floating-point can only replace a single-precision division by a constant by a single-precision multiplication by the inverse if said inverse is itself representable exactly as a float

19589973
multiplying	multiplication
so a programmer alex may be confident that f 2.0f will be compiled as if it had been but if it is acceptable for alex to multiplying by 0.10f instead of dividing by 10 alex should express it by writing the multiplication in the program or by using a compiler option such as gcc s -ffast-math

this question is about transforming a single-precision division into a double-precision multiplication

but when the user clicks the psi radio button then i want only the first checkbox to be checked and the others should be unchecked

19590607

on initial page load the radio button gets set and this causes the checkbox to update accordingly

this will not affect any other checkbox or radio button

for your file to get into cuda memory space you will have to use the cuda memcpy command after allocating memory for the information so do a cudamalloc your malloc params here and a cudamemcpy your memcpy params here after you have loaded parsed and stored in memory the file as you would normally in c++

i m interested in understanding how to keep such an hypervisor within the cpu prevented from being flushed to ram or at least encrypt data before being sent to memory disk

19591500
disk	ram
assumes we are running on bare metal and we can bootstrap this using drtm late launch we load from untrusted memory disk but we can only load the real operating system if we can unseal a secret which is used to decrypt the operating system and which take place after having set the proper rules to make sure anything sent to ram is encrypted

19591563
int	double
i believe the following works as a sort comparison function for positive int provided the int type used is substantially narrower than the double type 32-bit int and 64-bit double and the log10 routine used returns exactly correct results for exact powers of 10 which a good implementation does

19591563
int	double
the int portions of the logarithms of 31 and 310 use different numbers of bits so there are different numbers of bits left for the significand so they end up being rounded to slightly different values. as long as the int type is substantially narrower than the double type the calculated limit will be much larger than the error in log10

parent div has no width and height

uilabel	uibutton	uilabel	nsstring
i would think that if you added a uilabel as a subview of a uibutton and setup the label to only show two lines before truncating you could then detect if the displayed text was different than the actual text you used when you created the label by using nsstring s isequaltostring method

visit this lightweight js ajax library you will need to use ajax as suggested implementing and using jquery will be the fastest way but do go for other options like zepto mootools etc

using screen width and height to infer device identity is really bad practice

19592395

g.fillrect 0 0 width height

so i used getwidth getheight instead of using the exact variable width and height

equinox	knopflerfish
you could try take out the felix manifest parser class or equinox or knopflerfish equivalent into a standalone project and share it with the community

19592492

as you can see you have to input width and height of your screen

19592492
width	height
then get height and width of parameters that you set in

19592492
width	height
your set ratio is equal to height width

19592492
width	height
if you want camera to look good on your screen then height width ratio of parameters that you set to camera must be the same as height minus status bar width ratio of your screen

google-chrome	firefox
you ll see that if you type in the input before the replacement occurs you ll get the log message in google-chrome but not in firefox

i think it is because you didn t specified the width and height of the element you are trying to animate

19592519
width	height	width	border-box	height	border-box
border-box doesn t just ignore padding value it needs width and height value that includes padding and border

this is reflected in the documentation for example in the introduction and also in the source code for example in the comments of modules core include opencv2 core cvdef.h and the fact that it defines uint to be a 32-bit unsigned integer but doesn t define a corresponding signed type

i want form1 to stay as such and hide form3 and show form2

19597465

19597478
post	get
the following function untested but copied from one of my extensions and cleaned up a bit demonstrates how to get post data

19597782
integer	fractions
integer division in java truncates any fractions part so it can remain an int

19597792
put	get
do put parens after the name since in an expression you have to treat a model property as a function to get its value

19597807
button	checkbox
you can use custom radio button css only that looks like checkbox demo on jsbin and demo on jsfiddle

19597848

19597919
post	get
when using a form on post1.php i could get post3.php to echo nope post3. which shows that post values don t stick around after a redirect

19597919
post	get
however when using the current version of post1.php i could only get post2.php to echo nope post2. meaning that setting _post variables manually doesn t work or i could on the validation page enter and it would save the post variable through one more redirect

19598003
implements	extends
so because the oraclecommand class extends the dbcommand class it implements the async versions of it s execute methods

19598039
textchanged	keyup
instead of keyup event subscribe to textchanged event on your combobox textbox

int	chars
the sizes of the built-in types chars short int long are implementation specific and platform specific

19598090

umount	mdadm
now i m building a raid setup routine that involves partprobe parted - rm mklabel mkpart mdadm - stop zero-superblock create dd mkfs and ultimately mount umount

19598220
memcpy	strcpy
because your arrays appear to be char-arrays and not strings you cannot use strcpy etc you must use memcpy or copy elements by hand

19598248
apache	nginx
note serving files via django in bigger systems will lead to inefficiency - better serve them via simple http server apache or nginx

19598285
put	get
you could have a constructor for creating dvd movies to put into the collection but it would be useful to get a dvd movie by an id which an indexer would allow for

19598340
onresume	onpause
any way you can release your resources from mediaplayer when your application is going to backgound onpause and on onresume you can re-assign resources to mediaplayer

19598363
puts	gets
instead do an explicit gets nil to cause it to take in the whole input at once then call puts on that and add another n at the end of the regex so it doesn t leave a blank line

19598364
express	node.js
i m using express web framework over node.js

19598375
getter	setter
this doesnt work because the getter setter method of checking and savings are located in the checking and savings class not the superclass bankaccount

19598410
uiview	calayer
i think for such purposes as changing position and opacity of a view you d better operate with a uiview object uibutton in your case instead of its calayer property

19598420
folder	directory
when the project files are moved as a working directory of the git repository with a git metadata folder at the same level they re still under the eclipse control as eclipse workspace

19598430
post	get
usually 405 is returned when server expects post but request tries to do a get

19598549
post	get
i was able to get this question answered in a forum post at imagemagick t 24263

19598633
setinterval	settimeout
the of using the complete callback works because jquery animations internally use settimeout or perhaps setinterval and thus yield code execution so that the browser can continue reacting to user input and updating the display

19598634
setinterval	settimeout
but instead a good idea is to use setinterval or settimeout

19598642
post	get
pay attention that this api accepts post request since request for that many users may exceed get limits

19598664
opencv	emgucv
i am swapping from emgucv to opencv so that i can try some of the opencv functions that are not yet wrapped by emgucv

19598664
opencv	emgucv
looking at the emgucv source code i notice that they call the opencv c functions rather than c++ to initialise capture from a file or a webcam so i wrote the following test code with help from this answer

19598667
junit	mockito
i am using java 7 junit 4.10.0 mockito 1.9.5 and eclipse juno running in windows 7 as my ide

i have a plugin that calls some requests which doesn t expose the xmlhttprequest jqxhr object

19598729
memcpy	memmove
memcpy vs memmove excellent info here btw. i have been reading up and it would seem to me that unlike what is colloquially said for example at cppreference note memcpy has been changed to memmove since taking this quote

19598729
memcpy	memmove
so it would appear that implementing std copy in terms of memcpy is not possible but using memmove is actually a pessimization

19598736
multiplying	multiplication	multiplying	transpose
if we only have two pairs of sequences then the problem is quite easy since it reduces to simple matrix multiplication an n x t matrix for a_i - a_t and an n x t matrix for b_i - b_t where you multiplying the first with the transpose of the second

19598764
powermock	jacoco
there are some problems with jacoco if you combine it with mockito or powermock

last i read the best options were scrypt bcrypt or pbkdf2

19598878
for-loop	loops
i am thinking of using a for-loop to call this test multiple times with background run with different parameters set up in the beginning of loops

19598886
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
largelocalstorage uses the filesystemapi on google-chrome indexeddb in ie and firefox and websql in safari

19598941
submit	submission
do i need to actually use a button rather than submit with a jquery submit function in order to prevent submission

19598942
google-chrome	safari
as slace suggested indexeddb will solve your problem but it isn t supported in safari yet and google-chrome doesn t let you stored blobs in indexeddb yet

19598942
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
the largelocalstorage project bridges those gaps and gives you large persistent storage in ie google-chrome firefox safari and opera

19598951
unsigned	short
will operate on whatever the t type is if it is an unsigned short it will still operate properly but also requires a null terminated value - that is the last value must be t 0 - if an array of t s passed to it is not null terminated behavior is undefined as well

19598976
width	height
this will change your webview s height and width to 200

19598993
post	get
i am new to django i am trying to get data from post but getting error csrf cookie not set i tried alot to find the solution on google and stackoverflow via google too but failed

i have tested this scenario of perspective usage a w3c validated webpage with all necessary and optional css browser tags in ie firefox google-chrome and opera and found different all inaccurate results

i have problems with json on google-chrome and opera for several days i managed to fix some errors but now i m stuck and can t find a way out

19599150
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
in firefox everything is ok but in google-chrome and opera function is never called

19599156
appdata	uninstaller
if the app is uninstaller the appdata contents will be cleared out such that on reinstall and launch you d collect credentials again

19599158
perl	tcl
you will find it used as a standalone language much like perl tcl or even visual basic

19599186
mouse	keyboard
tell these apart because keyboard mouse and triggertype information

19599205
put	get
using -i would probably work but you likely want to script this and get it put in the right order

19599208
memcpy	strcpy
iâ m a huge fan of c++ functions over c equivalent i will never use std strcpy or std memcpy thereâ s a perfectly fine std copy

19599208
memcpy	strcpy
one reason to use c++ functions exclusively is interface uniformity for instance both std strcpy and std memcpy have atrocious interfaces

19599316
teamcity	dotcover
from what i have read the excludefromcodecoverage should be automatically excluded when using dotcover but i m not sure if this was true when running via teamcity so i included the filter as mentioned in attribute filter syntax for code coverage in teamcity trying both excludefromcodecoverage and excludefromcodecoverageattribute with no luck

19599321
maya	3dsmax
users don t want nodes created and saved from an older version of maya or 3dsmax to complain of unknown node when opened in a newer version because the developer of mental ray decided to drop it which would in turn create annoyed users

19599326
hide	show
this will show the image quickly then hide it slowly then wait for half a second then show it slowly and then hide it quickly

19599395
for-loop	arrays
if you want to go faster and iterate through the arrays without knowing the length you just have to use foreach instead of for-loop

19599415
post	get
most browsers makes a get request to the new location even if the original request was a post

19599424
salt	md5
i have a vbulletin database that i m trying to switch users to a custom system i ve converted the usernames and the passwords i then converted the double md5 d passwords to sha256 but i m left with one issue which is the salt

19599431
google-chrome	firefox
tested in google-chrome 30 and firefox 24

19599464
guava	lambdaj
the guava library is much more popular than lambdaj and does allow you to avoid for while loops by using preficates and filter methods

19599467
post	get
i ve search for this problem read all the post tried the various suggestions but still can t get it to work

19599474
hide	show
i also had to comment your hide statement to show the rest of the rows

19599489
hash	salt
without a non sensitive identifier to perform retrievals with it would seem i would be stuck just doing a basic hash operation without a unique salt i can still pepper them

19599489
hash	salt
anything i store in my own db would be just as vulnerable as what is being passed as a token so there s no point in creating a map table of raw login id s to salt and hash login id s

19599511
range	max	range	min	min	max
my plot range is basically set up to the min - max of each and the graph data shows up fine.

19599522
ubuntu	linux
some linux distros ubuntu for one package their php with separate php.ini files for cli and apache

19599528
width	height
yet i have to force set a width and height on the border otherwise it makes like width and height of 2

19599528
width	height
this leaves me with having to put a fixed height and width in what i don t like as if the text is too big it gets cutoff

19599571
mouseover	mouseout
ie8 behaves as if the child elements are not actually decedents of the parent element or as if the tooltip is using the mouseover and mouseout events

19599571
mouseleave	mouseenter
however we are using the mouseenter and mouseleave events for this tooltip

19599571
mouseleave	mouseenter
however i have tried explicitly attaching the mouseenter and mouseleave events to the .fieldset div to display and hide the tooltip but i still get the same behavior

19599571
mouseleave	mouseenter
based on the console log from the above events the mouseenter and mouseleave events are firing as they should

19599591
median	percentile
the median is the value that accumulates 50 of the values the 50 percentile

19599608
width	height
you need to make the inside of the div s have 100 height and width

19599611
sorting	grouping
i don t understand how can i use sorting with such kinds of as selected fields and grouping by

19599629
streamingmarkupbuilder	xmlslurper
you could parse the xml using xmlslurper and afterwards print the xml nodes you wish to with streamingmarkupbuilder

19599674
getter	setter
many of swing s core components follow a simple getter setter pattern

19599674
getter	setter
that is you can get a property value and set a property value note not all getter have a corresponding setter though

19599674
button	checkbox
you might like to take a look at how to use button checkbox and radio button for some more details

19599679
opera	google-chrome
t receive json data from php in google-chrome and opera

19599715
children	parent
so unless i m missing something somewhere this should fix you up as the grid will handle the sizes of its children for you and consume the space necessary in its parent

19599730
versioning	upgrade
another potential issue is that some versioning of the framework do in-place upgrade

19599733
mdpi	hdpi	screens	hdpi	screens	mdpi
android resizes images from res drawable according your screens resolution ldpi mdpi hdpi etc.

19599772
ubuntu	debian
host os tested on ubuntu and debian

19599780
next	except
i know that the problem is not that this code is not being run as the transition to the next scene works exactly as expected when the button is pressed except the button animation does not play

19599808
prepare	bindparam
in simple terms can someone explain what i am doing wrong here - i am simply trying to insert into a db with with prepare and bindparam this is inserting 0 and null into all the fields

19599975
uilabel	uitextview
the sizewithfont method will return the size needed to display the text in a uilabel which is slightly different than that for a uitextview due to content insets line spacing etc

19600007
width	height
things like width height will work but checking orientation won t

19600090
serializable	deserialization
then i do the proper serializable deserialization using the second gson object

19600090
serializable	deserialization
i declared it as static so you won t slow serializable deserialization with multiple allocation of gson

19600090
serializable	deserialization
maybe you want to unificate serializable and deserialization into a unique object you should be check the typeadapter class or experiment with an object that implements both interfaces

19600174
zoo	xts
you can t add columns to zoo xts objects like that

19600207
for-loop	loops
one way to think of it is to walk through the for-loop imperatively and when you reach an if statement if that statement evaluates to false you continue to the next iteration of loops

19600238
clang	llvm
now llvm-gcc help says it supports -mfpmath sse and clang has a method of passing things to llvm using -mllvm but i cannot seem to make them work together

19600274
dictionary	map
what you want to do with your class is impossible because its attributes have no inherent order because they re stored in a dictionary so there is no reasonable way to map to ben.name instead of to ben.age

19600274
inherited	properties
if you look at the source for collections.namedtuple you can see that it s using a combination of these there s a class attribute named _fields to store the field names while the field values are stored in the tuple that it inherited from and it then defines __dict__ as a properties that puts them together an ordereddict on the fly

19600294
inherited	properties
obviously it has something to do with the owf implementation but i was under the impression that these frameworks inherited the properties of the browser it was being run in i could be completely wrong .

19600315
cpython	ironpython
edit forgot to mention this is in cpython not ironpython

19600320
width	height
what i want to do is loop through the mediaitems in a given story and set the width and height of each

19600372
nstextstorage	nstextcontainer
i noticed that ios 7 introduces new classes related to text layout such as nslayoutmanager nstextstorage and nstextcontainer

19600372
uilabel	nsstring
for example say i have a long nsstring which i put in a uilabel

19600432
tcpclient	networkstream
i have a method that reads some data through a tcpclient s networkstream and it has been giving me some errors

19600478
children	parent
i encountered a problem when trying to fetch a tree structure parent children elements in one table

19600489
box-sizing	border-box
as a side note if you intend to have them pushed down by what looks like 10-15 pixels as in the original css you can set the padding-top value and add box-sizing border-box

19600524
onclicklistener	ontouch
i have attached ontouch listeners to the changeable fields in the clock and onclicklistener for the buttons

19600540
super	extends
say you are adding a new type of object first thing you need to do conceptually is to find a base super parent object type for it that has subset of the attributes and you are adding on top of them extends base object type

19600623
int	boolean
the comment makes it clear that you want to check that is not null but you aren t doing that you are casting the int value of to a boolean so 0 will be treated as false and anything else as true

19600688
post	get
post requests should be reserved for creating records so you may consider re-doing this as a get

19600742
min	max
you can use min max to handle it

19600901
viewdidload	viewdidappear
i am attempting a simple uiview animation in the viewdidload or viewdidappear method but it doesn t animate

19600901
viewdidload	viewdidappear
when ran from viewdidload or viewdidappear the image changes but isn t animated

19600921
ssl	https
pretty much a duplicate of how to redirect https to http without any ssl certificate

19600997
hide	show
i have a simple switch clause which should show hide some controls and call a method

19601002
for-loop	loops
i m having difficulty constructing a for-loop such that i can start at a and loops abcd or start at b and loops bcda or start at d and loops dabc etc

19601035
folder	directory
once downloaded unzip de package and move the theme directory under sites all themes folder

19601062
int	double
suppose we have a list of some int values positive and negative and we have a task to double only positive values

19601120
put	get
if i put a breakpoint in and mouseover the results i get the message that children could not be evaluated

19601143
int	chars
but say i had an array of int arrays just like i can have an array of chars arrays

19601160
filesystems	fat
from a quick glance the boot loader expects a fat filesystems that you don t create either

19601160
filesystems	fat
you ll either have to change it so it simply loads the second sector or create a proper fat filesystems

19601167
wxpython	pyqt
i would put my vote with pyside more flexible licence for commercial options over pyqt and pyside pyqt over wxpython simply because i think the gui designer tool are better

19601168
width	height
yes there is drawimage image img int x int y int width int height imageobserver observer

19601172
folder	directory
add the folder and files to your project folder include them in your project and set the copy to output directory on each file

19601172
post	put
in the last case i sometimes put a rem comment in the post build event to clue people into the fact that the project file has been customized

19601178
post	get
edit since updating your post in your particular case you can just use backtrace and get right to the iteration

19601205
post	get
you then get something like this which includes all headers and post data sent by the request in an curl command

19601215
width	height
it has a nice function paintcomponent graphics g override it and paint your image inside with g.drawimage x y width height observer

19601215
width	height
swing graphics has graphics.cliprect int x int y int width int height to bound the area rectangle to which you wish to draw prior to drawing the image

19601215
width	height
first approach is to use bufferedimage..getsubimage x y width height to get a sub image with specified rectangle region

19601215
width	height
this function will give you a new image cropped with the rectangle x y width height of your original image you specified

19601281
children	parent
this option only grabs immediate children of the parent so if your datagrid is nested it s not going to work

19601334
equals	compareto
try using compareto method instead of equals to compare strings

19601403
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
this works more or less like classic inherited since subclassing also delegate calls it doesn t understand to superclass

19601460
put	get
- however if i put the query in the through the webservice doc pages i get a result

19601469
hash	salt
i also wonder if it will make any difference if you do retrieve the password since it appears that the database stores a sha256 hash of the salt password

19601470
width	height
that s to stop the renderer automatically reducing the height to fit the width

19601470
width	height
set both the height an width to the desired height

19601499
hide	show
i use the following codes and still can not show the icon on the taskbar while hide the form1

19601505
apache	nginx
i assume i need some sort of web server like apache or nginx that s always running

19601519
textarea	textbox
so all i m trying to do is grab whatever the user inputs into a textbox and have it paste at the endof a preformatted script i have assigned to the inserttext link ultimately into a textarea box

the error you are seeing is because the database does not exist on the database server it depends exactly on your server postgresql mysql etc but you ll need to go onto the database server and run something like

19607238
getter	setter
the main difference is that does not use any getter setter and writes to the ivar directly

19607238
getter	setter
obj.foo will then automatically use the atomic getter and will make the property readonly ie no setter

19607238
getter	setter
obviously when you are actually implementing a getter or a setter yourself that s another place to use the ivar syntax

calculating the percentile for all temporal time spans is a fairly quick process however once i add in calculating the sic2 percentile rank it s fairly slow but we are likely looking at about 65 000 subsets in total

19608657
width	margin
also i see some websites they adjust the content when you shrink the browser window looks like an effect of margin 0 auto just keeping things centered but also when the width gets small enough it just stops adjusting it stops because moving any more and the content will start moving to lines below it in order to fit.

19608660
multiplying	multiplication
as an example if instead of multiplying the first matrix with the first vector and the second matrix with the second vector you wanted to compute all possible multiplication you could simply do

i was thinking an array that is nearly sorted would fall under this case and also an array that is almost completely sorted with the max element and min element switched for instance

19608875
for-loop	arrays
now i tried to use the same code for the arrays with the extended third axis but the cross product function produces the wrong values compared to the original slow code which is using a for-loop

19608875
for-loop	arrays
i tried this code with my the big arrays it is around 10 to 20 times faster than a for-loop solution and around 200 times fast than the old code

there are various other stylistic changed i d make - probably starting with changing loops in addition to use an enhanced for-loop for string item a etc

19610428
folder	directory
as i see you just want a hint on how change that code to save your images into a specific folder in your case the folder called images i ll assume that your folder in the same directory as your script

19610428
folder	directory
save it in the folder images in the script directory

persistent	transient
if you don t want to persistent some fields of your object like that you could use transient annotation to exclude those fields from the fields map when persistent the entity

19610864
instances	transient	persistent	transient
this is not good to hardcode ids in the daos or entities because these values could be generated by some generator but if you manually updated the database with this constants you could at least define these ids as constants in your code and load objects from session by id before initialize the transient or persistent instances

19610889
put	get
your put method is synchronizing on this whereas your get method is synchronizing on str and those are two different objects so it doesn t have the necessary protective effect

19611043
width	height
you should wrap the menubar into an element with height and width specified to avoid this

19611048
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
it looks like there s a problem with multiple uinavigationcontroller s linking to the same uiviewcontroller

19611048
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
but no problem with the same uinavigationcontroller linking to the same uiviewcontroller provided they are instantiated separately through the uitabbarcontroller

19611201
rvm	chruby
the problem you are seeing is probably due to missing rbenv chruby or rvm

19611222

in my constructor in the superclass i have buttons that lead to other subclassing

19611288
inherited	subclassing
however these subclassing also inherited these buttons even though they aren t in their constructors

19611294
post	get
also post your code by edit your question help us to get you the best answer

19611308
int	double
we use it for a game where we have health based on int hitpoints but calculate the damages based on double to be more exact

19611315
inherited	base-class
i have an abstract base class which contains an array as well as two or more inherited classes which would like to have a slightly larger array in the base-class

19611321
put	get	hide	show
the problem itâ s i canâ t get hide the elements for example i put visible first 3 items and after this i want hide the others and when push to the right show this and hide the other

19611323
portrait	landscape
common resolutions include the 320px portrait width of smartphones 768px portrait width of tablets 1024px landscape width of tablets

19611328
inherited	properties
i have a custom web control that inherited from datacontrolfield which has a properties called myproperty of type string

19611330
textview	imageview
in that case you can offcourse make you own textview extending default one and create particular layout with imageview for it but the easiest and more logical way is to create lauout file for your activity with textview and imageview

19611330
textview	imageview
if you have to create textview dynamic from java i can t see any reason for it from your code you can add id property to linearlayout and than find it by id and add textview to that and it will be placed after imageview

19611330
textview	imageview
if you really have to create textview in runtime and you can t use xml layouts you can create linearlayout in runtime and after that create textview and imageview and add that two views to that layout after that make set this layout as content view for the activity

19611342
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
got a very simple scroller working in google-chrome and safari but not in firefox

19611375
inherited	subclassing
however yes objects added to a component or jcomponent in its constructor will be inherited by subclassing but not in the oop sense of the word inherited unless they are removed in the subclassing

19611375
superclass	subclassing
a better way might be to call a method createbuttons in the superclass and override it in the subclassing to do nothing but be careful not to refer to anything before it exists if you do it that way

19611410
pull	push
for most cases you ll want to hit the sync button which will both push and pull for you

19611447
textview	imageview
2 you need to add textview and imageview in linearlayout then need to set that linearlayout in setcontentview like

19611450
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
if in uinavigationcontroller set topbar as translucent navigation bar by default then for the first uitableview that will be added to the uiviewcontroller it will automatically set contentinset in uiedgeinsetsmake 64 0 0 0 but only the first one

19611489
freebsd	netbsd
the seq command is available in netbsd freebsd and gnu systems

19611525
cos	sin
change your matrix to use sin and cos instead of sin angle and cos angle

19611533
subtract	add
then add subtract that vector to one of the original points to get your final answer

19611536
for-loop	arrays
try doing this using a c style for-loop and bash arrays slice

19611618
udp	tcp
tcp handles packet losses whereas udp doesn t

19611618
sctp	udp
datachannel uses another protocol called sctp which is implemented on top of udp

19611673
google-chrome	firefox
i think the best to check if a component exist in your dom tree is to right click on your tree and use inspect element function in firefox or google-chrome

19611762
hide	show
there is a hidden show hide toggle that only appears on mouse-over see the images below

19611791
sorting	filtering
but after applying some totally different filtering or sorting i would think that a user would like to be brought back to the first page or scrolled back to top for infinite scroll

19611814
google-chrome	safari
i ve been doing web development for a long time and it seems like this is a recent bug in webkit which has made it into safari 7 and google-chrome 23 or so

19611890
spy++	sendmessage
basically if spy++ doesn t show child windows inside the main window then you won t be able to use the traditional window manipulation apis or sendmessage

19611902
gif	png
these vtt files contain links to the actual thumbnails which can be in jpg png or gif format

19611923
subtract	add
the following lines are equivalent to taking the player s original rotation in degrees multiplied by the delta step and subtract the radians version of that off of the player s current rotation then subtract the delta dt from the step value inside of a loop which is executed within a single game frame i might add

19611932
width	font-size
i want to have the font-size to be adjusted to the width available

19611939
mousemove	pointer-events
what you re probably doing is setting pointer-events none for an object and then trying to capture mousemove events on the same object

19611947
children	parent
then the beforemove would set arg.canceldrop based on whether arg.item has any children and whether the new parent was the root s children

19611982
maven	pom.xml
however if you have a broken unavailable dependency pulled in by one of your explicit dependencies in your pom.xml any maven goal including dependency tree will fail fast and the build output only says what artifact failed to download but not which of your dependencies uses it

19612001
width	height
i am trying to fill a jquery mobile side panel with a background color with 100 width and 100 height

19612001
google-chrome	safari
i can make it work with absolute positioning but this gives me some errors in safari and google-chrome

19612023
qimage	qquickitem
what i need to do is adding an image available as a qimage object to a custom qquickitem

19612097
uicontrol	uibutton
in every uicontrol subclass uibutton etc you can use this to subscribe to a specific set of uicontrolevent

19612133
negative-number	zero
numbers less than zero however you might use the more descriptive negative-number tag

19612162
getter	setter
ivar in times of arc i understand that arc will use the __strong ownership qualifier when i directly get or set a strong property s autosynthesized associated instance variable but will neither call custom getter or setter nor trigger kvo

19612231
postgresql	mysql
packages tdbc mysql and tdbc postgresql require dll libmysql.dll and libpq.dll somewere in path

19612251
getter	setter
going a little further i wonder if i could do the same from everywhere else within the class with the obvious exception of the getter and setter themselves

19612256
ssl	https
i have ssl enabled site wide and want to use a secure session using https

19612260
listview	gridview
it s true that adapterview uses a generic type argument but listview and gridview specify that the type must be a listadapter

19612265
multiplying	multiplication
building on my previous answer for apa-add multiplication is a matter of apa-adding multiplying one list by a digit at a time and adding zeroes at the end of the intermediary multiplication just as you d do it manually

19612312
post	get
in order to get only the number of published post you should refactor your condition statement by anding

19612319
post	get
or when using jsonp it s mysterious that it sends get instead of post

19612331
imagemagick	wand
it puts out the path to magickwand.h in my case opt imagemagick include imagemagick-6 wand magickwand.h

19612367
administration	activation
the problem stems from ibm placing the host port queue manager channel etc. into the activation spec instead of the administration object

19612367
jboss	glassfish
jboss allows for the resourceadapter annotation to change the resource adapter but glassfish only allows this via the glassfish-ejb-jar.xml file

19612382
put	get
to get floating point division as standard you need to put

19612411
min	max
it sets the jvm to start with allocating 840 megabytes of ram with a max of 840 mb and min 100 mb

19612417
integer	unsigned
overflow happens precisely when is not representable unsigned integer divisions can never overflow

19612417
integer	unsigned
please note that contrary to what i said originally mea culpa does not work because max_value is a multiple of 3 when the integer type is unsigned the condition is that there is an even number of bits available for positive numbers

19612428
getter	setter
yes you can use the setter getter in the constructor

19612435
oncreate	onstart
so i have to go inside onstart since oncreate is called only once

19612440
width	font-size	min	max
another way is to use min max font-size and i think setting the parent with would be better here as we are resizing the inner element a based on the parent li width

19612460
hide	show
i already made panel1 to show up when i click on textbox or richtextbox i ve used enter event and panel1 will hide when i click enter button on it

19612497
ant	maven	ant	pom.xml	maven	m2e	maven	pom.xml	m2e	pom.xml
by the way i should point out that i think maven is now the most popular build system in the java community and for that you can use the m2e eclipse plugin to make eclipse use the maven pom.xml file which is kind of like ant s build.xml but for maven for builds

19612512
versioning	upgrade
try to upgrade to the versioning 4.0.1

19612542
versioning	upgrade
upgrade your versioning of emgucv if you want the later behavior

19612582
put	get
if we put a real even sequence into the fft function and get back something back that is not real and even we have a problem

19612601
put	get
now when i want to put this into an update statement i get stuck

19612665
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox dev tools report a post error without any further explanation

19612668
chown	chmod
doing chown and chmod for home dir by hand

19612680
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
and exemplary code looks fine in firefox ie and buggy in google-chrome opera laster versions using blink

19612687
for-loop	loops
your return is within the for-loop and therefore you will return on the first interation of loops

19612714
stdout	stderr
as it is in development it crashes a lot and throws random errors on either stdout or stderr

19612716
vcard	mime
contacts are usually represented as vcard so the mime type would be set as

19612856
range	max	range	min	min	max
if your values range between 0 and 1 then max is similar to the or operator and min is similar to the and operator

19612856
min	max
therefore you should be able to approximate min x 1 x 2 ... x k by computing 1 - max 1 - x 1 1 - x 2 ... 1 - x k

19612958
for-loop	arrays
also notice that i pre-allocate arrays before the for-loop

19612974
switching	screens
that being said i want to return the selectors to their original positions when the other is clicked so that they don t keep sliding up the screens and the user can keep switching between the two color selector options as many times as they want

19613000
vb.net	vb6
you probably want vb.net or vb6

19613026
put	get
note to get the code to run put the view controller inside a uinavigationcontroller and display the navigation controller

19613107
versioning	upgrade
anyway your provided code works like a charm in 4.0 versioning so you should consider an upgrade if you can

19613167
folder	dir
pay attantion that if you whant to use dom.load assemblyname with specified only codebase property you must set it in uri format file d dir ... and i think these assemblies have to be strongly named if they are not in the current applicationâ s folder

19613191
g++	gcc
to my surprise compiling it with g++ gcc 4.2.1 and running it succeeded without errors or warnings and produced the following perfectly decent output

19613208
profiling	debugging
or are there other profiling debugging tools that could be useful

19613211
int	double
sqrt is defined for double and an int value can be and is converted implicitly to a value of type double

19613211
int	double
it is in fact pretty hard to prevent a function that takes a double from being called with an int

19613212
int	double
and c++ allows you to convert int to double implicitly

19613212
int	double
thus you can also add an int to a double which converts the int to a double before invoking the actual addition

19613213
int	double
because there s an implicit conversion from int to double

19613217
int	double
because the compiler is actually automatically implicitly converting the int to a double or maybe long double and sending that value to sqrt

19613248
int	double	rational-numbers	fractions
floating point numbers are generally somewhat precise to about 12-15 digits as a double but as they are stored as a mantissa fractions and a exponent rational-numbers int or common fractions are not likely to be stored as such

19613266
stdout	fflush
python opens stdout in line-buffering mode so you won t see voltages printed in columns until a fflush when not printing newlines

19613292
textview	imageview
i am populating gridview with multiple item each containing imageview and textview there will be about 100+ such items

19613297
x86	mips
library disclosure i am the author which provides information on cpu features on x86 arm mips and powerpc

19613303
integer	fractions
so we cannot compare that to an integer and we cannot check if the fractions part is close to 0

19613336
pop-up	dialog
when you click on it a confirm dialog pop-up with ok and cancel

19613337
subtraction	addition
your addition and subtraction methods do not account for position whatsoever

19613383
width	height
the first step is to know your view s width and height

19613383
width	height
in the example above width 300 and height 300

19613383
width	height
we can finally find the offset width orange and height purple

19613383
width	height
for width we use the formula and for height we use the formula

19613383
width	height
after applying the formulas we find that width 193.20 and height -87.60

19613383
width	height
finally we can add those values width and height to the center of the square to find the coordinates of the blue point

19613404
min	max
note this bug is also seen in the fact that the min max and mean are not the same.

19613436
post	get
this way get gets through and for post user has to be authenticated

19613455
post	get
it seems weird that i can get a public page feed on facebook post etc by doing

19613455
post	get
is it possible just to have any changes post created get pushed to me with the realtime api by subscribing to a page for example the cnn facebook page

19613464
put	get
when i put the above code into the gradable_items_inputs.html.erb file i get undefined local variable f error

19613475
for-loop	loops
my first guess was to use a for-loop and i tried it but it didn t work no errors on that either. i ve never really had a use for for loops before so i m unsure as to whether or not what i did was correct

19613482
post	get
if you have different verbs get post you probably want a different controller action per verb

19613509
put	get	post	get	post	put
i can create a php file on my sever that will handle get post put delete requests and i can can return the correct data for each case to the requestor from the same file

19613523
fputcsv	fgetcsv
you can make your life easier by using fputcsv and fgetcsv

19613532
express	node.js
i have html that is generated from the server using node.js express and precompiled handlebars templates

19613553
versioning	upgrade
there must be a difference and i doubt is the tomcat versioning but if you must you can upgrade tomcat and try again

19613557
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
fyi so far this has been tested on google-chrome v30 firefox v24 safari v5.1

19613570
udp	tcp
prior to android 4.3 the uid traffic stats were available for tcp and udp and included api for bytes and packets sent and received

19613590
post	get
in firebug i do see the post and i see a response but it does not get appended to the file

19613601
rss	feed
i want to be able to update an xml file which i can do and then have the rss feed atomically updated from this xml file

19613615
width	margin
width will be 100 of its containing block plus any horizontal margin

19613625
profiling	debugging
thread and socket tagging is possible for ddms purposes to allow the profiling and debugging of your own applications

19613666
awt	swing
override the paint .. awt or paintcomponent .. swing method

19613675
typedef	struct
i noticed that you use different identifiers for the struct name and for its typedef

19613679
width	height
basically what i ended up doing was writing each character and symbol s x y width height xoffset yoffset xadvance to a file

19613679
width	height
width height the width height of the character

19613679
width	height
after i ve parsed the file i also convert the characters x y width height to actual u v u2 v2 coordinates on the texture

19613692
width	margin
the browser will add equal margin to the left and right of that container keeping it in the center as long as the window is larger that the width you ve specified

19613702
getter	setter
no static context reference static getter setter for each property when required you can add memory cached value for some property to get it faster from memory instead of reading from sharedpreferences

19613731
google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari
at least it works on ie9 ff3 google-chrome 1 safari 4 opera 10.5

19613753
post	get
what i want is to get the code from this file and post it on the website so that everyone will be able to see it

19613762
filtering	grouping
one of the simplest ways of keeping things grouping in ga is to set up an advanced profile filtering

19613767
punctuation	words
does this regex work well for selecting all words excluding spaces and punctuation other than underscores and hyphens

19613772
width	height
i know how to use jquery to assign width height etc

19613784
typedef	struct
also note that it s possible to avoid having to repeat the word struct over and over again by typedef ing the struct

19613790
xlib	xcb
i have written some basic opengl applications with xcb as the backend xlib for glx of course and in every test i have written when i move my mouse over the window it causes all input to get sort of buffered and only responds to the events after a period of time varies depending on how many inputs

19613800
width	height
also i want the left column to always be 150px wide and the entire height of the frame while the right should always fill the remaining width of the window

19613820
hash	md5
md5 is a cryptographic hash function which means it s intentionally designed to be very difficult to reverse

19613820
hash	md5
md5 in particular is relatively weak there are vulnerabilities that make it easy to find collisions â two files with the same md5 hash

19613820
hash	md5
since an md5 hash is only 128 bits there are 2 128 different possible md5 hash and while that s a very large number there are still many many more files than that in the world potentially an infinite number in fact so it is inevitable that some files will hash to the same value

19613836
httpconnection	downloading
i am using httpconnection package to downloading a large file

19613842
strlen	strncpy	strlen	memmove	memmove	strncpy
strncpy memmove str + 6 str strlen str + 1 - 6 stuff 6

19613842
realloc	malloc
if you are using malloc and need realloc

19613895
post	get
the simplest way is to simply make your form s method be get rather than post or leave the method off as get is the default

19613918
client-side	server-side
but be aware that server-side support for range retrieval is optional so the client-side needs to pay close attention to the response headers to figure out whether it is getting the entire file or just the requested range

19613922
hide	show
if it does get div with class of branddump and slide it up slowly hide it and remove the class of active else take the div with class branddump and slide it down show it and add class of active

19613930
google-chrome	firefox
for example signing into cas in firefox won t sign you into cas via ie or google-chrome

19613935
width	height
i mean what s the max width and height the function support thanks

19613963
int	double
also in printarray elements is defined as a double when it should be an int

19613965
int	chars
there is zero reason to allocate for quicksort and in fact the function can easily suffice in your case with a simple interface of quicksort chars arr unsigned int len using pointer-math for the subsequence invocations

19613983
next	replacewith
chaining replacewith on same element is shakey at best since once it s replaced it no longer exists and therefore there is nothing for the next replace

19613992
int	double
1 your printf format statement should use d to print int and lf to print double

19613992
int	double
2 you re better off using an int for counting numbers instead of double

19613999
width	height
in short width and height cannot exceed the value of gl_max_renderbuffer_size and the number of samples cannot exceed gl_max_samples_apple

19614001
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome make a request to the actual page

19614001
firefox	safari
firefox 3 and earlier versions behave the same as safari and

19614014
google-chrome	safari
another possibility which is less desirable would be to do this in css detects webkit browsers google-chrome and safari and override padding styles so that they appear the same in both browsers

19614030
versioning	upgrade
it s also a good idea to make all beans serializable regardless of scope because if ibm ever adds true cluster support to xpages then application and session beans will need to be serialized to disk as well in order to replicate them to other servers so just make all your beans serializable now and you won t need to worry about your apps suddenly breaking when you upgrade to a versioning of domino that includes cluster support

19614031
persistent	transient
if you do not want to persistent the classroom or any other attribute for that matter then the transient annotation allows you to ignore a particular field so that jpa won t try to map it

19614042
width	height
you provided a width of 100px to both elements however you omitted height

19614069
width	height
we can set the starting width quite easily and detect the scroll easily enough too as can we get the height of the element that ll trigger the animation i just can t get it as a percentage

19614099
hide	show
but note also that the .slideup and .slidedown methods hide and show your element s so you don t need to call hide and .show as well

19614115
width	height
everything seems good until i previewed the website on an ipad iphone portrait mode where the screen height is much taller than its width

19614172
mutators	setter	mutators	getter	getter	setter
in order for your class to be immutable you can t allow mutators methods setter or accessors getter on private data that are mutable

19614179
apache	nginx
rails expects the web server apache nginx etc to serve them up

19614213
hide	show
i know how to restart using a batch file but i can t find a way to hide or not show the warning message

19614214
width	height
when i give overlay 100 width and height 100 it covers the whole screen and not just that li

19614223
chown	chmod
reapplied chown and redid chmod on the directory

19614227
disk	ram
once you ve read a chunk of a file from disk once it will hang around in ram for a while

19614227
disk	ram
ram is orders of magnitude faster than disk so you ll see a lot of variability in the time it takes to read random pieces of a large file

19614246
matplotlib	scipy
i use sublime text as my ide and i tried to install a few libraries scipy numpy matplotlib

19614266
slider	caroufredsel
i m trying to add a class of active to the current slider in caroufredsel and i can t get it to work

19614328
minimum	max
note that i am using the minimum scale taking what is the least so that the whole bitmap can be rendered in the screen..if i take max then it might go beyond the screen

19614362
stdout	fflush
since you re not terminating it with a newline you should also add an fflush stdout

19614383
jlabel	jtextpane	jtable	jlabel	jtable	jtextpane	jlist	jtable	jlist	jlabel	jlist	jtextpane
first learn about the swing jcomponent jpanel jlabel jbutton jlist jtable jtextpane etc and various type of event listeners and how they responds with the component

19614385
implements	extends
if you really need to leave the extends inheritance open you can implements a shape and implements all the methods to go to the yinyang variable

19614394
udp	tcp	icmp	tcp	icmp	udp
ip tcp udp icmp gre igrp all use ip at the network layer

19614500
bluetooth	usb
i am working on an app which needs to be able to use external usb or bluetooth keyboard wedges

19614502
post	get
first decide if shugarcalc should be a get or a post hint if it is just doing some computations and returning a result without modifying anything then it is probably a get and then adjust the route s via option or how you re trying to access the route accordingly

19614525
revmob	applovin
using chartboost applovin and revmob

19614528
getter	setter
now your banking class would need a setter getter for each type of account and it just calls the appropriate method

19614563
setinterval	settimeout
if the interval is to stay the same then setinterval is ok though i personally prefer to use settimeout either way because i usually find it simpler to have code like

19614563
setinterval	clearinterval
...to decide whether to keep looping rather than saving an interval id and then calling clearinterval before later calling setinterval again

19614574
jtabbedpane	jscrollpane
the jtabbedpane contains a jscrollpane as one of its tabs

19614574
jtable	jlabel
within the jpanel a number of jlabel s and jtable s are to be displayed

19614574
jtable	jlabel	jtabbedpane	jscrollpane	jtabbedpane	jtable	jtabbedpane	jlabel
if the number of columns in the jtable s are too many or if the number of elements jtable s and jlabel s in the jpanel of the jscrollpane of jtabbedpane are too many then the scrolling through items will be done through the scrollbar of the jscrollpane of the jtabbedpane

19614598
post	get
i have a project for modification where i need to post a form with get but i am unable to get the post value

19614617
int	double
it also depends on the data type int float double some languages have others like decimal nsnumber etc

mouseleave	mouseenter
mouseenter and mouseleave

19615887
mouseleave	mouseenter
it has created two new events mouseenter and mouseleave

19615887
mouseover	mouseout
they are almost the same as mouseover and mouseout except that they donâ t react to event bubbling

19615887
mouseout	mouseleave
so it s best to use mouseleave rather than mouseout as it causes event bubbling

19615889
spaces	delimiter
spaces is a standard delimiter in batch for loops as well as and with you deactivate it

19615899

i suggest you to upgrade to turbogears 2.3 more recent versioning support an authenticate method in applicationauthmetadata which makes easy to provide custom check of username and password validity

19616232
turbogears	repoze.who
if you cannot upgrade turbogears you must implement a custom repoze.who authenticator which is a bit more complex

19616233

fileinputstream	filechannel
you should instead get a fileinputstream for your book.txt or cast your inputstream and then get a filechannel from it

19616487
int	chars	ord	chr
basically ord transforms a chars into an int and chr transforms one such int into a chars

19616487
ord	chr
so for a given character if you transform it into its ord you can add the key to shift it and then transform it back into a character with chr

19616491
range	max
just noticed another thing - your k i expression is probably overflowing int at the max range which means your access pattern might not be cyclic as you expect

put	get
to diagnose where the problem is get the code out of asp .net and put it into an interactive console application and run it

19616584
getter	setter
second one is you can maintain a object of your fragment and have setter getter functions for updating the data inside fragment

19616622
ostringstream	std
but i d say using std string to keep the data and std ostringstream to format it would be a better solution for your use case than fixed size arrays

19616629
background-color	transparency	inherited	properties
while this obviously solved the background issue the border of the element below cg_content started showing again because the inherited properties acts like transparency instead of what it does when there is a set background-color

19616631
hide	show
have different user controls and hide all except the first one depending on the users selections you show the on you want or

19620013
google-chrome	firefox
behavior is consistent on google-chrome ie10 ie11 and firefox

19620041
width	height
it is for this reason that calculated values like an element s width or height sometimes return the wrong value when you try to read them immediately after creation - the browser hasn t drawn them yet

19620041
width	height
but there is one case that causes the browser to execute reflow calculations immediately if you try to read any of the calculated values such as width and height

19620055
int	chars
so when outputting a chars the assumes you want a string output while with int it outputs the address of the array rather than it s content

int	double
in java the default type of numbers is int so when you write 50 110000 they re both considered int although you defined the result to be double

19620353
int	double
when int division occurs the result will be 0 because they are both int s then the double will hold this value which will be represented as double so you re getting 0.000000

19620388
pandas	xlrd
one alternative is to use pandas which internally uses xlrd and xlwt saving you of coding all the steps involved

one chunk of logic can be used for unsigned and signed add and subtract

19621448
subtraction	addition
the only place that matters for unsigned vs signed addition or subtraction is the overflow bits unsigned overflow a.k.a carry bit and signed overflow a.k.a overflow

19621448
subtract	add
well when you want to subtract 5 from 7 for example what you would do in logic is not add a -5 but instead add the ones complement of 5 and set invert the carry in bit

maven	pom.xml
but i m building my project with maven and i m using only one repository with parent pom.xml spring-boot-starter-parent version 0.5.0.m5

19621666
free	malloc
for example free doesn t have to validate whether the pointer you are passing has been previously returned by malloc because that would affect the performance

19621689

char.isdigit string int see documentation checks if the chars at position i in the string is a digit not only 0..9 but also other numbers

19621788
width	height
i am not really happy with that since it s quite messy to hardcode the window border width height i won t use the win32 module for that

19621827
int	chars
the only difference between your problem and longest common substring is that you have an array of unique int whereas here they had repeating chars in the string

19621831
isspace	toupper
indeed 4.8 fixed the problem with isspace but another surfaced - toupper

19621833

post	get
you get everything id title contentâ for a couple of post you are gonna decide what post from any category orderâ

19621961
post	get
however if you want to get more than one post rather use functions mentioned above i think the most important thing is to grab them in one db query and not in ineffective way one-by-one

19621972
put	get
i have located what i believe is the right file ie frlayout.class from the jung library and put it into the directory edu uci jung algorithms layout however when i do and i try to run the applet i get the corresponding error

sequence	permutation
but with phrases storing each permutation of a sequence as a key seems infeasible

19621995
getter	setter
the field name is wrong you have getter setter for

19622010
firefox	safari
although it works fine in safari and firefox the content and even background color of the submenu does not show in msie 9

19622038
prepare	execute
when i execute i get an error the call to undefined method database prepare

19622050
post	get
given your update to the question that this isn t feasible using ar s include you could try the following to get the associated post with a single extra query

19622108
implements	extends
your database class does not extends pdo neither it does implements prepare method

19622111
int	chars
the previous step just does in.nextint which reads the next int but doesn t consume the eol chars

19622111
int	chars
you should add in.nextline in step6 to consume the eol chars and not just the int

19622142
getter	setter
this also helps to keep member variables from clashing with similarly named getter setter if that s the way your camel rolls

19622179
subtract	add
get a singleton class that runs the sync and on each onstart and onstop add or subtract my counter and stop the sync when the counter is 0

onresume	onpause
subclass the application context or make static variables to see the state of each activity and inside each onresume and onpause do a check and start pause stop the sync accordingly

19622189
put	get
likely you ll want to get rid of that method and put its code into the actionperformed method

19622198
ubuntu	debian
i think that the rest of the script is pretty simple it checks whether the debian ubuntu package manager is executing an install operation

19622198
ubuntu	debian
if the user is asking the debian ubuntu package system to install my package the script also deletes two directories

19622205
spaces	linefeed
in html a carriage return or linefeed in the source code is treated as white spaces and rendered as a spaces

in a different class i have to use as parameter the superclass in a method however i need a method in the subclassing but the compiler cant find it if i cast the superclass

19622220
superclass	subclassing
i get the error cant find symbol however this is the way i have to construct my classes and methods as the teacher told us have to be a superclass a subclassing with a method in it and a method in a different class with the given parameter of superclass

19622261
put	get
my real question is is there a way to condense those three lines of code into one line because if i put them all together i get an error

19622322
free	calloc	free	malloc	calloc	malloc
you should have a corresponding call to free for every malloc calloc in a symmetric manner

19622371

other methods like get put or post works fine

19622394

it should render correctly renders well for me in os x 10.8.5 latest google-chrome firefox 24 and safari 6.0.5

19622459
scheme	racket
in languages like scheme and racket using such higher-order functions can be a way to express things concisely and leverage patterns

19622459
scheme	racket
in scheme and racket a variable can have a value like a number or a string -- and it can also be a function

19622475
google-chrome	firefox
i have the following code -- which renders oddly enough correctly in ie but not in google-chrome or firefox see

19622475
google-chrome	firefox
basically the element with the btn_group btn_group_fill should span the entire width -- which it does in ie -- but not in google-chrome or firefox -- obviously i am missing some css element or combination

19622516

max k 1 ... k n - min k 1 ... k n + 1 â 2 n

19622621
int	chars
but in your chars romandigitchar int val method you need to have some sorts of algorithm to convert natural number to roman number something like

19622696
int	boolean	int	chars
there are other primitive types like chars short int float boolean

19622696
int	double	int	chars
although the language does provide wrappers built around each of the primitive types that extends from object - int chars short double etc

19622762
punctuation	words
split your text into words and remove things you don t consider significant remove capitalisation punctuation words breaks etc.

19622776
udp	tcp
we are trying to write our own client but somehow it is working for tcp but not for udp

19622776
udp	tcp
i am basically adding a udp 8 byte header in front of payload that consist of a request header+ .. which is similar to tcp except an additional 8 byte header

19622820
hide	show
of course it is possible to trigger to show or hide content with javascript by using navigator.useragent

19622823
public	protected
you re building against qt 4 but this code apparently is qt 5 only and relies on signals being public in qt 5 they were protected in qt 4

19622836
put	get
very well....now when i try to put in contact my tag mifare 1k card or nfc forum type 2 tag i get

19622837
int	double
also comparing double to int is dangerous since double is not guaranteed to represent exactly an int

19622843
onresume	onpause
start restart it on every onresume of your activity app gets in forground stop it on every onstop or onpause app gets in background

19622858
getter	setter
as it s taking advantage of ecmascript 5 s object property getter and setter the value of age can be easily tracked and then updated in the div

19622877
post	get
update thought this clearly stated it was a homework assignment and that the onus for reading what was written should lie with well those who are reading it but someone advised that i should clarify that so the post doesn t get voted down by those who don t actually read it in its entirety

19622877
client-side	server-side
so here goes to clarify i understand that client-side validation is insecure and you should always use server-side validation for a real-world project - again this is just part of a college exercise to learn about the necessary syntax for something like this should not be confused by anyone reading it as a real-world example.

19622946
mouseup	mousedown
for the click event to fire you need mousedown and mouseup an element which on mobile browsers results in an 300ms delay

19623033
min	max
there is an issue opened on opencv where it says that when using vs2013 preview you must add the line in the file where you re using std min and std max

19623104
decltype	auto
you could of course just wrap the function in a decltype to figure out the return but an auto is much cleaner to write

19623159
goo.gl	bit.ly
your best bet is to use something like goo.gl or bit.ly to shorten the links into something more manageable

19623179
inherited	subclassing
one thing to consider though - ruby is a single inherited language so if you are already subclassing these controllers from some common parent controller then probably going with modules approach will be more flexible

19623181
put	get
for example when will put rich calendar i can t invoke this component it is static and i cannot get anything components looks only like image on the xhtml page

19623276
bluetooth	usb

19623287
wildfly	jboss
update i ve tried jboss wildfly 8 beta and i m getting about 5k tps - a massive difference

19623342
int	chars
since chars can be either signed or unsigned converting a chars directly to an unsigned int may give the wrong answer

19623342
int	chars
the conversion from chars to unsigned chars always produces the expected unsigned byte value and then it s fine to convert this to an unsigned int

19623349
implements	extends
this is the implementation of point_cut_decorator i have chosen to implements the decision function as a simple function you could extends it to let it decide from your settings or configuration if you use regexes for all 4 coordinates you will end up with something very powerful

19623361
invokelater	invokeandwait
also tried playing with swingutilities invokelater invokeandwait but even though switchapplets gets run on the edt it seems that it must be called directly from init or at least the thread init is running on to have the desired effect

19623365
build.gradle	gradlew
it needs to sync project with gradlew files everytime you edit build.gradle so androidstudio can fetch the changes

19623389
wan	lan
there may be multiple nics there may be lan and wan addresses wired and wireless loopback.

19623401
bufferedreader	objectinputstream
this is a bit like reading a text file line by line but wrong for bufferedreader and completely wrong for objectinputstream

19623403
initializer	class-method
solution 2 initializer the class-method hydrator with the optional parameter underscoreseperatedkeys set to false default is true or use class-method setunderscoreseperatedkeys false

19623415
explode	implode
it will split to array with explode function then converts each member to an integer with array_map and joining array back to string with a comma as separator by implode

19623445

if you want to support internet explorer 7+ no quirks compatibility and other pain last google-chrome last safari last firefox and no iframes - this will be enough

19623518
des	rsa
i am writing a simple java programs to encrypt decrypt using des and rsa algorithms using java

19623526
int	chars
in java a chars is essentially an unsigned 16-bit int with their int value corresponding to their unicode value

google-chrome	firefox
annoyingly instead of having the right click inspect element features of google-chrome or firefox you access the developer tools by pressing f12

19623575
hex	binary
i tried null base64 hex and binary

19623599
public	protected
as soon as you make your inline member public or protected you should put the definition in the header

19623602
width	height
tinymce does not append a style tag to the width and height tags

19623602
width	height
ie requires a style tag for width and height otherwise it is ignored

19623603
int	double	int	boolean
on the stack primitives int double boolean etc and object references pointing to the heap are stored

19623607
maven	pom.xml
the class androiddbhelper is not included by an dependency in the maven pom.xml because it is a nested class in android-proj android-apk

19623609
post	get
i want to get a json print with some of my post in a specific category

19623611
width	height
also there s no need to recalculate the width and height for each box since you re doing the same calculation for each

19623621
width	height
after that point the ground is drawn as a rectangle from 0 0 0 to width height 0

19623718
opera	firefox
opera and firefox always sets caret on a beggining of a line

19623718
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
and it works in google-chrome firefox and opera

19623738

19623742
folder	directory
i am very new to php and i would like to iterate through an images directory in the root folder and post these images to a webpage

19623750
jobs	cron
the format of cron jobs you are using works in the case when you are directly adding crons system wide in etc crontab

19623750
jobs	cron
or you can add the cron job to system wide cron jobs in etc crontab instead of using crontab -e

19623750
jobs	cron
also note that you are using in your script which can cause issues always use complete paths in cron jobs

19623791

int	chars
a chars can be treated as an int for a number of purposes -- a is 65 in ascii and unicode

19624156
int	chars
if you convert an int to a chars the int value is used as the index of the chars in the ascii table

19624160
int	chars
in java a chars is essentially a 16-bit unsigned int as well as a single symbol

19624160
int	chars
when using + between a chars and int instead of concatenation you use normal addition

hide	show
if you want to hide the entire block intially and show just the first by default

19624181
free	malloc

19624550
google-chrome	firefox
tested in firefox and google-chrome

19624555

19624601
inherited	properties
set the child s background-color properties to inherited like this

19624601
inherited	properties
only some properties are inherited from the parent automatically

19624601
children	parent
if for instance borders were inherited from the parent the result would look very messy as all children have borders

19624691
uibezierpath	nsbezierpath
nsbezierpath and it s ios counterpart uibezierpath are objective-c objects that wrap much of the functionality of the cgpath api for you

19624702

19624931
for-loop	loops
each time you enter the outermost for-loop you create a number of figures equal to the length of your matrix in the innermost loops

19624956
punctuation	words
but in your example code you tried to use a tokenizer that is appropriate for english it recognizes space-delimited words and punctuation tokens

19624964
for-loop	while-loop
you should put your while-loop inside a for-loop like this

19624964
for-loop	arrays
in order to calculate the mean create an arrays before the for-loop named turns

19625004
int	double	int	chars
and every time i am changing this array type to int chars float string or double

19625004
int	double
what if i have changed some of the values in the any of this type of the array for example to 5 for int float and double

19625017
inherited	properties
but keep in mind that you can create proper style inherited by using basedon properties

19625022
versioning	upgrade
because i have upgrade to versioning 0.8.1 of the flot javascript library this allows the chart axis to be saved with the canvas

19625064
getter	setter
i could give you some code but it is useless that are just classic objects with getter setter and a classic onsave onrestore implementation

19625065
width	height
i was thinking about placing all thumbs each in their own iframe and writing a simple bit of css that changes the thumbnail s width height equally on hover but i was wondering if there s a better solution

19625068

19625162
accessor	ivar
this in modern objc generates both the accessor and an ivar _foo for storage

19625162
accessor	properties
declare the properties implement both accessor and simply ignore the fact that the compiler creates storage for _foo and never use it

19625162
accessor	properties
the first seems inelegant at runtime and the second seems inelegant in the declaration where i d probably now have a mix of properties and property-like accessor

19625221
getter	setter
if you override both the setter and getter and don t use the variable within the setter and getter a variable will not be created

19625221
getter	setter
for example if you have a class for which you want a firstname and lastname property but perhaps also a setter and getter for a fullname property if your fullname setter simply parses a string into firstname and lastname and sets these properties to that and never stores the full string into a fullname variable and your fullname getter simply returns the concatenated firstname + lastname and never uses a fullname variable one will never be created

19625230
for-loop	loops
if i split the for-loop into two for-loops with one loops handling moving the bullets and another checking if they need to be removed there s no misalignment but i m curious why bunching the loops together causes the problem

19625233
superclass	subclassing
then somehow you decide the type and potential attributes of the pokemon whether you make pokemon a superclass and subclassing it or have fields for these things and load them from outside java

19625279
wordpress	joomla
firstly may i assert that this is a perfectly reasonable question given the importance of cms web technologies which run a large portion of the www and one rightly asked by many java-aware people as there are some serious problems with all of the many nevertheless popular php-based systems like drupal wordpress and joomla including

19625279
dotcms	magnolia
the dotcms site compares its own popularity with its main java cms competitors magnolia hippo jahia

19625279

for-loop	arrays
i first thought i d create an arrays of arraybuffers that gets populated as the for-loop continued and then add it to the blob like

19625717
puts	gets
this code gets the x and y coordinates of each point calculates z at that point then puts it back into a matrix of the correct size

19625720
width	height
it seems to me that the uilabel is working off the old frame size when calculating it s appropriate height and drawing itself since it is dynamic not the new frame size which has indentation - with indentation there is less width available for the same text so it should know it needs to be taller

19625765
shadowing	named
by using var you re telling the engine to use a local variable named foo shadowing the global one

19625769

to get it installed we can use apt which is aptitude the package manager on ubuntu the flavor of linux i ll use in this answer since it s a popular one for servers and is the default for digital ocean

19625953
pull	push
you can also just use github or bitbucket - push your app to a remote repo then clone it down from your vps make sure to apt-get install git and set up your username first - if it s a private repo you ll probably have generate and add a key to get access to pull it down

folder	directory
the file is going to be in the same directory folder as the program so that s not an issue

19626523
folder	directory
if you are able to find maven installation directory in your file system you will certainly find settings.xml in its conf folder

19626540
subclass	abstract-class
when you have an object reference whose type is an abstract-class that reference doesn t mean i m referencing an abstract class. instead it means i m referencing some actual object that s a subclass of that abstract class. this is why you can have the reference refer to a savingsaccount which is a non-abstract class that subclasses from account but you can t have it point to a new account since you can t actually instantiate account

19626550
width	height
the first one that is 49 height flexible width

19626550
width	height
the second one that is 320 height and 320 width and the last one that is 69 height flexible width

hex	binary
if you are doing a lot of go between with different number systems the bitstring library make a lot of binary hex operations easier

19626860
hash	md5
cryptographic hash even though md5 is now broken have the property that even minor tweaks to the input string cause huge changes to the output of the hash so there should be no correlation between the md5 of a substring and the string itself

19626860
hash	md5
multiple strings can have the same hash code which means that if you just have the md5 of a string there s no possible way to know whether the original string is a substring of some other string

19626860
hash	md5
you could never distinguish the cases where you have the md5 of a substring or the md5 of a non-substring that coincidentally happens to have the same hash as the substring

19626917
factors	matrix
i should be getting the identity matrix but with the larger matrix the diagonal elements are off by a factors of 2 and some of the off-diagonal elements are a little too large on the order of 0.0001 when i want them to be at least on the order of 10 -6

the d format specifier tells printf that you are passing in an int but in the first case you are passing in a double which is also undefined behavior and so the results are not reliable

19634020

the callback is client side only so you will have to make a call to the server get post via javascript that will pass along the session id to a servlet that you have listening for this

19638857
hide	show
to workaround this you might have to implement javascript to show or hide the dropdown it is a painful solution though

getter	setter
use either _sw or create setter getter methods and use self.sw

19638882

19639776
post	get
i m trying to get the first five post in an array and the five next in another array

19639801
post	get
in you case since you are interested in getting the info using query thus it should be a get operation instead of a post operation

19639840
min	max
you can use group by to ask it to give you lines grouped by usubjid but you would need to tell it what to do with the various lines - use things like max min sum to group those variables

so to answer my question which rogmahall helped with my asking the question about height and width

19640230
webchromeclient	webviewclient
additionally i found out that when i use a webchromeclient without the standard webviewclient i can scroll

19640235
client-side	server-side
you haven t explained in your question whether the value of i is defined client-side or server-side but i m guessing from your subsequent comments that you want it done server-side

19640235
client-side	server-side
since this is inside backticks it will get expanded client-side within the eof -delimited heredoc and then evaluated server-side by the eval

19640235
client-side	server-side
that s why the echo line in the first one needs quoting to ensure that parameter expansion happens server-side not client-side

19640254
textview	imageview
as you can see i ve got two textview s and an imageview

19640281

19640480
inherited	properties
by default bindings inherited the data context specified by the datacontext properties if one has been set

19640480
inherited	properties
however the elementname properties is one of the ways you can explicitly set the source of a binding and override the inherited data context

19640504
for-loop	arrays
i originally believed this could be done using arrays and a for-loop that checked them but every time i did that it never stored the data into the dragged clips so they all displayed wrong

19640540
inherited	subclassing
you can customize the appearance of the datagridview to make it look good out-of-the-box but don t underestimate the amount of time it will take to subclassing inherited from datagridviewcell to make something like a datapicker it won t be that enjoyable but of course possible.

19640675
statusstrip	mdichild
the mdichild forms have one or more toolstrips and a statusstrip along with other controls in them

exponent	modulo
i can prepare public key for c# modulo and exponent are ok but verification failes

i am trying to use the edge i sobel method inside a matlab function block in simulink matlab 2013a

19641040
post	get
you have two general options in my opinion - loop through the post and get the data that you need like so this code will go right after

19641040
post	get
considering the fact that this would happen inside of an ajax request you can technically get rid of the remove_filter call but it s good to have it just in case you re going to make any other post queries in your code

19641064
range	min
we recently experienced a situation where the dequeue rate from a specific queue was in the 4000-4500 msg min range while the queue depth was only about 2500

19641279
draggable	droppable
jquery ui has the droppable and draggable interactions

19641290
for-loop	arrays
problem with your first version is that an item could be found in lets say second iteration of the for-loop your bool linearsearch would be set to true but if that item doesn t exist at the end of your arrays you will get false result because the else part would set to to false for all the other elements in arrays

19641291

19641505
listview	gridview
gridview listview also supports incremental loading of data

19641506
hide	show
you ll want to use jquery s animate to handle the scroll and then the fade in and out functions to make it hide and show

19641506

i looked at your post again and it looked like you wanted a highlight effect not a hide show so i added changed my code to this

19641527
scatter	graphing
directed graphing are different from scatter plots

19641566
ssl	https
to secure the data between the sender consumer of the service and servicebus you will need to setup the servicebus endpoint to use https so that the data between sender and servicebus is over ssl as well

19641569
hide	show
there are hooks for custom filters but they can only be used to hide stuff not to show stuff

19641691

tried to change the settings c c++ build - gcc c++ compiler - command - g++ -m32

19641818
children	parent
.prevall wouldn t work because you need to check the parent and then previous children

19641842
width	height
the fastest way was to use padding-top and a but this way the padding would result a of the width of the page and not its height

19641891
folder	directory
however i m not sure if it will look in the src folder too so you may have to move the test suite to the test directory

19641933
for-loop	arrays
i am trying to remove any one of those variables the problem is when you remove the second variable you mess up the arrays so that it cannot be displayed in a for-loop

19642000
children	parent
i have children divs #mainnav .metanav that have position fixed but this causes them to disregard the a parent div container with overflow hidden #container2

pop-up	dialog
basically you are going to only have two dialog one which triggers the pop-up and the pop-up itself

19642109
pop-up	dialog
in the pop-up you do not open a new window as described above instead you return focus to the calling dialog

19642130
width	height
you can get height and width using

19642131
int	chars
as a side note you don t have to cast a chars to an int to do math with it

19642154
folder	directory
the .apk file is read only so the directory structure which are in that apk file follows the same so no one can write this files or make changes on that at runtime that s why you can t make a changes in raw or assert folder at runtime

19642191
width	margin
give a width of your div if you want to use margin auto

apache	lighttpd
having some trouble converting what appears to be a simple rewrite rule in apache .htaccess to a lighttpd rule

19642510
apache	lighttpd
i can parse this in php and make it work but the point is to have the same php code in apache and lighttpd

19642547
int	double	int	chars
the conflict occurs in a state where there is a vardec on top of the parse stack and the next token is a bool int chars double or id

19642547
int	double	int	chars
the actual states identified by bison might differ a bit with that change but in the likely event that there were still one having a vardec on top of the stack and one of bool int chars double or id as the next token there will be only one possible action with only the rules presented reduce the vardec on the stack to a rule

19642618
width	height
the width seems to be sized properly but the height isn t working -- it seems to stay 111px no matter what i input

19642658
mvp	presenter
it is true that if you use mvp on winforms this is somewhat alleviated but still the presenter have a much tighter coupling with the ui framework than viewmodels in mvvm which are completely ui-agnostic

19642683
getter	setter
the workaround is to use getter setter methods

19642747

std	ostream
problem is solved by breaking that cycle via temporary std ostream which holds pointer to original rdbuf of std cout

19642833
post	get
so essentially get is used to retrieve remote data and post is used to insert update remote data

19642834
int	chars
in this case the long property names were a significant overhead above the actual int values and using 1 or 2 chars property names reduced the sizes of the entities significantly

19642870
stdout	stderr
like stdin stdout and stderr to specific files see the example

19642955
post	get
can i use the second variant in any case or the documentation should explicitly say that i can use both get and post queries

19642955
post	get
however in order for the call to be restful calling the endpoint via the get method should have a distinct functionality which is to get resource s from the post method which is to create new resources

19642974
implements	extends
with a reference variable of type a you cannot call gets because it could be any type that implements a say aimplementer that doesn t extends from b

i ve been thinking on using backtracking to solve this problem especially the branch and bound technique but it gets faaaar too greedy in term of speed as much as in term of memory even for a over-simpified use

19647465
put	get
this step work fine because when i put a wrong user in the login form the application return the message bad credentials. but when the user and password are correct the application fails trying get the user roles

19647618
subtract	add
if on insert you subtract from stock on delete you should add

19647618
subtract	add
on update you should probably subtract the new but add the old to end up with the difference

19647627
junit	mockito
if you re looking to integrate mockito and junit it sounds as if you might be trying to do bdd at a smaller scale with classes or small groups of classes

19647627
junit	mockito
since bdd s inception tools like junit have improved and mockito didn t exist

19647627
junit	mockito
it runs using junit and you could put mockito in there if you wanted but i still suspect you re mixing concerns if you want to do this

19647631
post	get
in the login screen i only ask for the username and once the user clicks on sign up i sent a post request to create the account and send a get request for the token and use the restkit s setauthorizationheaderwithusername right before the get request

19647635
persistent	transient
benchmark includes some performance numbers for you to decide with both persistent and transient results

19647660
x86	64bit
this jit is targeted at 64bit posix x86 systems primarily and i m concerned about jumps in the code always being encodeable as 32-bit relative offsets

19647678
google-chrome	safari
edit this seems to definitely be occurring on osx google-chrome osx safari havent got a pc to test with

19647684
box-sizing	border-box	height	border-box
i have and my div with 100 height but it gives me extra height yes i saw this but box-sizing border-box doesn t work for me

19647688
width	height
another bug in your code was setting width and height by percent

19647692
subtract	add
simply i could have a class a1 with the properties x y and only with the add method and another class a2 with x y z and the methods add and subtract

19647698
hash	md5
md5 is a cryptographic hash function not an encryption algorithm

19647698
hash	md5
md5 hash

19647698
hash	salt
you should also salt the passwords before you hash them

19647755
filtering	grouping
if i have many grouping and securityroleusers then i will be getting them all from the db and then filtering the result on the server

19647794
pull	push
whenever app is online it can periodically push local inserts to remote and pull data from remote db

19647808
dataframe	multi-index
i actually joined these on a multi-index so the dataframe looks something like the following where name1 and name 2 are indices

19647831
int	double
you can cast it to a number if you know it s definitely going to be a float double int or long

19647843
mouseleave	mouseenter
you should create mouseenter and mouseleave event handler for your div and there you should slidetoggle

19647844
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i ve got a uiviewcontroller that has been pushed onto a uinavigationcontroller stack which contains a single button with an addmaptoview target

19647844
uilabel	nsstring
when i press the button the app crashes usually with no stack trace but occasionally an xxx barstyle unrecognized selector stack trace where xxx could be anything from an nsstring to a uilabel or anything else

19647865
free	malloc
remember for each malloc you need a free or elase you will leak memory

19647878
partialfunction	implicit
a way with a partialfunction and implicit which looks more like your mapfirst

19647881
width	margin
i had to animate the margin and the width of the view because there was no way out since i m using android version 8

19647882
width	height
as informed by luc jquery automatically sets overflow hidden to height width elements in animation

19647888
post	get
so when i submit for the first time i get too see 1 post variable when i submit for a second time i want to see 2 post variables in an array and so on

19648022
postfix	dovecot
i have just installed a centos 6.4 on a vps running a test mail server with postfix + dovecot

19648030
width	height
create a height and a width constraint for your subview

19648030
width	height
otherwise the intrinsic size of the uiimageview determines its height and width

19648030
width	height
you can either do this directly by changing the constant property of the height and width constraint or calling setneedsupdateconstraints and overriding updateconstraints to do the same

19648030
width	height
you may also try creating height and width constraints that directly reference a multiple of the height and width of the scroll view but i haven t tried this other approach

19648055
int	boolean
however when i use it my ide aide complains the operator cannot be applied to instances of type int and boolean .

19648089
versioning	upgrade
recently i upgrade mysql and with it came the new net connector versioning 6.7.4

19648096
hide	show
then for the next two just assign them the hide until show class

19648119
width	height
to be concise the first instant when i adjust the drag handle the box does not scales to the correct height and width

19648179
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i have a code which works in google-chrome and firefox but does not in safari

19648195

the windows ntfs filesystems uses utf-16 just ask martijn pieters so try this

19648223
getc	gets
getc gets the next character byte from the file

19648256
getter	setter
if in the implementation we override the setter and getter and in these setter and getter we don t use an instance variable fullname it is never created

19648256
getter	setter
if however you don t override both the setter and getter an instance variable is created

19648260
getter	setter
definitely use private variable if you intend to use modifier composer and checker internally and create getter and setter method for those variables

19648270

google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
this is the divs i am trying to change that wont work in ie and safari is working in firefox and google-chrome - the extra were a suggestion from another persons answers on this board to a similar not the same problem - they made no difference and can be removed

post	get
i am following along the acts_as_taggable screencast but cannot seem to get the tag pages to filter by tag instead it just shows all the post

19648368
fgets	strcmp
more typically you would read entire lines using fgets and strcmp to compare the lines

19648369
put	get
the only problem is if i put under the a.m.s element then the 3 menu items to the right also get put on a new line

19648392

google-chrome	firefox
but rechecking the app lately i saw the firefox just doesn t work anymore still working on google-chrome

19648455
google-chrome	firefox
both do not work for me firefox only google-chrome is fine

19648458
dictionary	map
the tables above illustrate the commonalities and differences between arrays dictionary and other objects and show that using a dictionary to map property names to property values can represent the properties of any given object

19648458
nsstring	nsdata
the purpose behind coercing all your objects into dictionaries is that the property list format only serializes a few classes - nsarray nsdictionary nsstring nsdate nsnumber and nsdata

19648529
google-chrome	safari
button does accept disabled in google-chrome so i blame safari on ios

19648638
maven	pom.xml
to fix this i changed the version number of the dependency and built this then manually copied it into my local maven repo and updated the main project pom.xml file to use this...and volia it now passes all the tests on the maven build

google-chrome	firefox
the tool tip looks fine in google-chrome but not in ie and firefox

19648673
mp4	webm
create a video element and set src to your mp4 or webm for firefox file

19648727
jlabel	jlayeredpane
i kept this example very simple by using a jlabel instead of your custom animation component and a jlayeredpane instead of your gardenpanel component you should be able to just swap them both out

19648745
folder	directory
now i navigated to this contents folder in terminal in terminal typed cd and then dragged the folder into terminal to auto-fill the directory path and hit enter

if you upgrade mvc versioning the password hash might not be compatible

19648878
for-loop	loops
--see there is a semicoln at end of your for-loop it means loops end from there

19648878
for-loop	loops
so you can t refer to block variables declared inside the for-loop from outside loops

19648885
for-loop	loops
your while loops and for-loop are structured incorrectly

19648936
awt	swing
i urge you to change your app to be a swing app not an awt app

19648937
width	text-align
if your span has width greater than the text you could simply do text-align right otherwise you could float right the span so the width increases from the left

19648962
explode	implode
explode array_slice and implode can help you here

19649017
strtok	malloc
i ve also tried malloc -ing more memory after every call to strtok but nothing seems to fix the seg fault

give the table a fixed width and remove the negative margin on the hover psuedo-class to prevent the last cell overlapping its neighbor

19649054
google-chrome	safari
to summarise the answers given already your options to remove the grey border from an but still display an image using background-image in google-chrome safari are

19649067
put	get	post	get	post	put
the http method is the verb get put post et cetera while the url should always refer to the noun recipient of the action

19649069
post	get
so researching around the internet i found post saying that a better way would be to get the bitmap data using the function bitmapdata which returns an unsigned char

19649069
post	get
unfortunately for me i don t know how to progress further from here and none of the post i ve found show you how to actually get the rgb components for each pixel from this bitmapdata

19649114
client-side	server-side
not sure if this is a little vague but i m grappling with how the client-side interacts with the server-side at the moment

19649114
client-side	server-side
there s obviously something fundamental to the whole server-side client-side system that i haven t learnt

19649175
getter	setter
specifically it will generate a backing variable and also generate a setter and getter for mypropertyname

19649175
getter	setter
its access should usually be restricted to the setter and getter with important exceptions

19649178
factors	mean
and what exactly does it mean by a fixed relative error expressed in ulps can wobble by a factors of up to b.

19649191

google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
works in firefox and won t work in safari or google-chrome

19649363
int	double
if you don t you are by your own and you will have to pass some kind of field like type 0 where 0 is for int 1 for double and so on... and make a dirty switch to cast the field properly

19649467
rss	feed
i m parsing an rss feed and trying to update my firebase based on the rss data

19649492
post	put
i m not going to put the output of that into this post simply because it would be quite long

19649506
width	height
for one you seem to be swapping width and height in them since x is related to width not to height and visa versa for y

19649545
post	get
an unchecked checkbox is not sent in the post request - you only get it if it s checked so you could do this

19649548

i started a new gradlew project then added the dependencies to build.gradle

versioning	upgrade
i upgrade to the latest versioning of passbook which was just updated today to handle the latest changes to rubyzip but things still didn t work

19649680
udp	tcp
i understand that unlike tcp udp is kinda unreliable

19649693
pop-up	dialog
if you don t have a default sms mms messaging application and there are more than one on the device you will need to choose one of the several in a pop-up dialog

19649693
portrait	landscape
that means if you rotate the device from portrait to landscape the coordinates will be relative to whatever corner becomes the uppermost left corner in the new orientation even if the application doesn t rearrange itself for the new orientation

19649701
strtr	substr
you can use the cheaper strtr to translate characters and replace your substr

a better approach might be to post your schema on the code review site and get feedback on your particular design

19649778
width	height
color background width height those properties worked fine but the zindex top left properties do not work

19649795
setinterval	settimeout
try setinterval instead of settimeout

19649821
getter	setter
to do so i need a delegate property which points to the real delegate the view controller but in my constriantmapview if i have one does that mean i m overriding the mkmapview s setter and getter to the delegate and things get kind of complicated because inside mkmapview it could call constraintmapview s methods and i would give it the view controller but i really want to give it constraintmapview instead

19649825
width	height
in my web application when i put a simple space with keyboard space key into a span it has no height or width 0px but when i put into the span it has a height and width

monkeyrunner	adb
after much mild aggravation looking at this problem and not seeing it except rarely i discovered that the so-called monkeyserver is actually the adb android debugging bridge daemon which for some totally unexplained reason didn t start when monkeyrunner threw the exception

19649846
monkeyrunner	adb
the adb daemon is supposed to automatically start when monkeyrunner starts

19649846
monkeyrunner	adb
also you can move the adb s address and port number to whatever you would like from its defaults and then supply the address port and logging level programatically to monkeyrunner when you start monkeyrunner

multiplying	subtract
to calculate the height of the pendulum using theta you multiplying the length of the pendulum by the cosine of theta and then subtract that from the length of the pendulum

19649941
hash	md5
md5 is a one-way hash you cannot without brute force techniques obtain the original string from the hash

19649943
hash	md5
for now i use authentication window to pass username base64 encoding and password md5 hash inside a http header

19649956
hash	md5
you could try using rainbow tables but because number of possible hash is limited there is a chance that you will get another string with the same md5 hash instead of the input

button	checkbox
the function you will add to your delete button will loop through all of the checkbox and see if they are deleted and then delete the checked ones

19650342
button	checkbox
that will delete all of the checked checkbox all you have to do now is make a button and add that function as an onclick

19650343
getter	setter
now for default access modifier visibilty of a variable is in the same class and same package no need of getter setter methods

versioning	upgrade
be aware that if you do this if you later upgrade xampp you may walk over the versioning of phpmyadmin you just installed

19650453
width	height
as with all bitmaps your function would necessary return width and height as well so your function should optimally return an object with reference to the array unless the dimension is always known in advance

slideup	slidedown
hi friends i am working on simple drop down menu using jquery when i mouse enter on the menu then the sub-manues will appear with use of slidedown 2000 and when i mouse out then same will slideup 2000

more specifically i want to make sure this type is a double or int float

19650790
for-loop	loops
in a for-loop or any loops is it possible to increment so that the result is something like

19650804
sorting	grouping
when i compare the gettext in java it shows result false while sorting of the text on the page is correct because my java code gets the text in whole column and sorting is on collapse grouping

google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
the code is working on one local host but isn t on the other host but for other browser google-chrome ie and safari firefox pre-version 24.0 its working very fine

19650815
put	get
presuming that put sets count to 1 and get sets count to 0 this code is actually fine as long as you have only one producer and one consumer

19650827
button	checkbox
but when i include it code does not work means check all button does not selects all checkbox

children	parent
what i tried is first i got the parent of that particular element and then got all children of that parent in ihtmlcollections

19650888
integer	unsigned
note that the and lines rely on 64-bit unsigned integer overflow in order to give the expected results

19650888
integer	unsigned
this should be fine since unsigned integer overflow is well-defined in c and c++

19650888
integer	unsigned
for this reason it s important to use unsigned integer types .

19650945
for-loop	loops
i understand that this for-loop update is different from the previous for-loop update since the first one tried to loops over single elements while this one loops over lists and just accesses the first element of each list

19650982
width	height
of same width but one of them is of different height

19651003

i understand that this for-loop update is different from the previous for-loop update since the first one tried to loops over single elements while this one loops over lists and just accesses the first element of each list

it seems to me that the solution at this point is to either show and hide the slots divs like zhertal suggested or you can possible find some other way to physically move the content of the slots div into board but this may still be a violation of the same security concern

there is no such concept as portrait landscape regarding the video tracks

19662638
portrait	landscape
by default the portrait video is encoded as it is produced by the camera let say landscape and a 90 degrees rotation used to present it properly

19662638
portrait	landscape
this is why you get the identity matrix on the second time it not means that it was changed from portrait to landscape but this time the it s natural size is also swapped and everything should be okay based on your code

sorry i have to edit the question...of course a self-balanced bst can allow to search max and min in log n but i was thinking about something more toward o 1

19663817
multiplying	multiplication
when you multiplying the second with c you are trying to multiplying two arrays of shape 2 so numpy does elementwise multiplication with no problems

19663854
min	max
according to the latest edit of the question i can suggest you to data structures which can give you o 1 min max insertion and deletion in o 1 by modified stack

19663854

free	malloc
if you don t have vla support you can either use a fixed size array or malloc and free

19663923
min	max
an avl would suit searching for max and min is o log n since the min is the left-most node and the max is the right-most node and the tree is balanced

19663923
min	max
if you are only deleting the max min nodes this is also o log n but only when deleting the node makes the tree unbalanced

19663924

in your example one param is passed by post one by get

when the two handles have the same value it is possible to move the min handle to reduce the value but it is not possible to move the max handle at all

19665268
width	height
setting .him to width 50 and height 50 is rather useless if the parent s dimensions aren t set

19665268

please note that there are getter and setter methods for this teamid data member which i have not bothered to include for simplicity s sake

19670347
getter	setter
just know they are a standard getter setter pair

19670387

you are right as regarding to writablecomparator is better to implement yours because as far as i know the way of comparing two objects in sort phase is by once serializable the objects output from the mapper hadoop in order to give and order have to deserialize them so it is pretty much better to avoid the deserialization phase and do the comparison at byte level

19671405

19671478
deselect	multi-select
i thought i remembered the default wpf treeview not allowing multi-select and actually deselect all items if you tried to set isselected on multiple treeviewitems so i was wondering if maybe itemscontrol had that kind of behavior even though it doesn t make sense for a generic itemscontrol to mess with selection
