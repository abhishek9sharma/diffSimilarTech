25442741
vim	emacs	pascal	delphi
perhaps you can improve the situation by telling vim to use the delphi mode instead of the pascal mode this trick works with emacs too

25442741
pascal	delphi
the reason for this is that in general pascal refers to the old language designed by wirth in the 70 while free pascal incorporates many syntactical additions introduced by turbo pascal and delphi in the following years

25442741

most of the development on vim emacs modes usually goes in the delphi mode not the pascal one

int	chars
you are implicitily converting the ascii code of the chars 3 to an int

25442827
int	chars
if you want to get the int value you need to parse that chars

25442829
int	chars
and converting from chars to int just copies that code unit

25442829
int	chars	int	double
note that you have to cast to int because the return type is double in order to cope with chars representing fractions infinity etc

a lot of the necessary functionality is only in later releases of mysql 5.5 and 5.6 and i strongly recommend you run the same versioning on all the dbs involved in the replication stack so you may have to do an upgrade of your old db before all of this which means yet more tedium and replication and so on

if the user choses an item for the first time the list has to change its width to 1 3 of its original size and to double the height of the selected item

25444113
width	height
if an item is already selected in the list and the user selects another the old item has to go back to the original height and the new selected one has to double its height without any width changes

25444113

now if you re passing in a dynamic arrays from say c# you would have to do some string handling and a for-loop for each id to create the sql syntax which is actually fairly simple

25451898
width	height
you might wanna use normal height and width for textarea because modern browsers like firefox has serious issues with cols and rows

25451930

the value is an int 2 24 float or 2 53 double

25452072
int	double
the value has a fractions part but when the value is multiplied by the smallest 2 n necessary to produce an int that int is 2 24 float or 2 53 double

25452072
int	double
if you can find an n positive or negative int such that and where y is an exact odd int then value has an exact representation if y 2 24 float or if y 2 53 double -- assuming no under- or over-flow which is another story

25452072
integer	fractions
to illustrate how few let us consider all the 4 digit decimal fractions of which there are 10000 that is 0.0000 up to 0.9999 -- including the trivial integer case 0.0000

25452072
integer	fractions
this is of course because your decimal fractions is actually the rational x 10 n 2 and your binary fractions is y 2 m for integer x y n and m and for a given binary fractions to be exactly equal to a decimal fractions we must have

25452072
division	multiplication
so the conversion of say 27 which is exact degrees to radians involves division by 180 which is exact and multiplication by our ï

25452360
width	margin
if the element has a specified width you can do margin 0 auto

25452448
setinterval	settimeout
but for now the primary issue is that if an arrow is pressed multiple times after the wait settimeout period it will then progress through the same number of slides ie if the button is pressed 3 times when the setinterval starts over it will move 3 slides again

25452467

equals	gethashcode	case-sensitive	case-insensitive
note that one could design a switchablycasesensitivecomparator whose gethashcode method would always return a case-insensitive hash value but whose equals method could be switched between case-sensitive and non-case sensitive operation

25453070
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
the biggest problem with doing that would be that adding if the dictionary is in case-sensitive mode when two items are added which differ only in case attempts to retrieve either of those items when the dictionary is in case-insensitive mode might not behave as expected

25453070
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
if populating a dictionary in case-insensitive mode and performing some look-ups in case-sensitive mode should be relatively safe however

go to the scheme for your target product - scheme - edit scheme then select profiling from the left menu and set the build configuration to debugging

25458702

for-loop	arrays
i am using a for-loop to generate an arrays with the sum of every possible combination of these areas as shown below

25458786

then i selected continue on netbeans to run the program and the output of the btrace was created on visualvm

25459168
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
i don t know this json library but if it allows you to access arrays elements with random access then a traditional oindexed for-loop would lead to cleaner code that the for in loops that you use

25459866
width	height
this issue comes from bitmap.createbitmap method either width or height equals to 0

you could also change the updatebitmap method from the library to not create the bitmap if the view width or height is wrong

25459901

now i would like to get all the videos post that have the same tags

25459987
post	get
another question is can i get all the post by tag id like this

25460140
directx	gdi
it was introduced with the directx 10 and its usage was very similar to gdi +

25460140
directx	direct2d
but with directx 11 1 the direct2d principles were changed and now its more d3d-like

25460147
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
note that ads files are not moved copied between incompatible filesystems from ntfs to fat when compressed into a zip or archived into a tarball nor when uploaded so never assume that your ads file will be persistent making it useful for storing local-machine-only metadata such as editor preferences etc

25460197
width	margin
by any chance if you could specify an explicit width to the element you can use a negative margin equal to the half of the width to achieve the same result

25460216
int	chars
sender receiver are both int which match a chars unique_id

25460320
debian	linux

25460407
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine on firefox and ie but 3 divs on the right are missing on google-chrome

25460412
disk	ram
also compared to actually retrieving data from the disk which by the way should happen rarely if your database is not huge - you want lots of ram in your database machines to have as much as possible in memory any parsing etc

25460427
post	put
i m little bit confused over http post and http put

25460434
hide	show

25460486
multiton	singleton
there are easy and plenty of hacks to turn your singleton to a multiton so i wouldnt worry about it

25460494
width	height
if you start with a full width desktop browser and keep reducing the width of the browser eg viewport width 870px you will see that the layout starts to look strange because the photo is no longer the height of the row parent container text block

25460517

now issue is when user click another link lets say user clicked twitter then disclaimer is shown but when user click on ok button on disclaimer dialog two pop-up is opened i.e previously shown window and new link window

25460576
comparator	comparable
implement comparable or comparator for class filedetail and implement your sorting logic

25460577

instead set the height and width for the image container class

25460603
int	boolean
if the latter can someone provide an example as everything that i have tried gives me error messages such as int cannot be converted to boolean

25460624
post	get
mvc is stateless so a post request is not a round trip from previous get request

25460624

so you should get this value as parameter in your post request

25460630
for-loop	arrays
you can use for-loop if words is purely an arrays

25460727
put	get	post	get	post	put
i think the only cons of using put etc are that not all developers are familiar with them and some third party software may not support them or at least it may not be as easy as using the more familiar verbs like get post

25460727
post	put
for example i had a problem a few weeks ago when a proxy was placed in front of an api just before it was to go live and the proxy didn t support the http put verb maybe a config issue - but we didn t have access to the proxy to fix it so we had to tweak the api and change it to post at the last minute which also meant we had to change the clients mobile apps that were using it

could i send udp packets from a webpage running locally in the null origin to a c# app if i disable some security features of opera or google-chrome

25461129
draggable	droppable
look at the jquery documentation to learn more about draggable and droppable

25461158
width	height
so every div i put that class in it would show the width and height

25461180
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this happens in google-chrome firefox and safari

25461234
width	height
it should be noted that the hard-coded width and height values in the example are not normally hard-coded

25461234
width	height
in other words i set the border to be a certain square width and height and then i specify how wide i want the button to be namely 10 pixels less

25461234
width	height
now the problem with that is that the width and height are then hard-coded rather than being set by the parent object s

25461263
jtextfield	jeditorpane
if your statstext object is of type jtextcomponent which includes jeditorpane jtextarea and jtextfield then it has several print methods which are demonstrated in oracle s java tutorials for printing

25461270

25461377
swift	objective-c
exposing swift interfaces in objective-c in the

25461377
swift	objective-c

for example your example function has type int however within that function you make a call to double which has type int

25461507
hash	md5
while one alternative that many folks do use is to hash the username and password using an algorithm like sha-1 md5 has some vulnerabilities though it is also used often

25461527
integer	unsigned
the trick is to treat the value as an integer so read your 547.4242 as an unsigned long long ie 64-bits or more ie 5474242 counting the number of digits after the . in this case 4

25461527
division	multiplication
then when you do the eventual division or multiplication by 10 n you have a another potential rounding and b the issue that large 10 n are not exactly represented in your floating point -- which is another source of error

25461575
margin	height
you could position the span element vertically at the middle by using top 50 and adding a negative top margin which is equal to half of the height of the line

25461577
versioning	upgrade
i cannot evaluate the amount of work required to upgrade your use of the older versioning to the newer one but with only the mail component involved this probably is a work worth doing

25461626
put	get
i have tried to put my php code in a loop but then i get

25461636
imageview	picasso
when picasso wants to put bitmap into the gridview imageview it causes a lot of lag

25461642
oncreate	setcontentview
and you should not call setcontentview if you will call finish in oncreate to save memory speed

25461710
int	double
so when you provide a double as input the token does not match the int regular expression so it will throw inputmismatchexception

25461753
width	height
i am trying to check for window size by width or height

25461753

you should use system.out.print instead of system.out.println for the int and println for the boolean

25461842
width	height
i get listview stay on top and stretched at all width and height

25461854

25461897
jasmine	mocha	jasmine	qunit	mocha	qunit
jasmine qunit mocha unit.js etc - as far i as i know are javascript test frameworks

25461906
integer	unsigned
you d have to make your own field that stores a 3-bit unsigned integer with entails all of the appropriate development required to glue it into django s orm

25461927
post	get
if i understand your question correctly you should just add another php function and ajax call to get the post on click something like this i also added nonce to add some secutiry it s always a good idea to add that to your ajax calls

25461978
implements	extends
you can just replace class user implements userinterface by class user implements advanceduserinterface because advanceduserinterface extends the userinterface

25462090
hide	show
just show and hide the popup

25462098
superclass	subclassing
i have a superclass and two subclassing that extend that superclass

25462098

i am trying to replace nsurlconnection with nsurlsession but i found that with nsurlsession i couldn t read the intermediate data chunks like i did in nsurlconnection with the delegate method

25462120
realloc	malloc
you might also want to check for errors as both malloc and realloc may fail

25462146
disk	ram
also your 0.002 s read time for a 5.7 mb file read does not sound realistic if the file is not in the ram cache as it would indicate disk read speed of 2.8 gb s

25462163
width	height
we set the line width for our stroke to 10 of the height of the button

25462181
put	get
i have developed a new login method and i want to put it in github website to get the most important improvements from professionals

i then proceeded to check the vendor folder which had the directory in it for the package but within this directory it s missing all the files folder such as the composer.json src directory etc

25462258
apache	nginx
sounds like you are getting the web server apache nginx etc 404 not found message rather than the zf in-appplication message

25462259
isotope	masonry
js right i also decided to use isotope but that does not change the fact that it uses masonry

25462273
min	max
imagemagick s -autolevels command will calculate the min max of the image and passes it to the -level command

then add a button or something e.g timer that hide the dialog and add a listener to that dialog so when the dialog disposes the main frame is show

25462360
int	double
in order to correctly round all possible decimal representations to the nearest double you need big int

25462373
nsurlconnection	nsurlsession
if you use the delegate-based rendition of nsurlsession the nsurlsessiondatadelegate protocol includes a didreceivedata method so you can instantiate a nsurlsessiondatatask and then write your own streaming code just like you would have with nsurlconnection

25462375
centos	linux
the configuration file httpd.conf is found in etc httpd conf httpd.conf rhel centos fedora scientific linux

25462375
ubuntu	debian
in debian and derivatives like ubuntu i don t think that is the case here but i am mentioning it anyway just for the record the configuration file is apache2.conf and can be found in etc apache2 apache2.conf

25462400

25462528
keydown	keyup
for reasons i have to rely on keypress instead of keydown keyup

25462528

25463051
textwrangler	bbedit
however itâ s a lot easier if you just ask an app like bbedit or its free version textwrangler which has the same applescript dictionary to do the find and replace for you because bbedit is an expert at finding and replacing text whereas applescript by itself is not

25463051
textwrangler	bbedit
so the above script gets a lot shorter easier to write easier to read and easier to understand if you add bbedit or the free textwrangler into the mix

25463092
inherited	properties
my custom handler inherited from java.util.logging.filehandler and was reading int properties like limit

25464734
int	double
because when multiplying an int by a double you get a double

width	height
i want to set the width and height of a div by taking the values of input elements

25467117
width	height
also when setting weight set width if orientation is horizontal or height if vertical to 0dp

25467117
width	height
that way the width height is calculated properly

25467160
gruntjs	yeoman
i have used yeoman bower generator-angular and gruntjs with nodejs in windows 7

25467179
width	height
you need to get the val the moment the person changes they way you coded it gets the value of width and height the moment the script is run and it doesnt ever change

25467198
public	protected
the methods onsaveinstancestate and onrestoreinstancestate parcelable state are declared protected in the view class while in some of its subclasses like textview or listview they are declared public

25467224
ssl	https
and https yourbaseaddress yourapp yourservice.svc are different address with different schema name or protocol as well as different ports 80 and 443 by default so you can have both endpoints for the service with the same basichttpbinding provided that the https one has a bindingconfiguration for ssl transportation as you had done

25467271
int	chars
finally you never assign the return value of fgetc to your local variable c which by the way needs to be an int to distinguish eof from other chars

smarty	phpbb
the only template engines i ve used previously were a modified version of phpbb 3 s template engine and smarty which the phpbb team based their template engine on

that s why it s completely off the screens in mobile and off partly in tablet

25467356
integer	unsigned
i am guessing that i can compare the unsigned int values above 4294967281 but it does not feel right to me and besides i donâ t know if that large integer is vc 8.0 representation of ã and changes from compiler to compiler

25467389
hdfs	oozie
using oozie you can invoke an external action capable of copying files from your source to hdfs but oozie will not do it automatically

put	get
i would like to input something like 01000 00101 01100 01100 01111 and get hello as an out put

25467535
put	get
why there are always six workers get task before print assigned all work in iteration 1 is only if the sixth worker get a task from the queue for the time being the queue is 6 7 8 the ninth task is allowed to put in the queue then the iteration 1 is fininshed and print.it is not purely coincidental.it will print the 9-maxsize tasks before iteration 1 ends.check output if the program below it is quite explaining

25467547
google-chrome	firefox
i have a bootstrap 3 website which looks well in ie but google-chrome and firefox and a bottom slider and small place from the right side is always there even if i scale to 1

box-sizing	border-box
this is something connected to box-sizing property however neither content-box no border-box works

25467550
int	chars
the value you see for unsigned int ã is the result of casting the iso-8859-1 code 0xf1 from a signed chars that is -15 to an unsigned int

25467574
children	parent
normally i would just inject dependancies via the constructor but it gets to be very verbose when the parent class has dependancies and have to pass them through all the children

25467587
g++	gcc
g++ gcc 4.8.2

25467648
fflush	gets
alternatively de-denting the 2nd with block would avoid having to use fflush since a file gets closed automatically when that block exits increasing the chance of it being fflush

25467663
subtract	add
i take the lower nibble of both numbers and subtract them right but i don t understand how to know if there needs to be a 5th bit and carry that over to the lsb of the high nibble of the number and if so how to add it considering i am doing this in 2 s complement so i already have carryin being used

25467697
client-side	server-side
i feel like i ve tried every variation there is client-side and server-side to get this to work

25467698

25467698
hide	show
on click event of a tag it checks for is visible and adjust the show and hide accordingly

25467700
subtract	add
we dont have subtract hardware we have add hardware

25467700
subtract	add
so for a normal add the carry in of the least significant bit is always a zero but for subtract we want to invert and add one so what we do is invert b and change the carry in of that first bit to a 1 which is the same as

25467700
subtract	addition	subtract	add
as far as addition and subtract hardware is concerned there is no such thing as signed or unsigned add or subtract

25467700
subtract	add
this works for any number of bits for example if you have 8 bit hardware but want to do math on 256 bit numbers just do them 8 bits at a time and apply the carry out to the next 8 bits add with carry or subtract with borrow instruction

25467700
subtract	add
so a subtract is an add with a carry in of 1 and the second operand inverted

25467700
subtract	add
but if you have to use an add with carry to simulate a subtract with borrow you need to possibly not only invert the second operand but invert the carry bit

25467726
equals	gethashcode	equals	tostring	tostring	gethashcode
the compiler will generate an is operator for pattern matching and equals gethashcode and tostring methods with record semantics

25467742
strcpy	strncpy
switch from using strcpy to strncpy or strncat which i think is better than strncpy

25467784

ingres	postgresql
now that postgresql has ingres support on their dbs you don t

25468062
sequence	permutation
65 536 is not divisible by 24 so there is no way that your algorithm can map the 65 536 possible random-number sequence to permutation in a way that assigns an equal number of random-number sequence and hence an equal probability to each permutation

25468062
sequence	permutation
could then be implemented by generating eight random indices and then calling this variant as a helper-function. your test would then iterate over all 4096 possible sequence and for each one create a four-element list a b c d and then call the variant method to see the resulting permutation

25468063
google-chrome	firefox

getter	setter
the compiler will synthesize the getter and setter as required with an instance variable named as automatically

25469048
getter	setter
it creates the instance variable but more importantly it creates the getter and setter methods for readwrite properties

25469048
getter	setter
if you ve manually provided the getter setter for a property then an instance variable won t be automatically synthesized and you ll need to add the synthesize statement

25469048
getter	setter
if you implement both a getter and a setter for a readwrite property or a getter for a readonly property the compiler will assume that you are taking control over the property implementation and wonâ t synthesize an instance variable automatically

25474291

cdr	cons
first draft august 24 2014 â the first draft answer defines the variables as a cons cell -- the car is a predetermined overlay string and the cdr is nil

25474747
cdr	cons
when the cursor visits the characters 1 2 or 3 an overlay is placed on top of those characters and the cdr of the applicable cons cell is set to t by using setcdr

25474747
cdr	cons
the overlay removal function contains a list of variable names and the corresponding cons cells -- when the cdr of the cons cell is non- nil t the overlay is removed and the cdr of the applicable cons cell is set back to nil using setcdr

25474747
cdr	cons
the advantage of this type of setup is that the overlay removal function will quickly look at and then skip over variables whose cons cell cdr is nil -- thus saving a substantial amount of time when dealing with large quantities of variables with predetermined overlay strings

25475429
int	chars
c language has pretty weak type-safety and that is why you could always assign an int to a chars variable

25475429
int	chars
you used different representations of an int to assign to the chars variable - and that is supported in c programming language

25475429
int	chars
when you key-in a specific chars on keyboard a pulse of a mapped int goes in and settles in memory of the reading program

25475429

similarly when you print a specific int on a printer or screen that int takes the shape of corresponding chars

25475429

therefore if you want to print an int in an int variable there are routines that convert each of its digits and send the ascii code for each of them and i o system converts them into chars

as the above operation are performed through the use of the natural logarithm i guess the rounding error here is introduced by the division by log 2 as math.log x 2 is math.log x math.log 2

25475562
int	double
for numbers above 2 53 the explanation is that double precision 64-bit floating point numbers cannot represent int bigger than that exactly

25475570
portrait	landscape
as a side note the portrait and landscape implementations do not work either

25475570
width	height
it is hard coded with width 10 and height 10 because that has been the dimension i ve been playing with

serializable	deserialization
the serializable runtime associates with each serializable class a version number called a serialversionuid which is used during deserialization to verify that the sender and receiver of a serializable object have loaded classes for that object that are compatible with respect to serializable

25479182
serializable	deserialization
however it is strongly recommended that all serializable classes explicitly declare serialversionuid values since the default serialversionuid computation is highly sensitive to class details that may vary depending on compiler implementations and can thus result in unexpected invalidclassexceptions during deserialization

integer	unsigned
the c standard captures this by having arithmetic operations defined only on int unsigned int and wider integer types

25480128
unsigned	short
where the standard says â œmay be usedâ above it is trying poorly to express that all short types and bit-fields must be promoted to int or unsigned int before participating in arithmetic

25480175
backtracking	greedy

uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i built a demo app to show that unwinding from a modal segue seems to be broken if your app uses a uitabbarcontroller with uinavigationcontroller

25494802
swift	objective-c
i saw another unwind segue post but it was using swift where as my demo app is using objective-c

25494802
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i also found i can unwind if i remove either the uitabbarcontroller or the uinavigationcontroller but i do not plan on changing my entire app ui architecture

25494807
width	height
if you want it center both horizontally and vertically you will need a fixed height and width to position it

25494807
width	height
then nudge it back with negative margins that are half the width and half the height

25494814
post	get
this is my solution i need get the id of post

25494884
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
i know i could use fileoutputstream and fileinputstream to create an identical copy

25494990
as.date	strftime
first convert to a proper date via as.date then use the formatting options in strftime to get the month name

25495011
int	boolean
the problem here is that this object s state consists of the fusion of three independent pieces of state -- two int counters and a boolean -- and all three must be read and written atomically

25495011
int	boolean
i d suggest rewriting this as a plain object with two plain int and a boolean not atomic not volatile and just lock around everything

25495027
post	get
i suggest you read this blog post to get a better understanding of how you should do it

25495055
profiling	debugging
i am also using team city for some automated build tasks and so i use a different profiling for that instead of the debugging profiling that i use locally

25495089
ssl	https
you can specify https in the host now to use ssl

25495098
pull	push
whether you push and pull the range from the head or the tail determines whether you progress depth-first or breadth-first

25495098
queue	fifo
but if you re working in a breadth first-manner by using a fifo queue as shown in the pseudo-code then the order can matter

25495100
integer	unsigned
the cl_device_local_mem_type type is just an unsigned integer so you should be printing it with u not s

25495102

by default in the profiling debugging and release visual studio will define the trace constant

25495191
profiling	debugging
the debugging constant is similar active by default in the debugging profiling but not release

25495193
dictionary	map
if you know the fields in the dictionary you are wrapping and the types of keys you want to map to from applescript are predictable it appears the best solution is to use a record definition as noted in another answer which also helpfully links to apple s documentation that i at least personally had completely missed from the scripting guide

25495194
nsmanagedobject	mogenerator
mogenerator is able to automatically toggle your nsmanagedobject subclass properties from non-optional to optional every time you change this option for each of your entity s attribute in the data model inspector and rebuild your project

25495501
decltype	auto
you can use decltype with the c++11 auto trailing return type

25495538
behat	mink
yes you would need to use selenium2 driver along with behat and mink + custom js calls to verify specific styles

25495545
sudoers	visudo
important always use sudo visudo to modify a sudoers file

25495572
for-loop	loops
even though i m trying to operate with unmanaged code and memory readprocessmemory and marshal.ptrtostructure are both involved i is a local managed variable that should only exist in the scope of the for-loop and it s value isn t changed in the code anywhere else but by the i++ instruction in loops

25495632
ubuntu	linux
update tested this on linux ubuntu 14.04 gcc 4.8 boost 1.56 and everything seems fine

firefox3 firefox4 google-chrome ieca opera safari

25495647
width	height
in other words why does does an imageview with width and height set to 200 show up as 400x400 instead of automatically scaling the image

25495679
hide	show
everything works great except for the fact that if you were to resize the width of your browser the media queries break the nav appropriately and hide the main nav to show a hamburger-icon mobile nav still a work in progress

25495711
google-chrome	firefox
what boggles my mind is that neither firefox nor internet explorer kept this connection alive between refreshes while google-chrome did

25495741
width	height
scale the image uniformly maintain the image s aspect ratio so that both dimensions width and height of the image will be equal to or larger than the corresponding dimension of the view minus padding

25495791
width	height
also the width and height attributes are deprecated for the tag

25495811
width	height
it seems to me that would guarantee that the height and width of the shaded area would be equal

25495839
for-loop	arrays
so i m new to java and i figured i d do something simple like a for-loop to print out an arrays of strings or something

25495849
button	checkbox
in my case i d love to extend a checkbox or a radio button in order to wrap more complex ui around the same core input element functionality but i don t see any way to do that using the extends syntax provided by document.registerelement

25495861
integer	unsigned
uint32_t is a typedef an alias for some predefined unsigned integer type

25495861
int	chars	unsigned	short
less plausibly it could be unsigned chars or unsigned short on an unusual system or it could be an extended int type

25495875
punctuation	words
note this will fail if the string has multiple negation words that precede a punctuation mark

25495875
punctuation	words
if having multiple negation words before a punctuation mark would ever be the case..

25495939
int	boolean
but for some reason it won t work because it says cannot resolve method inflate int activity boolean

25495948
osx	yosemite
we have tested our macbeacon osx app on yosemite and have not noticed any problems

25496050
firefox	safari	opera	firefox	opera	safari
this problem is not there with firefox safari opera

25496051
super	extends	superclass	subclassing
how can i access the constructor in superclass with parameters lets say the constructor superclass int a if i m going to access it in the subclass1 which extends subclassing because when i put super int a in the subclass1 it only accesses or executes the constructor in the subclassing which it extends

25496053
folder	directory
the exception to this is the platforms folder which it will try to find at your application deploy directory platforms

25496053
folder	directory
windeployqt qt 5.4.1 will copy your imageformats and iconengines plugin folder to your application deploy directory level instead of inside a plugins folder

25496057
folder	directory
inside that directory delete the source folder and pom.xml

25496057
maven	pom.xml
go to the pom.xml inside your project if it is a maven project and add the dependency

25496072
put	get	post	get	post	put
access-control-allow-methods get put post delete options

25496072
put	get	post	get	post	put
access-control-allow-methods get put post delete options

25496079
superclass	subclassing
you cannot skip levels of the constructor if the class in the middle subclassing does not expose a constructor that calls a particular constructor of superclass subclassing of subclassing no longer have an ability to access these constructors

25496079
superclass	subclassing
this rule makes perfect sense though to subclass1 the fact that subclassing extends superclass is an implementation detail

25496098
udp	tcp
note that this only works when there is a connection that is with tcp but not with udp

25496112
post	get
iâ ve post another question here that was to get my external ip and then telnet it to a device

25496139
width	height
say size width 1200 height 600 d 32 nchan 3

25496160
children	parent
to get children of your parent use qobject s findchildren function passing object name or type as template

25496162
getter	setter
make getter and setter for the two parts that modify the appropriate bits in the true representation

25496193
folder	directory
it also allows to search in folder different from the working directory and the ado path

25496210
int	boolean
that s because there s no such thing as an inflate int activity boolean method

25496210
int	boolean
it s supposed to be inflate int resid viewgroup parentcontainer boolean attachtoparent

25496219
inject	interceptor
this may be caused by the fact that the templatefactory see is being inject with the http service in addition to the interceptor itself being composed with the http service

25496251
config	ini
unfortunately when i try to read the ini file with perl s config inifiles module the values are surrounded by those extra quotation marks

25496291
google-chrome	firefox
so i was happy about using it fine on google-chrome but then i turned on firefox and the happy stuff disappeared

i put s after mysql query to try to include variable in the for-loop if i close brackets before query userids only prints last number from arrays

25496575
google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari
safari google-chrome opera all of them are web-kit browsers so it s very difficult to find a css or media query hack to target this browsers specifically

25496616
debian	linux
the background i forgot to mention is that this was compiling on debian linux but not on the cygwin platform i wanted to use

25496625
folder	directory
assuming i put it in a folder icons within the same directory level as my php file where i call google maps services if that helps

25496625
folder	directory
where pubicons is a folder in the same directory as the php file where i render the map

25496633
put	get	post	get	post	put
i used get for a quick test but post put may as well

the public was previously protected and the casting to int above was something else i tried but didn t work

25496710
post	get
i have referred to several post about this but i am not able to get my custom form to save to my database

25496712
google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari
as we know google-chrome is a webkit browser safari is a webkit browser too and also opera so it s very hard to target the google-chrome using media queries or css hacks but javascript is really more effective

25496712
opera	google-chrome
google-chrome 28 and google-chrome 28 opera 14 and opera 14

25496712
google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari
google-chrome 28 and google-chrome 28 opera 14 and opera 14 and safari 7 and less than 7

25496729
gson	jackson
your second question regarding parsing json is quite common and if your intention is to map json objects to java objects you should consider using google s gson or jackson json processor

25496759
google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari
please note that google-chrome safari opera all of them are webkit browsers so it you want to target this browser specifically that would be a real challenge and as i know there is no media queries hacks of css selector hack available for this but this piece of javascript code is really effective

25496772
post	get
i figured a foreach loop that pulls post under it and adds them to the end of the array to keep it going until it runs of out rows would work but i can t seem to get it to keep going through all of them

25496772
post	get
when i try to delete post 53 the row array will have 53 54 55 56 in it but still won t get row 57 or 58

25496789
polymorphism	multiple-inheritance
people often don t like multiple-inheritance or how complicated messy sfinae looks but i couldn t live without it now that i know of it the speed of static code with the polymorphism of dynamic code

25496798
disk	ram
the larger the disk or the vm the higher the performance so in essence the price you are paying for the disk or the vm pays not only for the disk cpu ram but also for the iops and throughput

25496808
domxpath	domdocument
here s a working code with domdocument and domxpath classes

25496810
dplyr	tidyr
assuming a typo in your column headers for df2 the following solution using dplyr and tidyr gets you most of the way there.

25496828
int	double
it also allows you to reuse code in the sense that you don t have to create a specific list implementation for string int double float and so forth

25496828
put	get
ensure that the programmer doesn t have to do unnecessary casts to get back data that they put in

25496835
free	malloc
most likely because glfwcreatewindow allocates the data using malloc and std shared_pointer free the memory using delete

25496857
zipalign	proguard
using android sdk 23.0.2 on cloudbees build servers - i see build errors with proguard and zipalign

25496857
zipalign	proguard
both proguard and zipalign are missing from that version of the android sdk

25496892
photoshop	paint.net
you can use any program like photoshop or paint.net

25496896
gruntjs	yeoman
i am having an issue with angular and yeoman when running gruntjs serve which minifies and outputs my angular app to my dist directory for production

25496912
for-loop	arrays
having said that if you want to do a for-loop you first want to do something like strtotime to get get it on a numeric value you can always undo it after the new arrays is made

25496921
sudo	passwd
but when i sudo make -c usr src linux-3.12.26 m passwd modules i got the error fatal error kernel sched sched.h doesn t exist

25497009
children	parent
in your modal code you need to make use of parent instead of children in order to access the textcontrol

25497081
versioning	upgrade
the development team i m currently working with is planning to upgrade the glassfish server application running on the server from versioning 3.0 sun glassfish to versioning 3.1.2 oracle glassfish and encountered an issue where the ejb web service endpoint urls changed from

accessor	properties
i am trying to understand objects and the dot notation properties accessor

25497100
accessor	properties
mdn properties accessor

25497112
try-catch	exception-handling
you could just be throwing the exception-handling up or catching it in another try-catch block

25497163
readonly	temporary
transform.position.y is readonly in c# so in order to modify it you ll need to store the value of transform.position to a temporary variable first change the value from that variable then assign it back to transform.position

25497168
post	get
server treats post as get as probably request data gets corrupted

25497168
content-length	content-type
request header has content-length but no content-type

25497203
folder	directory
i have noticed that when i deployed my ear file via manually dragging file or adding the file in the server tab the class lib and other custom folder are not included in the exploded folder in jboss directory

25497215
min	max
the bounds of the rectangle containing these points is defined by the finding the min and max x values and min and max y values from all the points on the list

25497215
min	max
that requires reading in every single point and finding the min and max x and y values

25497228
textview	simpleadapter
i m using simpleadapter to populate listview and every row has two buttons textview and radiogroup buttons

25497234
int	double
you also need to use double instead of int so that calculated values are not rounded to int

25497266
getter	setter
is using getter and setter for storing large arrays considered bad practice if data does not need to be private

25497266
getter	setter
i am using getter and setter functions to hold data collected from user to be later used to reconstruct page

25497277
gruntjs	browserify
i pretty new to most all of these tools gruntjs browserify handlebars

25497277
bower	npm
however i got to the point in fleshing out my app where i want to use handlebars for templating and many google searches for bower with handlebars led me to this npm package hbsfy

25497286
width	margin
note and doesn t apply any extra margin or width to your div#container and that also doesn t force the a#link to move or push the next pixel

25497286
google-chrome	safari
tested google-chrome 36 and safari 5.1.7

25497289
accessor	properties
dot properties accessor are a convenience and can only be used where the properties name is a valid identifier you must use square bracket notation for a properties with a name of foo-bar since a name with a hyphen is not a valid identifier but can be used as a properties name

25497290
int	double
they have function like calaab double param1 int param2

25497294
range	max
the excel function max indirect spd_1 max indirect spd_2 etc could then be used on the named range represented as strings in a single sheet

25497294
min	max
both of the above can be repeated the min in place of max to find the lowest speed

25497301
post	get
you can use facebook graph api there is fields likes so it will get all likes data of the specific post

25497357
openmpi	mpich
you originally compiled your code with openmpi which is apparent from its reference to opal but you might have moved to a system that s using mpich or something else like intel mpi

25497357
openmpi	mpich
it s not a problem to move your code back and forth since as long as you re only using standard mpi functions and not extensions it should be portable but if you re going between openmpi and mpich you ll have to recompile your code on the new machine

25497379
post	get
type post or type get in your ajax

25497400
getter	setter
at many cases i stick with getter and setter which makes my code secure as only that keys the ones specified at your setter will be updated

25497415
hash	hmac
just use a sha-256 hash and not an hmac

25497426
public	protected
in some older languages public private protected and default like c++ are considered as access specifiers and everything else is considered as access modifier but in java there is no terminology for specifier everything is by default considered as modifier only

25497426
public	protected
so public private protected default final abstract static strictfp synchronized native transient and volatile are all modifiers only

25497479
google-chrome	safari

explode	substr
i guess an alternative to explode would be to find the position of the 4th - in the string and then get a substr from the start of the string up to that character

25497497
profiler	yourkit
i am experiencing this problem once i have started using yourkit and java mission control profiler

25497522

25497692
mvp	presenter
now you could also argue that the above is actually more of a model-view-presenter pattern with the activity playing the part of the presenter but given that mvp can be thought of as a more specific variety of mvc that doesn t necessarily invalidate the mvc mapping

25497698
put	get
what s needed is to be able to accommodate the variation between buttons and to get them to stay where i put them in my html

25497698
width	height
i solved the problem by floating a container holding the buttons with a line-height if 1 and using some css to float the buttons displayed inline with a min width min height and left padding

25497701
hide	show
the answer is not to remove or hide the button to show running apps but to gracefully handle being put into the background

25497894
google-chrome	firefox
edit it turns out this is google-chrome specific problem sigh... firefox runs it fine

25497910
post	get
may be you should make a single get post call to the server and then on the server side you should fetch the data from first and second resource probably db table

25497917
folder	directory
i thought and i know this is dumb that this would be possible using filecopy because as far as i know ms windows treats copying to a zip folder in a similar way as copying to a directory

25497944

25498335
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
however this only works on firefox but not on google-chrome or safari

25498335
google-chrome	safari
on google-chrome and safari what happens is when i select the drop down and then select an item option nothing happens

25498414

25498696
width	margin
you are using margin-left and margin-right for the divs and by setting this you need to decrease the width than 100 in total because it adds spaces and increased width from 100 to plus margin values

25498700
folder	directory
copy and paste those files only in a similar directory stucture in you app folder

25498711
implements	extends
more or less the same thing as the accepted answer can be implements more succinctly by extends the gridviewpager like this

25498746
free	malloc
using free on anything other than a pointer returned from malloc is ub

25498761
width	margin
the other problem is your margin since you are using width you should use margin too

25498772
width	margin
margin is added to the width so you end up with 100 + 10px which obviously won t fit

25498789
try-catch	exception-handling
it is also up to your consideration whether you want to throw a runtimeexception which callers are not required to catch or a non-runtime exception-handling which callers must catch in a try-catch block or declare to throw it

25498805
getter	setter
i have seen two ways of doing data validation in .net 4.0.currently iam using idataerrorinfo like this but the problem here is this of idataerrorinfo is called only when getter of age property is called.i have some logic in the setter which is dependent on valid value of age

25498805
getter	setter
i can t call those methods as validation is not done when setter is called its done only when getter is called.can somebody help me understand why its designed like that.in my opinion validation should be close to setter where value is assigned

inherited	properties
keep in mind that scope properties only inherited down the state chain if the views of your states are nested

25499004
inherited	properties
inherited of scope properties has nothing to do with the nesting of your states and everything to do with the nesting of your views templates

25499004
children	parent
in this scenario you cannot expect to access the scope variables of parent state views within the views of children states

25499004
children	parent
simply as a parent it can do lot of common stuff for children while it cannot be reached directly

25499011

25499117
junit	testng
you should probably scan your code for imports from junit and replace them with corresponding testng constructs.

25499117
junit	testng
this can be easily done as most of the assertion statements are nearly identical to the junit ones in fact several frameworks exist for automatically converting all tests to testng and the test classes can be stripped of their direct inheritance from junit

25499117
junit	testng
this article may be helpful for understanding the differences between junit and testng

centos	linux	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	linux

the width is set right for both but not the height

25501425
accessor	properties
messaging methods that are not properties with the dot syntax is allowed because at the time properties and dot operator were introduced there were hundreds of millions of lines of code just using get set accessor methods and that meant you could use the dot operator to signal that you were using property-like accessor even though they were not declared as properties

25501425
swift	objective-c
on the flip side there s also no reason to not declare your properties as properties any longer - particularly since it results in less code in objective-c and enables them to show up as properties instead of as methods in swift

25501452
interpolation	splines
i have the following code to do splines interpolation in c# with alglib

25501454
spaces	linefeed
edit2 you may want to remove the spaces in your format in other words linefeed instead of linefeed as my experience with spaces in fscanf formats is that they are not doing what you want most of the time and fscanf will skip whitespaces as needed before the actual input so you should get at least as good results without the spaces

instead of using put post get basic name conventions of api use your function names which are more descriptive to what the function is actually doing

only objects can be dereferenced so primitives like int float double chars byte and there like can neither be null nor can they be dereferenced

25501764
google-chrome	firefox
instead in cases in which vertical content overflows the div shrinks to smaller than the table in firefox and google-chrome on windows

width	height
it appears the overflow width is about the same as the scrollbar width and there is no overflow if the table does not stretch beyond the parent height

25501767
for-loop	loops
it is because break will break the iteration of the for-loop and exit out of loops immediately

25502168
restrict	shared
you ll have to build a functional system application-based things like generating a unique token in the user page and checking that this token is used only once but an anonymous page could be used by thousands of users coming from a proxy cache maybe you ll have to record user ip and restrict the token usage by ip but some users may shared the same ip or maybe you ll have to send the unique token to the user using ajax

25502319
int	double
the cast just converts the final resulting int to long double it doesn t make the division be floating-point

25502360
octal	decimal	integer	unsigned
if all you do is use the constant to initialize a variable you don t need any suffix except for the edge case of a number that is in range of unsigned long long but not long long - in that case any of the unsigned suffixes u ul or ull as well as octal or hexadecimal representation can be used - decimal integer constants without suffix only promote to signed types

25502382
fontfamily	font-size
they have no text so fontfamily font-weight and font-size are nonsense

i added a height and width to the tag but then it appears small

25507357
width	height
i had it as but the width and height came out smaller in the browser

25507387
for-loop	arrays
the way you re doing it at the moment is bad practice if not only for the messing around you ll have to do to keep the arrays size and for-loop in sync through any changes made

25507412
rss	feed
problem i am experiencing is that i use a script which fetches rss feed from our main website

25507412
rss	feed
i use a script called magicparser to fetch those rss feed

25507419

you need to either use one div for each page and them hide show each one when needed or have different html files with code that will be injected into your single html page using jquery or any other javascript framework

25507452

this isn t legal html and in the past i ve seen behaviour such as the submit button from one form actually submission the other form

in this case i would need such a properties inherited method.

25507561
google-chrome	firefox
update a little experimentation with ie and firefox and it appears this problem is restricted to google-chrome

25507567
post	get
i ll post an answer if i get one

25507598
gif	png
the areachart is generated using javascript and rendered as an svg on the page i have tried a number of different approaches for adding the chart including importing the html for the div that contains the chart so far all i get using this approach is the title for the chart and not the actual chart i have looked into converting the svg to an image format png jpeg gif etc and then saving the image and adding to pdf as image

25507615
filtering	grouping
but it seems to be grouping by model_id and then filtering by the year on all the data not just for each grouping

25507634
gridview	repeater
i m not sure if your example is slimmed down or represents your actual use case but in this case you d be better of using either a gridview which will generate a table structure based off of a given data source or creating the structure yourself and then placing a repeater inside it

25507638
button	checkbox
i have a c# app winform that generates groupboxes from an xml file and based on what s in the file populates it with radio button or checkbox

25507652
hide	show
the easiest way would be the show and hide function

25507686
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
everything works fine with firefox and ie11 but has problems with google-chrome and opera

25507713
google-chrome	firefox
while defining a form with input fields in rows in a fieldset ie firefox and google-chrome result in different heights for the input fields

25507781
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
upon further testing i think the problem is that for whatever reason my elastic beanstalk app does not have permission to access other amazon-web-services resources

25507807
int	double	16-bit	64bit
types that can be written include byte 16-bit short 32-bit int 32-bit float 64bit long 64bit double byte strings and mutf-8 encoded strings

25507813
put	get
put subscribe on first textbox it will get whole object then it will process the object then store values in related textbox

25507862
width	margin
then in the css you just set the width of the center-wrapper div and assign an auto margin to center it

25507889
inherited	properties
i inherited from chart and created a multichart by adding a couple of dependency properties

25507902
swift	objective-c
in objective-c and in previous versions of swift you could use another type than bool like if an int is 0 is translates to false and if an object is nil it is also false

25507953
restrict	shared
note i would rather not shared the folder using the virtualbox shared folders as it would restrict me to be between the host and it s own vm

25508027
accessor	properties
properties accessor for application state are bad

25508027
accessor	properties
properties accessor for user state may be ok

25508027
getter	setter
so if you must represent that the object exposes state in an interface then you should use a getter and a setter

25508027
accessor	properties
when you create an accessor you should never create a properties accessor

25508027
accessor	properties
the difference is that properties accessor must always return a properties or set it

25508027
accessor	properties
properties accessor are a bad habit

25508061
min	max
- taking max min of distances between pairs of attributes

25508115
post	put
i try to put a permission on my view which would compare the feedback.user.id with the request.user.id the right work ok on a post on an object and return false but it s still posting my object.

25508122
filtering	grouping
my first thought was to filtering grouping of inputs by div parent which is for example uidivworkgroupmainwn but don t know how to do it

25508143
put	get
third i put the get method in the graphicalview

25508146
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
what i have an amazon-web-services server with an elastic beanstalk environment set up

25508237
put	get	post	get	post	put
you need to either get or post or put your data

25508237
post	get
once the data is more complicated than a few variables you probably want to use post rather than get

25508237
post	put
if you modify or create data then post or put requests are the methods to use

25508245
filesystems	ntfs
i am testing mostly on ntfs filesystems

25508259
hive	hdfs
but you have not added the partition in hive nor you have created the directory in hdfs that way

25508274
csc	vbc
then when you build rebuild your solution the easiest thing to do is to place your cursor in the build output window and search for csc or vbc for vb

25508303
tabcontrol	tabitem
now the above tabcontrol which already contains 3 tabitem is stored as content of another tabitem result here in my code below like this which is kind of parent of all

25508303
tabcontrol	tabitem
so you can see that first is result then it contains tabcontrol and then it contains 3 tabitem

25508303
tabcontrol	tabitem
suppose i have two result tabitem in my observable collection of tabitem and each result represent different object and renders different ui element on clicking 3rd tabitem of the tabcontrol of each result tabitem

25508331
direct3d	directdraw
goto direct3d and directdraw tabs and uncheck allow hardware acceleration

25508340
google-chrome	firefox
as well as on firefox and google-chrome

25508520
versioning	upgrade
as the in app purchase essentially unlocks all features which were included in the paid versioning 1.0 i wanted a way for users that had originally downloaded versioning 1.0 to be upgrade if they pressed my restore purchases button

25508520
versioning	upgrade
however i m still facing the same problem - users downloading versioning 1.2 for the first time and tapping on restore purchases are being upgrade for free due to the receipt check outlined above

25508522
webkit	blink
uses the blink developer tools formerly webkit web inspector

25508528
illegalargumentexception	runtimeexception
log system.out - runtimeexception caused by illegalargumentexception in buffer.limit

25508579
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome looked the same to me so not sure what it is that you want to achieve exactly

25508615
icomparable	compareto
assuming 1 does not occur within f val.compareto null does not cast val from int32 to icomparable in order to call compareto

25508645
subtract	addition
in addition you think that being very young should instead subtract from the job title

25508650
superclass	subclassing
class variables are like globals - if you change it in a subclassing it will also change the variable in the superclass

25508654
inherited	properties
which then means that you functionally have a properties already via inherited in the form of

25508688
width	height
when you refer to width of a bar series i am going to assume you mean the height measuring from the top to the bottom of the bar

25508688
width	height
if you wish to manipulate the height of the bars or the width of the columns you need to use the methods

25508698
hide	show
basically i d like to show hide them one by one on scroll event either with opacity or with display attribute

25508775
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
however when running against an arrays of url s stored within the script through the use of a for each loops it reports every webpage within the list as down despite that the code is the same bar the added for-loop of course

25508810
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade it to the latest versioning but it didn t help.

25508820
apache	nginx
if i m correct in assuming this is an http-auth window that is the remote httpd itself - apache or nginx or iis or whatever - is requesting authentication not the site software you can provide a login and password as part of the iframe src url

25508845
maven	pom.xml
the jaxb2 maven plugin is defined in my pom.xml like so

25508873
superclass	subclassing
i m writing a class in java which is a subclassing of another class i wrote and its constructor explicitly calls the superclass s constructor

25508873
superclass	subclassing
the constructor of the superclass may throw several types of exceptions when initialized directly however when i initialize an instance of my subclassing there are several exceptions that will never by thrown by design

25508936
for-loop	arrays
then i have the for-loop that modifies that companies urls arrays

25508936
for-loop	arrays
then i have the for-loop that modifies that products urls arrays

25508958
width	text-align
a variation of jcbiggar s great solution is to skip the width and text-align for .alignright but simply to float it to the right

25508965
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i have the issue that firefox 31.0 google-chrome and safari are fine renders a 1px-wide border on top of every div which holds a background-image

25508982
google-chrome	safari
i am trying to create a blurred banner effect and it is working pretty well in safari bottom but not so well in google-chrome top

25508982
google-chrome	safari
or just achieve the same effect in google-chrome as i m getting in safari

25508991
client-side	server-side
the other solution i found is client-side by checking the objects from the app itself and calling a deleteinbackground if needed but i would be happy to avoid this because i think a server-side solution would be more efficient

25509014
swift	objective-c
in objective-c it is clear to me but swift could not do likewise

25509026
width	height
i have set the width and height but the red background does not appear

25509035
public	protected
it may be sensible to scope this as protected rather than public

25509072
nsindexpath	nsindexset
what is that line supposed to do objectsatindexes will return a array of objects match all the nsindexpath object wintin the nsindexset that is passed as the parameter

25509079
integer	unsigned
specifically they felt that the concept of unsigned was used mostly to specify the behavior of the high-order bit which defines the sign of an integer value

25509079
integer	unsigned
thus the need for an unsigned integer type was eliminated

25509119
google-chrome	firefox
on both google-chrome and firefox based on my tests right now this seems to be interpreted as a gmt date

25509153
scatter	graphing
if i graphing each sample individually they are fine but when you graphing them together you can only get the xy scatter points but no lines since it thinks there are missing values

25509155
post	get
first stack post so don t be harsh if i get it wrong

25509178
integer	unsigned
unsigned functionality is implemented as static methods on integer

25509222
ubuntu	linux
i m using an ubuntu based linux distribution if that matters

25509240

25509357
jsfl	fla
i m trying to export multiresolution spritesheets from a movieclip or a library item in a fla file via jsfl

25509363
google-chrome	firefox
it will say browse in ie and firefox but choose file in google-chrome

25509389
listener	eventhandler
otherwise you can encapsulate the eventhandler and trigger it to the resume event listener

25509468
children	parent
layout is for parent view not for children

25509468
children	parent
so you should use horizontal and set children width to parent width for remove gap

25509501
children	parent
if i set a parent node with selected parameter to true it will select all of its children but i want to have only the parent node selected

25509528
wildfly	jboss
you also don t need the org.jboss.resteasy resteasy-servlet-initializer when running on wildfly jboss 7.x or jboss eap 6.x

25509528
wildfly	jboss
in the documentation it states the resteasy-servlet-initializer is only needed in containers that are not wildfly or jboss eap containers

25509536
width	height
you see a normal box like this if it has i.e 30px height 30px width and some border lets give it 5px border

25509536
width	height
now you see how the edges of the borders take form then you can just give it height 0 and width 0 and you will have one side of the trapezium made by the borders to have length 0 so you have a triangle

25509555
width	height
leaving those unassigned seems to allow them to inherit the source pdf s dimensions and then the height width of the resulting image is set based on the setresolution value

25509563
width	height
set width height

25509563
google-chrome	safari
tested on google-chrome 20 safari 5.1.7 and ie 9

25509611
children	parent
it allowed us to get past all the major ux limitations that were mentioned while being able to have arbitrary complexity in controller hierarchies parent with children with sub-children etc.

25509701
hdfs	oozie
normally for oozie the sharelib directory is user oozie share lib on hdfs where oozie would be the name of the user which is used to start the oozie server

25509719
screens	tablet
and then you could have enable_service be set to true in some configurations but false in others for example if you only want the service on phone sized screens not on tablet sized screens

25509768
kramdown	redcarpet
i m trying to switch my markdown from kramdown to redcarpet to better support gfm for local development

25509774

my static files are collecting and being served properly from a directory outside of my project root var www mysite static so i tried moving the media folder over there and repeating all of the above steps - same result

25509805
pandas	pytables
you can use pandas with pytables in background to query that efficiently docs

google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome on clicking the button it is going to the given link but it is not working in mozilla firefox

in access set up the graphing with xy scatter like you want

25509992
google-chrome	firefox
i tested on google-chrome and on firefox so..

25510037
width	height
but i want to understand exactly what these properties are so i can accuratly change them and position the lines for height and width

25510082

25510099
rar	zip
but zip and rar files i can download using this code

25510154
decoder	encoder
when you re not working directly with io streams it s usually more convenient to use json.marshal and json.unmarshal rather than creating the encoder and decoder

25510170
submit	submission
my problem is that if the user double clicks the submit button it successfully submit the vote but then it ends up doing an unsuccessful submission after that since the voter name was used twice a double post occurs

25510170
submit	submission
i would love to be able to disable the submit button upon submission but i can t figure out how to do it with the above code

25510171
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
tested in firefox safari and google-chrome with same results

25510196
getter	setter
you can use properties instead of getter and setter methods

25510279
google-chrome	firefox
this problem is only with google-chrome while firefox and ie does not appear

25510301
int	chars
you can use c set and xml entity tags to cast the int to a chars

25510314
put	get
it s easier if i can put both of the two script sections in the body but i ve tried the conventional head body approach as well and i can t get it to execute

25510336
spaces	delimiter
i have tried loading multiple includes into the same line using nothing commas and spaces as delimiter and i always get an error about extra tokens at the end of the include directive

25510449
width	height
if for whatever reason you really need an imageview as a background then use the width and height as 0dp because you are aligning to parent on all 4 sides

25510483
mouseover	mouseenter
you can trigger the hover mouseover mouseenter events on say it s click event

25510568
folder	directory
if not found it will move one level up the directory tree all the way up to the filesystem root so if there are any .jshintrc files in any intermediate folder those will be used instead

25510591
union	distinct
okay there are some things that hurt performance such as an unnecessary select distinct or union instead of union all

25510593
int	chars
this converts the number to a string in decimal then parses each chars in the string as an int

25510598
chown	umask
then i downloaded mamp installed it renamed the mac php to php.backup made a symlink from php to applications mamp bin php php5.5.10 bin php restartet apache downloaded composer to htdocs directory created a new symfony2 project setted the user and group of this project with chown -r user group myproject put umask 0000 into app console and web app_dev.php launched it in my browser

25510710

select the table range you want to melt reshape

25510735
melt	reshape
select the columns you want to melt reshape ctrl or shift-select don t drag

button	checkbox
i then tap a button that invokes another app to launch and then when i return back to my original app with the listview and scroll down the listview i observe a pattern of mysteriously checked checkbox that follow the pattern of the original checked locations that i have made within the listview

25510770
implements	extends
side note the reason i want logexception in the same object that implements the other trace functions is because i ve got code that manages appending to a log file in there and it seems natural to extends it in this way

25510792
width	height
first instead of fiddling with the height width properties that might push other parts of the screen around hit the scaletransform.scaley and scalex respectively you ll want to play with the values i m sure to get the sizes you want. for your size changes

25510836
phpmyadmin	adminer
it is workings fine when i enter the command in adminer or phpmyadmin

25510855
put	get
then i realized i better put the sql server on a vm and somehow get it physically close to wherever the web site on the cloud is

25510864
post	get
using a post as a universal replacement for a get is not supported by the rfc as each has its own specific purpose and semantics

25510864
put	get	post	get	post	put
the rfc also specifically calls out an http 204 as an appropriate response for put post and delete but omits it for get

25510915
post	get
and you will get form re-submit warning because in order to refresh the page you have to send the post request and all its data all over again

25510916
post	get
to do that you need to use javascript which is executed on the dom with php you can t basically do what you re trying to achieve what you can do is retrieve the text with js and pass it to php with get or post methods

25510919
int	double
use double literals or cast one of the int literals as a double

25510924
unsigned	short
in short there are no unsigned types in java8 because it would be a huge effort to add them if there were primitives it would require also large additions to the bytecode and jls

25510965
getter	setter
your name attribute differs from value attribute so you should have both properties defined with getter and setter

25510985
spaces	delimiter
expands to a spaces delimiter list of dependencies for the current rule

25511005
mouseleave	mouseenter
what this does is bind to each li element s mouseenter and mouseleave events and changes the background-color properties of the bull class anchor when the events fire

25511186
int	chars
note that calling int checks whether the chars are digits and throws an exception if not but that it accepts non-english digits such as unicode u+0660 the arabic-indic digit zero

25511202
addition	modulo
since the modulo has precedence over addition 1 5 evaluates to 1 before being added to x

25511221
mp4	webm
we deliver webm mp4 and ogg files i m not sure which is being used on ios but we generate all three for various purposes.

25511331

i m developing a web page using spring 3.1.3 framework and i want to set a counter number of registers counter in all pages but i don t want to put in every get method this counter

25511352
outputstream	inputstream
i have done this before with a vanilla servlet where on the doget method i used a inputstream and outputstream and set the content type and my png would appear in the browser as fast as i could generate it on the server

25511418
maven	pom.xml
regarding maven this tool only supports the pom.xml it s not capable in reading other buildtool files

25511427
urwid	ncurses
sounds like you need a structured menu drawing system for console mode like ncurses or urwid

25511437
equals	tostring
the downsides are negligible and several upsides automatic equals hashcode tostring copy apply unapply product methods etc.

25511466
ready	each
so during development i could use standard cgi with its accompanying performance hit the fact that the python interpreter has to startup each time and then when the code is ready for production use easily migrate it to a fastcgi based backend so that it can run at maximum performance

25511483
tostring	getter
defining case class point x int y int however gives you apply unapply copy tostring hashcode and getter methods all within one line

25511522
slider	owl-carousel
i have an owl-carousel with one item per slider and each image in the gallery has different dimensions and aspect ratios

25511522
width	height
what i want is to get the width and height of the current or active image

25511527
width	height
when you ve done that it will make the whole width area clickable but within the height of the anchor tag if you want to cover the whole div area you must set the height of the anchor tag exactly to the height of the div tag for example

25511536
int	chars
with this approach you are still reading the bytes then converting them to int that represent chars

25511536
int	chars
which int represent which chars depends on the chars set specified utf-8

25511536
int	chars
and it wouldn t rely on providing a chars set to interpret which chars is being represented by the returned int

25511607
serializable	deserialization
search word cache in your application if they are present then you have to use serializable and deserialization

25511654
post	get
you could output json data according to get post parameter by paginating the results in your sql table

25511680
hide	show
i have a large set of 8 series of data over time and currently i have two working graphs one that has a range selector allowing you to slide a bar to select which dates to show and the other has the ability to click on the chart legend to choose which of the series to show and which of the series to hide

25511681
post	get
im prety sure you cant send them with a simple post or get http request

25511793
maven	pom.xml
we can also make use of below given dependency and plugin in your pom.xml file - i make use of maven

25511813
post	get
and on the server side using the value by get post methods

in the previous code i used objectinputstream and objectoutputstream as streams on socket java and it s working but now i don t know

25511886
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
i use in both programs objectinputstream and objectoutputstream

25511979

i m able to post the lat long run it through a function to get the closest schools and print out the dict object in terminal but the template never reloads with the new context_dict data

25511995
folder	dir
make a folder named node_modules on the root dir of your project then go to the console and type npm install parseuri or npm install -g parseuri to make it global

25511996
post	get
rest representational state transfer has more to do with the way you use the http methods to represent your desired action like going to users with get should give you back an arrays of users then post in users 1234 should create a user with id 1234 for example or delete in users 1234 should delete the user with 1234 id etc

25512083
mousemove	mouseup
draw on mousemove mouseup directly if needed

you can multiplying the double and then add cast using parantheses

25516085

upgrade your selenium package to the latest currently 2.42.1 versioning

25516172
cassini	iis
that works the same in iis7 iis express and in cassini

25516200
implements	extends
there is a difference between specifying t with the class and using t in the extends or implements clause

25516200
implements	extends
when specifying t with the class you are declaring the type parameter t but in the extends or implements clause you are using a type parameter that is already declared

25516200
implements	extends
using a type parameter in the extends or implements clause is no different than using the type parameter in the body of the class

25516207
int	chars
since sc seems to be a chars array this means treat the bytes in the array sc as code for a function that takes no arguments and returns an int . this will lead to undefined behavior in the c++ spec and depending on your system that function might work or it might crash due to no-execute bits set on the page containing the code

25516219
chown	chmod
i didn t figure out how to set chown and chmod but i was able to create the file as trusted

i recently had to make a custom view that would show a series of imageview s in a linearlayout - horizontal fixed height matching parent width linear layout with fixed size images

25516445
post	get
read a basic tutorial or the threading module docs if you know what you want but don t know how to do it and post a separate new question if you get stuck somewhere.

25516445
freebsd	linux
if you may have to deal with ridiculously long lines on some nix platforms although it doesn t seem to be necessary on at least recent versions of os x freebsd linux or solarisâ you may have to loop manually instead

25516474
range	minimum
i am looking to find a minimum value of a non-contiguous range using excel vba

25516474
range	minimum
the following is what i have been using but it only returns the minimum of the first contiguous portion of the range

gruntjs	yeoman
you might want to look at references to font font-awesome resources are not updated in yeoman angular gruntjs build as well

25516504
ionic	angular
i ve just pull request to angular because it s an angular limitation not of the ionic

25516534
for-loop	loops
my particular approach is not in a for-loop for loops are not even used in ruby see for vs each in ruby for more info but using a recursive method

25516615

but i can t figure out where to put it to get it to work

25516629

ssl	https
https uses ssl so yeah it s secure but don t send the password in every requests only when it s necessary and don t store it on the phone

25516833
subtraction	addition
this is done to make subtraction an inverse of addition which also operates in terms of array element size

25516833
subtraction	addition
this makes pointer arithmetics a lot easier because the operations of addition and subtraction take care of dealing with the size of array element

25516833
multiplying	subtraction	multiplying	addition	subtraction	addition
without this rule one would need to keep dividing or multiplying results of addition or subtraction by the size of an element in order to get the address of the desired element or to get the offset

25516889
hide	show
i have a button which toggles the value of foo and hide show the form

so basically i want to have two records of each fruits with the min price and the max price

25517087
awt	swing
take a look at painting in awt and swing for details about how painting works in awt

udp	tcp
you can also use the ino field there to know which socket each line refers to and can cross-reference that elsewhere such as by grepping for that number in proc net tcp or udp

25517122
range	min
the min worksheet function works just fine for non-contiguous range and i have been unable reproduce your problems

25517127
min	max
to make your components to be of constant size you will need to use addcomponent component component int min int pref int max

25517134
comparator	comparable
if you dont want to implement comparable interface you can just create a comparator and call the following method of collections

25517186
jscrollpane	jviewport
there is a complicated amount of work going on between the jscrollpane the jviewport the jlist and the jlist s listcellrenderer in which you don t want to get involved

25517186
width	height
this is especially handy when you have a large number of values to add as the jlist won t need to check each one to determine the height of each row and the width required to accommodate the values

25517186
gridbaglayout	miglayout
alternatively you could use a layoutmanager which gives you more control over how components should be positioned and changed such as gridbaglayout or even miglayout

25517220
min	max
now build you output query with only min max

25517286
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
alternative will be to replicate it with mousedown mousemove mouseup but detecting the device as in ios will bring undesired side effects

25517289
post	get
i am creating a shortcode to display the most recent post in the homepage however i cannot get the pagination working

25517356
profiler	visualvm
from the package name it appears that gotosourceprovider is an spi for the profiler module but i wasn t able to find any documentation on how to implement this spi and it doesn t seem to be part of the visualvm extension points

25517392
sorting	filtering
you could take a look at how to use tables sorting and filtering for a ready made alternative but this might not meet your requirements

25517412
amr	aac
unfortunately for you neither mp3 or wma is supported with this method but you can choose between aac and amr codecs

folder	directory
thus this code gives you the root directory for your configuration files or images in case of a frozen application the folder containing the py2exe executable otherwise the folder from where your python script is running

25517657
setinterval	clearinterval
this is perhaps a bit cleaner with a setinterval instead of a clearinterval

25517665
chown	sudo
so you should create data db folder and then give access to the folder by using sudo chown -r data db

25517679
clearinterval	settimeout	setinterval	clearinterval	setinterval	settimeout
you can use setinterval and clearinterval instead of settimeout

25517739
comparator	comparable
because t extends comparable you should be using the comparator method instead for example.

25517740
web.py	cherrypy	flask	cherrypy	flask	web.py
you can use cgi or you can use one of the cool server frameworks that will run standalone or wsgi like cherrypy web.py or flask

25517757
bmp	png
so that users that paste a screen capture to the control get a smaller png image instead of a huge bmp file

25517776

25517923
width	height
you may need to also add width and height to the iframe because sometimes it does not work as well for desktops

25517927
int	double
it seems the double.parsedouble .. call is unnecessary - it s already an int you don t need to parse anything to a double

25517968
submit	submission
also even after i check the length of the value of the textarea before submission my code accept comment with only n as valid content and hence the user will be able to submit empty comment if they press enter in the textarea multiple times.

25517980
libxml2	libxslt
i suspect sudo port install libxml2 libxslt is failing because you don t have the macports package manager installed

25517980
libxml2	libxslt
brew install libxml2 libxslt

25517999
jar	war
then we will deploy war without jar

25518045
inherited	properties
such properties are found on constructor function s for new instances to inherited from roughly equivalent to

25518045
getter	setter
they re referenced through an internal property which __proto__ is was an unofficial getter setter of

25518097
int	chars
even the chars 0xffff is going to convert into the int 65535 . so your while loop is simply indexing off the end of the string

25518112
integer	unsigned
in this case this will lead to the integer promotion which will see -1 converted to unsigned int

25518112
integer	unsigned
otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank

25518112
integer	unsigned
the operand with unsigned integer type

25518188
disk	ram
i ve heard but i can t find a reference right now that linux can actually use binaries .so files as read-only swap space meaning essentially loading a 2mb binary so will increase your vm size by 2mb but not actually use all of that ram because it pages in from disk only the parts actually accessed

25518244
put	get
all you have to do is put a strings in the expression and you will get what you want

25518279

25518324
put	get
ng-include seems can solve this but i don t want to put the logic in another page to minimize server http get request

25518417
int	chars
the size of int on your system would be 4 the size of a void pointer also 4 and while chars can usually be 8 bits long the struct itself will not be 9 bytes long as most systems are at least 32 bit so the compiler is padding them to be multiples of 4 bytes

25518470
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
there may be another issue at play--i was having a similar issue where a custom-generated icon set using font custom would display in google-chrome firefox and some versions of safari but no versions of ios

from your formula it looks like if you swapped the cos and sin then negated the cos term you might get what you re looking for

25518575
cos	sin
it looks like they also swapped the cos and sin and negated the cos term

25518601
int	chars
the important thing to remember is that c++ is a statically typed language and every variable has a type associated with it for example int chars or a user defined type such as movie_t

25518643
getter	setter
getter and setter are also basically unused just access the actual property you want instead

25518647

put	get
however when i try to get it put there using the templatebinding my app crashes because data expects a path object instead of a string

25518934
int	boolean
because because using a + operator in js converts the boolean to an int ref

25518934
int	boolean
so what he s done is basically constructed a numerical value using boolean to int conversion and some grouping

25518974
subtract	add
it is telling me the sum is 5.05.0 when i add 5 as the numbers and it says - isnt a valid operation when i try to subtract

from modelviewcontroller i need to get the width and height of the container

25519119
int	chars
well you can use charat int index method to access chars at your specified index

25519119
int	chars
but for changing chars of the string you can use stringbuilder class and use .setcharat int index chars chars method

25519125
int	chars
you can read a chars from a specific index with charat int index but you can not modify it

i have included the relevant path to the directory which contains the google folder in my header search paths for my test target

25519440
mp4	h.264
as you mention mp4 you presumably need a third party filter codec installed since stock windows does not offer a component for this within directshow api gdcl filters should fix this in windows 7+ and in older systems you also typically need a third party h.264 decoder in addition

25519459
pop-up	dialog
however the log shows dialog is running but in fact nothing pop-up actually

25519465
crypt	hash
however for blowfish algorithm the crypt api still returns normal des hash and not the blowfish hash

you can subclass uinavigationcontroller and uiviewcontroller to prevent corruption

25519648
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
need to use mynavigationcontroller and myviewcontroller instead of uinavigationcontroller and uiviewcontroller

it s like using these functions aes encryption for an nsstring on the iphone but instead of nsstring nsdata

25519723
nsbitmapimagerep	nsimage

25519847
free	malloc
i have to malloc some memory to create a weird structure for the wparam on this message but after calling postmessage i can t free the memory without the program crashing saying there was heap corruption

25520036
int	boolean
pd all types like array or regexp except int string boolean null and undefined are treated like objects

25520119
google-chrome	firefox

uiview	subviews
if i understand your question correctly using a uiview with uiimageview subviews is the right approach imo

25520226
uiview	subviews
what you said also should work fine - creating a uiview adding uiimageview subviews then moving the parent view and changing its visibility etc

25520231

25520647
datagridcomboboxcolumn	datagridtemplatecolumn
when you set autogeneratecolumns to false you will have to declare all your columns yourself by adding them to the datagrid.columns collection property and besides using datagridtemplatecolumn you can use datagridcheckboxcolumn datagridhyperlinkcolumn datagridtextcolumn and datagridcomboboxcolumn

25520666
submit	submission
is submitted this can be achieved when you add in the array at then you have to red your form data in this function post it via ajax and very important return false in this function it will prevent the form submission you can also make a button instead of the submit button that calls this function but then you have to implement in the text-field that when the user presses enter it should send the data.

25538629
for-loop	loops
with an arraylist a hand-written counted loops is about 3x faster with or without jit but for other collections the enhanced for-loop syntax will be exactly equivalent to explicit iterator usage

i can t get the jssor slider to work at 100 width and height

25557541
x86	64bit
however jet is only available to 32-bit applications so you need to go into your vb.net project and target it to the x86 platform so it will always run as a 32-bit application even on 64bit machines

25557541
x86	64bit
further to point #1 so even if you target your .net app to the x86 platform and require the 32-bit version of ace you can still have difficulties dealing with target machines that already have the 64bit version of office installed

it seems to be a low-priority badly-supervised project as evidenced by the poor and inconsistent spelling in the inbuilt documentation the decision to have a leading-zero string interpreted as octal not decimal rather than using o 123 analogous to h 123 for hex

25560471
folder	directory
what seems to confuse people at first is that by default mstest s current directory is not the mstest launch directory but the out folder of the test results

note that based on your evaluation player1 is the min player who is trying to make his points as low as possible while player2 is the max player who is trying to make his points as high as possible

25560657
width	height
i ran the identify portrait_source.jpg command and noticed that it had the width and height wrong â 4320 x 3240 instead of 3240â ã â 4320

25560657
portrait	landscape
so basically imagemagick thought it was looking at a landscape oriented file when really it was a portrait oriented file

25560658
google-chrome	firefox
i believe google-chrome firefox have supported it for quite a while where as ie needs at least version 10

25560669
for-loop	arrays
i need to look at each word in an arrays so i made a for-loop with equaling string word then i made another for-loop that has an if statement that is changing word.charat i with word.charat i+1 and changing

width	height
the function getnewframebuffer is used to allocate allocate memory for framebuffer sizeof pixel x width x height please note that pixel is a user defined data type

25560726
superclass	subclassing
the power of a subclassing scheme is that you can have methods that operate on a generic superclass without having to know the specific subclassing

25560767
linefeed	delimiter
suggested in the comments you can use std getline to extract up until a delimiter by default the linefeed

25560796
versioning	upgrade

i am following this railscast to implement endless scrolling but am only able to get it to work on my post index page

25560857
width	height
inside the onmeasure method i use the provided width height measurespec s to calculate how much room i have

25560857
width	height
then based on that i calculate the maximum width height each item can have and store these in 3 variables width height and radius

25560857
width	height
i also calculate given the padding and spacing between the items what the width and the height of the layout itself needs to be

25560857
width	height
note initially i used setmeasureddimension width height to force the size of the layout but it suffered from the issue that i m about to describe

25560857
width	height
once i ve set all the rows i loop through the items and set their height and width as calculated in onmeasure

25560857
portrait	landscape
when the device goes landscape i see the same drawing as portrait this should not happen unless the device is a square

25560857

then i use jquery to show hide the icon based on the conditions

25560884
post	get
i like to get last 4 post from post collections

25560977
for-loop	arrays
you need to leave the computation of the average in your current for-loop and then create a second for-loop and an int count variable which you will increment each time you find a number in the ba arrays that is smaller than the average

25561023
getter	setter
he said and here s another great use of getter and setter which is to keep ui in sync with a property

25561026

migrate	staging
i tried running cap staging deploy deploys but doesn t run migrations cap staging deploy migrate does nothing cap staging deploy migrations don t know how to build task

25561230
width	height
if the aspect ratio must be maintained that just means that you need to scale the height and width by exactly the same amount

25561230
width	height
for example if the height and width are both less than 1001 and the pixel count is less than 500 000 then you don t bother scaling at all

25561230
width	height
first if the height is greater than 1000 simply scale both height and width by 1000 height

25561230
width	height
this brings the height down to 1 000 and adjusts the width accordingly

25561230
width	height
following that if the width is greater than 1000 simply scale both height and width which may already have been scaled due to the height by 1000 width

25561230
width	height
this brings the width down to 1 000 and again maintains aspect ratio by scaling down the height by the same amount

25561230
width	height
with the height and width both 1 000 or less you may still have a pixel count up to a million

25561230
width	height
if it is over 500 000 you scale both height and width in such a way that the pixel count comes below that value

25561302
min	max
try this looks like your defining a max value but not a min i am assuming you want a number between 0 and mapsize

25561333
asterisk	pbx
i was trying to compile from git source for asterisk open-source pbx and almost immediately after running . configure i hit a rather unusual error when it comes to checking bison s support for parse-param it hits a kind of segfault or rather a memory corruption making the process come to a complete halt by hanging at the caught memory corruption

25561642
width	height
instead of making your images the background of a div put them as an actual element within those divs and give them a height of 100 choose height because your height will break before width since you have wide images

25561645

to get width height from a string drawn with your bitmapfont you can utilize this super nice method

25562122
post	get
now i want to add a feature wherein i can get a user s page id and allow my app to post to that page

25562129

pop-up	dialog
i m using the following code to pop-up the dialog fragment upon button click

25562672
atomic	compare-and-swap
the standard for posix semaphores allows a wide variety of implementation types that might be needed to support implementations on different types of systems machines without atomic compare-and-swap instruction bare-metal with no kernel ... so it leaves the behavior undefined so as not to impose requirements that might limit implementation choices

25562743
miktex	xetex
the easiest way to get a working xetex is to go for any modern latex distribution texlive available for all platforms or miktex windows only

25562752
min	max
for min max you could check at each line of the value was lower higher than a current value and if so update new min max accordingly

25562774
fputcsv	fgetcsv
php offers some nice functions to store data in files be it with json_encode and json_decode var_export to save variables in native php syntax or with fputcsv and fgetcsv to handle files in csv format

25563612
getter	setter
it will automatically create ivar _object setter and getter for it

25563612
getter	setter
but if you override both setter and getter you need to synthesize property like

25563623
hide	show
if the ui is in fact not completely different but has a lot of overlap i would say it s better to make one spa and create a generic set of computed observables that you can use to show hide the correct parts of the ui to each user type

25563625
inherited	properties
this is why doesn t create an inherited properties

25563636
clang	llvm
llvm clang does not provide anything like this or may feel brave and try lld instead of link.exe thus you have 2 options so far

int	double
figure out how to solve the problem with a 3-class case int double and base say and see if the technique works for the n+1 class case

25563735
button	checkbox
scenario 2 multi select select check box with status dead and then select checkbox with hit status you can observe delete button will be enabled which should not happen in my case as in a multi selection and there is a status of dead type which should make button disabled on overall which is not happening

25563785
button	checkbox
i can do a single delete with the javascript modaldelete but i can t implement the same thing with the checkbox since the delete button is not inside the table and it wouldn t be a good sight if you put the delete button beside the checkbox since it has a for-loop for each item in the table

25563793
addition	multiplication	division	multiplication	division	addition
when using just the single addition the program is consistently slower than if i uncomment the next line and do a multiplication an addition and a division

calloc	malloc
i am writing a program which should do multiple things including prompting the user for the name of the input file which i have done but i am having troubling implementing a process where the program processes each line from a file storing it as a struct data structure finally using the malloc calloc commands it will store all the valid records in memory to be validated

25563911
swift	objective-c
looking at the contentsofdirectoryatpath documentation it states it always returns an array - so what said above can be reduced to unwrapping the return value to either a swift or objective-c array with no need to use the optional binding

25563928
getter	setter
so logical solution was to send object and to receive it as an generic object like object data but this object has no getter and setter so it was not possible to extract data

25563928
getter	setter
absolutely not acceptable solution was to create utility class with getter and setter designed for this kind of data

25563961
post	get
by convention it should get submitted to a post action

fish	bash
the reason that you see this with fish and not say bash is that fish wraps ls in a function that passes the -g flag as you can see

25564001
width	height
you need to add dimensions width height for the div having password class .as you want to see that fading effect for the empty string too you need set the dimensions as well

25564001
width	height
what happen is when you give text to that div the div takes width auto and height auto .but when you don t give any text to that div then width auto and height auto will show you nothing and that s purely logical

versioning	upgrade
i would highly recommend to upgrade the class that is making the problems with an older log4j versioning

25564118
serializable	deserialization
the serializable runtime associates with each serializable class a version number called a serialversionuid which is used during deserialization to verify that the sender and receiver of a serializable object have loaded classes for that object that are compatible with respect to serializable

25564119
serializable	deserialization
serialversionuid is an optional attribute of java classes to indicate the standard serializable deserialization format version

if i want to get the third and fifth bits and put them in the first and second bits with everything else as zero i can have

25564265
addition	multiplication
i would also be moderately surprised if the multiplication actually was faster than the addition

25564265
addition	multiplication
if the multiplication is truly faster than the addition then i expect somebody well-versed in byte code could explain why the load_fast for num is faster than the five operations for line 12

25564276
strtol	strtok
as downhillfromhere suggested use strtok to get each part of the string and strtol to convert the read strings to numbers when appropriate

what i wanted to achieve here is to make the images to display in the center either it is restrained by width or height

25564806
mouse	keyboard
i actually ended up using local mouse and keyboard hooks instead of mouse capture

25564829
freemarker	velocity
there are a huge number of template expression language engines to help you with that velocity and freemarker can also solve the problem however they can be too heavy for this rather simple task

25564848
stdout	stderr
on the local server the result is status 0 output array stdout test stderr test as i would expect but on the live server the result is status 1 and output is an empty array

25564898
super	self
int swift i can t overrive the class self super alloc

25564927
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

vb.net	vb6
please notice that we re talking about vb6 and not vb.net or whatsoever

25565030
g++	gcc
and i am using gnu gcc family of compiler g++ version 2.95.3

25565032
google-chrome	firefox
i wonder why the ie error that part but not in other browser like google-chrome and firefox

25565035
nsdata	nserror
the block is passed an nshttpurlresponse nsdata and nserror

25565035
nsdata	nsjsonserialization
if the response is in the 200 range we make sure the nsdata has something in it before handing it to nsjsonserialization

25565077
pull	push
as you can see im working with push and pull

25565077
pull	push
to get the right positions of the elements you had to reset the pull push for the specific widths

25565085
google-chrome	firefox
as you can see in that thread there are different solutions for ie and firefox google-chrome

25565144
children	parent
every time a parent object changes it should send a message to its children so that they can update their state

25565157
width	height
the only thing is to calculate the ratio according to the actual width and height of image

25565161
maven	m2e
in lastest version of the m2e plugin on luna you can display what maven will do

25565167

google-chrome	firefox
this code runs fine in firefox but not in google-chrome

25565317
addition	multiplication
the throughput for addition and multiplication without fma is 2

25565317
addition	multiplication
this is equivalent to an addition and multiplication throughput of 4

25565317
sse	avx
all of the varible here are simd sse or avx registers so i m acting on multiple pixels at once 4 with sse 8 with avx for single floating point

25565317
sse	avx
my frame rate only increases 15 or so using fma whereas when i go from using 4 pixels with sse to 8 pixels with avx it nearly doubles

25565317
addition	multiplication
on haswell and broadwell the throughput for multiplication is twice addition so in this case so it might seem that it would be worse to do x+x but since haswell broadwell can only write 32-bytes per clock cycle it does not make a difference

25565317
addition	multiplication
however if you unrolled the loops enough times so that latency did not matter then the second case would be better in general since all the processors can do addition and multiplication at least every clock cycle

25565326
prepare	execute
edit as debflav pointed out and i ve also touched upon the matter that your queries could benefit from not being execute as simple queries but transforming them into prepare statements

25565356
width	margin
basically set the width to something higher that 100 and the 15 margin came from

25565366
profiling	debugging
there are debugging information in each profiling

i am trying to develop bootstrap s carousel module for news which are fetched from a remote website using its rss feed for my joomla 3.3.3 web site

25565386
rss	feed
i now can see line in the rss feed when i look at the source code

25565386
rss	feed
but i do not know how to handle it on joomla s rss feed module mod_feed

25565520
rspec	capybara
this has caused my rspec capybara tests to fail with the following error message

25565540
punctuation	words
seems like what they all have in common are extra punctuation at the end of the words except for the words #prì cieux

25565553
range	minimum
i want to get a value if the value is in a specified range and if it is outside range it should return maximum or minimum value

25565642
width	height
i expect the image to fill the width and height on those imageviews to create squared images based on my original image using this code

25565642
width	height
but the the image is just stretched on its width but the height is not adjusted

25565642
width	height
where it should be more like this but stretched in both width and height

25565707
implements	extends
the one under question now is when we are extends a thread not implements the runnable interface

25565707
implements	extends
on a side note i am aware that it makes perfect oo sense to implements the runnable interface rather than to extends the thread class but for the purposes of this question let s say we extended the thread class

25565724
hide	show
if i understand right what you need is to show hide the list of areas and change the title according to the visibility of the areas list i.e if the areas is hiding show the + and if it s viisble show the minus

25565757
elasticsearch	kibana
i have setup logstash kibana elasticsearch in logstash-server and logstash-forwarder in client-servers

25565799
opengl-es	glkview
similarly if you draw using opengl-es and the glkview class glkit configures the underlying opengl-es context appropriately for your view before calling this method or the glkview drawinrect method of your glkview delegate so you can simply issue whatever opengl-es commands you need to render your content

25565835
calloc	malloc
one way to get that is to allocate memory on the heap with malloc or calloc

25565836
unsigned	short
note that if there is no padding field then one must generate 5 unsigned long comparisons followed by comparisons of a long a short and a char comparison

25565841
implements	extends
on a side note i am aware that it makes perfect oo sense to implements the runnable interface than to extends the thread class

25565841
implements	extends
actually it makes perfect oo sense to follow either approaches implements runnable or extends thread

25565841
implements	extends
the advantage that you get by implements runnable is that you can make your class extends another class which might actually break your oo design.

25565875
hide	show
i have used 9 ellipse in a grid and my point is to change the color for the ellipse from white to blue just for a second or less then tern again to white the ellipse will be chosen randomly or just to set the 9 ellipse as invisible then show them randomly but with animation for seconds then hide

25565890
range	max
the variables start and end defines the range of numbers you could easily use max val from yourtable as end instead

25565935
post	get
currently i am using both controller for get rendermvccontroller post surfacecontroller

25565941
min	max
i have javascript function that add numbers to array start form min to max and increase by step but when i use getnumbers 2 20 2

smartphone is portrait only but tablet is portrait and landscape

25566109
google-chrome	firefox
in ie and firefox it works but in google-chrome doesn t

25566195
google-chrome	firefox
but on samsung devices with android 4.4 kitkat galaxy s4 s5... the stars are natively styled by touchwiz i suppose and the color property has no effect anymore on stock browser and google-chrome but not firefox

25566245
sum	floor
i created variables on each particular group to sum the values i needed so for example the floor group has a variable that sums the area of all rooms as its on the floor group it sums all rooms on the floor

25566256
google-chrome	firefox
both firefox and google-chrome won t let me submit the form with unfilled required inputs in the disabled fieldset but don t give any instructions on how to complete the form either

25566308
width	height
on button up click try adding the object tag to show the url set width and height which you want.

25566356
int	chars
chars strchr const chars s int c

25566370
versioning	upgrade
the problem being that i ran into a bug in the groovy versioning 2.2.2. that i use in my application the only reasonable conclusion is to upgrade to a versioning in which the bug is corrected

25566370
versioning	upgrade
all these upgrade were already planned to eventually happen but the groovy bug forced the pace and we took longer steps skipping som intermediate versioning

25566381
button	checkbox
if you add a hidden field or checkbox with array name you can use approveall button if you want this below

25566427
dictionary	map
use a dictionary to map the corresponding words

25566427
capitalize	uppercase
with an uppercase letter and use str.capitalize for the output the data capitalize

25566442
screens	tablet
actually aide is pretty practical as a ide if you have a large screens tablet and pair it with a full size bluetooth keyboard

25566477
width	height
however as you can see in this jsfiddle link the height of the sidebar content is much longer and the width of the image block is wider than it should be

25566477
width	height
i understand this is due to the height of the sidebar content set to 100 height and width of the image block set to 100 but i m not sure how to correct it and at the same time make the height the width to fit within the layout

25566493
folder	directory
if you have a lot of libs in a folder turn to configuration properties - c c++ - general - additional include directory add your folder of libs here

25566500
setinterval	settimeout
you can use settimeout instead of setinterval

25566640
bluetooth	usb
i doubt that if your company has disabled usb they still allow bluetooth but because you did not state it specifically

25566692
keydown	mousedown
1 store the selected values on mousedown and keydown events

25566699
inline	inlining
that said i gather that most of the performance difference between inline and out of line comes not from the actual inlining itself but rather from any additional subsequent optimisations this might allow

25566772
client-side	server-side
in asp.net and all other server-side languages if you make changes to elements to the html on the client using client-side scripting such as javascript jquery those changes will only be sent back to the server if they are in form elements such as

25566792
children	parent
alarm doesn t propagate to forked processes so you can set it on your parent so it just times out waiting for children

25566801
opcache	apcu
the tool you are using is for opcache it doesn t know about apcu

25566843
implements	modifiers
if you want to ensure that the layout attributes are always modified according to your layout implements a modifiers for both layoutattributesforelementsinrect and layoutattributesforitematindexpath

25566875
pull	push
but if he first pull the code he gets my rev2 and can proceed to push a modified rev3

25566878
pbkdf2	salt
store the symmetric key wrapped with the master public key and user key the salt required for the pbkdf2 function prefixed by some kind of version indicator of the protocol if possible and the ciphertext together

25566924
alarmmanager	powermanager
the solution is to either use a partial wake-lock using the powermanager or in the above case use a pendingintent and the alarmmanager to trigger a event at a later time

25567135
children	parent
set the font size of the parent to zero then reset that for children

25567140
uiview	subviews
it works if you add a uiview to your table cell prototype and clear it s subviews

25567177
rss	feed
your rss feed that your site reads could be filtered with some parameter to avoid programmatically created nodes prewiew nodes despite these nodes will be available for a very short time

25567194
ant	maven	jar	war
i know you can do that with maven - with jar or war plugin depending on packaging including generating two or more packages with one execution - but i suppose you can with ant or other managers too

25567275
nfa	dfa
the complement of a regular expression can be determined by making an nfa out of the regex then converting it into a dfa if possible make it a minimal dfa

25567297
uilabel	uibutton	uiview	subviews
i am developing an app in which a uiviewcontroller firstviewcontroller contains some uilabel a uibutton and a uiview subviews

25567349
jobs	cron
i ve never really worked with cron jobs other that the below code

25567368
width	height
its height and width should adjust according to the content

25567381
width	height
i am working on a flex air spark list which lists a collection of images with differing width and height

25567381
width	height
i know the current item s width height but i don t know the rowheight decided by the layout left and right margins between the images

25567407
versioning	upgrade
before i upgrade grails versioning i could save korean or other languages to db without any encoding problems

25567455
folder	directory
i have to call one script in informatica command task which is in directory say home folder

25567473
udp	tcp
accessing wmi remotely requires port 135 tcp udp and all tcp ports above 1024 1024-65535 to be opened and forwarded by default

25567473
udp	tcp
after you follow these steps you are required to setup port forwarding and proxy rewrites if any for 135 tcp udp and port 24158 tcp

25567489
domxpath	domdocument
you can do this relatively easily even using domdocument to parse the markup domxpath to query for all the comment nodes and then access each node s parent extract the nodevalue and list those values as strings to translate

25567499
width	height
sometimes user want the text to not contain more than n chars sometimes the source must not be longer than m characters and sometimes the content must not exceed a certain graphical boundary height width - it all depends

25567534
int	double
the representation encompasses int floats and double

25567550
children	parent
but all rows that refer to the parent as parent and children are in the same table will have a correct group id

25567557
put	get
bottom line find the wherever you might have put it and get rid of it

25567624
decoder	encoder
according to the following pictures i have a qtoolbox with two tab named encoder and decoder

25567715
int	boolean
in java instance members are defaulted to the all-bits-off version of their value automatically int s are 0 object references are null floats are 0.0 boolean are false and so on

25567781
email-ext	jenkins
using email-ext version 2.38.1 jenkins 1.575

25567790
rss	feed
i am trying to parse an rss feed and since i m a beginner in android i cannot find a way to do this through a fragment.

25567793
downcasting	upcasting
you are asking about downcasting not upcasting

25567807
put	get
for instance i think i can use something like context.identity.addclaim in configureauth to put the access_token to our identity and then get it from there when doing imap login on another page but not sure if this info isn t already available

25567809
hide	show
you have many other options like putting two login and logout buttons in master page and show or hide them depend on user authentication status

25567809
hide	show
you just need to create both login and logout buttons and related events and show hide them depend on authentication status

25567835
hide	show
hide and show div tag using jquery

25567906
put	get
when i put that in to local.properties i get a error

25567961
oncreate	recreate
since you have already chosen to drop and recreate the table just add the new column specification to the create table in your oncreate

25567979
folder	directory
i guess moving the sheets to sharepoint is the smaller task since the folder can be used like a windows directory

25567994
integer	unsigned
if you use java to call matlab function java sends byte array as input image first of all convert matrix to unsigned 8 bit integer

25567994
integer	unsigned
after set input as unsigned integer you can use those pixel values as rgb in the range 0 255

25567997
min	max
i know there is an extension method to find max and min of array

25568011
inline	inlining
for inlining ghc uses some heuristics to decide whether something should inline or not

25568022
free	malloc
using malloc will allocate memory on the heap until it you free it

25568022
free	malloc
this means you need to assure every malloc has a corresponding free also it is not implied that no other process can t access your data

25568098
free	malloc
yes memory allocated with malloc stays until it is free

25568098
free	malloc
when a program exits all the memory it allocated with malloc is free

25568109
width	height
you are inverting the height and the width when creating the cv mat

25568118
free	malloc
malloc allocates memory on heap and therefore this memory remains allocated until it is free by free function or program terminate successfully

25568182
ready	each
an approach you could take is to subscribe in the template s created function then when rendering the template first check each subscription s ready and if they aren t all true then render a loading display

25568194
noscript	meta
base link meta noscript script style template title

25568262
google-chrome	firefox
when using both a border and a shadow on a single element that is absolutely positioned using a negative translate the technique is explained here i experience an odd rendering bug in firefox and ie it seems to work in google-chrome

25568287
min	max
edit it s important to set min and max if your longitude and latitude is not a real lng lat for example if you could use 2dindexes in a orthonormal map

25568302
post	get
i suggest your read developing with ms sql on your mac blog post from sebastian porto where he nicely explains few tricks and tips - it involves mac but it should get you up to speed

25568309
post	get
if you do get option 2 working though post back it sounds interesting

25568336
getter	setter
the two code samples you gave are functionally equivalent right now but the main reason for getter setter methods whether they re in the form of properties or explicit methods is that their implementation can be changed without modifying the code that calls them

25568336
getter	setter
other than that there is no practical difference -- in most cases even though properties are essentially compiled into getter and setter methods anyway they still retain metadata that they are in fact properties as opposed to methods and some apis rely on this information

25568363
post	get
the problem is that when i try to post to the https 443 outbound what has come in from https 8081 inbound i get the error shown below

25568381
temp	tmp
debug transferpagesourcexml command d.. adb.exe -s emulator-5554 pull data local tmp dump.xml d.. local temp 1-6552-8k.xml

implements	extends
public class myservice extends service implements sensoreventlistener

25568418
post	get
i am using the web interaction to make a post i supose to get a xml as the result just like that

25568458
min	max
maybe make sure that min is lower than max first

25568458
min	max
otherwise your method will semanticly error if the user forgot which one should go first min or max

25568486
int	chars
change the two constant definitions from chars to int

25568493
mathml	mathjax
you could try using mathjax to convert the latex equation into mathml an xml format

25568509
google-chrome	firefox
when i try firefox and google-chrome i got broken images

25568538
implements	extends
where d is or extends com.j256.ormlite.dao.dao parametrized with an object of type t or extends implements t and an unknown type parameter

25568547
listview	gridview
first i will suggest using a listview or gridview to display your databound objects because of build-in ui virtualization

25568551
children	parent
i have a parent children relationship like this

25568607
hide	show
you don t need to call show and hide instead force creating the handle

25568607
hide	show
you need to make the form very small so that user can t notice it probably size of 1 1 then call show and hide

25568788
nsdata	nsjsonserialization
if i understood your question you need to use nsjsonserialization convert json string to nsdata

25568803
width	height
the div in the middle has multiple divs inside it that also have variable information that i want to also be able to adjust the height of the overall container as well and also have variable width so if someone expands their window the content will expand with it

25568819
versioning	upgrade
i use cakephp 2.5.3 and want to upgrade to 3 once the stable versioning is avaiable

25568842
width	height
at present these divs have a different percentage width and a different fixed height in each of the different media queries rules

25568842
width	height
height is needed for the text due to the extra width

25568842
width	height
what i really need i think is something like ....div height 920px minus div width which although not perfect would make the div shorter as it becomes wider

25568874
submit	submission
you should treat submit as what happens after you ve done any pre-processing so binding to click events then conditionally raising the submit is better than always submission but conditionally stopping the submit

25568883
int	double
however i noticed that whilst using json_decode the double value 6.0 0.00 etc are truncated to int 6 0 etc

25568890
mdpi	hdpi
or should i create image size rate for each folder hdpi mdpi ldpi xhdpi

25568936
post	get
this is starting the jenkins job but i am unable to get the post data sent by the hook in my jenkins job

25568940
getter	setter
but the getter and setter are called only on page load

25569063
ant	maven
ant is a separate build system as is maven

25569066
ant	emma
ant emma debug

25569066
ant	emma
ant emma debug install test

25569074
for-loop	arrays
i tried to create a div arrays list outside the for-loop aswell

25569083
nunit	mstest
change mstest to nunit or xunit

25569098
width	height
by using jquery window height you can get the height and with window .width you can get the width

25569103
width	height
therefore in the componentresized method i check if the new width and height of the window equals to the user s screen resolution

25569103
width	height
i had to subtract the new width and height by 16 because these are of offsets of the window border

25569126
portrait	landscape
by clicking this you can modify just one size class for instance landscape and portrait

25569180
mp4	webm
i need convert all videos to my video player in website when file type is other than flv mp4 webm

25569239
google-chrome	firefox
i m testing with firefox and google-chrome under linux

25569245
email	dkim
i have dkim pass and spf pass on my outgoing email

25569248
implements	extends
secondly if you add a method to the abstract class all the classes that extends from it will inherit this method and are forced to deal with implements behaviour of this extra method or have a partly unusable api

25569254
pull	push
technically all changes are implemented as push or pull semantics over event streams so we can only possibly mean the most recent value as of the last event of consequence for this behavior

25569266
maven	pom.xml
unfortunately changing the pom.xml with maven will probably result into a modification of the output directory and you will have to do it again

25569332
loops	while-loop
at the starting of while-loop .this leads to completion of loops until data equals null

25569371
versioning	upgrade
once done generate the component with a new versioning number and in qsys upgrade the component to the edited versioning system - upgrade ip cores.

25569528
folder	directory
if you re insistent on keeping your upload directory within your site folder then you can use a path like upload which will force the path to start from the web application root

25569565
maven	pom.xml
...and here is where hibernate-c3p0-4.2.11.final.jar is specified in my maven pom.xml

25569607
ubuntu	linux
however when i host my application on linux ubuntu 12.04 it gives following error

25569633
spyne	soaplib
you should use spyne instead of soaplib

25569633
spyne	soaplib
as spyne was built from soaplib the spirit of the code will remain and spyne works fine with its own wsdl

25569638
xslt	xquery
to build a new tree like this you need to use a higher-level tool like xslt or xquery or a suitable xml manipulation library in a general purpose programming language

25569660
feedback	review
the most important feedback from code review -- by far -- is high-level feedback about the change as a whole not feedback about implementation details

25569690
post	get
the best approach to mvc is to create a model in your get method use it in your view and post the model in the action that accept the post verb

25569693
post	get
after parsing feedjson from according to above code i get post s url and other stuff but that url is not working for public like if i try to access that link from another fb account then it denied to access

25569727
chown	sudo	chown	chmod
once you change the owner to the right user i assume www-data sudo chown -r www-data www-data ... media make sure permissions are correct sudo chmod -r u+rwx ... media

25569740
hide	show
so i m trying to create a custom class that simulates a bar that when tapped expands to show extra information then when tapped again collapses and hide that

25569741
filesystems	ntfs
the easiest way to get the label of a dos filesystems and ext 234 ntfs etc in linux is with the command blkid 8 it gives the followind output

25569752
uiview	calayer
uiview category for rounding just the corners which you want not all like calayer cornerradius

25569823
webmock	vcr	cucumber	vcr	cucumber	webmock
if you use both rspec and cucumber you might need to create two config files for webmock when using with vcr

25569824
portrait	landscape
and after i have taken the image when i try to get the device orientation in onactivityresult which is called after the picture is taken the device orientation states landscape mode although i took the picture in portrait mode and the device is held in portrait mode

25569824
portrait	landscape
it appears that while taking the picture the device orientation is internally changed to landscape mode even though the image is taken in portrait mode and after the picture is taken it takes a while until the device realizes that it is in portrait mode

25569848
children	parent
i would like to position the children depending on the height of the parent div

25569848
children	parent
vertically if parent div s height allows both children to be positioned vertically

25569848
children	parent
horizontally if parent div s height has not enough room for the children to be set vertically

google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
basically i have a search-as-type panel and i just wanted to react properly to the press of the little x under google-chrome and opera firefox does not implement it and clear a content pane as a result

25569880
google-chrome	firefox
it turns out that google-chrome and firefox react differently

25569880
google-chrome	firefox
in particular firefox treats change as every change to the input while google-chrome treats it as when focus is lost and the content is changed

25569880
google-chrome	firefox
so on google-chrome the update panel function was called once on firefox twice for every keystroke one in keyup one in change

25569880
google-chrome	firefox
additionally clearing the field with the small x which is not present under firefox fired the search event under google-chrome no keyup no change

awt	swing
also note it is usually advisable to draw on a dedicated canvas component jpanel instead of global jframe - it s connected to so-called lightweight vs heavyweight component difference and other oop swing awt edt concerns

25574454
width	height
however you can get the screen s width and height like this

25574454
width	height
and if for example your imageview takes up a specific portion of your screen you can measure it using the screen s width and height

25574459
folder	directory
i have many folder in a directory with content inside them

25574478
joptionpane	jdialog
on further review i can see how you d like to do your logon via a dialog window but i d do just that use a modal dialog such as a jdialog or a joptionpane

25574483
nfa	dfa
independently there are several algorithms for converting an nfa into a dfa

25574483
nfa	dfa
that algorithm is deterministic - there s a specific sequence of steps to follow to convert an nfa to a dfa and accordingly you ll always get back the same dfa whenever you feed in the same nfa

25574483
nfa	dfa
you could conceivably have a nondeterministic algorithm for converting an nfa to a dfa where the algorithm might produce one of many different dfas as output but to the best of my knowledge there aren t any famous algorithms of this sort

25574485
uiview	subviews
try creating a custom uiview subclass that is inspectable designable and add it as the cellâ s contentview â s first subviews in the xib and do all your customization from there

25574530
coalesce	isnull
coalesce or isnull in the join is nonetheless the way to go

25574531
post	get
it d help to see the code you re using to make the angular request as well as the header information from chrome s logger but my first guess would be angular is sending the ajax request with the get method instead of the post method

25574531
post	get
try changing agular to send an explicit post or change routes.php so auth signup responds to both get and post requests

25574540

enter reasonable guesses at your view s runtime width and height

25574707
tostring	getter	getter	setter
finish the blueprint with a minimum of two constructors a tostring and getter and setter

25574735
submit	submission
the usual work around is to ssh to one of the queue submission nodes and submit the script from there at the end of your submission script

25574735
submit	submission
alternatively if this is for the common case of just automatically submission a series of jobs which continue a run you can look to see how job dependencies are handled at your site and submit a convoy of jobs each dependent on the successful completion of the last which will then run in order

25574756
children	parent
the containing div it the parent of the children

25574789

this is the get post part

25574871
win32com	xlsxwriter
if you want to use xlrd xlwt xlsxreader xlsxwriter win32com scripting of excel etc. the details will be different but the basic idea will be the same iterate over the rows then iterate over the date columns generating a new row for each one based on the name from the row the date from the column header and the value from the row

if you use 302 you re risking that ua will re-send post to the new url instead of switching to get

25575034
put	get
if you put a in your loop you will see so will not be in your mylist anymore and you will get the valueerror

mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseenter
i also added listeners for mouseover mouseenter and mouseleave and those are firing in the target window

25575118
popover	tooltip
however using both the tooltip and the popover directive and their associated -trigger and -placement directives the behavior is odd buggy both tooltip and popover are placed based on the popover-placement directive ignoring the tooltip-placement - and display the text provided for the popover

25575172

swift	objective-c
this works in objective-c of course but i can t figure out where the value is hiding when accessed from swift

25575210
int	chars
scanf reads chars from the standard input interprets them according to the format specifiers here d for int and stores them in corresponding arguments

25575369
folder	directory
in this folder i have a .htaccess file and php files - i need use the css js and images from root directory

25575444
nsdata	nserror
in your case after a network failure that returns an nserror with the nsurlerrordomain an appropriate error code and a userinfo dictionary with a populated nsurlsessiondownloadtaskresumedata key you would hold on to the nsdata value for the nsurlsessiondownloadtaskresumedata key and start monitoring for reachability changes

25575444
completionhandler	nserror	nsdata	nserror
if the network interface comes back in the reachability change notification handler you would create a new download task using downloadtaskwithresumedata or downloadtaskwithresumedata completionhandler and pass the nsdata you retreived from the nserror s userinfo dictionary

25575478
hide	show
i am using thehierarchical layout sample from the d3 site that hide show child nodes

25575486
for-loop	loops
now i was thinking of using a for-loop but because of my limited knowledge in for loops i don t know how i can make loops to stop after a certain amount of loops

25575492
put	get
if you put this in a package you ll get the non-numeric argument error and incompatible operators warning

25575500

it would change the default for both tooltip and popover

25575513
int	double
i want to make a function accept any number int float double ... in swift

25575547
awt	swing
awt and swing applications however will almost always end up multi-threaded and therefore extra care should be taken with them

25575551
min	max
making min and max logic dynamic is a little more complex

25575576
folder	directory
look for the entry that gives you access to the directory probably either hostname users or hostname yourname and ensure that under the applies to column it says this folder subfolders and files

25575582
google-chrome	firefox
the issue is it works fine in google-chrome and firefox but i can t get it to work correctly in ie

25575591
put	get
for example i get access to myapplication login and i put the user and password and when i push the buttom log in is when the struts library begins to work

25575615
maven	m2e
meantime i can see from error that your m2e - maven integration for eclipse 1.4.1.20140328-1905 org.eclipse.m2e.feature.feature.group 1.4.1.20140328-1905 doesn t match original version included in sts 3.6.0 which is m2e - maven integration for eclipse includes incubating components 1.5.0.20140606-0033 org.eclipse.m2e.feature.feature.group

mouseleave	mouseenter
my program is currently reading figures from a text file and drawing them on the canvas but i have problem with mouseenter and mouseleave events

25575712
folder	directory
its value would start with the image variable making the resulting filename value relative to the calling process s current working directory which explains why the file is getting saved relative to the vs solution s folder

25575747
uialertview	uialertcontroller
it does not use uialertcontroller or uialertview

25575756
gentoo	linux

25575756
post	get
ask me if you need more info i ll post something more when i get home got that info through ssh

25575837
put	get
the guy that wrote the book async javascript build more responsive apps with less code explains that he would put the functions at the root scope which sure would get rid of the pyramid but now you would have a whole bunch of high scope variables possibly even global depending at the scope you declare them at and this pollution can result in some pretty nasty bugs this could cause var conflicts with other scripts if set at global space sure you could use self invoking functions more yachhh.

25575892
charindex	substr
you will need to use charindex and substr functions to split your input values

25575944
for-loop	loops
it can be for for-loop while loops if else etc

25575949
spaces	delimiter
you have a spaces between about and us which is making mod_rewrite interpret it as a delimiter for the rewrite flags

25576029
min	max
unfortunately the examples in the documentation about annotate only show direct min max values

25576030
screens	pixel-density
just use media queries targeting a screens with lower resolution and use pixel-ratio and pixel-density to be more specific targetting modern mobile devices

25576030
screens	tablet
when targeting tablet you might consider using but for mobile is not necessary you can simply rely on the screens resolution

25576032
width	height
your custom font is wider and or taller than the normal font therefore when masonry calculates the width height of the boxes it does before your font is downloaded applied and that screws the calculation

25576042
listview	gridview
when you use your own onitemclicklistener the default clicking on the list gets overwritten thus not giving you click feedback even if you set clickable true but you can specify the abslistview base class for listview and gridview to still draw a selector

25576055
width	height
as you can see the width and height arguments to image3d s constructor look wonky but i m not sure those are the real values and not optimized out values due to the compiler

25576059
post	put
i am currently struggling with internally forwarding requests with post put form data attached

25576148
stdout	stderr
heroku s documentation says anything written to standard out stdout or standard error stderr is captured into your logs

25576194
width	height
however for simple width and height and ignoring the rest of the parameters able to be set you can just use the base which is the one from viewgroup

25576259
put	get
seems as though if i put the url into the fb debugger i initially get this the og type property is required but not present. error but if i then click the fetch new scrape information button it will find all the correct information like it should

25576303
screens	hdpi	screens	tablet	tablet	hdpi
i ve got an image with a resolution of 1616x369 which fits in to nexus 7 tablet and nexus 10 tablet i guess because they contain hdpi screens densities which looks perfectly fine

25576303
screens	mdpi
but if i change the preview on eclipse to a 10 wxvga screens size which seem to contain an mdpi resolution the image gets pixelated

25576303
mdpi	hdpi
i know this is because i haven t specified an image in the mdpi folder for android to pick it up hence it picks up the image from the hdpi folder

25576304
hide	show
i am trying to toggle on and off hide and show the draggable window not the draggable functionality itself

25576316
int	chars
i think your void solution is as fast as it gets i expect that you are not actually working with chars int and float but that those are just examples and that the long cast is an abstract form of something like a serialization routine - if it is not take a long-array cast on assignment and save the indirection

25576326
width	height
it basically just overrides the new width with the original width so it never changes width but dynamically changes height

25576332
portrait	landscape
i want to disable changing orientation in my android app but i want to allow user use his native orientation landscape for tablets and portrait for phones

25576332

just in case it matters all user classes extends different base classes however they all implements a shared interface

25576481
for-loop	arrays
you can either use the for-loop to append options individually or plug the data arrays into the function using the method described here

25576485
centos	linux	debian	linux	debian	centos
it is confirmed that in the near future xamarin will support linux and provide binaries mono and mainline applications for debian and centos derivatives and their are already packages for debian and centos derivatives for technical preview

25576501
swift	objective-c
i guess because non-embedded swift frameworks aren t yet supported sharing a framework scheme implies there must be an objective-c component of the module

25576606
robocopy	xcopy
yes you can use xcopy or even better robocopy to copy the svn repositories svn will still work as usual if retored back

25576676
versioning	upgrade	installation	upgrade
in my case i want to allow installation of 1.0.0.0 and 1.0.0.1 versioning of product side by side and also support upgrade any of installation like just allowing upgrading from 1.0.0.1 to 1.0.0.2 without changing 1.0.0.0 versioning of product

25576741
cypher	gremlin
neo4j and cypher is still faster and obviously this has no effect on the gremlin queries on neo4j but that might be just a issue with the gremlin implementation for neo4j

25576753
ubuntu	linux
i use linux ubuntu 14

25576759
stdio	fflush
but i would still recommend avoiding making too much of io operations and have some buffering if using stdio 3 routines pass buffers of several dozens of kilobytes to fwrite 3 and use setvbuf 3 and fflush 3 with care

25576759
disk	ram
use ram filesystems tmpfs or fast ssd disk if you can

25576768
margin	text-align
if your fiddle is your real situation container with overflow hidden and text-align left then you may use this to set outside the container the pseudo with a negative margin

25576770
width	height
just set the frame of the view to the frame of the view controller and set the view s autoresizing mask to flexible height and width and the frame will automatically resize no problem

25576771
width	margin
however with both the width and the margin present it will not collapse

25576783
postfix	dovecot
centos 6.5 | dovecot postfix

25576785
integer	unsigned
something like these functions should work for the conversion but be aware that you may need a longer type than unsigned if you need to support completely arbitrary 5-byte bcd sequences but 5 bytes of bcd suspiciously coincides with the range of a 32-bit integer

25576805
google-chrome	firefox
i have checked the same code in firefox google-chrome and internet explorer

25576819
int	chars
notice robot.keypress character.getnumericvalue lol.charat i converts your chars to an int before passing to robot.keypress int c

25576819
int	chars
when you pass a chars in a method it is automatically converted to type chars not type int

25576837
int	chars
you need to pass int s to robot.keypress int not chars s

25576837
int	chars
the best thing to do would probably be to get the chars s int value

25576901
screens	tablet
7 tablet typically require slightly scaled down dimensions to their 10 counterparts since they usually have less screens real-estate

25576922
background-position	background-size
is it better to use a combination of background-position clip and background-size to get the desired effect

org.json	jackson
in the example above an invocation of the url above would try to return a response in json format if a json provider is available org.json or jackson f.e

25577242
fiddler	charles
you will however be able to see it in a proxy like fiddler or charles or when you make the request directly to the api server in case of a get request because a request was actually made and data will have been returned the browsers security policies just denies access to it trough ajax because of the missing cors headers

25577306
mouseleave	mouseenter
i am trying to catch-modify ismouseover to change the backcolor of the button on mouseenter and mouseleave

25577369
strlen	strncpy
using strncpy target source strlen source guarantees that the string in target is not null terminated

25577369
memcpy	memmove
if you know how big everything is you can use memmove or memcpy instead

25577397
children	parent
whenever you add a new child re-index the parent having queried all of its children to find the lowest price

25577397
children	parent
get the parent if price is null get the min value of the children

25577451
serializable	deserialization
the serializable deserialization part is not a big problem rather the network could be the bottleneck if you don t run it in at least a 1 gbit network environment but it should be ok

25577475
width	height
i want make full width and full height slider also fully responsive

25577484
mouseover	mouseenter
i can t for the life of me get the mouseenter and mouseover effects to function without flickering

you need to use both keyup and keydown

25577570
fgets	strtok
what i ve done so far is to use fgets and strtok to iterate through the text file and i m trying to load the tokenized strings into a function to populate the linked list

25577587
put	get
i ve been able to get some raw data in the form of a html webpage which i have in turn put into an ordinary text file

25577603
jtextfield	jlabel
instead give your class a non-static instance int counter variable and a jtextfield non-static variable and simply increment your counter in the actionperformed method and display the results in the jtextfield or jlabel if you prefer

25577603
jtextfield	jlabel
you need to count the chars in a string and so you will need another class instance jtextfield one to hold the user s string get rid of the counter instance field since it no longer will be needed and then in the actionperformed method simply get the string from the jtextfield get its length and display the length in another jtextfield or in a jlabel again your choice

25577607
portrait	landscape
the images seem to be landscape instead of portrait

25577607
width	height
the 200x can also be written as 200 but using 200x or x200 shows better if the width or the height should be resized

25577610
portrait	landscape
one othertwist inside sub-vc i change to landscape finish putting in all value and reset to portrait mode and then proceed to main ctrl then

25577635
keydown	onkeyup
this way the timeout is cleared whenever your client pushes a keydown yet the timeout is set again as soon as the your client releases a key onkeyup therefore will only be called if there s no key action after 10 milliseconds in this case

25577640
sorting	filtering
i ve made a voting script which already works but i wanted to practice some mysql to try and do sorting filtering of the results via sql queries instead of getting an entire table as an array and working with that using loops

25577642
inherited	properties
this has the added advantage of being dynamic when you have multiple inherited and don t know which side a properties comes from you probably don t want to explicitly list a class name for basically the same reason you want to use super instead of explicitly calling a base class method

25577714
width	text-align
set the width of the spans to be the width of the widest icon and use text-align center on them

25577769
strcpy	strdup
there are several issues here but for starters strcpy drinktype strdup token doesn t make a lot of sense

25577769
strlen	strdup
strdup allocates strlen token worth of memory and copies the contents of token

25577769
strcpy	strdup
strcpy drinktype strdup token copies that new memory into the memory pointed to by drinktype

25577782

i have an application in netbeans with a folder in the same directory as the application containing all the images and i also have an attribute string in the class where i save the absolute path when i upload an image

25578103
width	height
instead just make sure that the value you assign to bmi is valid which means it has to be computed after you ve assigned values to width and height

25578103
width	height
drop the initialization on the declaration of of bmi and add an equivalent assignment after valid values have been stored in width and height

25578107
put	get
if i have a sql table that contains hundreds of millions of rows am i going to get the scalability i need if i put all this data into one collection

25578162
inherited	properties
also note that scopes follow prototypical inherited pattern i.e all scopes except isolated scope are inherited from its parent ultimately they all are derived from the which means a child scope can access the properties set at its ancestors via prototype chain

25578190
fontfamily	font-size
it seems like the wrapping is calculated before the font-size and or fontfamily is calculated

25578205
int	chars
a string is a constant object having type array of chars and also it has the property that the last element of the array is the null chars 0 which in turn is an int value converted to chars type having the int value 0

25578244
entities	entitymanager
you can t ask an entitymanager for detached entities because they are .

25578244
entities	entitymanager
for the simple reason that navigation properties look for related entities in the same entitymanager and this detached entity doesn t have an entitymanager

25578262
width	margin
what the margin auto does is that is adjusts its margins automatically within section s width of 100

25578268
box-sizing	border-box
you didn t mention what conflicts but usually it s the .container class being the same or the global -- and necessary -- box-sizing border-box that bootstrap uses

25578782
pthreads	fcntl
if you are able to use the fcntl function in luaposix only available for pthreads oses like linux or macos you can make the calling process block until the lock can be acquired see here for an example but use f_setlkw instead of f_setlk

25579104
folder	directory
the sub domain folder is admin and is in the same directory level as the main domain

25579109

so here is my code that i am working on to upload chunked files i have a 2d arrays each cell in the arrays is inturn another arrays which contains each files info and then followed by the actual file data i am unable to make the http request as soon as the done function is entered instead it is being called after the for-loop is done executing

25579792
caanimation	calayer
this is because unlike applying implicitly animatable properties belonging to uikit the shadow is set up on the calayer of the cell which means to get the animation of the shadow you re probably going to need an explicit caanimation

25579827
google-chrome	firefox
also firefox and google-chrome seem to resolve it differently if it appears in a file called styles style.css

25579827
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome apparently uses the main document as the base firefox apparently looks for the defs in the style sheet.

25579827
firefox	safari
i ve now tried three times to isolate the problem by deleting elements until the pattern works which is how i discovered that firefox doesn t like the style being defined from another folder but i ve had no luck in isolating the problem with safari

now while search add this files i am lock all my controllers and at the end of this operation i want to unlock this controllers but i cannot know the specific moment that the class has finish it s job i try to put break-point at the end of the consumer foreach loop but it seems that it didn t get there so i wonder how could i know when this operation has finish

versioning	upgrade
dr php 5.3.x will still get security upgrade by ubuntu but upgrade to 14.04.1 for a newer versioning

25579857
versioning	upgrade
you could download and build install the source for php 5.6 from the website but don t since it means you risk losing stability with your system because other packages on your system won t be designed for this versioning and you ll have to upgrade it manually every time a new versioning comes out risking stability if those upgrade are security-related since you won t get them upgrade quickly like you would using a package manager

25579867
getter	setter
your mqconnection class is not a java bean no getter and setter so spring can t bind to it

25579867
getter	setter
if you don t like getter and setter use groovy or project lombok

25579873
postgresql	mysql
however a much better solution would be to switch to another rdbms such as mysql or postgresql

25579942
hide	show
if you are interested in toggling show hide in the specific element or part of the page then you should use jquery toggle function

25579942

25580004
mousemove	mouseup
i need to get the coordinates of cursor in mup handler of mouseup and mmove handler of mousemove

inherited	properties
i think it s because #main ul it s more important than .nav-expanded and when you remove the css display this element inherited the #main ul properties

25580098
width	height
so it facilitates handling children and processing properties such as focus width and height

25580099
width	height
i have 2 sections with 2 background images covering the whole width and height of those sections and both are fixed position

25580244
google-chrome	firefox
seems like firefox is not as strict as google-chrome and ie here

25580329
put	get
we then put the result of the previous step into a cte and use a simple group by to get the value with multiple occurences

25580349
integer	unsigned
slotid in your case specified by slot variable is unsigned long integer and it is up to the pkcs#11 library creator to choose what exact value will be used so it may be very hard to just guess the correct value

25580362
for-loop	loops
my code belows doesnt work just keep pointing the cursor at the first record and when i try to replace the if statement with a while or for-loop it just loops to the last record on my data table when i click the button that performs the action

25580383
google-chrome	firefox
no problem with firefox it work without problem but i have trouble to make it work with google-chrome and webkit

25580454
int	chars
your executescalar is bringing a non-numeric chars a which cannot be converted to int

25580494
hash	salt
you always should apply a salt when hashing passwords to have a different hash even if you have the same password

25580494
hash	salt
with the salt as this is usually contained in the hash and you want to hack it then you have to hash all possible passwords + the salt and when you find the combination with the same hash you found a possible password for this hash

25580494
hash	salt
let s say you use a good salt and a long enough password then you need something like 1-5 seconds for a password hash

25580500
postgresql	mysql
i would certainly look up about the null data type with the likes of mysql postgresql

25580513
integer	fractions
obvious choice to store them in a cgpoint struct however the struct is designed to store fractions coordinates but it can handle integer values as well

25580751
filesystems	ntfs
doesn t contain invalid characters for filesystems especially for ntfs as has already been mentioned

25580815
post	get
i have a r.e.s.t web service waiting to received get and post http request

25580864
tinyint	varchar
my opinion would be that if you are simply selecting the value then it would not matter whether you will use varchar or tinyint

25580864
tinyint	varchar
but if you are going to use it in some where condition then tinyint would have an edge over varchar

25580884
put	get
in my app i have put 2 button first button show different location name and second different location name.when i click on one of them then i call get direction from my app like that

25581232
post	get
i have also post same issue in github but didn t get any update

25581380
width	height
interestingly if visibility collapsed instead of hidden cuit will recognize it by reporting width height -1

25581420
width	height
then i would update the template for post_item object to also contains height and width if needed then i would update the template to

25581466
put	get
you should put the check into a filter then only let the user get to the controller if they are logged in in the first place

folder	directory
if that is not what you want please show as directory listings with files and folder in one of the two directory before cleanup and after cleanup

joptionpane	jdialog
i would then add this jpanel to an instance of a jdialog possibly even using a joptionpane and show this dialog making sure to make it modal so you can easily retrieve the values set by the user

25581663
hide	show
this code is using div tag to be show as fullscreen when you press the mouse button and will hide it when you release it

25581678
children	parent
means that after serialization children 0 parent has value but children 1 parent is undefined because parnt1 is serialized one time

25581681
put	get
i want to get the value that is selected and put it into a hidden input value

25581735

25581863
ubuntu	linux
install code blocks on linux ubuntu mingw is windows version of gcc

25581871
swift	objective-c
for some reason the location property on a phasset is only exposed in objective-c and not in swift

25581871
swift	objective-c
to work around it i figured i could create a objective-c class whose sole purpose is to extract the location and import it into swift

25581995
width	height
step1 figure out the device width and height

25581995
width	height
step2 set the width and height of gamehandler accordingly

25581995
width	height
step3 addchild level1 level1.width and height is set to device width height

25581995

level 1 width and height are correct when i trace .widht height but on screen they are much smaller than they should be

25581995
width	height
both the parent clip gamehandler and the child clip level1 are the same width and height and yet they are not

when i opened the file a1.txt it had the chars a correctly in there but for the int it had some weird encoding and a message that if you continue to edit this file it will be corrupted

25582067
cos	sin
for direction you multiply a vector2 containing your cos and sin components by the speed

25582067
cos	sin
this uses cos and sin from so it expects the argument to be in radians

try-catch	exception-handling
a programmer is expected to check for these exception-handling by using the try-catch block or throw it back to the caller

25582098
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
do note that although errors are unchecked-exception we shouldn t try to deal with them but it is ok to deal with runtimeexception also unchecked-exception in code

25582157

postgresql	mysql
the best solution is to forget about mysql and migrate to other sql like postgresql but lacking this option maybe the following will help you

25582313
width	height
so i have lists which give width height x coordinate and style type of flowers

25582313
width	height
i need help taking the data from this list and using it in a function to generate the different types given the width height and x coordinate which could be anything

25582313
width	height
for example if type_a had a width of 30 height of 30 and x coordinate of 30 i would need these generated for style a which may be red and have certain petals and textures

25582356
versioning	upgrade
i d also recommend to upgrade to .net framework 4.5.1 jqueryuihelpers didn t work for me until i installed the new versioning and changed the project application properties to use 4.5.1

25582495
std	ostream
std ostream is a class and not an object

25582504
post	get
for parse post or get method parameters use these functions

25582566
post	get
first of all get that json from post and store it in a var

25582574
websocket	pusher
the value of this will be that when you use a front-end notification service such as pusher what you re really doing is taking data from your application and sending it via a websocket or maybe sse to the front-end browser

25582680
post	get
so same function will work to get title of either post or page

25582709
width	height
type_a had a width of 30 height of 30 and x coordinate of 30 stylea

25582723

serializable	deserialization
i m currently writing a bidirectional map class and i m having some troubles with the serializable deserialization of the class question at bottom

25582842
serializable	deserialization
since the forward- and inversemap dictionaries contain the exact same data my idea was to only serializable one of them forwardmap and then build the other inversemap from it s data on deserialization

25582878
post	get
for this i have an angularjs service that i use get post delete update method

25583076
gif	png
you need to know the image file type jpg png gif etc. as this must be passed as the second argument

25583079
width	height
my goal is to have the div on the right side of the li filling its height while having a fixed width say 10px

25583087
width	height
this is no different than desktop windows in a windowed os windows os x linux or browser windows which can be of any width and height

25583155
children	parent
you might expect that this would cause ebeneezer to have an array containing only child a and noah to have an array containing only child b but in fact both parent will now have an array containing both child a and child b because children actually refers to the same array belonging to the internal prototype object

25583155
children	parent
...then the two parent would have separate children arrays but of course i m mentioning this just for illustrative purposes and you should declare array or object properties in the constructor as i showed above

25583166
hide	show
i mean hide and show on transitions in this particular module instead of removing from dom and rerender

25583230
box-sizing	border-box
as you see this will make your column content box-sizing border-box this will prevent the container from becoming bigger than 100vh because of the padding-top and bottom

25583242
margin	height
also all 3 columns should take the whole height of the window keeping in mind the 5px margin

i initially wanted to test something different with floating-point performance optimisation in java namely the performance difference between the division by 5.0f and multiplication with 0.2f multiplication seems to be slower without warm-up but faster with by a factor of about 1.5 respectively

25583317
spaces	delimiter
for the delims option since the default delimiter character is a spaces without the option it fails with the image files with spaces in the file names

25583396
mouseover	mouseup
fyi all other functions like mouseup and mouseover are not working for e2 as well even if i add them later

25583399

perform some functions on some columns like sum avg max min

25587852
udp	tcp
tcp is also a benefit--you don t want to use udp for in game chats

25587856
post	get
anyways i recommend that you post to the community forum of wuala and you are expected to get a response faster

25587914
udp	tcp
both udp and tcp have benefits in terms of latency

25587937
ienumerable	ienumerator
the ienumerable and ienumerator interfaces

25587937
ienumerable	ienumerator
ienumerable and ienumerator

25587937
ienumerable	ienumerator
as the system.array type as well as many other collection classes already implements ienumerable and ienumerator you can simply delegate the request to the system.array as follows

25587979
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
i tried editing the portion of code from simple-slider.js below by replacing mousedown mousemove and mouseup with the corresponding touch values of touchstart move end - but that didn t work

using godbolt we can verify this is indeed the case at least for several versions of gcc clang and icc

25588103
int	chars
that are int constants enumeration constants chars constants sizeof

25588133
hash	md5
the session id is a 32 byte long md5 hash value

25588133
hash	md5
to date md5 is uncompromised but there have been collisions so it is theoretically possible to create another input text with the same hash value

25588133
hash	md5
the security of the md5 hash function is severely compromised

25588194
children	parent
in the picture there are nodes linking grandparents to their grandchildren whereas a normal binary tree only links children to parent

25588196
swift	objective-c
since this is pure swift code i think it has nothing to do with objective-c

25588200

25588295
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
that is only firefox problem google-chrome and safari work perfectly

25588295
google-chrome	safari
on google-chrome and safari if one dialog is active whole browser is blocked and it is not possible to open new tab until the dialog is opened

25588295
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it would be great if it is possible to make firefox to work as google-chrome and safari

25588339
uibutton	uinavigationitem
you will have to drag the uinavigationitem onto the navigation bar for that view controller object before adding uibutton on top of it

25588340
getter	setter
your workaround is what s regarded as a property in which a getter and setter are defined for a variable

25588341
sorting	filtering
the datatable is doing exactly what it s supposed to all the data is there it s filtering and sorting properly

25588360

base	fractions
since the html for the base directive has to be loaded from the server there will be a fractions of time where no content will be displayed

25588543
for-loop	loops
what happens is that your for-loop is infinite because you don t specify a termination condition nor a break statement in the body of loops

25588575
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
you should loops through arrays with a standard for-loop

25588609
passenger	webrick
i realized that i had switched to using passenger as my web server from a singled threaded process webrick webserver

25588676
int	chars
in your case you want it to be either int void or chars void - functions with no arguments returning chars or int

25588715
for-loop	arrays
i have tried to add the id s to an arrays and use a for-loop to run through each one but get no results

25588730

securesocial	deadbolt
i m trying to use deadbolt for authorization and silhouette or securesocial for authentication using play 2.3.3 and scala 2.11.1

25588827
width	height
keep in mind that visibility only toggles the visibility of the element but the element itself still exists and has all the properties width height etc hence it will push any element if it needs space

25588827
width	height
alternatively you can keep using visibility keeping on mind to adjust the height and width as needed

25588851
maven	pom.xml
this was translated to a compile scope dependency on support-v4 in the maven pom.xml

25588863
inherited	properties
in order to set height 100 the parent must establish a defined height too but if height properties value is inherited then the grandparent must set it

25588863
inherited	properties
so you must set the height properties to other than inherited of at least one parent

25588872
accessor	properties
you implemented the indexed collection accessor for a non-existent properties named data

25588872
accessor	properties
you don t really need the non-mutating accessor since you have an array-type public properties with a normal getter -addedletters

25588878
post	get
the approach to get back on the ui thread commonly used is to post using a handler that was originally created on the ui thread

25588963
inherited	properties
in order to set height 100 the parent must establish a defined height too but if height properties value is inherited then the grandparent must set it

25588979
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
for solving this i make a class fixedorientationtab it is a subclass of uitabbarcontroller and a navigation class orientationenablednavigation it is a subclass of uinavigationcontroller

25588992
width	height
you can get the screen ratio by dividing the height by the width by the height

25588992
width	height
the viewport above will have a minimum width of 800 and a minimum height of 480

25589010
post	put
i m trying to make an automatic news feed on a project website where all the post are put into a json file and then formatted on the news page accordingly

25589021

25589040
post	get
i want to get the username in table user of post id in post table and return view make post.index

25589050

wordpress	joomla
it looks like the best course of action is to import your posterous data into wordpress before migrating your wordpress site to joomla

25589282
multiplying	multiplication
glm may handle this in a number of ways it may build up a cache of things to multiplying waiting for the final vector to arrive then do right to left multiplication

25589282
multiplying	multiplication
it may also more likely use the theorem of algebra that matrix multiplication is fully associative and just multiplying out left-to-right then assure the reader in the documentation that it s the same as thinking of it as right to left

25589386
button	checkbox
there are 7 button that load an sql querys result to the dgv as well as adding a checkbox to select rows

25589418
hash	salt
when salt is not provided a random salt will be created which will lead in different hash though

25589420
hide	show
use css to control the show hide of element

25589430
int	chars
the assumptions i m making here are that your strings only contain number and space chars and the numbers are separated by spaces they are all int values

25589444
express	node.js
not looking for a framework solution like express i want to understand how node.js works and why this is happening

25589506
strlen	strncpy
strncpy dest src strlen src guarantees that the string is not null terminated

25589506
memcpy	memmove
using memmove â or memcpy if you prefer as it is safe this time â is likely to be quicker

25589571
gif	png
i know the file names but not the file type jpg gif png etc

25589665
postgresql	mysql
i test postgresql and mysql using the same code above they are all in repeatable mode .i think the one transaction will fail because the concurrency update

25589665
postgresql	mysql
in fact postgresql does but mysql runs without exception and the one transaction overwrote the result of the two transaction.it means the result is lost that is very annoying

int	chars
but i keep getting the error incompatible types when assigning to type chars 50 from type int

25590217
maven	pom.xml
you need to either state a reference to that jar in your pom.xml and mark it in provided scope or if you are not using maven for some reason you need to add it to your classpath the libraries of your web module in your project

25590270
superclass	subclassing
if you are creating instance of subclassing which in your case is foobarclass you need not worry about message passing from superclass to subclassing

25590270
inherited	properties
with inherited whatever properties methods are exposed in header file .h of baseclass can be accessed from foobarclass

25590270
super	self
if the methods belonging to baseclass has been overridden in foobarclass then you have to explicitly make use of super otherwise you can directly call self

25591383
swing	windowbuilder
you can consider this similar to windowbuilder for swing with a difference of the end result being in fxml .fxml instead of java .java

25591400

getter	setter
that being said it s not considered very pythonic to have getter and setter for every class data

25592282
width	height
because your images are different widths and the default height is auto the displayed height of the images will change as width changes

25592282
width	height
i m betting that when the page width shrinks enough the natural height of the shorter wider image edges under the max-height you ve set

25592290
maven	pom.xml
each time i m changing somethin in pom.xml eclipse forces me to perform maven - update project and than project settings are changed to use jre instead jdk and some maven builds are stopping to work

ssl	https
but an https proxy works differently it first establishes a tcp connection then issues a http connect command and only once it gets a successful response from the proxy it upgrades the connection to ssl

25592656
ssl	https

when you don t define width and height static in the fancybox-options it s possible to get different values using the beforeload -option and set the values as data -attribute on the link

openmpi	mpich
your mpi implementation may have limitations and if your implementation chooses to map mpi processes to os processes as is common and done by mpich and openmpi then you may also run into an upper limit on the number of os processes your os can support

unsigned	short
first as noted in this question you can t instantiate basic_string s and streams with types like unsigned short without writing a hell lot of custom template specializations

25597355
std	ostream
std cout is an instance of std ostream

25597355
std	ostream
and simply put std ostream overloads the operator such that it can accept a several types and return a std ostream reference back

25597355
std	ostream
so the operator on std ostream is mostly same as this function

25597355
std	ostream
this also returns a std ostream reference which is discarded immediately.

25597355
std	ostream
it is because of the fact that overloaded operator returns the same std ostream reference that we can chain the operations together in the manner you have done

width	height
i have used php to upload the images and python cgi-scripting to resize them if their width or height is over 600px or 400px respectively via ajax calls

25597427
width	height
on success another ajax call to resize.py cgi-scripting is made to resize the image if the image is bigger than the max width and height

children	parent
i figured i would just look in the children of the prototype node see the dataloggerp function of the parent search for that function definition and have my problem solved

25597449
inherited	subclassing
by making bar pure this has the usual effect of forcing instantiable subclassing to implement bar or inherited from another instantiable class

25597449
superclass	subclassing
perhaps you explicitly don t want subclassing to invoke the superclass s bar directly and force subclassing to invoke it indirectly via some other protected method or two.

all your values appear to be int which is causing int division try casting one of them to a double

25597696
apache	nginx
the redirections works pretty well in apache locally and remotelly but in nginx does not

25597696
apache	nginx
the strange behavior is that for example when i try to use the url fakesite.tk section index.php apache redirect to fakesite.tk section but nginx returns a 404 error and if i try the url fakesite.tk section index.php mysteriously work note the slash at the end and redirect to fakesite.tk section note the double slash

25597698
width	height
i set the width to be 90 of the viewport width and the height to be half of that

25597698
width	height
using percentage values for the width height and margins

25597698
width	height
you can use a similar approach for the narrow-screen layout using a 1 2 width height

25597700
inherited	properties
you should study the concepts of inherited basemonster being a base class for ghoul and access modifiers which govern which fields methods and properties are accessible from where

assuming you re using mysqli because nobody would be using mysql right you should prepare a statement once bind parameters then execute it in your loop

25597854
explode	implode
if your initial data is an array just explode them again each them gather them inside then finally use implode

25597865
getter	setter
by using public getter setter methods the controller can get the view to render any type of object that inherits from guielement

25597873
hide	show
on my opinion you must use .foreach selectorname to find a matching elements if length is 0 then use . selectorname hide in order to hide delete link or better add css class that hiding link so if there images appear again you ll just remove this css class to show link again

25597886
int	chars
you will get a string get the first chars in the string and then convert that chars to its int code

public	protected
so in general the pattern is to implement the public non-virtual function and the private or protected virtual function it looks like you have researched this already but this is generally known as the template method pattern with more explanations by herb sutter here and here

25598009
public	protected
there are various concerns comming together at the point where your problem lies in general make virtual functions private or protected called by a public function again template method pattern

25598013

25598183
width	height
w h denote the width and the height of the bounding box

25598183
width	height
to calculate the rectangle simply use the minimum x and y co-ordinates as the top left corner then calculate the width and height by subtracting the maximum and minimum x and y co-ordinates respectively

25598221
superclass	subclassing
the general issue is that if a superclass s initializer invokes a method a subclassing may have overridden this method

25598236
width	height
there is lot more to do than just specifying height and width

25598261
for-loop	loops
since your for-loop is nested inside your while fetch loops and you are using the for-loop to populate individual variables on each loops iteration you are overwriting the same variable

25598261
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
the for-loop needs to happen after the while loops once all rows have been fetched into an arrays

copying	overwrite
this is where the problem lies -- since we re a team handling different modules at a time it may come to a point where they would need to overwrite the .phtml file i ve written and do the same process -- copying the contents from the original which in this case should be my custom .phtml to their custom .phtml which isn t upgrade safe at all because any future changes that i make on my module will not reflect on the template as my colleague has already rewritten it

viewdidload	viewwillappear
try the same code in viewwillappear instead of viewdidload

25599429
width	height
another improvement would be to initially only read the meta exif data into bmoriginal as the only use of this variable is to retrieve the height and width

25599441
width	height
you need to set the height and width of the object tag you are adding

subtract	add
look at it this way based on your logic while x is greater than 100 add 5 while it s greater than 500 subtract 5 .

25599703
subtract	add
so once it reaches more than 500 it s both greater than 100 and greater than 500 ...so you re going to add and subtract 5 meaning it won t go anywhere

25599729
subtract	add
therefore when it reaches 505 it will add 5 then subtract 5 each update

i have a listview with a textview and switch.the listview is inside a settings page fragment.while clicking swiches some settings gets changed on off .its works fine for me.consider a situation if i changed the third switching state from on to off and i scroll the listview.after the third list element move inside the view and i return back the list to its original visible position the third switching become in on state.however the third setting become in off state programatically but it shown as on.if i changed the fragment containing listview with another one home and i return back to settings screens then i can see the third switching is in off state.that means the list view item returns back to its loading state if it disappear while scrolling and return back

hide	show
the problem in your case is general while using jquery..let me explain..when we use in jquery firstly your dom will first load i.e your html will render first and then event will fire and then the code inside will execute which will take flicker of a time atleast so in your problem you can implement a loading image on page load i.e when your page first loads display a loading image so that when your bxslider will complete loading then you can hide loading image something as show below

implements	extends
in r inheritance can be implements by extends a list based class the following way

25600776
integer	unsigned
depending on your platform if int is 32 bit the integer part of this value is too big to be represented by an unsigned int

25600778
int	double
the convertion from double to int first disregards the fractional part giving 4294967295

25600780
integer	fractions
when a finite value of real floating type is converted to an integer type other than _bool the fractions part is discarded the value is truncated toward zero

25600780
integer	unsigned
50 the remaindering operation performed when a value of integer type is converted to unsigned type need not be performed when a value of real floating type is converted to unsigned type

25601569
udp	tcp
imho it s much easier to assemble messages in tcp than writing a reliable protocol on top of udp

25601587
dictionary	map
in scala and most statically typed languages we use map s instead for the dictionary use case

25601587

viewmodel	caliburn
link caliburn micro mapping a actionmessage methodname to a child object of the viewmodel

25601804
children	parent
the children elements width is set to 100 so they are always updating to the current width of the parent which is being animated

25601804
width	height	children	parent
by setting a fixed width for the parent element and just animating the height or providing a fixed width for the children would also solve it

25601818
button	checkbox
i placed a button that when user click on that the size of all checkbox should change in all panels and forms

for-loop	arrays
i am struggling with both stages - how to use the names of individual variables in a for-loop and how to properly save individual outputs in a combined arrays

25601994
int	double
the exception occurs because you are entering string 7.25 and trying to retrieve double and int from the scanner using input.nextint and input.nextdouble

25601997
min	max
this would allow you to calculate min max etc

25602011
min	max
min and max are called twice because first call creates maximum among rows second call among columns

25602031
fullscreen	minimized
attempting to bring another window in front of it will either minimized the fullscreen application or force it into windowed mode

25602194
inherited	properties
in css you can just inherited the properties of the parent into the child element

25602206
put	get
but when using multi threads to get and put the order can not be ensured

25602211

also as i see you send post request but get request is expected on server side

25602519
treemap	treeset
3 another significant difference between hashset and treeset is that hashset is backed by hashmap while treeset is backed by treemap in java

25602519
equals	compareto
4 one more difference between hashset and treeset which is worth remembering is that hashset uses equals method to compare two object in set and for detecting duplicates while treeset uses compareto method for same purpose

25602519
equals	compareto
if equals and compareto are not consistent for two equals object equals should return true while compareto should return zero than it will break contract of set interface and will allow duplicates in set implementations like treeset

25602519
comparator	comparable
hashset doesn t guaranteed any order while treeset maintains objects in sorted order defined by either comparable or comparator method in java

25602526
getter	setter

25603092
filtering	grouping
thus the account will have the grouping view configured above as well as individual views filtering by subdomain country language

folder	directory
in your particular use case this is going to be okay but you might find cases when you have to use lib in your client directory as well and as the load order rules stack subdirectories being loaded first it will be loaded before the lib folder residing in your project root

the shorthand method is easily a one line piece of code the problem is that for readability programmers tend to put it in many lines as the original post has it

25612277
nullpointerexception	classcastexception
so far the most effective method i ve seen is the poison pill which would be great if the queues didn t throw nullpointerexception on a null insertion and all the methods i ve tried of introducing a poison generic have failed because of classcastexception trying to cast object to socket trying to instantiate a generic socket etc.

25612278
inherited	properties
since all of auto-created form objects become owned by application object and tapplication inherited from tcomponent you can either iterate thru application.components array properties or use application.findcomponent method

25612713
implements	extends
b must implements where u extends a or is a

this can help us substantially because the context being used in the preferencescreen is actually our preferenceactivity so all we have to do is override the getthemeresid method which is hidden from the public api to provide our custom theme and the sub-preferencescreen now uses whatever custom theme resource we wanted

25613187

if you want to break a long header line you have to use folding white spaces a cr linefeed sp or cr linefeed htab sequence r n or r n t

25613204
libxml2	libxslt
the answers which suggest --use-system-libraries are poor because nokogiri needs to be linked against its bundled libxml2 and libxslt libraries because other versions of those libraries are incompatible with it

25613204
installation	upgrade
upgrade and or repair your xcode installation

25613204
macports	homebrew
if you have opt local lib libiconv.dylib then nokogiri adds that path to the list of directories that it searches for and it will find the macports installation similar to how it picks up the homebrew libiconv and conflicts with the system libraries

25613206

post	get
i m trying to get a category and loop through its sub categories getting one post from each of those sub-categories

25613954
profiling	debugging
it s very likely that the differences in the runtime profiling between your application s debugging and release builds are sufficient to tip the scale towards that outcome with the release builds while the additional overhead in whatever you actually mean by debugging build will slow things down enough so that the child process has the time to spill its standard output before the parent process gets around to closing the pipe

25613954
buffering	sigpipe
keep in mind that once your tarball contains a sufficient amount of files even if tar gets ahead in this race it s output is going to fill up the pipe buffering and block and once the parent process gets around to closing the pipe it will sigpipe the child process and tar will always fail

25614017
post	get
i ll post my answer here when i get it

width	height
the layout that contains thees buttons takes up 70 of the screen height and maximum width there is another layout in the top 30 and the screen is locked in vertical orientation

putting your second push logic in viewdidappear rather than viewdidload solved the problem for me

i have the game creating the file if its not there and reading the contents of the file that i put in manually but i can not get it to write to the file

25614263
post	put
you have to put the concatenated value into the form field so it will be submitted to the server when you post the form

25614340
int	boolean
boolean is most likely being mapped to one of the number types and therefore default f is not valid syntax although i don t think it would be valid in any version of sql that does support boolean as a datatype since they general use int for the underlying storage

25614351
onresume	onpause
onpause and onresume are primarily for when an activity is being backgrounded

unix	bsd
as in traditional bsd unix the backslash character may be used before an illegal character to cause it to be parsed as part of the search string

25614485
allocator	stl
in the proposed change there is still allocator in the priority_queue version but is only one time you are saving a lot of allocator for big vector sizes and allocator is one of the important time consuming operation and maybe the initialization in o n could take advantage of the complete state of the priority_queue don t know if the stl really does this

25614535
submit	submission
using a submit button makes codeigniter actually perform its standard form submission function which causes a reload or a redirect

25614567
division	modulo
here is a simple implementation of floored division and modulo in c89

25614567
division	modulo
if you re using c++11 here is a templated implementation of floored division and modulo

25614567
division	modulo
in c99 and c++11 you can avoid using div since the behavior of division and modulo in c are no longer depend on the implementation

25614637
x86	64bit
i recently decided to start trying android app development so i downloaded the java se development kit 8 x86 for windows i got windows 8 64bit but my guide recommends getting the 32bit one the android sdk and the eclipse ide for java developers x86

25614852
128bit	64bit
however this makes sense there is no built-in 128bit data type and i am certainly not rich enough to afford a 128bit processor so i am only getting back the lower 64bit of the result

25614902
for-loop	loops
if you entered two lines the scanner will add two lines into the arraylist and then the for-loop will loops through the list and print them from backwards

i ve got all of this working except i finally want a bottom margin of 11 between the last label and the cells content view with the cell height adjusted accordingly

width	height
since is an inline element it don t accept any height or width just add the display block

from the example i though that for the new projection the lower left corner is always 0 0 then you just calculate the width and height coordinates upper right

25621713
integer	unsigned
i am getting wrong value while converting float to unsigned integer

25621734
int	double
while the described problem should not happen in case of ieee 754 and round function since round returns double which allows exact representation for int still the first approach does not look very convenient because we have to keep all these assumptions in mind

25621738
centos	linux
first install cronie.i dont knw which linux flavour u are using.i am using centos

25622656
width	height
change the height and width to 100 where is says

25622682
pickle	dill
what probably is getting you confused is that serializing an object through pickle or dill alike does not include neither its source code the actual lines of textual python code used to define the class nor its name

25622734
width	height
change the height and width to 100 where is says

25622741

25622751
miktex	xelatex

25622755

this will always set the height of your custom imagebutton to match its width when rendered on screen

25622963
swift	objective-c
as someone else said it looks like you are mixing objective-c and swift concepts and syntax in the same file

25623314
put	get
this what i get when instead of a date ms or date object i put an integer as the column 1 2 3..

25623326
onclick	onsubmit
since you plan to have different actions per depending on clicked button you can use combination of button onclick and form onsubmit events

25623327

there are some more issues like arc4random doesn t work and we have to use rand and srand functions

25623359
freebsd	procfs

25623375

note that if you want to get the subscribers for super classes as well if specialmessage extends message and you want to get those that subscribed for message as well then you d need to walk up the class hierarchy

25623420

in google-chrome and safari it looks as intended

executing sudo bin bash -c echo foo works without being prompted for a passwd

25623755

any fgets or fgetc will exhibit my problem

25624075
fgets	fgetc
so if they typed abc while processing and then you prompt for something their input is abc plus whatever they typed at the prompt by the time you get to fgets or fgetc

25624075
fgets	fgetc
so if someone keeps hitting enter and you re using fgets or fgetc wiating for a n then you get premature code continuation

the decorator pattern is typically used to add additional responsibilities to an object dynamically by forwarding requests onto its accepted component and|or decouple deep inheritance hierarchies to be compositive in type not to be confused with the composite pattern -- which is compositive in hierarchy -- using a component-leaf structure to allow synonymous requests across a uniform fractal topology treating parent children equally

if thats the case you might want to just skip the queue entirely and just make the serial read writer work by always writing scale s current value at a regular interval 0.02 second delay is probably the smallest you can get but if you re really connecting 9600 baud just modify the write interval to not write more than you can physically put into the serial buffer s uart

int	double
as each row shall have a unique id or code which is later used to create relationships between several tables is it more efficient to use a double int id such as 1456156148489418189 instead of string code such as ds156b1dsb4ds8b4sd6b14s864ea

implements	extends
rather than take a copy of the springbootservletinitializer and errorpagefilter you can continue to extends it but simply add a redundant implements webapplicationinitializer to your class

hash	md5
i am trying to get an md5 hash of two different lists so i can easily tell if the lists are the same or different

25635324
hash	md5
however i keep getting the same md5 hash for both lists even though they have different contents

25635343
cat	tee
you can drop the result.dat and the cat and instead change the done to done | tee result.dat for the same effect

25635345
implements	extends
this is redundant as it extends springbootservletinitializer which itself implements webapplicationinitializer however as pierre points out weblogic requires a class to directly implements it

set tablelayout s width and height to match_parent

25635441

int	double
you can t sum two double and put the result in an int because the int cannot contain the decimal part so you will

25635584
children	parent
you could take that further and not bother to check the children if the parent was a match just by moving that to else

25635584

but this is the basic approach to the only way to are going to get this distinction to be processed on the server and client side post processing would follow much the same pattern

25635798
post	get
if you do not need to handle conflicts with multiple sources updating the same database you may simple send the updates between the server and the client and vice versa on regular intervals using http get post or simple socket server client

25635798
pull	push
usually sometimes disconnected devices use http or another network protocol to pull and push updates

25635798
pull	push
files are rarely used for push pull updates

25635798
post	get
as you used the php tag for this question too using http with a php server with a database in the background you can use php to extract data sent via get post and also provide data back to the device using xml or another format

25636196
for-loop	arrays
it s rare for sequential streams to beat a for-loop over an arrays though it can happen

25636198
width	height
step 1 calculate height and width of your device screen dynamically by using this code

25636198
width	height
step 3 now calculate height and width for your imageview according to height and width of your screen

step 4 finally set height and width of your imageview problematically by this code

25636201
post	get
all the gem does is provide you with a wrapper so that you can perform a get post requests to their servers

25636240
mdpi	hdpi
i think making same image in different sizes and putting them res drawable hdpi mdpi etc according to their sizes will work

25636257
hex	binary
another reason why someone might use hex values is because it s sometimes easier to remember and represent a binary digit as two symbols rather than three

25636275
width	height
the only problem is that the layout does not adapt to the window size 100 height width

25636286
folder	directory
since firstpack is part of the mypack.in package it needs to be in a folder . mypack in beginning from the current directory the directory you execute the compiler from

25636317
button	checkbox
user can only select a radio button only when the corresponding checkbox column is selected

25636317
button	checkbox
this is needed because when user clicks on columns other than one and two the row gets selected and afterselectionchange event is fired but the radio button and checkbox does not toggle

25636343
put	get
however this service is maintained in a dll that is consumed by other applications so i d prefer that this early activation be configured directly in the registration extensions modules used to register the feature to which it related rather than forcing the consumer to do a superfluous resolve operation just to get the feature to work--or put another way allowing them to forget to do it

int	double
int double 33 5.0 will give double so 33 5.0 6.6

25636405
int	double
and the second calculation 33 5.0 the result is actually promoted to double which has greater precision than int and resulted to decimal

is it more efficient to use a double int id such as 1456156148489418189

25636654

please take care of the width and height of the div

25637078
inherited	subclassing
your ide keeps telling you to add the abstract keyword to your arrayintlog class because a class must either implement all abstract methods inherited or defined by implemented interfaces or the class itself must be declared abstract and leave implementing the missing methods for subclassing

25637094
int	boolean
but your implemented contains method has different signature public boolean contains int element

25637121

25646692
post	get
my specific case is i need to send too much data to fit it in the query string but i can t send it all as post because the site i want to submit to is selecting a handler for the posted data based on a variable in the get string

25646692
post	get
i can try and have that changed but ideally i would like to be able to send both get and post data in the same query

25646703
put	get

it should have both landscape and portrait view

25646823
int	boolean
basically grab all the orders and use a handy mysql hack where the above sums take the boolean results of your supplier id comparisons and auto-cast them to int 1 and 0

25646830
put	get
i think the best approach is to get an user from web api update the properties on it and put it to web api

25646902
webkit	blink
you ve run into a bug in blink webkit where the keyboard focus doesn t move when you follow in page links i answered that here uptating keyboard focus when implementing the skip to main content technique through an anchor link

25646914
int	double
this is since the literal 0 is treated as an int by java which can automatically either be boxed to an int or widened to a double but not both to make it a double

25646920
post	get
php itself wouldn t decide to ignore the get parameters if a post is performed

25646922
multiplying	addition
multiplying costs exactly the same as an addition in term of cycles

25646922
division	multiplication
and multiplication it generally faster then division

25646924
background-color	transparency
it s z-index problem because when there is no background-color than it s transparency

25646942
post	get
and your needs to have the method specified as post or else it defaults to get

25646967
inherited	properties
so for example if you have a style attribute on a div the styles will only apply to that div inherited properties and conflicting styles notwithstanding

25646970
maven	pom.xml
once the non-mavenized dependencies are installed to your repo you can add them to your pom.xml like any other maven dependency

25646981
stdout	stderr
to get both the stdout and stderr

25647004
phpstorm	webstorm
all i know now is that phpstorm doesn t support js like webstorm but is able to due to plugins

25647021
width	height
untick both width height

25647021
width	height
within the shape transform table remove guard from the width and height cells

25647031
width	height
for example my json file would have the width height and depth values of a cube i want to make and i want to be able to pull these out of the json file and use them as parameters for my cube geometry

25647048
put	get
then in the put you would get the data-attributes values

25647066
equals	gethashcode
i have already read tons of articles on properly implementing equals and gethashcode

25647108
ant	maven
now to build the war file we are using an ant maven task artifact mvn providing the argument war war

25647112
super	self
sorry this may seems super basic but im struggling with excel at the moment as i am self teaching

25647114
versioning	upgrade
i ve tried brew upgrade opencv and opencv is the latest versioning 2.4.9

25647178
equals	gethashcode
but to be honest once you ve implemented equality it s usually really easy to write gethashcode with code like this perhaps - and if it s not easy then that s often a sign that your equals method will violate its contract anyway

25647233
ant	maven
calling mvn war war via ant does not make sense and shows you should learn how maven works

25647233
maven	pom.xml
change the packaging type in your pom.xml file to war and you can simply call maven via

25647349
width	height
don t forget to add width and height constraint

25647378
pull	push
this is also true for the push and pull classes

25647378
pull	push
so what you need to do is layout the buttons the way you intend for them to be in a small screen and then push pull them in larger screens to where you want them

25647378
pull	push
in other words put the buttons in your html where you want them in small screens and use the push pull medium classes to move them in larger screens

25647378
pull	push
a push class moves an element to the right a number of columns and the pull class moves an element to the left a number of columns

25647378
pull	push
for example if you want to switch two elements the first of size 3 and the second of size 6 you will need to push the first 6 columns and pull the second 3 columns effectively switching their positions

25647386
mouse	keyboard
i can press shift+arrow to resize anything with my keyboard shortcuts but the mouse does not work

25647400
viewdidload	viewdidappear
so i tried this inside the viewdidload and viewdidappear methods

25647482
phpstorm	webstorm
note phpstorm includes all the functionality of webstorm html css editor javascript editor and adds full-fledged support for php and databases sql

25647482
phpstorm	webstorm
basically phpstorm webstorm + php + database support

25647482
phpstorm	webstorm
webstorm comes with certain mainly javascript oriented plugins bundled by default while they need to be installed manually in phpstorm if necessary

25647482
phpstorm	webstorm
since webstorm has different release cycle than phpstorm it can have new js css html oriented features faster than phpstorm it s all about platform builds used

25647482
phpstorm	webstorm
for example latest stable phpstorm is v7.1.4 while webstorm is already on v8.x

25647482
phpstorm	webstorm
but phpstorm v8 will be released in approximately 1 month accordingly to their road map which means that stable version of phpstorm will include some of the features that will only be available in webstorm v9 quite few months from now lets say 2-3-5 -- if using comparing stable versions only

25647482
phpstorm	webstorm
since 2016.1 version phpstorm and webstorm use the same version build numbers

25647482
phpstorm	webstorm
so there is no longer difference between the same versions functionality present in webstorm 2016.3 is the same as in phpstorm 2016.3 if the same plugins are installed of course

25647482
phpstorm	webstorm
is that phpstorm doesn t support js part like webstorm

25647482
phpstorm	webstorm
here is the list of plugins that are bundled with webstorm 2016.3 but require manual installation in phpstorm 2016.3 if you need them of course

25647499
tabcontrol	tabitem
in a similar fashion you could also make a behavior for the tabcontrol which turns the selectionchanged event into a command and pass the tag object of the selected tabitem as command parameter

25647503

i have a very basic grasp of functions such as map and listcomprehensions but don t know how to work with them when the loop required a placeholder value such as place_holder in the below code

25648040
super	self
in the get_queryset self method there is no reference whatsoever to the book class so how come the dahlbookmanager knows that it needs to work with the book instances when doing super dahlbookmanager self no reference to book model and as far as i know self refers to an object of type dahlbookmanager and not book

25648055
aggregate-functions	sum
i have a query that must return the values of a second table only if the aggregate-functions sum

25648078

if the ordering of these post save callbacks is not guaranteed to be in the same order that the mongoose save method is called it would mean that the clients view could potentially get out of sync with the real database representation

25648117
multiton	singleton
actually this is a benefit of this pattern similar to multiton pattern which works like a singleton when only one comm port is used

25648248

25648306
maven	cargo
in general if you run cargo using an eclipse maven launcher in debug mode debug as -- maven build... killing the process on the eclipse console the red button doesn t leave any orphan process.

folder	directory
i can t figure how to migrate the trunk folder alone without its parent directory

25648615
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this works as expected on os x 10.9.4 in both firefox 29.0.1 and google-chrome 37.0.2062.94 but in safari 7.0.6 it is ignoring the name in the download attribute and saving a file called simply unknown

25648615
google-chrome	safari
everything i have seen suggests that safari should honour this attribute and it is presumably not a webkit issue if it works in google-chrome

25648624
getter	setter

uipickerviewdelegate	uipickerviewdatasource
read up on the documentation of the uipickerviewdelegate and uipickerviewdatasource to populate it with your array

25648807
width	height
when using float there s something important you need to understand floated elements are lifted out of the box model and have effectively zero width and height as far as other elements are concerned

25648810
google-chrome	firefox
the best in my opinion is google-chrome s though firefox with firebug is not bad

unixodbc	iodbc
iodbc and unixodbc are both driver managers which are essential parts of the odbc stack that also include an odbc driver

25649187

having one of iodbc or unixodbc would not alleviate the need to have an odbc driver as well

we use a uicollectionview in this example but the same issue would apply to a uitableview approach

25649420
appendto	each
it seems you are trying to do a get on the images in an ajax call through a loop counter and then add these image elements to the element however ajax calls being asynchronous the appendto of image#1 might be called after appendto of image#2 depending on when each of the ajax calls returns which in turn might depend on the size of the image network traffic etc.

ia-32	x86
take for example intel s ia-32 architecture also called x86-32 here x86 indicates the architecture and 32 indicates 32-bit processor

25649935
cpu	processors
simply- its the data handling capability of cpu processors in a single clock cycle

25649935
cpu	processors
since the alu can handle only 8 bit data in a single clock cycle it won t make sense to have data bus width more than that 8 bit processors will have 8 bit wide databus hence databus width can also be an alternate way to find out the bit processing capability of processor.for a processors with n bit databus means that the cpu can transfer n-bits to another device in a single operation

25649935
cpu	processors
using bus width classification the intel 8088 microprocessor is an 8-bit processors since it uses an 8-bit data bus although its cpu registers are in fact 16-bit registers

25649935
cpu	processors
similarly the motorola 68000 is classified as a 16-bit processors even though its cpu registers are 32-bit registers

i haven t done method swizzling in swift or objective-c before so i m not sure of the next step to resolve this issue or even it s possible at all

25651081
swift	objective-c
the other option is adding objective-c but swift doesn t allow you to add it to extensions

25651097
getter	setter
i would recommend you don t add the getter setter pair but just use the property name appcontext directly in your code as there are more than likely places in grails core or plugins that assume quite reasonably in my opinion that a property named applicationcontext is the spring object rather than anything else

the tokeninput also bind the keyup keydown to resize the input field

25654176
versioning	upgrade
instead you need to build specific wix upgrade elements that target the specific versioning range you want to upgrade

25679400
preorder	inorder
i find that if we have preorder and inorder traversal we have a unique tree

25679400
preorder	inorder
for each preorder traversal we have multiple inorder traversal

25679450
min	max
that algorithm works provided that the max value in the normalized array comes before the min value in the normalized array

25679450
min	max
note that in both of those sample arrays the max precedes the min

25679450
min	max
however this algorithm fails if the absolute min in the array appears before the absolute max

25679450
min	max
step 2 scan the normalized array to find the min and max values

25679450
min	max
step 3 subtract the min from the max and divide by 2 rounding up if necessary and there s your answer

25679450
min	max
the idea behind my original answer was that the midpoint between the max and the min provided a target value that every entry in the normalized array could be adjusted to hit

25679450
min	max
the max and min being the farthest from the target required the largest adjustments and hence provided the answer

25679450
min	max
step 5 scan the sectionsarray to find the largest difference between max and min

25679450
min	max
also the midpoint between min and max is the target value for that section of the array target values can be truncated

with your scanf you are inserting a int inside a chars

25681434

fair enough - it was maybe stupid to imagine scala would magically know as it were how far outward to pull the parameter though in this case one could imagine parsing the initial expression into a tree seeing the placeholder and then trying to reformulate its immediate parent as a lambda and on seeing that that doesn t make sense push the reformulation up and up the tree until it does but i guess it might just be too hard to reason about expressions in general if one had this kind of implicit behavior

25685497
textblock	itemscontrol
you have provided an itemtemplate for the first itemscontrol but the inner itemscontrol contains a textblock which is just nested inside the control

textblock	itemscontrol
otherwise the binding scope for the most inner textblock is going to be the same as the inner itemscontrol resulting in the problem you are seeing

25685506
getter	setter
you have to have a lot of useless setter and getter in your code

25685506
getter	setter

it is a bad practice to have setter and getter on interfaces

the submit all button can iterate over the cards again based on a naming conventions for the div s and check for the value of the checkbox if you decide to implement that feature and then submit the cards either to the same action method that receives the single card in that case the single card case would have a list of one card or to another one altogether

sorting	filtering
a great option that provide sorting filtering capabilities are listview controls that allow you to display information in the format that you want based on templates that you create

for-loop	loops
you could loops over letters using a simple for-loop

25688082
pull	push
you could also use the directive controller hierarchy but that means things like are kind of hard-wired in where they appear in templates and if you push down or pull up a child directive in terms of where it appears in the dom hierarchy of the overall repeated object that breaks things whereas directly passing state into each item works okay

25689121
prepare	execute
the caching you are referring when using prepare a and execute for statements that will be issued multiple times with different parameter values optimizes the performance of your application by allowing the driver to negotiate client and or server side caching of the query plan and meta information

25689129
hide	show
i have the following code which show and hide elements according to buttons being clicked

25689135
uicollectionview	uitableview
so i just had to go and find any other uiscrollview or subclasses uitableview uicollectionview and set scrollstotop to be no

25689227
hide	show
in combination with this to traverse the dom and then just toggle them away or keep hide and show if you prefer

25689244
getter	setter
the toolbox is meant to only contains basic plain old java objects with getter and setter

25689287

25689308
ubuntu	debian
i failed in debian sid ubuntu trusty and mac 10.9

25689309
mongodb	bson
probably the biggest advantage of using the mongodb bson date type instead of a string is that you can only use the aggregate date operators with bson date values

25689322
free	strdup
you don t seem to be free ing the duplicated string so the strdup is also a memory leak. alternatively you could use an enumerated value in your semantic type

25689369
width	height
the navbar is centered and nested inside a div of the same height and a width of 100

25689369
google-chrome	firefox
the navbar nests properly as is in ie10 google-chrome firefox but not in jsfiddle

25689416
addition	multiplication
simply take advantage of the way multiplication distributes over addition and add all the ones digits into one accumulator the tens into a separate one hundreds and thousands into their own accumulators

25689418
short	base
what i needed was a base 2 logarithm and in short - this is what happened

25689441
width	height
i want the getimagesize function to display the height and width for that specific image in the height and width image attributes

25689441
folder	directory
i think my biggest problem is i am not sure how to access the small folder inside my public directory

25689447
folder	directory
lists current folder under the fruit repo directory

25689447
folder	directory
history of all files and folder directly under the fruits repository directory

25689470
inherited	properties
if you use implements you won t actually inherited from the base class - so if that base class had other properties and methods that you were hoping to access you would find them all absent from you test1 class

25689470
implements	extends
when using extends you can optionally override methods but do not have to implements all members as you inherit them from the base class

25689499
for-loop	loops
im not sure how this can be accomplished without using a tedious for-loop which loops through all the coordinates and checks whether the coordinate in question is inside the polygon given by the shape file

25689502
post	get
here i want to get the work_id from my tabel workers and post it as the row hvem

25689534
width	height
now you can use width and height

25689557
automake	autotools
i am using the so-called gnu build system that is the autotools including autoconf automake libtool

25689597
int	chars
anyway this solution is based on idea that int value or chars represents its index in unicode table

25689616
post	get
if we had to do this every time we wanted to get a post and its comments it would get very repetitive and very tiresome

25689678
width	height
the svg object is inside a div with both height and width set to 100

25689678
width	height
when i set the width and height in the svg i can get it to the size of the display yet then the coordinates of the paths is wrong and sending a div to that spot is not where it should be

25689708
int	chars
test.cpp in function â int main int chars â

25689721
svg	vml
to address issues for rendering in the browser zingchart offers svg html5 canvas and vml options

25689721
client-side	server-side
this is a server-side image generation library which works from a very similar codebase as zingchartâ s canvas client-side library

25689723
versioning	upgrade
the third is to upgrade or downgrade to a versioning of visual c++ express that includes the redist directory

25689783
folder	directory
utl_file can only access files residing in a folder mapped by a create directory command

25689793

working demo tested on ie firefox google-chrome and opera

25689868
filtering	grouping
this will not filtering records like grouping by having does in your second query and numbers the duplicates

25689868
aggregate-functions	sum
aggregate-functions such as count and sum can also use over with the partition by functioning the same way and order by not being required

25689877
google-chrome	firefox
using android browsers firefox google-chrome ... crash when i use this instruction

25689897

25689928
cucumber	geb
i have created a gradle project which uses cucumber and geb

25689936
temp	tmp
in this case the user had changed their temp folder to d tmp

25689950
apache	nginx
as a sidenote i m sure you will get much better performance if you leave gzipping to whatever web server you are using apache nginx etc.

25690007
int	chars
that s the source of the public void write chars int int of bufferedwriter

25690012
bash	subshell
one of the main reasons to use a subshell is that you can perform operations like i o redirection on a group of commands instead a single command but if your subshell contains only a single command there s not much reason to really fork a new bash process first

25690115
charindex	substr
you can accomplish this with substr and charindex

25690117
swift	objective-c
first of all comparing objective-c to swift compiler is somehow cruel

25690146
google-chrome	firefox
it was acting a bit glitchy in google-chrome before ie or firefox late flash 13 updates but as soon as clients switched to 14 it stopped working completely

25690153
junit	mockito
i have an android project for which i am trying to setup unit tests using junit mockito and robolectric

25690183
inherited	base-class
then you need to create a new base-class and inherited from system.web.ui.page and not allow override in the constructor the false

25690183
inherited	base-class
then on your web-page codebehind you inherited from the base-class instead of system.web.ui.page

25690205
hide	show
what i want to do is hide the https link on mobile and show the fb link which is easy with .js or css

25690240
folder	directory
now it works to the part where the new folder is created in public directory download and also the csv file in the custom directory

25690272
hide	show
and in order to avoid recreating each fragment when itâ s selected i hide show them depending on which one is selected

25690289
swift	objective-c
now i did this in swift so i don t know if it translates exactly to objective-c but this should work

25690297
button	checkbox
you can change checkbox drawable using android button drawable your_check_drawable attribute

25690341
width	height
set the body html height and width to 100

25690349
portrait	landscape
when switching between portrait and landscape orientation one of my views uibutton disappears and i am at a loss as to why or how

25690378
width	height
i want to set certain width and height for div elements

25690392
post	put
according to this question setdooutput is used for put and post requests they contain a request-entity-body

25690397
width	height
display inline elements are rendered inline - meaning they do not respect width and height declarations but just go with the flow

25690402
subclass	abstract-class
the other approach uses an abstract-class to declare a deferred procedure initialize_t1 which will be implemented by each subclass differently

25690405
mouse	keyboard
hi made a hook library that catch global events from the keyboard and mouse

25690435
srp	principles
this approach breaks the single responsibility principles srp unless every combobox.selectedindexchanged event does the same

25690440
listener	eventhandler
just keep in mind that when assigning click handlers for the columns in the row remember to remove the handlers before you assign new ones otherwise you will experience funkyness as opposite of java where you can only set a single listener in c# you have event s and eventhandler s which you can basically set multiple times on an event

25690469
apache	nginx
if you re seeing 404 s for sites that aren t yours in your logs it would seem like somebody has pointed their domain at your servers ip address you could use apache nginx to filter these out before they hit your app but your middleware should catch them though possibly by raising an uncaught 500 error instead of a 404

25690476
portrait	landscape
once i set a background image for portrait orientation it s ok but when it s come to landscape same image is showing

25690499
getter	setter
edit the other classes dont do anything much though just a couple of getter setter and checking for validity of tokens

25690545
width	height
you can t give height and width for inline elements

25690587
typedef	struct
here s my typedef struct - i am not allowed to change this

25690602

exponent	modulo
i gave this answer to another question which has some ruby code that outputs a pem-formatted file given just the modulo and exponent

25690698
put	get
i can t put the 3 commands in an external function cause it wouldn t get the variables.

25690727
folder	directory
i got this to work by creating an assets folder in the public directory and moving the events.js file into it

25690789
post	get
i have a view that i m using for get and post to a database that s not the default db

25690789
post	get
the get works perfectly fine but on the post it constantly fails complaining that the table does not exist

25690799
folder	directory
...manually installing sendgrid and smtpapi and then copying the folder to my gae directory and then moving smtpapi to the sendgrid directory.

25690802
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
are preserved in google-chrome 36 opera 24 and firefox 31 the html attribute rules are applied

25690802
opera	google-chrome
are displayed as linebreaks in google-chrome 36 opera 24 and ie 11

25690802
opera	google-chrome
are displayed as plain text angle brackets printed out in google-chrome and opera

25690802
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	opera	safari
works in current versions of google-chrome opera firefox and ie haven t tested in safari or mobile although the webkit-based browsers will create an extra blank line

25690834
put	get
i can t put the 3 commands in an external function cause it wouldn t get the variables

25690835
width	height
for what ever reason android isn t turning the width and height attributes with the rotation so it is only turning the view

25690835
width	height
usually you don t use x for width and height

25690857
int	chars
c knows enough to create the simple things in structures like basic int and chars along with int arrays which have a predefined length like

25690861
mouseleave	mouseenter
use the mouseenter and mouseleave events in jquery

25690923
post	get
i saw the post redirect get pattern so i tried it and it effectively refresh the page like it should

25690973
multiplying	add
i have created a table with some columns like orderid custid unitprice quantity.now i want to add the other column as totalprice by multiplying quantity unitprice

25690988
children	parent
what you can do with emit though is emit it up to the parent stop the propagation and then broadcast which all the siblings will pick up as well as their children

25691082
width	height
a horizontal line a short-but-wide rectangle gets its length doubled and it s height the width of the line stays the same

25691084
for-loop	arrays
my for-loop is pretty simple i have an arrays of objects and i have to perform some evaluation to each object in the arrays

25691103
carrierwave	paperclip
you also want to make sure your bucket name is listed in your production.rb along with your keys or in a paperclip or carrierwave file if you are going that route

25691107
mouseleave	mouseenter
first you use the .hover function wrongly it should only accept 2 arguments which is for mouseenter and mouseleave

25691108
hide	show
as far as i understand you don t need classes to show and hide the text use .show and hide to take care of it in the original js you re passing 4 functions to the hover event whereas only 2 are needed one executes when the element is hovered and the second one when mouse exits the element causing hover event to stop

25691118
width	height
the main content view is set to match the parent view s width and height because it represents the entire ui when the navigation drawer is hidden

25691118
width	height
the drawer view specifies its width in dp units and the height matches the parent view

25691122
voip	sip
if you are interested in a protocol with a syntax close to http but with support of udp then have a look at sip which is used for voip

25691126
put	get
the form has been submitted and i did a request.post to get the values now i want to put them into a table and add them up

25691132
equals	gethashcode
you can also override equals and gethashcode for your class employee base on property code and then you can use except like

25691132
equals	gethashcode
remember the above implementation of equals and gethashcode only considers code property

25691194
post	get
i ll post updates here as i get them

25691203
post	get
include all of the same fields in the post that a browser would...watch out for hidden fields that a browser post and any request-specific fields which would require you to make an intial http get request to have the server give you some valid ones then a post-request to send the payload

25691279
keydown	keyup
in most browsers an autorepeat is sensibly treated as a character event but not a key event so it triggers a keypress but not a keydown or keyup

25691295
public	protected
and in you tests you will be able to call protected methods through the public ones in a test-specific subclass

25691311
mvp	presenter
the host my-element is in control hence controller or maybe more precisely presenter in an mvp pattern and the children don t interact with each other directly

25691320
dlsym	dlopen
i was attempting to dlopen an application s executable and then dlsym on it s main

25691346
short	base
in short if you have poco classes and you are 100 sure you are never going to code against a framework that doesn t allow you to use pocos instead it insists on classes inheriting from a framework-specific base class you could go with the first option classes

25691351
pop-up	dialog
third in the properties of the second taskflow-call-activity under behavior section you can configure set the run as dialog property to true then configure the property display type to inline-popup to use an adf pop-up or external-window to use a new browser window

25691372
lodash	underscore.js
i d recommend you use underscore.js or lodash instead

25691374
int	double
after the string name of the category in question is input using scanner of course the user is then able to put in the quantity of that category an int followed by the unit cost of that category a double

25691374
int	double
and then the user puts in a duplicate of the first entry which is cars followed by an int 5 followed by the double 37000.00

if there is any simple function associated with qtgui.qgridlayout to show and hide

25691502

llvm	clang++
i have compiled a c++11 program test.cpp into an llvm ir file test.ll using clang++ 3.4

25691863
consistency	acid
consistency in the sense it is used in acid means that all constraints are satisfied before and after any change

25691923
ready	each
despite my research i cannot find the answer to the process above everything seems to involve deploying the database changes this will include custom scripts for data migration changes and then publishing the site to azure from visual studio but as we want to deploy this multiple times it would be ideal to build a package that we run against each customer site database when we they are ready to migrate to the next version as this may not always happen at the same time

25691932
width	height
i thought just removing the code flipping height and width above would be sufficient to migrate

25691935
put	get
of course when you get to run the first time you can check the available storage and put up a dialog suggesting that the user clear out some storage to bet a better experience with your app

25691959
inherited	properties
the only exception to the getting and setting behavior rules is when there is an inherited properties with a getter or a setter.

for-loop	arrays
the reason for wanting to accomplish this is to avoid tying up the main thread in case there s a huge amount of data which needs to be assigned to the self.googleresults arrays or rather in a for-loop using a custom class containing properties for specific key data which would eventually be added as elements to an arrays

25703396
width	height
to this we re removing the width and height from markup which anyways you shouldn t use

25703396
width	height
max-height 875px and also restrict the min height or width like this

25703396
min	max
all this being said which is basic theory see you ll probably prefer in most cases to apply max and min width to the containing element so your css will slightly change and everything will be even easier

25703403
int	double
if you expect an int as the result of a particular mathematic operation and you get something very close to it you can use the math.round double midpointrounding method to perform the correct rounding and compensate for small errors and make sure you pick the midpointrounding strategy you expect

25703453
int	chars
then convert your byte values to an int in the range 0-255 and use the chars at that index in the conversion table

multiplying	subtract
roughly speaking adding or subtract a constant to the rgb value of all your pixels changes the image brightness multiplying your pixels by a constant changes the image contrast and raising your pixels to a constant positive power changes the image gamma

25703977
addition	multiplication
more subtle brightness contrast modification can be achieved by suitable combinations of addition and multiplication

25704084
width	height
bind the width and height properties of canvas to the width and height properties of the parent pane

25704085
128bit	64bit
the second one is that first according to c language rules both operands are converted to common type which is int64_t and then division for this type is expanded into cpu instruction which divides 128bit dividend by 64bit divisor

25704085
division	multiplication
yep this division requires about 70 cycles and can t be optimized well really it can but reverse divisor approach requires multiplication with 192-bit product

25704111
apache	nginx
i m moving my server from apache to nginx

25704112
width	height	width	text-align	text-align	height
i would suggest removing the float attributes from both then just setting both items display as inline-block you will need to specify width and height on both cases then apply text-align center to the parent that will allow the child to be centered to the parents available area

25704157
floating-point	integer
while 64 0.8 computed to higher precision is slightly lower than 80 because 0.8cannot be represented exactly in binary floating-point and converts to 79 when truncated to an integer type if the result of the division is converted to float it is rounded to 80.0f

25704157
floating-point	integer
conversions from floating-point to integer types truncate.

you will see this issue popping up in the network panel of google-chrome developer tools or firebug extension when working with firefox

25704613
width	height
in this example my container is 310px in the height and the width equals the width of the visitors computer screen

25704664
children	parent
since you are using white-space nowrap on the parent element you need to use white-space normal on the children elements rather than word-wrap normal

25704682
integer	unsigned
if a big-endian 4-byte unsigned integer looks like 0xaabbccdd which is equal to 2864434397 then that same 4-byte unsigned integer looks like 0xddccbbaa on a little-endian processor which is also equal to 2864434397

25704682
unsigned	short
if a big-endian 2-byte unsigned short looks like 0xaabb which is equal to 43707 then that same 2-byte unsigned short looks like 0xbbaa on a little-endian processor which is also equal to 43707

25704732
width	height
i want my images to take whole width but half the height of total screen

25704732

width	height
i gave a width width of 1280 and height of 200 for inner and outer slier containers

25704732
width	height
is there any way i could use percentage or any other solution for width and height in jssor to avoid stretching

25704741
integer	unsigned
if a big-endian 32-bit unsigned integer looks like 0xaabbccdd which is equal to 2864434397 then that same 32-bit unsigned integer looks like 0xddccbbaa on a little-endian processor which is also equal to 2864434397

25704741
unsigned	short
if a big-endian 16-bit unsigned short looks like 0xaabb which is equal to 43707 then that same 16-bit unsigned short looks like 0xbbaa on a little-endian processor which is also equal to 43707

25704752
margin	height
but when you omit the tag and fills in just the text then it has no prescribed padding margin and or height

25704752
put	get
so in order to get it aligned you need to put an extra div inside class and give it padding-top

25704757
hash	salt
i am trying to use salt to hash my password

25704766

25704845
rcurl	libcurl
would be much nicer to invoke this pipe directly via rcurl libcurl

25704870
jsonb	hstore
there would have to be hundreds of different sparsely populated columns before such an unwieldy eav design could pay - and hstore or jsonb in postgres 9.4 would be superior solutions for that

25704883
devise	cancancan
i am using devise cancancan for authentication authorisation

25704885
cout	cin
you are mixing c++ streams cin cout with c-style strcmp

25704901
haskell	ocaml
these suggestions rely on the ability found in lisp to overwrite the symbol definition of a function or on the â œcall-by-needâ strategy used by haskell and are therefore useless in ocaml

25704903
button	checkbox	checkbox	dropdownlistfor
you could do this in several ways - for example a form is complete checkbox a form status field with a dropdownlistfor having two possible values - work in progress or complete or a couple of radio button

25704911
codeigniter	pyrocms
thought it was a pyrocms problem but codeigniter alone has the same behaviour

25704941
superclass	subclassing
gives a compiler error since activationexception is a checked exception and its superclass implementation isn t throwing it or a subclassing of it

25704957
width	height
in case this won t work because possibly the lightbox.css which is missing in the fiddle overwrites these values you could try to set height and width 100

25704957
width	height
as you probably already know but should be added as short explanation if the img is assigned 100 width and height but is located in a container element with responsive size the img will just get as big as the container

25704957
width	height
update as already tested setting the image height and width to 100 is not enough as the thumbnail image is displayed too big

25704966
centos	linux
i have a linux centos server on which i run a game server on which recently started leaking memory after an update

25705097
for-loop	arrays
1- the jvm can remove arrays boundary checks if it s safe in a for-loop for example where the counter has to be less to the length of the arrays

25705097
for-loop	arrays
it also seems that a for-loop with unsafe read and write case 4 to copy an arrays to another copying 8 bytes at time is faster than system.arraycopy

25705110
monkeyrunner	androidviewclient
i tried using monkeyrunner but androidviewclient doesnt support it anymore and shows an import error

25705189
getter	setter
your getter and setter should be static since it is a static field

25705189
getter	setter
however since it is a primitive type and that your getter and setter do not process anything particular i would recommend you to make your counter public so you can access it very easily

25705211
getter	setter
you probably want to make the getter and setter for the counter static as well

25705274
children	parent
the children class is the reply comments i want when any people replay a comment directly show the replies within the parent comment

25705288
configure	libtool
the configure script is generally generated with the . buildconf script in the curl source code root directory and it requires autoconf automake and libtool to be installed

25705289
exif	xmp
you could use exiv2 a command line tool to extract exif as well as iptc and xmp metadata

25705335
ready	each
the callbacks for each individual operation i call this cbasync in my examples should be invoked when you re ready to move on the first parameter will be an error if any and the second third fourth.

25705694
submit	submission
the user submit a form value to another table called info in database which is submission successfully

25705778
opera	google-chrome
of course because all other browsers are uiwebview browsers you can approximate this quite well by using google-chrome or any of the other ios browser alternatives except opera mini but you won t have debugging options

25705809
pop-up	dialog
when i try to add my domain name to the server in system properties i get an error message instead of the windows security pop-up dialog

25705859
for-loop	loops
i imagine there would be some for-loop that deletes each character one by one so at the end of loops you can do something like

25705871
dlsym	dlopen
still if i access the shared file via dlopen and dlsym any calls from within library.so to the method do actually refer to the method which was only implemented in the main program

25705927
range	minimum	floating-point	integer
flt_min_10_exp is the minimum negative integer such that 10 raised to that power is in the range of normalized floating-point numbers

25705935
min	max
in this case the solution requires finding the largest difference between the max and the min of the queue

25705935
min	max
if we want an o 1 solution we need a queue for which the operations push_back pop_front min and max are all o 1

25705935
min	max
the first thing to note is that if we were looking for a stack with that property where pop_front is replaced with pop_back the solution is trivial whenever we push a new value we compute the new min and max and push them along with the new value

25705935
min	max
when we pop a value we also pop the associated min and max and the min and max remaining on the top of the stack are again correct

25705935
min	max
and in the case that the input is a vector we don t need to actually push elements onto the front stack since the elements are at a known place in the input and we don t need the stack min max values in the front stack

25705973
hide	show
you can use markers get location and display it in a scene2d label also you can show or hide the map

25705997
mpfr	mpc
gmpy2 requires relatively recent versions of mpfr and mpc

25705997
mpfr	mpc
if you can t install the most recent versions of gmp mpfr and mpc then you will need to compile your own versions of gmp mpfr and mpc and then instruct setup.py to use your versions

25706014
for-loop	arrays
as such i would recommend you make a cell arrays that stores the individual circles for each bounding box then run a for-loop through all of your bounding boxes

25706014
min	max
the reason why is because when you do this you ll be able to extract all of the areas as a single array instead of a matrix with singleton dimensions and min max can t work on something like that

25706052
dataoutputstream	bytearrayoutputstream
case 5 dataoutputstream writing to a bytearrayoutputstream

25706063
int	chars
there were a few problems main one was that when the user enters the number of legs he presses enter which adds a newline chars right after the int but since only the int is being read the newline is being buffered and used on the next read which messes up everything

25706826
client-side	server-side
you are calling first because email should be unique and you want to optimize the query on server-side and handle a singe object instead of a list on client-side

25706858
getter	setter
as properties instead of ivars so they ll be synthesized automatically -- you don t have to write all the getter and setter

this is more secure because if the attacker has a hash dictionary has worked out the hash of millions of likely passwords then he still can t break the hash his dictionary won t have factored every possible salt value into it

25713443
hash	salt
when the user logs on hash the salt and secret repeatedly and then compare the final result with the stored value

25713534

25713909
for-loop	loops
first when you need to execute loops strictly n times for-loop can be replaced with while n-- one

therefore i am trying to have as much of the srp and open close principles in place for ease of extension and domain based management

25715252
srp	principles
now a product has many different attributes and relationships with other domains and because the other domains or entities need to be fully detached and again abiding with the above principles srp etc.. i decided to also have the same structure for them as i do for the product...i know some might think that this is too much but we need to have the system very extendable and to be honest i like to be organised and have a uniform pattern it doesn t take that much more time and saves me a lot later

25715260

25715301
implements	extends
if bird implements the method and sparrow extends bird then sparrow has an implementation

25715307

instead you want to return if firstname exists so you should instead do this in both your objective-c and swift code

25715855
min	max
i m trying to write an extension for the swift int type to save nested min max functions

25715862

the idea is that you create a new 2d arrays and then the outside for-loop controls which row you are putting the numbers in and the inside for-loop controls which column

25715956
awt	swing
take a look at painting in awt and swing and performing custom painting for more details

25715956

decimal	ieee
the decimal value is converted to the floating point representation used which on most platforms is ieee single precision a binary floating point type

25715985
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome firefox and edge 13+ will use the specified filename

25715989
int	chars
assigning this to a chars type chars b provokes a type cast to something like an unsigned int namely the chars - thus the hint of possible loss of precision

25716011
min	max
it looks like it is trying to find a method in int for min and max since you are extending int

25716011
min	max
you can get around this and use the default min and max functions by specifying the swift namespace

25716026
clang	llvm
you can get clang to output into llvm bytecode by using the -emit-llvm command-line flag along with the -c flag

25716026
clang	llvm
if you use the -s flag instead of -c you get a textual representation of the llvm bytecode. you don t need to compile clang into llvm bytecode for that to work

25716026
clang	llvm
if you want to try to run clang itself inside a browser then you will need to compile all of clang into llvm bytecode and then link the object files together using llvm-link

25716070
post	get
the answer for me to get a response was to set post as the http method for example

25716080
for-loop	loops
for something like this where you don t know how many times you d need to communicate in advance then you would need to use a while loops not a for-loop

25716129
width	height
for example in ios 8 an asset catalog can distinguish between versions of an image intended for different size class situations using the width and height pop-up menus to specify different size class possibilities

25716129
portrait	landscape
if the app rotates from landscape to portrait and there s both an any height and a compact height alternative in the image set the compact height version is replaced with the any height version in your interface automatically

25716129
portrait	landscape
in this example i ll fetch two images out of the app bundle and configure them so that one is used when the app is in portrait orientation and the other is used when the app is landscape orientation automatically

25716190
post	get
or get a list of most popular post

25716203

if you want the ui to appear dynamic but you are just fetching a static file i would use the .toggle technique or look into other jqueryui features to show hide content

25716284
min	max
scaling is achieved by setting the scale to a normalized value obtained through a gamepad trigger between 1f and 2f so i don t know what actual scale was applied when the shot was taken with the exception of the max min

25716284
width	height
when a scale is applied it is a constant multiple across all width height values and mathematically shouldn t make anything change

25716296
post	get
however when i retrieve fetch the data as described in the linked post above i do not get the original 0 0 0 1 but random integers instead

25716319

25716588
portrait	landscape
my app is configured to be portrait only but i want the video to be displayed in landscape

25716588
hide	show
again the facebook app does hide the statusbar before the video is show in the screen

25716611
rss	feed
the cron job looks at an rss feed and identifies items published within the last hour

25716611
jobs	cron
for my application this can be problematic because when the cron job is triggered it only looks for rss items that were published one hour ago or sooner and if the application is taken down obviously the cron jobs won t be run

25716683
width	height
you can do by changing the horizontal values to vertical change all width related calculations to height

25716691

25716715
range	min
the problem is that the range accuracy in time is 60 min

25716734
printf	strlen
that means it may not have a zero byte somewhere in there to terminate the string so calling printf or strlen on it is not a good idea as it may run off the end of the buffer and cause problems

25716829
ffmpeg	libav
however i found it difficult to find proper documentation for the libav libraries in ffmpeg package

25716836

25716875
margin	height
but can be tuned to have some basic styling changes like change of margin size general line height etc

25716878
width	margin
the work-around is to calculate the pixel-length of 1 margin yourself remembering that values for top and bottom margins are calculated relative to the parent container s width and use that as your final value for the transition

25716907
heroku	openshift
you can use a paas like heroku or openshift to host your web application

25716918
screens	tablet
that is you need to support your web site for small screens like mobile phones or tablet

25716937
width	height
calling it will simply return the sum of the width and the height of your rectangle which doesn t really mean anything

25716971
width	height
this will do what you want without changing your rectangle s width and height in the process

25716971
width	height
your original code would have changed the width and height every time you called get_bottom_right

25717011
for-loop	loops
by loops in c++ that means for-loop while loops and do.

25717011
for-loop	loops
if you want your program to work without restarting put your testing if statements into a loops for example a for-loop

25717055
int	double
you should use float double instead of int for variable result

25717069
int	double
you can use floor division using a double instead of a single when dividing which rounds down to the nearest int

25717071
int	double
declare result as float too or double for int

25717088
inherited	properties
what needs to be mentioned here is that a static helper class with a bunch of attached properties or a new control that inherited from textblock can do exactly the same thing

25717116
client-side	server-side
if it needs to be accessible both client-side and server-side and you don t have a better way of doing it use but be wary of size constraints with cookies

primes	palindrome
there are a couple other questions like this but i need to do it without creating an array or just typing in all of the palindrome primes

25717138
primes	palindrome
my program works and displays all primes but the problem is that it displays all primes not just the palindrome ones

25717166
printf	strtod
the c convention which still works in c++ uses either strtod or sscanf to convert the string to double and printf to convert the double to a string

25717283
int	chars
i m running into a ridiculous usage of memory because i have to convert each byte read into a chars array convert those chars into int and then perform my bitwise operators which involve rotation in that format

25717319
multiplying	add
which says - give me an array of the weekdays of the dates compare them to 3 giving an array of true and false multiplying this by the sign of the quantities 1 if 0 0 if 0 -1 if 0 giving an array of 0 s and 1 s and add them up

25717319
multiplying	add
which says - give me an array of the weekdays of the dates compare them to 3 giving an array of true and false multiplying this by 1 giving an array of 0 s and 1 s because you can t add up true and false and add them up - this is all the tuesdays

it also uses that control s existing text for context. from the point of view of the app using an nstextview if you just create a standard edit menu the start dictation item gets added to the end with fnfn as a shortcut and anything that gets dictated appears as input just like input typed on a keyboard or pasted or dragged with the mouse or via any other input method

25718234
pop-up	dialog
fortunately if you re not on the list the first time you try to use accessibility features it ll pop-up a dialog and if the user clicks on it it ll launch system preferences reveal that anchor add your app to the list with the checkbox disabled and scroll it into view so all the user has to do is click the checkbox

getter	setter
the compiler converts the field to a private field and generates a public getter and a setter for it although it won t overwrite a getter or setter that you wrote

25736689
getter	setter
this is convenient because you can later write getter and or setter to implement business logic and not affect the callers

25736689
getter	setter
there s no generated getter or setter

25736689
persistent	transient
gorm automatically assumes that typed properties are persistent unless you exclude some with the transient list

25736689
getter	setter
properties in this sense are similar to javabean properties - a matched getter setter pair

25736689
getter	setter
hibernate has no support for groovy and doesn t know what s going on under the hood - it just calls your getter and setter to set and access field data during persistence

25736689
getter	setter
and you could do this yourself - add in a getter and setter with correct names and data type string getname and void setname string name and it will be treated as a persistent property even if you do nothing with the values

25736730

on unix systems the process creation fork and fork exec idiom requires iterating over all potential process file descriptors attempting to close each one typically leaving leaving only a few file descriptors such as stdin stdout stderr untouched or redirected to somewhere else

25737274
unix	bsd
newer non standard apis have appeared on the major unix variants including kqueue on bsd and epoll on linux to address performance shortcomings when dealing with a large number of descriptors

25737274
pthreads	epoll
the modern pthreads asynchronous io approach is now api but it is likely not competitve with kqueue or epoll api s

webmock	curb
to hook into curb requests you ll need to use hook_into webmock instead

at the very least there s a good chance a user would get into trouble with the 1 mb limit and it is clearly not intended for anything as complex as i m dealing with. core data can integrate with icloud through uimanageddocument or nspersistentstore but again that means less in the way of reusable code

25737985

25741620
folder	directory
if you run runapp in a separate r file where you include the directory that would fix your problem as you just have to specify the name of the folder containing ui.r and server.r

25741813
swift	objective-c
to import a set of objective-c files in the same app target as your swift code you rely on an objective-c bridging header to expose those files to swift

25741813
swift	objective-c
xcode offers to create this header file when you add a swift file to an existing objective-c app or an objective-c file to an existing swift app

25742272
treemap	linkedhashmap
you can use a treemap if you want a map sorted by the natural order of its keys or a custom comparator or you can have a linkedhashmap if you want the elements to be arranged in the order of insertion

25742272
treemap	linkedhashmap
treemap has firstentry and lastentry methods and even with linkedhashmap it s a lot cheaper to just manually iterate across the elements and keep the first and last one instead of allocating a potentially huge array

25742282
multiplying	subtract
note given how slow is you could replace it by a multiplying and subtract -- though your compiler may do that for you

it contains an eclipse android library project that provides a java api for accessing natively-compiled tesseract and leptonica apis

25743227
getter	setter
the most important reason for me to always use getter and setter instead of directly asccessing properties ist that you can always change the way they behave at a later point in time

25743275
free	alloca
allocating on the stack is just subtracting the required size from the stack pointer which is normally done for all local variables once upon function entry anyway so it is essentially free unless alloca is used

using setter and getter ist broaldy common in other languages

25743579
getter	setter
in java we have a convention the java bean convention that describes the usages of setter and getter

25743579
getter	setter
there are two design- principles that lead to using setter and getter its seperation of concern and information hiding

25743579

25743985
mouse	keyboard
one solution might be to pass tunnel keyboard and or mouse events from win forms to wpf host

25744002

25744148
button	checkbox
to use the validate-one-required validator you must first add the class name to only one checkbox radio button in the group last one is probably best and then place all the input elements within a parent element for example a div element

25744148
button	checkbox
that way the library can find all the checkbox radio button to check and place the validation advice element at the bottom of the parent element to make it appear after the group of checkbox radio button

i tried fadein and fadeout

we are only seeing this behavior after we moved to amazon-web-services elastic beanstalk

25744224

sudo	passwd
solution 2 use osascript to prompt for a passwd and use that with sudo

25746493
pjsip	mjsip
after messing around with pjsip mjsip and jain-sip i desparately made one last attempt to rewrite this using the sdks sip stack in a more structured manner separating the methods into classes that handle talking to the registrar handling a call etc. you know- standard mvc layout

25746493
pjsip	mjsip	voip	sip
bug also occurs when another voip sip application with the pjsip or mjsip stack is present and connected to the server with the same account credentials

25746494
post	get
if request is post i am not able to get post parameters data

25746528
vbscript	vba
thats perfectly valid vba however you will get those exact errors in vbscript which is what i presume your using

25746568
put	get
when i try to build i get a permission error because make is trying to put the object file in the build directory which i have no write permissions for

25746637
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	opera	safari
it works fine in google-chrome firefox safari and opera

25746648
sudo	passwd
you need to complete this ssh connection and a sudo command without any passwd prompts from the jenkins host as the user you run jenkins with first to confirm the jenkins web interface will be able to do it

25746648
sudo	passwd
on jenkinshost confirm ssh chefuser clienthost sudo chef-client -v runs without passwd prompts

25746654
strncmp	strncpy
the n variants of str functions like strncmp strncpy etc are the safe choice because they all are limiting the size of string buffer used

25746657
dtls	sdp
the sdp file data is not available and dtls may be used

25746673
hide	show
i would give all of the divs you want to show hide a common selector such as

25746717
for-loop	loops
in your for-loop you store name quant and rate in a variable that will be overwritten each time you go through loops

25746724
getdate	dateadd
select dateadd day datediff day 0 getdate 0

25746743
hide	show

25746758
portrait	landscape
i am using below code and it s working perfectly but when coming back to pervious view controller it s not rotating in portrait mode when i am coming from landscape mode

25746767
width	height
i use a imageview with scaletype centercrop to fill all layout width and height whitout streching the image

25746777
hide	show
when you change the menu just hide them all and only show the one you want

25746940
filtering	grouping
we end up with a set of key grouping pairs so some additional filtering gets us only the grouping

25746940
put	get
edit the question logic demands that values above the threshold get put in their own groups not sharing with collected smaller values

25746941
int	double
oracle s javadoc for math.pow says if both arguments are int then the result is exactly equal to the mathematical result of raising the first argument to the power of the second argument if that result can in fact be represented exactly as a double value.

25746941
int	double
a double x is an int if

25746941
int	double
10.0 is an int by that definition and so is 6.0 and every int less than 2 52 can be represented exactly as a double value so math.pow 10.0 6.0 should be exactly equal to 1000000.0

25746945
express	node.js
inspired by jssloyer s blog post on the topic which he summarized in his answer above i wrote my own post called redirecting http to https with node.js express on ibm bluemix where i provide a slightly different approach

25746959
width	height
by applying this filter we add 10 extra pixels in each direction of the image we are going to blur making the image 20 pixels bigger in height and width

25746960
apache	nginx
you can use some static file servers like nginx apache boa or even mongoose for it

25747038
lan	localhost
try if ok then cassandra reachable from lan if ok then cassandra is not reachable from lan but only localhost 127.0.0.1

25747114

so i want to loops through the arrays and assign the values of each pom table to pom so that i can then run a for-loop on each subsection of pom

25747121
button	checkbox
if there is a button a radio a checkbox .etc

25747156
filtering	grouping
either filtering at dataset with a where clause or below is using grouping filtering

25747175
x509	openpgp
use either pkcs#7 cms or openpgp depending on whether you prefer to deal with x509 they can be self-signed or pgp keys

25747204
int	double
format of int value will be different than double value format floating point in binary

25747265
width	height
paste a path to an image in the front image box and try using the controls on the right set 100x100 height and width

25747295
mouse	keyboard
this works great as the user is typing but if they correct spelling through spell check using mouse clicks and no keyboard at all the binding will not update

25747326
sequence	permutation
for example i 5 4 is nothing but the number of permutation of the sequence 1 2 3 4 5

25747328
children	parent
that lets you modify the base textual content of the parent tag without worrying about anything else to do with the children

25747330
gridview	sqldatasource
however it should also work to use the sqldatasource as datasource for the gridview directly

25747342
post	get
but now i need to sign a post request with oauth and seems signpost can t do that as the default http method to get the signature is get

25747377
swift	objective-c
how can i annotate wrap my existing objective-c code especially libraries to make it cleaner to use from swift

25747403
inherited	properties
i m trying to create a form type with a inherited properties i have one entity candidate that have two attributes string dni and user user

25747478
int	chars
this isn t surprising since i know chars are at least in c technically int

25747484
maven	pom.xml
and my maven pom.xml includes the following in the build-section

25747524
int	double
the simplest would be to store a union of a 64-bit int and a double and some flag indicating which one you have and then a method to convert to any numeric type asdouble aslong etc

25747533
put	get
i want that admins can update rights for users because admins can also add more rights i need to get the row from a _get and put it in the query

25747541
division	modulo
the user-selected rule by which the division of data is accomplished is known as a partitioning function which in mysql can be the modulo simple matching against a set of ranges or value lists an internal hashing function or a linear hashing function

25747555
udp	tcp
registered stream socket transports tcp udp unix udg ssl sslv3 sslv2 tls

25747600
addclass	removeclass
you can use jquery addclass removeclass and toggleclass if you want

25747646
put	get
to get the filename you re passing in the code fore print_file put

25747681
textview	imageview
if the linearlayout that you posted only contains the imageview and the textview then you can simple change the height to match_parent and it should work fine

25747739
int	chars
actually it works with a pretty small number of types int chars string bool not sure on this one and maybe a couple of more primitive types

25747774
getter	setter
recently i did some performance tests using getter and setter methods

25747774
getter	setter
beside using references pointers it might also improve the performance a little bit by inlining frequently called getter setter since they are small functions

25747792
maven	m2e
in my case the project was a maven i had jdk 1.8.0 eclipse kepler and i installed the m2e plugin from eclipse marketplace

25747818
matplotlib	scipy
we re using an internally hosted pypi server devpi-server so that we can host binary wheels of huge packages that take a long time to install from source like scipy matplotlib etc

25747847
pop-up	dialog
if you do not want to use the built in confirmations then you will either need to design your own pop-up or use something like a jquery ui dialog box

25747889
inherited	properties
each properties may also have a cascaded value of inherited which means

25747889
inherited	properties
properties that are not normally inherited

25747894
post	get
in this case you should embed the whole proxy in your methods processing get and post requests

25747903
put	get
i tried all ways to get this gridview part in the layout scroll-able horizontally i also put but still scrolls vertical

25747909
google-chrome	firefox
the validator works just fine on google-chrome and firefox but when i run it in ie i get the following error message 0x800a138f - javascript runtime error unable to get property split of undefined or null reference

25747921
getter	setter
if you store pointers to data in your getter and setter you are going to have major issues with ownership and object lifetimes

25747929
rubygems	bundler
c railsinstaller ruby1.9.3 lib rubygems 1.9.1 bundler gems active_admin-b41450a52c09 lib active_admin form_builder.rb 119

25747936
inline	inlining
the only exception is if they are built into a shared library which is tricky to inline into a caller s code but even then you can compile with link-time inlining in modern compilers and then will be inline there too

25748044
children	parent
a search-in-depth would be a little more complicated involving each parent item to look for the name on its children

25748146
mutators	getter	mutators	setter	getter	setter
i copied this first paragraph exactly from my previous answer at simple c++ getter setter generally using accessors mutators at all is a design smell that your class public interface is incomplete

25748146
getter	setter
now if you really want to have getter setter for specific attributes either of the first two versions are correct although the second might perform better in some circumstances

25748147
min	max
and i need to get the max price and min price values too

25748168
ms-mpi	intel-mpi
you can find several for windows including intel-mpi and ms-mpi

25748183
matplotlib	colormap
i ve read the documentation for matplotlib.pyplot.colorbar but wasn t able to figure out how to do what i wanted to do without using one of matplotlib s previously defined colormap

25748186
armadillo	lapack
to use armadillo it suffices to provide the header files you do not need to link against an armadillo library itself just make sure to link against blas and lapack

25748203
stdout	stderr
where script1.py outputs the environment variable to stdout and writes the stuff to be fed to script2.py to stderr

25748212
min	max
for finding the max and min maintain two variable int min and int max initialise with say value 0 and value 1 start iterating from i 2 to the value.length

25748262
width	height
after that set the width and height of the imageview to be relative to its superview

25748268
getter	setter
of course most of the time the correct solution will be to have no getter setter at all

25748275
post	get
one good tool to use in web development especially with get and post requests is googles postman app

25748313
swift	objective-c
values cannot be passed by reference in swift except for inout parameters this is one of the things that makes it objective-c without the c

25748343
post	get
it would be pointless if you could just link to the real profile of the user as you would be able to get his real id quite easy with the profile link by just replacing www with graph - and you could see his public post too

25748384
int	chars
short ushort int uint long ulong bool chars string or an

25748384
inherited	properties
in this case the switch statement uses the enum value which inherited from int and satisfies the specification requirement to determine which properties to fill and what values to set

25748398
chown	sudo
you ll want to sudo chown them back to the right user

25748407
google-chrome	firefox
the below code is working in ie and firefox but not in google-chrome

25748448
getter	setter
the right way to do string getter and setter in c++ is this

25748448
getter	setter
despite what some other contributors say getter and setter are not necessarily bad class design

25748448
getter	setter
however excessive use of getter setter or direct access to member variables is a code smell

25748449
stdout	stderr
this issue is only evident in powershell ise not the standard powershell console unless you redirect stderr to stdout with or something similar

25748515
google-chrome	firefox
so the not only-of-type excludes the google-chrome version s core-item inside the shadow dom while the #submenu core-item finds all even single item submenus the submenu core-items in firefox

25748556
post	get
i tried to substitute any with get or post because i already had an app where i did an redirect blog 42

25748588
min	max
max value is at last index and min value is at index position 0 you must figure how to get it out or you learn nothing

25748621
filesystems	hfs
since your hfs filesystems is not case sensitive lookups for filename will match filename at os lib level and therefore node.js will behave the same

25748644
post	get
i have a simple restful wcf service to which i can post without issue but which returns a 405 error when i try to do get requests

25748681
hide	show
and as show in the issue when there is a stack to share grunt-contrib-nodeunit will on occasion hide it

25748775
bottle	cherrypy
i really like bottle and then for production i run bottle with cherrypy

25748775
bottle	cherrypy
just pip3 install both and then run your bottle app with cherrypy like

25748805
int	double
you are doing int division and then casting that answer to a double

25748829
gson	jackson
use any json parsing library such as gson or jackson and convert it into java object

25748838
int	double
int int is an int which is casted to a double so it remains an int expanded to a double

25748850
postgresql	mysql
postgresql mysql etc

25748856
xlwt	xlutils
this means that if the user desired he she could just move the pythonmod folder to the python site-packages folder and everything would run fine even if xlrd xlwt xlutils are already installed

25748887
fseek	fread
also i prefer the stream functions fopen fseek fread

25748892
int	double
kahan with this snippet which assumes 32-bit int and relies on ieee 754 format for double to generate initial estimates with 5 bits of precision

25748892
addition	multiplication
but it s in the ballpark and uses only one multiplication and one addition

25748892
division	multiplication
at a glance this seems like an attractive approach but an old rule of thumb was to treat the cost of a fp division like three fp multiplication and to mostly ignore the additions and subtractions

25748892
division	subtract	division	multiplication
while the relative cost of multiplication to adds subtract has come down in most cases to a factor of two or even equality the cost of division has not fallen but often gone up to 7-10 times the cost of multiplication

25748916
put	get
but as i said it s invalid and i just breaking my head trying to understand why i ve tried to read about it but couldn t really put the finger on the answer that will satisfy me on why really so i ve provided the code example and the picture so you could get into my head and try and see why i m thinking wrong here

25748919
folder	directory
as long as the program stays in the build directory of cmake the string should include the plugin folder inside the the build directory

25748932
wildfly	glassfish
i am migrating a glassfish app to wildfly 8

25748932
wildfly	glassfish
in glassfish i was using jersey and in wildfly i am using resteasy

25748932
wildfly	jaspic
i have run into a bit of a problem with the jaspic implementation in wildfly

25748940
twig	smarty
either way i intend to use smarty partly because i have lots of experience with it and partly because its much more well documented and has much more functionality than blade and to me the syntax is slightly cleaner than twig although the template engine is not the point of this question really

25748978
pull	push
as a public repository where developers can push changes to or pull

25748979
udp	tcp
i m trying to build a program able to have a tcp server connecting to a client on one port while also being able to pass and listen for data in udp packets on other ports

25748979
udp	tcp
i m acting as a tcp server and getting commands from a tcp client and then passing them by udp to other devices

25748979
udp	tcp
i also have to listen in udp for the responses from the devices and then pass them back to the tcp client

25748979
udp	tcp
i have been trying to achieve this by creating 2 threads one for connecting to the tcp client while constantly listening for udp packets on the other thread with a different port

25748979
udp	tcp
it works fine when getting data from the tcp client and sending them to the udp devices

25748979
udp	tcp
but when i try to collect the results from the udp devices and sending them back to the tcp client

25748996
hide	show
as mentioned in the solution the controller doesn t show and hide with tapping the videoview but you mention wanting it static anyway

25749005
build.gradle	gradlew
there where some errors warnings in the cordovatestthree build.gradle and cordovatestthree cordovalib build.gradle in regards to which i changed to com.android.tools.build gradlew 0.12.0 and which in my case i changed to 19.1.0

25749018
int	double
what you are doing is dividing an int by another int and then trying to cast that to a double

25749018
int	double
int int is a int do though you cast that to a double you will not get the actual value with decimal points

25749024
width	height
note that you need to give the footer view a height and an x position the y position and the width are ignored

25749028
rss	feed
i have a rssreader working fine on some rss feed but i got one where i have some problems with special danish charaters - encoding i expect

25749030
int	chars
this uses an unsigned int parameter so that it will work for single byte chars as well as wchar_t chars

25749032
profiler	visualvm
launching a java process and clicking on it from the main visualvm window i am able to click on the profiler tab clicking on the memory button it says that a calibration must be performed so i click the ok button but it stucks again at the connection step

25749060
post	put
i suppose i could by create some new querying expression language and put it in a post but that seems like a heavy and proprietary approach

25749088
put	get
then if i put my mouse marker over list in the second row i get the error c# unknown type list

25749100
folder	directory
i think my upper-level directory are okay because they all allow executable access which as far as my understanding allows access through a folder but actually to see or modify the contents

25749113
int	chars
your code basically compares the ascii values of chars c and int a

25749137
fpdf	fpdi
check out fpdf with fpdi

25749144
chown	sudo
fix the permissions -- probably sudo chown -r youruser .cache

25749183
post	put
so i have a php post process to put user input into a csv

25749191
width	height
there is a very simple way of assigning width or height to any element at run-time and that s using .width and height method of jquery

25749191
width	height
example regular iframe without updating height and width at run-time

25749191
width	height
example when you update height and width at run-time

25749267
swift	objective-c
i have a huge background as c++ dev but i m still newbie in swift objective-c zone

25749272
int	chars
i am trying to compare two chars with each other but treating them as int

25749334
post	get
i solved the problem you have to post the video without tagging and after that you can get the id of your post and add tags

25749338
post	get
many browsers even modern don t support any request methods beyond get and post

25749375
instances	transient
findorcreatebyname is similar to findbyname except that where the plain finder would return null if nothing is found the findorcreate will create a new transient instances based on the query parameters in this case a new station name stationone

25749418
getter	setter
the problem i have is when i run doctrine generate entities command both classes privateoffer and publicoffer are fullfilled with the same properties than the mappedsuperclass offer class and also it s getter and setter methods

25749419
nunit	moq
ex code using nunit and moq

25749449
int	chars
the usual arithmetic conversion includes the int promotion that particularly means that objects of type chars are converted to objects of type int

25749466
pull	push
feel free to push it further with a pull request

25749481
folder	directory
i ve now added a couple of sub-directories inside app styles fonts with more font files in them but when i run the command it will copy the files and the folder but put the contents of the new directory into the build fonts

25749521
width	height
i assume that mass of a view is width height density 1

25749524
openrowset	openquery
if you use openrowset instead of openquery you can specify the connection parameters dynamically as a string

25749530
children	parent
setting children themselves to invisible hides them with no problem but i wanted to hide the entire parent so i don t have to go through children one by one

25749531
rdf	owl
the real problem is that your question suggests that you have little knowledge of rdf owl and you re attempting to dive way too deep way too fast

25749537
int	chars
chars are int of 8-bit length so if you re always treating the chars as int this will have the exact behavior you desire

25749537
int	chars
if you re treating them as chars then this will give you their lexicographical comparison which is based on the interal int representation of that chars

25749578
portrait	landscape
i see both portrait and landscape ads

25749595
post	get
this is part of standard erlang distribution that lets you send get and post requests with custom headers

25749606
post	put
say if my actual json is 1 one 2 two 3 three this for the post operation and during a put if it comes with 2 b how will i maintain the vo class

textview	imageview
and now i want to encapsulate the layout into a custom view and control the behavior and interaction of all its components the textview the button and the imageview

25749787
post	get
i have written a post on this if you need more info get intellisense in sass less files in visual-studio

25749788
keydown	keyup
one thing you could try is when the keydown is issued you could set some flag to true like and then you could also check for a keyup in which case you would do and do this for each of the running keys

25749789
folder	directory
perhaps the easiest solution is to get the mp3 files written to a directory that allows writes such as a temporary folder

25749792
google-chrome	firefox
on a pc both videos have styled videojs controls in google-chrome firefox and ie

25749792
google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari
it doesn t happen always on mobiles - there s no problem in safari and opera on ipad but in google-chrome on ipad sometimes video 2 has videojs controls and then on refresh has native controls when that happens the video usually won t load

25749977
getter	setter
make a getter setter functionality

25749979
qquickview	qquickitem
qquickview only supports loading of root objects that derive from qquickitem

25750104
for-loop	loops
alternatively don t use a for-each loops but rather a basic for-loop and this way you wouldn t even need a c variable

25750131
mdx	dax
using a dax query instead of a mdx query solved the problem

25750142
post	get
i have to use the same url but get post to two different files

25750217
int	chars
i can tell the s # is the number of chars in the string and i seems to mean int

25750379
ienumerable	ienumerator
lets assume that you do not have a separation between ienumerable and ienumerator

25750379
ienumerable	ienumerator
with the separation between ienumerable and ienumerator you can implement each interface as you like and use struct for enumerators

25750430
mouse	keyboard
ive been trying to setup bluestack so i can play my phone terraria saves on my computer with a mouse and keyboard

25750430

now it all works and i can switching items or pause but is i try to use the dpad to walk left and down work because it s the edge of the screens but up and right do not

25750430
move	drag
you have to touch the screen for the joysticks to even show up where ever you touch and then drag in the direction you d like to move

25750448
many-to-many	many-to-one
and a second problem is that your current code would only work for many-to-one relations but not for many-to-many relation

25750449

you can reconstruct a tree with inorder and preorder or postorder traversals

25756372

integer	fractions
since both numbers are integers ruby is doing integer division which ignores remaining fractions and i would guess all your divisions are returning numbers between 0 and 1 so the answer is always 0 to avoid that one of the both numbers should be a float so like mtm suggested add a to_f function to either of the numbers

25773302
google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari

25773412
int	double
i was wondering if someone can explain the benefits of using uint32_t as opposed to int float double etc

25773428
swift	objective-c
it s bridged in both directions with nsarray so for more type-safe code it s best to do your work with swift arrays and bridge only when needed for interoperating with objective-c apis

25773446
subtract	add
i was thinking of using some sort of boolean value grow that tells me whether or not i should grow add .05 to each factor or shrink subtract .05 from each factor

25773473
x86	64bit
for instance while int s are 32 bits on x86 and x86_64 they are 64bit on many other 64bit platforms and less than that on some older and or embedded architectures

25773497
filtering	grouping
one solution could be to use union in a subquery to make the columns available to the outer select and use that to filtering sum and grouping by

25773521

then it uses min and max within each group to get the lower and higher ids of the pairs

25773602

i created a maven build file pom.xml and tried to recreate the necessary dependencies so that i could download the appropriate versions for camel-2.13.2

25773611
hide	show
i am trying to use an accordion to show and hide the list of reports in each group

25773616
hide	show
to hide or show all markers set the map-property of all category-mvcobjects to the particular value maps-instance or null

25773632
getter	setter
what you have also obviously won t work because eloquent s getter setter are specified in a parent class yet you have the properties themselves defined as private which is inaccessible from any parent child scope

25773649
int	chars
you can turn the int to a string and iterate in reverse counting the zeros until you find a chars that is not zero

25773704
public	protected
you can either not directly specify the properties on the model or you can declare them as either protected or public then eloquent will have access to them and be able to save them to your database

25773806
getter	setter
_line is just a field if it doesn t have a getter or setter

25773806
getter	setter
i think it s personal opinion if using getter setter in your classes is evil

25773877
getter	setter
you need to implement the getter and setter and annotate the primary key

25773897
udp	tcp
indy s udp and tcp components use different interface architectures

25773897

25774065
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in google-chrome but but the sidebar and markers don t load in firefox or ie

25774098
width	height	portrait	landscape
you need to assign a width or height to an image depending on whether it is a landscape or portrait image

25774098
width	height
in this instance i would control the width height in css not inline

25774098
portrait	landscape
this is a quick example using a portrait image and a landscape image

25774211
width	height
this may not be super useful alone with jquery unless you develop jquery but if you compressed all of your javascript files this is a neat feature instead of having a crash in a function g y s w f your browser would download the original source and tell you the error is in dosomething element width height otherthing and basically act work like if the code was never compressed

post	put
the way you can go put all the datas in your post in the simplest form possible and then use them with simple jekyll tags and filter

25774538
fgets	fgetc
you may also find fgets -- which reads a whole line at at time -- simpler to use than fgetc

25774569

now trying to do something like drag and drop i made it possible to move objects an element border in the longlistselector in vertical direction

25774894

bower	npm
i m new to using all this ember tooling npm bower ember-cli etc

25775091

if every card c has c + 1 as the next card s value except the last i have a straight

25775203
getter	setter
reason behind phrase using getter setter in your classes is evil in a matter of ddd is that getter and setter are not representing your ul ubiquitous language usually and are leading to anemic entities

25775203
getter	setter
getter and setter were needed in the first place because later in the project you could ve want to add some additional validation converting before setting getting a property without it you would have to find every piece of code that is accesing property and change it

25775203
getter	setter
with getter setter you access property in one place so you change code in one place - much easier to maintain

25775203
getter	setter
but since in ddd you must use only domain logic methods then you don t access your properties directly anywhere outside of given entity so you also don t have to use getter and setter

25775203
getter	setter
you would consider to create real getter setter for internal use if you see that you are accesing property in few places in your entity class

25775300
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
if you have a single instance elastic beanstalk environment try this solution amazon-web-services elasticbeanstalk single instance force ssl redirect loop

25775392
int	chars
the program is supposed to read in a text file load it into an array and assign a chars to each number in the array so for this i m thinking i ll be creating 2 arrays an int array with the numbers read in from the file and a chars array with the chars assigned to the numbers

25775401
erlang	scheme
it makes erlang almost as prototype-friendly as guile or scheme

25775448

google-chrome	firefox
my site loads fine on google-chrome firefox but when i open it in ie 8 9 10 11 it takes ages to load

25775464
opera	firefox
firefox and opera works fine with 4g and wifi

25775475
elasticsearch	kibana
i have elasticsearch and kibana running properly on server

25775481
getter	setter
in swift it s slightly more annoying because layoutmargins is a property so you have to override the getter and setter

25775500
clang	llvm
run an llvm pass automatically with clang describes exactly what i want but the method appears to be deprecated in llvm 3.4 passmanagerbuilder has been moved to the legacy namespace

25775500
clang	llvm
llvm - run own pass automatically with clang seems to address the basic issue but i was hoping i could do this without having to modify clang which seems to be what s suggested there

25775517
shapefile	geojson
i want to format my json string to geojson in order to convert it after to shapefile

for-loop	arrays
the init function has a for-loop which generates a new canvas image per url in the arrays

25775582
fadein	fadeout
you need to use a callback so that the fadein does its thing and then the fadeout event fires

25775587
google-chrome	firefox
if you try this jsfiddle code you can see that with ie 11 and google-chrome the event object is correctly evaluated but with firefox 32.0 you get an error referenceerror event is not defined

25775633
width	height
set css for top left height width of the clone div to precalculated dimensions centering in the screen while also setting transform rotatey of the front back children

25775633

give the parent div or the menu in our case a height and width

25775754
width	height	children	parent
the css for the children give them a percentage of the of the parent s width and 100 it s height

25775827
comparator	comparable
the closest you can get to is to implement the comparable interface which includes a comparator method

25775844
min	max	range	min	range	max
the sv_depth range is determined by the depth min max in the viewport and has a maximum range of 0.0 to 1.0 it is effectively a unorm surface interpretation

25775852
getter	setter
for example when the user empties an input with the type set to date angular sends undefined as the new value which means angular.isdefined no longer can be used to determine if the method was called as a getter or setter

25775852
getter	setter
this is the example of getter setter method given in the documentation

25775862
int	boolean
typically this value is a boolean but it could be any simple type string int etc.

25775862
pop-up	dialog
as you can see in this method i try to make the pop-up window look as similar to a dialog as possible by hiding the menu and the toolbar i setup a time every 500 milliseconds to check if the window has been closed by the user and if so get the returnvalue and invoke a callback

you can look at regextransfer for an example or search for methods that extends cfabstracttransfer or implements transferfunction

25775994
google-chrome	firefox
a difference between google-chrome and firefox that i have noticed is that for styles which use url like url path to resource.ext if there is a relative url google-chrome is nice enough to output the

25776020
put	get
this will also come in handy later when you want to be able to rearrange items in the queue remove them one by one etc.â you can get the current queue apply changes and put it back

25776020
put	get
volume is clearly better modeled as a separate status volume resource with get and put

25776020
put	get
ditto for the playing paused stopped status get put status playback

had those bugfixes not occured i could simply squash the new branch back into the master

25776090

button	checkbox
when i click on the button that invokes the method for filtering selected items every items selected parameter is false even though the checkbox for it is checked

25776299

the first main problem is your hide show will only be based on the last checkbox in your loop of the checkboxes

25776310
width	height
you might have to set the width and height of the element depending on your other css

25776315
width	height
without knowing the width height of the positioned 1 element it is still possible to align it as follows

25776315
width	height
this is because a percentage value on top left properties is relative to the height width of the parent element which is creating a containing block

25776315
width	height
while a percentage value on translate transform function is relative to width height of the element itself actually it refers to the size of bounding box

put	get
just as kind of a side answer though for whatever it s worth if you don t need the div this problem goes away if you get rid of it and put the

25777378
int	double
firstly you shouldn t be converting from double s to int s as you will lose the amount after the decimal point

25777426
int	chars	int	double
there are different type variable in java like int double chars string and so on

25777454

install the 4.7 versions of gcc and g++

25777984
post	get
the code inside of onrequest calls a bunch of other functions to do different things handle get vs post requests etc. so simply generating an id at the top is a cumbersome solution as i d have to pass it around through all those other function calls

â œvectorizedâ operations like elementwise addition and multiplication

25778181
folder	directory
when investigating i don t understand why the .npm folder in my user directory has some folder created as the root user

25778204
int	double
like int and double bigdecimal instances are immutable which means that any one bigdecimal instance will never change value and thus you can share or reuse instances that represent the same number

25778204
int	double
unlike int and double bigdecimal does not participate in autoboxing which is the translation from int primitives to int object instances and likewise across other types

25778282
express	node.js
i am using node.js express engine a mvc model to read the mysql database and display the output on ui using jade

25778321

i want to lock user mouse and keyboard for seconds during this uninstall operation or block input from mouse and keyboard for seconds

25778336
division	multiplication
does the element by element multiplication and just for your own records in the same fashion . does element by element division

25778381
subtract	add
actually solution is first grade math - subtract the samples and dividing by desired factor gives delta value which we just add to first sample to get interpolated values

25778406
jquery	smart-wizard
note i don t know smart-wizard at all and not a serious jquery user

25778475
put	get
i have consider add a new method named transfer file which accept one more parameter to control process of put file get file

25778475
put	get
but later on i found that this is not a best solution because i it can t handle more than 2 condition get file put files

25778485
post	get
instead of using a post form and then redirecting to the same action with a get request why not just submit the form via get to begin with

25778558
int	double
double int

25778558
int	double
int double

25778625
post	get
to get the better result the part can be replaced with string similarity algorithm like in this post

25778681
put	get
if you want to get remove responsibility from the controller for triggering the translation you can use just put those as attributes in your html

25778708
width	height
the problem is that wooslider and most sliders in general use the page width height to display itself and since the gallery tab was off content hidden when you select it the slider does not appear

25778731
calloc	malloc
the code allocates 200 pointers to struct using calloc instead of malloc and then later allocates space for each struct as lines are read

25778772
setinterval	settimeout
and finally if all else fails ajax using good old settimeout and setinterval will work

25778804
uninstall	upgrade
that way you can for example uninstall them or upgrade them or list them out so you know what you had installed before upgrading python or moving to a new machine

25778846
maven	pom.xml
i used exec-maven-plugin at my pom.xml for generate css styles while maven build

25778860
strcpy	strncpy
in the last case the size of an element of the array shall be equal to 7 that to include the terminating zero or the size can be equal to 6 but you have to use function strncpy instead of strcpy

25778865
width	height
this is after being rendered in freewall - however height and width are still specified

25778875
keydown	keyup
i use processcmdkey but it just give me keydown event and it doesn t raise in keyup event

25778889
width	height
basically we tell wooslider to take the max available width of the viewport for the imagem and then scale the height automatically

25778917
integer	unsigned
the idea here is threefold readability using operator functions with compatible left and right arguments as well as return value and the use of integer multiplying operators being faster than unsigned operators

25778948
width	height
of course your #boxf div is empty thus it has 0 width and 0 height and the only size it has is that 10px padding you gave to everything

25778948
width	height
just give it a width and height and you ll be fine see fiddle

25778963
min	max
im trying to write a method that returns the number of words from the words parameter that have at least the min but no more than the max c haracters

25778983
uicollectionview	uitableview
uicollectionview have a different realization other than uitableview and i recommend to use rzcellsizemanager

25779004
equals	tostring
several functions are provided for you 1 a tostring function will be provided to you so that all our polynomials will be displayed identically 2 the insertion operator is defined so we can easily print a polynomial and 3 the equality inequality and addition operators are provided and are simply defined in terms of your equals and add functions

25779008
width	height	portrait	landscape
previously it would always give you width and height of the screen in portrait so 320 x 568 on the iphone 5 but in ios8 it will give you width and height with respect to whatever orientation you re in in landscape you would get 568 x 320

25779029
post	put
alternatively put everything in a form and post to the charges url like you re presumably already doing to send the stripetoken

25779056
clang	llvm
at least for me using clang llvm 3.5

25779117
jar	manifest.mf
even though the assembly plugin is configured to have a manifest.mf with my main class name the jar created thru the assmbly.xml is not executable and has a folder of my projects name with the executable jar inside it

25779147
textview	imageview
this listview has a custom layout which consists of an imageview and a textview

25779173
min	max
and also i suggest you change the if condition to make it inclusive of min and max

25779173
min	max
if wordlength min wordlength max

25779184
comparator	comparable
basically if i have a person class i will get it to implement comparable interface and will provide the implementation of comparator

25779200
put	get
i get an error when i want to transfer a string using intenet put extra it seems that the second activity fails delivered

25779230
implements	extends
you always use extends with generics wildcards even if the type parameter implements an interface

25779230
comparator	comparable
it makes sense if you think about the type paramter passed to the comparable interface and how it s used in the comparator method

25779230
super	implements
as pm 77-1 has eloquently pointed out the super keyword allows for either the class t or one of its parents to implements comparable

25779240
put	get
you should put the radio buttons inside of the form there should only be one form and then get that value on the controller you might want to set the values to cents or otherwise convert it to cents in the controller

25779244
free	malloc
you could use malloc instead of a simple array but then you have to remember to free the allocated memory

25779249
width	height
the takes 100 of the width and height instead of just the width

25779250
uicollectionview	uitableview
i think you do not understand how the uitableview and uicollectionview delegate methods work

25779252
int	double
you might try parsing the response from vkbeautify.json but this won t be very easy as arrays can contain other objects arrays int double etc

25779257
prepare	execute
looks like you want to put some sql text into a user-defined variable including in the value of v_id into the sql text then prepare execute and deallocate prepare

25779279
hide	show
we use a controller for table views that lets you hide show cells while actually handling the removal reinsertion of rows in the table view

25779311
for-loop	loops
since band is true now it will exit the while loops and go to next iteration of for-loop

25779320
free	malloc	free	realloc	realloc	malloc
you ll want to add some error handling malloc and realloc can return null and of course the rest of the api beyond append especially a delete function which will call free on the allocated memory but this should be enough to show you the idea

25779327
min	max
nitialize max with highest value and min with the lowest value

25779329
swift	objective-c
also make sure that when compiling for debug either swift or objective-c you set to build active architecture only

25779405
post	get
i think you need javascript variable in php script.php is serverside language for accessing data you can use either get or post method.you can simply get this way first assign the javascript variables to hidden text field and access in php using get or post method.you can assign javascript variable like this

25779412
google-chrome	firefox
so your example works okay on google-chrome but is broken on firefox

25779503
express	node.js
i used express to create server in node.js with port

25779503
apache	nginx
ensure node.js app directory must have proper ownership permission for apache or nginx

25779503
apache	nginx
before giving the ownership please check the name or apache or nginx user

25779503
apache	nginx
after starting the server you need to use proxy in apache nginx server to access your site globally

25779503
apache	nginx
note ensure you have enable proxy support in apache nginx

25779505
draggable	droppable
thus multiple draggable are allowed into a single droppable which is unwanted behavior

min	max
based on what i can understand from you you want to count words that has specified max and min

25779701
min	max
based on what i understand from your question you want word which has either min length or max length

25779701
min	max
explanation length of the word is equal to min length or max length counter is gonna be added

25779717
cout	cin
your plain c++ project can be a simple console application making use of cin and cout for example

25779721
min	max
i am posting the complete code here to find min and max in a given stack

25779756

like this system.out.println is printing line by line i want to add element to jlist but it adds only when for-loop ended and all lines added at once for the last loops

25779817
rtp	sdp
however you will need to generate the rtp h.264 stream on the device and appropriate sdp for it this can be done using standard gstreamer elements

25779841
min	max
if you want all records from min sku value to max sku value than just order by your query

25779942
markermanager	markerclusterer
i have taken a look at the google maps v3 utility libraries and found the markerclusterer and markermanager libraries.however i am reading and writing data using multiple google.maps.data layers

25779986
min	max
time complexity will be o 1 to find min and max in a given stack

25779986
implements	extends
public class minmaxstackfinder extends mystack implements minmaxstack

25780098
put	get
however if between the put and the get the hashcode of the key changes the hashmap might put it in bucket a and try to get it in bucket b

25780105
solaris	bsd
on windows and solaris there are advantages to instead using a proactor a pool of threads that all service the same event queue but since you re on linux let s not worry about that. modern os s have very good multiplexing apis to build onâ kqueue on bsd mac epoll on linux dev poll on solaris iocp on windowsâ that can easily handle 10k connections even on hardware from years ago

25780105
eventlet	gevent
off the top of my head i d search for gevent eventlet concurrence cogen twisted tornado monocle diesel and circuits

25780200

you really really don t want every jpql hql query of your app to have underscores everywhere

25780208
int	chars
positive int that can fit into unsigned chars

25780208
int	chars
we can also find why the interface uses int as an argument as opposed to chars from section 7.1.4 use of library functions it says

25780208
int	chars
an argument formerly declared as chars is now written as int

25780240
ironruby	ironpython
the other option is to use a scripting language like ironpython or ironruby

i am try to preview of camera in square something like instagram app but there is problem preview squeezing i put a constant value in height and width of layout and same as in preview size

25780386
implements	extends
all of the new classes extends the layer class making it easy to implements

25780460
equals	gethashcode	equals	tostring	tostring	gethashcode
that means we can call tostring equals object b gethashcode and gettype

25780495
width	height
i am using compact width regular height for this

25780605
post	get
get the contents of the html to a javascript variable then post the variable to your backend where you now have the webrequest

changes to various attributes can occur that can alter the md5 hash such as the colorspace or chroma subsampling

25780714
hash	md5
you can see that the md5 hash can change if you output to a lossy format

25780835
inherited	base-class
when you statically allocate an object whose class inherited from the base-class then at the end of the function if the object is local or the program if the object is global the destructor of the class is automatically invoked and in turn invokes the destructor of the base-class

25780835
inherited	base-class
on the other hand when you dynamically allocate new an object whose class inherited from the base-class then you need to dynamically deallocate delete it at some later point in the execution of the program

25780873
int	double
double 0 casts the int 0 into a double of 0.0

25780873
int	double
you could fix this as pointed out in the comments by either casting the first int like double 3 17 or turning the int 3 into a double 3.0 or using static_cast

25780873
put	get
so unless you transform the equation and put the transformed equation into the code you won t get the results you expect

25780976
appdata	uninstaller
what really happens is that version 1.0.0.0 is uninstaller from control panel entry is deleted from registry and the new version s entry is installed but folder appdata myapp 1.0.0.0 remains there and a new folder 1.1.0.0 is created under appdata myapp

25780976
appdata	uninstaller
during its installation previous version 1.0.0.0 is uninstaller from control panel its entry is deleted from registry and folder is uninstaller from appdata myapp

i need to get separate copies to put in arraylist

25781100
google-chrome	safari
but this effects support only google-chrome and safari browsers

the schema for post put could therefore be

25784506

to me the obvious although probably not best way to do the assignments is to go through the arrays with a for-loop and use a series of if statements to check for the value of the number at each index and assign the appropriate symbol

hide	show
the point is the hide option works fine but the show options doesn t work at all.

floating-point	fractions	decimal	ieee
the standard 32-bit ieee 754 floating-point type has a 24 bit fractions part 23 bits written one implied which may suggest that it can represent 7 digit decimal 24 std log10 2 is 7.22 but relative rounding errors are non-uniform and some floating-point values with 7 decimal digits do not survive conversion to 32-bit float and back the smallest positive example is 8.589973e9 which becomes 8.589974e9 after the roundtrip

my problem now is pretty much the same except that instead of separating the image and text in differend views namely imageview and textview i learned i can use the attribute android drawableleft to set an image for my text the suggestion was pointed to me by eclipse with a warning icon on the linearlayout line

25790141
textview	imageview
i thought the only difference would be that instead of setting the imageview with setimageresource method i would simply set the textview s drawableleft attributed with the setcompounddrawableswithintrinsicbounds method

add or subtract time

25790214

25790221
post	get
the request header contains some post get data

25790244
prepare	execute
this tells me that the sql is being generated correctly it just seems that i m not doing something quite right to execute the prepare statement

25790248

25790305
post	put

25790317
width	height
if your cell is using autolayout to determine the height of the label you should set the preferredmaxlayoutwidth to an appropriate value for example table width before laying out the cell

in this case it uses __set and __get magic methods to implement getter and setter

25790361

more generally it doesn t make any sense to create more continuously-working cpu bound threads than you have processing units cpu cores in general although the existence of hyperthreading muddies the waters a bit

25790438

this is really bad but i could not simply override it as there usages of the private instance variables directly without getter setter in endtest method

25796406
pem	pkcs#12
but let s assume you were able to do the steps above to convert that troubesome pem rsa private key to pkcs#12

25796406
nsstring	nsdata
assuming that data is an instance of nsdata that contains the pkcs12 data and passphrase is an nsstring instance representing the passphrase

25796416
for-loop	loops
also consider the fact that if you were adding new control logic such as for loops or if statements to your function exclusively for the purpose of specifying how sldv.test is defined then this would unintentionally add extraneous coverage objectives as well for example your for-loop will have decision coverage objectives associated with it

25796430
screens	tablet
now within my xhdpi folder the largest asset i have is 2560 x 1838 as i m targeting large screens here for example the google nexus 10 tablet which gets its resources from the xhdpi folder

25797778
width	height
there are a couple problems i am addressing at the moment such as why the fixed header doesn t slide to the right with the rest of the body in mobile browser but does on my pc and why you can still scroll the width height of the body when the menu is open in mobile browser but not on my pc

25797874
spaces	delimiter
your delimiter seems to be a tab or multiple white spaces

25797879
entities	entitymanager
this ends up clearing the original values but it is a major pain because i m actually dealing with a large number of entities so performance is a concern and many of these entities don t have unique primary key values in fact they don t have any key values filled in because they are just in memory objects that i don t plan to actually ever save so i need to do extra work to avoid duplicate key exception errors when adding them to an entitymanager

25797922
width	height
i am able to achieve two-thirds of my goal but need to explicitly invert the height width of the parent and apply that to the element

as a rule of thumb anything you do maths on - add subtract divide etc - is a number

25798119
subtract	add
for example phone numbers are strings - you will never add or subtract phone numbers

25798123
width	height
i have tried calling _setcoords and setcoords on the group but that moves the group to 0 0 on the canvas and keeps the height and width the same

25798187
redhat	fedora
redhat has a super old version of upstart that is probably full of bugs because they never contributed to upstart despite using it fedora switched to systemd right after rhel 6 was released before they even really tried it out well

25798203
macports	homebrew
if you installed it from source i d assume you d know where you put it. something to note is that if you use homebrew and possibly other osx package managers like macports though i haven t used it installing python through the ppc installer will cause a warning

25798273
elasticsearch	kibana
we use kibana elasticsearch with logstash and the load does get pretty heavy but then again we have over 400 servers so ymmw

25798288
singleton	facade
if you have the service bound as a singleton shared service facade access will return that singleton

25798288
singleton	facade
if you have the service bound as not a singleton shared service facade access will instantiate a new object

25798288
singleton	facade
this means facade access introduces a second singleton implementation

25798288
singleton	facade
a service bound as a singleton will be stored on the application object a service accessed via a facade will be stored as a singleton on the facade class

25798291
width	height
the rows are all the same height the widths of the fields are always the same and the overall width of a row is always the same

ienumerable	ienumerator
if one wishes to receive notifications when the sequence changes and one doesn t recognize a particular implementation of ienumerable or ienumerator the best one can reasonably hope to do is periodically enumerate the sequence to an array compare the result with that of the previous enumeration and raise a notification event when something is found to have changed

25798397
put	get
fwiw if you do want to do your own pixel-by-pixel processing of whole images it s more efficient to get a list of pixels using im.getdata and put them back into an image with im.putdata rather than doing that stuff

25798447
folder	directory
since this distribution will be installed the alembic scripting directory which holds the migrations will end up being copied to the python packages folder

25798678
strtol	atoi	int	chars
manual parsing one chars at a time is key to high speed as even well optimized converters like atoi and strtol have to deal with many different numeric representations while your example seems to imply that you are only interested in plain unsigned int

25798685
.htaccess	httpd.conf
i believe you can place this globally for apache in httpd.conf per web site in a virtualhost configuration or more specifically in a local .htaccess folder as well

25799302
for-loop	loops
so you can only iterates the integer x from 1 to sqrt z but sqrt itself is too slow and you can loops x until see the for-loop below

uiview	subviews
the uiview is a container that is itself transparent but has many subviews which are not

25799358
uiview	subviews
some of the subviews are buttons so they have tap gestures that override the scrolling action but the transparent gaps in the frame of the uiview still blocks the scrolling gesture

subclass	abstract-class	outputstream	inputstream
for example in java inputstream outputstream are abstract-class and you typically pass subclass instances to the methods

25799412

you need to either start two separate threads to read the stdout and stderr or use the process and processbuilder classes merge stderr and stdout and use a single thread

25799413
int	chars
i m trying to convert the int representation of an ascii chars back into a string

25799413
int	chars
in other languages like java the example here i can just cast the int into a chars

mouseup	mousedown
i use separate handlers for mousedown and mouseup instead of just a click because i want to make the shape resizeable before mouseup

25799616
mouseup	mousedown
it s happenning because on every mousedown you re binding to mouseup again

25799624

thats because double totalitem2 still holds a double even if you cast the result that you re assigning it to an int

25800477
getter	setter
so for example lets say we have the following noxiously common model where i have stripped out getter and setter for brevity

25800485

one such way would be to copy the file from the latest folder for ex. run n where n is the highest number folder to another directory

filter supporting google-chrome 18+ safari 6+

25809377
int	double
if your dictionary will be used only within swift code then you should use any because your types int double float string array and dictionary are not objects

25809377
int	double
when you import foundation or import uikit or import cocoa it is possible to declare your array as but in this case swift is treating your int double float literals as nsnumber your string s as nsstring your array s as nsarray and your dictionaries as nsdictionary all of which are objects

25809401
versioning	upgrade
i am trying to upgrade powermock from 1.4.9 to 1.5.6 and mockito from 1.9 to 1.9.5 because powermockrunner in 1.4.9 breaks unexpectedly under particular condition in my ide and the problem is solved in 1.5 versioning which in turn needs the latter to be upgrade

just iterate from 0 to 12 multiplying your number by 5 and applying modulo 12

25810439
division	modulo
the modulo gives you the remainder from a division problem

25810462
hash	salt
you also need to store the salt. then give the key to the javascript making the request to your page ajax.php and check that the key and salt give the same hash as before

25810462
hash	salt
or even send periodic heartbeats to the server which generate a new hash salt and key returning the new key to the browser

25810488
decimal	ieee
for a cost value we d typically use a decimal datatype or in sql server we could use the money datatype rather than an ieee float

25810504

a user should be able excel pivot to filtering by a employeegroup to get the attendance and timeticket-time for those grouping or the other way round or filtering by both ...

25810669
getter	setter
why are you using a synthezise since this is is automatically done by xcode for you along with the getter and setter so you don t need to create them ever

25810681
width	margin
example if a viewport has a width of 600px i m not using pixel btw - it s just for ease of illustration - i calculate margins based on a 2 column layout - 2.5 15px for each margin of which there are 4

25810681
width	margin
however i also want to apply that margin to other internal containers - the problem is that internal containers are not necessarily going to be the same width as the viewport therefore 2.5 on an inner box thats 300px wide - is going to be 7-8px

25810738
width	height
it has three attributes - id width and height

25810753
profiling	instrumentation
i am using the profiling from vs2012 ultimate with the instrumentation option for timing

xjc	maven-jaxb2-plugin
however it may be that maven-jaxb2-plugin uses a newer version of xjc than you re using with enum

25810976
prepare	execute
with the execute function you just pass the array with keys corresponding to the placeholder data you defined in the prepare function

25810980
min	max
if i can at least get the initial values to show i can calculate the min max avg later

25811135
int	chars
yes it is because int is bigger than chars but using chars instead of int would not be safe for the same reason

25811142
entity-relationship	diagram
i ve learned about the difference between entity-relationship and eer diagram but i d like to understand the whole modelling process.

25811150
int	chars
it is safe here because chars is converted to int anyway when calling printf

25811171
int	chars
assigning the ascii value of the chars to an int

25811171
int	chars
but safe does not mean useful as int is bigger than chars usually we do the inverse to save some memory

25811179
folder	directory
check if you have pygame on the site-packages folder in the directory

25811217
int	chars	getchar	fgetc
standard library s fgetc getchar ... functions do just that--they read unsigned chars internally and cast them to int because int provides additional room for encoding eof end of file usually eof -1

25811220
unsigned	short
when i assign the same value to signed and unsigned short and do a comparison it fails but it works with int

25811227
superclass	subclassing
i have seen constructer method of subclassing being used for a variable with superclass type

open your packages folder as above go to the python directory and open python.sublime-build in sublime

25811381
unsigned	short
in your first example both signed short and unsigned short can be promoted to an int

25811424
inherited	properties
all the scopes except isolated scope are inherited ultimately from rootscope so you will have the properties available on the rootscope automatically available on the scope

25811455
submit	submission
when i try to select some check box values and submit them i got a inavlid values error message and no submission is done

25811485

not all those processors have been thoroughly tested for gccgo but many have including x86 32-bit and 64bit sparc mips powerpc and even alpha

25811521
qpushbutton	qwidget
i have a top-level parentless qwidget on top of which i have a bunch of other qwidgets qpushbutton s

25811536
versioning	upgrade
users will only see the upgrade dialog if they re running an older versioning of v4 or if they re somehow still on v3

25811536
versioning	upgrade
moreover with a wildcard if you always keep your sdk manager updated whenever you compile the release versioning of your app and then push it to google play you may have just shipped an app against a versioning of play services that isn t widespread or worse - isn t even available for download on every device yet in which case users will get the dialog and not be able to upgrade as you ve seen during development

25811567
chown	sudo
sudo chown -r whoami .npm

25811572
google-chrome	firefox
if the webpage you re trying to do this on is not under your control you could always inject the same code using for example greasemonkey for firefox or tampermonkey for google-chrome

25811573
for-loop	loops
then on form submit you can easily loops through them using a foreach or for-loop

25811576
swift	objective-c
as you mentioned swift and objective-c codes can work together perfectly

25811576
swift	objective-c
apple s document using swift with cocoa and objective-c should be help

25811618
implements	extends
because class cannot extends interface or implements abstract class

25811642
ienumerable	iqueryable
however as per msdn the source is an iqueryable and the parameter is an ienumerable both containing the same type int or so intellisense leads me to believe

25811656
viewdidload	viewwillappear
alternatively you can do and in viewdidload or viewwillappear assuming you have your iboutlet hooked up from the xib storyboard file

25811661
nonetype	iterable
it s clearly doing the right thing for the inputs but for some reason at the end spark is trying to feed the mappartition functions something which is causing a typeerror nonetype object is not iterable error

25811675
junit	testng
take a unit test framework for instance like junit or testng

25811703
uninstall	upgrade
assuming you allow normal major upgrade make the bundle do the uninstall with a command line parameter such as bundleuninstall 1 and then have a type 19 custom action that prevents the uninstall from continuing if remove all and bundleuninstall 1

25811755
filtering	grouping
if i simply bring those two statements together in a single statement select query1 as filtering query2 as base and move the grouping by s to the outside i get results but it is the entire total for each value on every single line and about 10k lines too many

25811781
manual	rcs	cvs	rcs
as jonathanleffler observes a more careful approach is necessary when you work with a team and or are using version-control software rcs cvs subversion mercurial git etc. but if and when you start using version-control software when you read the version-control software s manual you will soon learn all about that

25811813
apache	nginx
so i assume you have a web server instance apache nginx proxying requests for thin

25811885
audiotoolbox	avfoundation
avfoundation doesn t seem to be able to answer the question at all and audiotoolbox is lying to me

25811906
fullcalendar	momentjs
fullcalendar i think from 2.0 uses momentjs library to deal with dates

25811920
profiling	debugging
by debugging leiningen.core.project i realised leiningen looks up available profiling in project metadata which doesn t contain the injected profiling

25811928

25812014
wildfly	jboss
i had a similar issue with jboss 7 and it seem to be the same issue with wildfly too

25812020
put	get
trouble is the dhtmlx library will automatically exit whenever it thinks it s done sometimes it might not get past the first require_once ... line so i can t just put require_once cronwriter.php

25812023
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome have the best support but it is still incomplete

25812054
dplyr	tidyr
you could use tidyr with dplyr

25812175

it detects when the browser does not support showmodaldialog and attaches a custom method that uses window.open parses the dialog specs height width scroll etc. centers on opener and sets focus back to the window if focus is lost

25812231
google-chrome	firefox
this works under firefox 32 and google-chrome 37 but not under ie 11 and qt 5.2 webkit

25812241

inherited	properties
why won t javascript inherited the properties from a prototype

25812342
inherited	properties
it does not inherited the properties

25812349
put	get
now if you were to put them together simplistically you d get

25812360
hide	show
this will hide the hidethis class and show showthis class

25812376
getter	setter
i think it might be because of different getter and setter name cause for remaining onetomany fields the criteria is working fine

25812393
int	chars
yes it is safe to cast a chars like chars type to an int type like int

25812393
int	chars
the int is converted to a chars

25812393
int	chars
the chars ch is converted to an int x

25812393
int	chars
in theory there could be a loss of data going from chars to int but given the overwhelming implementations there is none

25812393
int	chars
typical examples if chars is signed in the range -128 to 127 this maps well into int

25812393
int	chars
if chars is unsigned in the range 0 to 255 this also maps well into int

25812393
int	chars
printf c x uses the int x value passed to it converts it to unsigned chars and then prints that chars

25812393
int	chars
chars and int could be the same size and chars is unsigned with a positive range more than int

25812393
int	chars
this is the one potential problem with casting chars to int although typically there is not loss of data

25812393
int	chars
this could be further complicated should chars have range like 0 to 2â³â²-1 and int with a range of - 2â³â¹-1 to + 2â³â¹-1

25812451
build.gradle	gradlew
you don t have the spring boot gradlew plugin installed so you re not actually creating a fat jar you need to add the following to your build.gradle file

deallocate a block of memory previously allocated by a call to malloc calloc or realloc is deallocated making it available again for further allocations

25812564
integer	unsigned
then this address is casted to so it is casted to a pointer to a uint8_t which is a fixed width unsigned integer of 1 byte

25812570

compare the scrolltop with the height of the container and prevent further scroll when max or min is reached until moused is out

25812703
int	chars
chars is an integral data type in treated as an int by the c++ core language

25812703
int	chars
string literal + chars therefore is interpreted as pointer + int

25812729
int	chars
string literal is converted to pointer to its first chars in this case to its terminating zero and int value stored in c is added to the pointer

25812729
int	chars
in c++ string literals are constant chars arrays and the semantic of operator + for arrays and int are different

25812756
int	boolean
i ve declared the run variable globally and changed the value to boolean instead of int so the code is more clear

25812768

also if you re really worried about a future major versioning breaking compatibility you could embed the installer for the versioning of .net you target if it so happens than your application gets installed on say windows 9 .net 6 later and those happen to not be in place upgrade the installer would install the previous versioning side by side and when multiple .net versioning are installed side by side the one that matches your appliaction will be used

inherited	subclassing	metaclass	subclassing
because of this difference when you inherited from testc __metaclass__ is used as the metaclass for the new subclassing whereas when you inherited from testf type is used

25818417
metaclass	subclassing
because in the testf case since no custom metaclass is applied to the creation of the subclassing the subclassing doesn t get a modified __init__ method applied

25818417
super	self
so the __init__ method called is still testf.__init__ and when it calls super cls self .__init__ it is calling object.__init__ which takes no arguments and this works fine

25818417
metaclass	subclassing
but in the testc case the metaclass is used again when you create the subclassing

25818417
super	self
so in this case when it calls super cls self .__init__ it is calling testc.__init__ which itself having been created by the metaclass takes the required argument field which you are not passing

onresume	onpause
then you should create a base activity your activities will inherit and implement the onpause and onresume methods for firing an intent to the service indicating that they have gone into onpause onresume

25819842
onresume	onpause
when your last activity goes into background the onpause method will be triggered without later triggering onresume which cancels the countdown resulting in the session being cleared if the time elapses

25819864
int	chars
if the plain chars is an unsigned type as it is on some machines then this will never evaluate to true because the value -1 the normal value for eof is assigned to an unsigned chars it is mapped to 0xff and when 0xff is compared with an int like eof that is still -1 the answer is false so the loop continues

25819864
int	chars
the fix for this is to use int letter instead of chars letter

25823355
iprincipal	iidentity
obvious benefits are as follows the whole concept of application s authentication authorization is built around principals and identities expressed as iprincipal iidentity

25823355
iprincipal	iidentity
replacing iprincipal iidentity with your own authentication authorization interfaces would take forever

25823366

for example not only the files and databases but also the cron jobs dns zones email accounts etc.

25829470
base	fractions
the first thing to realize is that unlike integers fractions values can t always be represented in arbitrary base with a finite number of digits

25829470
base	fractions
specifically if the target base does not include all prime factors of the source base there are values which can t be represented accurate for example all binary fractions can be represented using decimal fractions but not all decimal fractions can be represented using binary fractions

25834134
put	get
put the javascript in your code after the declaration of the span or you ll get an error stating that you cannot set property innerhtml on null

25834144
margin	text-align
neither margin auto nor text-align center is working

25834215
addition	modulo	division	modulo	division	addition
in addition division and modulo are the same instruction div and idiv both return a quotient and remainder so you can end up with sigfpe from integer modulo too

25834251
min	max
stick is just a weapon object i made with min max damage values

25834257
behat	mink
i am aware i can test the full application with behat mink and phantomjs for example

25834305
stdout	fflush
that means including a n in the printf or by manually calling fflush stdout

25834313
for-loop	loops
while technically the while and for loops are equivalent the for-loop expresses the iteration idiom way better as it keeps the iteration logic separate from the rest of the code and thus also makes it more reusable you can use the same for header with a different body for any other iterative action on the list

25834330
width	height
save those images to the disk and inspect their width height values

25834399
width	height
for each div i extract attributes and the top bottom left right width height of the div

25834586
google-chrome	firefox
it is working on firefox but not working on google-chrome

25834592
cout	ofstream
compared to std string and std ofstream which do allocate memory on the heap programs containing std cout don t seem to have any heap allocation

25834592
std	ostream
i know that std ostream s inherit xalloc iword and pword

25834640
width	height
the size is the constraint on the area the calculated area width is restricted to the specified width whereas the height is flexible based on this width

25834656

25834743
bmp	png
the file-type does not seem to matter jpg png bmp

25834772
width	height
and then from that you could get the height and width by doing

25834867
children	parent
the viewpager children will should always match it s parent width

25834883
setinterval	settimeout
also if you re sure if you want to execute this function only once when the body loads you might as well want to use settimeout instead of setinterval

25834884
setinterval	settimeout
finally if you want to run the function 10 seconds after the document loads rather than every 10 seconds starting from when the document loads use settimeout instead of setinterval

25834897
put	get
get the time from database and put that on variable

25834906
int	double
well you do print the double as an int so you have undefined behavior in your code

25835008
std	ostream
a std ostream is a base class that lets derived classes hook into a its std streambuf

25835008
std	ostream
so a std ostream can be seen as a wrapper around a std streambuf pointer along with a pointer to it s locale and formatting information

25835022
post	get
so far the http get and post works fine giving me a 200 and 201

25835074

here is a jsfiddle where the div hide or show whether the textbox has some text

25835297
width	height
note that #days div width and height are percentages

25835325
range	infinity
traditional approach simple looping every element of c in array a and if find in the range set the value of and to minus infinity or remove them for arraylist

25835333
backtracking	greedy
in this one the parser gets to the . and matches it as a variablesegment but then backtracking just one step in the greedy lookahead decides it s got a variable and then re-parses the . as normal

25835333
backtracking	greedy
now that greedy group will backtracking when it fails in peeking forward at an _

25835370
getter	setter
my first thought was to hide all needed transformation in getter and setter

25835381
button	checkbox
for that application use checkbox instead of radio button

25835381
button	checkbox
you can style the checkbox so they look like button if that s important cssdeck.com labs css-checkbox-styles

25835414
put	get
so one alternative is to decrease the idle connection time of connections in pool so may whenever connection sits idle in connection for say 10 sec connection to database will get closed and new connection created to put in pool

25835430
post	get
for example if one tag is cool then i would get any post with tag cool

25835465
folder	directory
in the scenario you described it sounds like you need to create a virtual directory in iis for the second application instead of making just a sub folder

25835489
gruntjs	package.json
in both my bower.json and package.json for gruntjs

25835489
bower	npm
i don t like the fact that my dependencies are spreaded out like this â i would need to run npm install and bower install .

25835495
folder	directory
in that case i suggest adding figaro gem into your application and then you can create an application.yml file inside shared config folder and link it with current directory in your app

25835535
super	extends
i have to make an implementation in which i have a super class a and two classes b and c both extends a but both b and c have constructor with different number of parameters

int	chars	int	double
the data type of the target can be as simple as chars int double etc

25835634
margin	text-align
the text-align center you need on the parent element since margin 0 auto does not work for inline-block elements

25835635
hide	show
as i m just not sure what the required result is i ll leave it like that - clicking philosophie in the main menu hide show the submenus

25835647
put	get
for example i have situation when on button press i make a call to the server get response and put it into a using something like

25835668

the problem here is that the two branches in the case statement return different types - the when returns a chars string while the else returns an int

25835705

it may still be a good idea to detect ie versioning that are outside that range to let the user know that the feature of your application that uses opentok is not supported with some suggestions to upgrade install

25835820
put	get
i need to get the location that is part of the parse object that the user would have put in when they sign up

width	height
you can change the width and height of the window that is displayed as well as the width and height of the buffer

25836092

25836267
integer	unsigned
you compare signed integer a with unsigned x.length

25836304
super	extends
create a super class that your 20 different activities extends

25836327
post	get
i should have sent http parameters via post method instead of get

25836331
ssl	https
i thought that since maybe tls ssl works on port 443 i should have fiddler listen there and move my web server to another port like 444 i should probably set on iis an https binding on port 444 then

25836351
isotope	masonry
this is a common issue that people will experience while working with masonry isotope and it s addressed here in the faq

25836803
google-chrome	firefox
so i ve been playing around with this problem and i think i ve found a solution that works on both google-chrome and firefox respectively

25836803
google-chrome	firefox
so far i ve tested on both google-chrome and firefox and it displays the following behavior

25836822
hide	show
overlay the two images on top of each other and show and hide them instead of doing a replace

25836831
post	get
i have read different post and the qt documentation explaining command lines in shell but i cannot get through the installation of static library and i suppose shared frameworks would be even harder in order to produce an app file from my project

25836840
oncreate	ondestroy
call stopservice intentofyourservice at onpause or ondestroy and give the intent you created at oncreate or elsewhere to the parameteres

25836859
int	double
there is no distinction between double or int or any other type of number

25836859
int	double
you need an explicit cast if you want to convert the parser s double to an int

25837010
post	get
i just want to send a post request to remote server and get response

25837044
google-chrome	firefox
code below - this works fine in google-chrome but not firefox 35 where it consistently fires the geoerror function regardless of the value of timeout

if you have two entities which share a common set of properties but differ in others you basically do the typical oop inherited thing you create an abstract parent class with the common stuff and two children with their specific properties

25837264
debian	linux
asp.net mvc4 application is running in debian x64 linux using apache and mod_mono

25837731
tcpdf	fpdi
by the way both fpdi and tcpdf are common php libraries so you can just put them somewhere in your base folder no additional tools should be required on a common web server

25837744
width	height
the big orange area is as you may guess a floating element with a width of 0 and a height of 100 of it s parent minus the height of the 70 other floating elements the stripes which is 70px

25837746
children	parent
this will give you parent and children

25837746
children	parent
now to refine we see that we need to ignore children in the parent role and to this purpose we add where p.parent_id is null

25837746
children	parent
real children have a parent and will then be skipped

25837746
children	parent
bottom level the true children ignore those parent that have

25837746
children	parent
then you want the top child in relation to a parent id and this calls for a group by which will yield the desired result when children are there or null when there aren t

25837747
google-chrome	firefox
assuming that by address you mean physical address and not domain i d recommend that you right click on the element if you re using google-chrome or firefox that is and select the inspect element option

25838387
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops

25838437
post	get
note that the generic formview has got get and post methods

25838477
int	boolean
as you can see the data includes strings an int and a boolean

25838524
typedef	struct
because a.h only defines an opaque type typedef struct element element b.c can t possibly know the make up of element to even determine its size

25838530
src	attr
anyway in your case if you want to change the src of the element i guess it s a you just need to do get the element with selector and change the src using attr

25838561
versioning	upgrade
i recently upgrade it to versioning 4 by removing the old .jar library and adding google play services as a project dependency

25838561

it roughly doubles the buffer size for each realloc and won t crash on a failed malloc realloc

25838729

the manpage on getline and getdelim doesn t detail what happens if the malloc and realloc fail on my system and only mention a possible error einval no enomem

25838811
post	get
django and other frameworks do this - the assumed default is get then you add a if statement for the post method

25838813
for-loop	loops
i think that your code is falling into an infinite loops by checking for board i .length in the first for-loop

25838857
put	get
regarding checking if the queue is actually full or empty before notifying other waiting threads you re missing something which is both methods put t t and t get are both synchronized methods meaning that only one thread can enter one of these methods at a time yet this will not prevent them from working together so if a thread-a has entered put t t method another thread-b can still enter and start executing the instructions in t get method before thread-a has exited put t t and so this double-checking design is will make the developer feel a little bit more safe because you can t know if future cpu context switching if will or when will happen

if you have control over the destination method convert it to handle get and change your post to a get on the source domain

25839157
width	height
unfortunately i can t use document height like with the vertical scroll and find when user is at the bottom of the page so i can t figure out if it s even possible to do.i have tried to compare the div.scrollleft with div.width but the width of the div is constant and it s not working

it seems like the kinds of things that are bridged over from swift files to objective-c are limited though to what exactly i m not sure

25858450

25859066
width	height
it seems to be the same width as the screen but the height is padded out

25859085
serializable	deserialization
due to the size of the data we receive i would like to start taking advantage of all the goodness that protocol buffers provide specially with regards to size bandwidth and the saving around time resources on both sides during serializable and deserialization

25859086
hash	md5
i m aware that if you exceed the 32 characters it will still hash it perfectly fine but it might actually be the same hash as md5 a though unlikely

25859102
uilabel	uibutton
purpose is i need to set all uilabel uibutton text again

25859116
express	koa
koa is incompatible with express middleware

25859116
express	koa
the req and res that you would receive in an express middleware are not directly available in koa middleware

25859120
hash	md5
in fact you may be under the impression that md5 will hash all of the first 2 32-1 values uniquely - in fact that is not the case

25859120
hash	md5
there are many values that will hash to any given md5 output

25859175
fileoutputstream	filewriter
or use a filewriter instead of a fileoutputstream same principle

25859376
hash	md5
neither md5 nor sha-x are suitable for password hash

25859376
hash	md5
ignoring the fact md5 is cryptographically broken and should be phased out in general both hash families are too fast and are not suited for this problem - this is because the hash are too fast and humans often choose weak poor password which severely compromises the domain which makes brute-forcing md5 sha-x passwords practical

25859376
scrypt	pbkdf2
other options not supplied standard in php are scrypt and even the more vulnerable pbkdf2

25859376
hash	md5
since neither md5 nor sha-x are perfect hash functions then there will be collisions over the domain even when it is less than the range - but the range is so huge and a valid cryto-hash has certain properties that it just doesn t matter

25859376
hash	md5
this is because cryptographic hash functions are designed with certain properties which also explains why md5 is not suitable in such a role

25859387

for-loop	loops
here this means that loops does nothing and then n becomes undefined is it s defined only within the context of the for-loop itself.

25860682
client-side	server-side
meteor server-side methods are and have to be asynchrounous while the nature of client-side javascript implies that the helper methods are synchronous there is no wait in the browser

25860682
client-side	server-side
thus to use a server-side method inside a client-side helper you have to take advantage of reactivity

25861967
children	parent
remove itself from its parent s and siblings linked lists no change to its children they are just left for garbage collection

25861972
apache	nginx
you would be better off to use nginx as a front end proxy on port 80 and have it proxy to both apache mod_wsgi and tornado as backends on their own ports

25861972
apache	nginx
apache mod_wsgi will actually benefit from this as well if everything is setup properly as nginx will isolate apache from slow http clients allowing apache to perform better with fewer resources

25861998
for-loop	loops
in that case you make the inner part of loops into opencl kernel and launch it with a global_work_size that is equivalent to the for-loop s total loops count

if you want to detect control-v as a key chord independent of the actual paste functionality you can use keydown keyup events but then you hit the cross-platform issues - do you want it to still be control-v on a mac where paste is usually command-v etc

25872993

a common thing to do in this situation is a post redirect get -- this will allow a user to change the category and then will refresh the page so that it reloads with the new one which will allow them to change it again

25873169

25873987
width	height
playing around with css width and height doing a mix of 100 and auto on the image got me nowhere

25873988
width	height
the width of the container in this case is controlled by bootstrap layout css so i only need to set the height of the container

25873988

and the image will adjust to fit the container by either using up full height for vertical images or full width for horizontal images

int	chars
if your b points to the 0xef byte chars is signed and int is 32-bit wide and uses 2 s-complement then the result in hex terms will look as 0xffffffef which is a negative value

25874463
division	subtraction

decimal	ieee
the ieee standard for floating-point arithmetic ieee 754 is for binary and decimal formats only

25876895
int	double
you add to your global curmempos2 pointer sometimes sizeof int sometimes sizeof double

25876895
int	double
as each dictionary construction uses numwords int and numwords double in your self managed memory pool i d recommend to use a protected struct

25876962
if-statement	while-loop
also if it was intended to be used like that otherfunc could return a boolean and be placed in an if-statement to end the while-loop or the method

sorting	filtering
if we don t post the form devexpress grid user selection sorting pagination and filtering is not exporting to excel

25877099
int	double
the address returned by malloc is always suitably aligned for any type of object with a fundamental alignment requirement - so it s always well-aligned for int or double

25877099
int	double
suppose malloc returns the address 0x3000 and you allocate five int s then the address of curmempos2 becomes 0x3014 and then you try to allocate five double s - but 0x3014 isn t a valid address for a double because it isn t 8-byte aligned

25877223
range	minimum
the range consists of the minimum and maximum value that can be contained in a variable of a given type

25877223
int	chars
an unsigned chars has 8 bits all for actual data meaning it can contain int values between 0 and 255

25877252
swift	objective-c
this may be a bug in the objective-c swift bridge but it looks like arrays of uint8 or of any other byte-length-specific integer aren t compatible with objective-c

25877252
swift	objective-c
i say it may be a bug since uint8 s by themselves are fine and the swift type compatibility section of using swift with cocoa and objective-c doesn t say anything about it

25877255
dataframe	multi-index
my approach was to create a multi-index date - time and then do a pivot table or some sort of reshape to achieve the desired dataframe output

subtract	add
an easy optimization for updating a sum is to subtract the old value and add the new value

25877310
subtraction	addition
commutativity - addition and subtraction reach the same result regardless of the order they are performed in

25877310
subtract	add
this lets us reach the same result when we subtract the old value and add the new value to the total even if the old value wasn t the most recently added value

25877310
subtraction	addition
associativity - addition and subtraction can be performed in arbitrary groupings and still reach the same result

25877310
subtract	add
this lets us reach the same result when we subtract the old value and add the new value to the total even it the old value was added somewhere in the middle of the additions

25877317

25877984
put	get
i put a breakpoint inside the didfinisheventsforbackgroundsession and it never seemed to get called

25878057
width	height
if the image width and height are both less than 200 we can continue with the same size

25878057
width	height
height is greater than 200 we need to calculate the new width and

25878057
width	height
height by multiplying with the ratio 200 max width height inorder

25878057
width	height
to avoid cropping either top if width is more or left if height is

25878057
width	height
calculate new width and height

25878057
width	height
if the ratio is 1 there is no problem but if the ratio is less than 1 we get either less width height image than required i.e 200 200

25878057
width	height
for this you can create a new transparent png or white 200 200 jpg and place the newly generated image apprioriately i.e if height is less place it vertically centered or if the width is less place it horizontally centered and save that file

25878209
primitive	reference-type
this is a java language feature called boxing that allows a primitive type to work with a reference-type parameter variable or collection

firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	opera	safari
so i ve experimented a bit not with this jsfiddle but with larger example and found solution for google-chrome safari opera and firefox

25878320
hide	show
if you only have a few different form options and addining in the dom as hidden elements on page download does not add what you deem to be unacceptable incremental page download times you may strongly consider a javascript only solution to hide show form elements based on your desired logic

25878392
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
odd issue in firefox no problem in google-chrome ie 11 at least and safari

hash	md5
the file is saved correctly but md5 hash that i get in code via sparkmd5 is different from the one i see in windows after the file is saved

25878606
width	height
you actually want to round the number of cans down to the lowest whole number assuming that you have a container with dimensions width and height that you want to fit some number of cans into without going over with math.floor when you first calculate it

25878606
width	height
in this case you would have to calculate the number of cans that fit into the width direction and then the number of cans that fit into the height direction and multiply them together

25878606
width	height
if a can in the grid takes up x sqmetrespercan then its width and height will both be math.sqrt x

25878619
public	protected
they are defined by using one of the keywords public protected or private followed by a normal variable declaration

25878834
opera	safari
all browser i haven t checked safari yet except opera can play my video file

25878841
pop-up	dialog
in other words blur the background around the dialog pop-up

25878848
postgresql	mysql
if you really want to use it you have to make the is_active field nullable and use none null instead of false as two nulls are not considered equal at least in postgresql and mysql

25878861
getter	setter
in your code behind keep track of the index of the currently displayed image index with a private backing field and a public getter and setter

25878896
internationalization	localization
there are plenty of tutorials about internationalization and localization around but here is how it works in general

25878896
translation	localization
now you localization framework should find out which is the locale wanted needed by the user and present the according translation taking from the according property file to the user

25878950
int	chars
you can include primitive types using placeholders like d int c chars

25878984
put	get
i am certain it will be merged however i don t know if when then devs will get a chance and i d rather not put off the work flow i am in.

25879018
children	parent
if you add all of your nodes to a parent node named background you can filter to only the children of the background node by replacing self with your background node though this will result in it using the background nodes coordinates

25879019
spatialite	mapnik
though mapnik supports spatial sqlite databases spatialite has to be a statically linked extension for sqlite

25879092
hide	show
i am trying to figure out how i can show hide the same div in 2 different positions on the page but its currently not working correctly

25879095
range	minimum
at a minimum you need to tell range that you want to deal with the .cells in this case a single cell that is specified by the with .

25879105
width	height
in your case the left and top values are probably becoming negative thus right and bottom do not represent the width and height

25879105
width	height
calculate the width and height with r.right - r.left and r.bottom - r.top as you do in your 2nd example function

25879112
hide	show
at 150 text characters visible ignore formatting and tags the show more less functionality needs kick in and hide characters greater than 150 with a link to show more or less

25879124
width	height
you also need to calculate width as right - left and height as bottom - top since the adjusted rect usually has a negative origin relative to the origin of the client area

25879183
octal	decimal
since putting ascii decimal characters 7 or 8 next to an escaped octal byte representation is impossible 0337

25879196
unsigned	short
i read somewhere unsigned short int and unsigned int go from 0 to 65 535

25879223
put	get
i m completely confused as to how to get my serializer to ignore the but still use obj.owner_name to get the owner_id to use for the put

25879244
unsigned	short
an unsigned short will consume half the memory of a signed int 2 bytes vs 4 bytes

25879269
folder	directory
do bare in mind that each extension may have it s own separate database tables so if you do plan on removing manually from the database make sure you remove all associated database tables along with files folder from the joomla directory

25879339
width	height	children	parent
i m trying to figure out a relatively browser-compatible way of allowing the height of a parent div to expand with its children of width 100 and some percentage height

25879340
put	get
i see this asp.net control for embedding a markdown file into a page but the control is for vs 2010 so clearly is not being actively maintained plus to use it i ll need to build something to take the relative links and find the related .md files and load them up in mvc - sounds like a hassle to get working and it will require me to put mvc in my docs project

25879355
google-chrome	safari
it appears to integrate versions of the safari webkit inspector and google-chrome dev tools to offer an integrated debugging experience on os x and windows

25879379
ubuntu	linux
it s worth mentioning that i ve used the exact same code on a similar software suite written executed under a linux system ubuntu 14.04 and the seekslider worked exactly as expected

25879390
post	get
this will either be post or get

25879413
hide	show
my goal was to create a simple button which once clicked would hide show a navigational menu and change the footer s padding alternatively i d have used toggle if not for the latter condition

25879447
min	max
the lines that declare min and max should be

25879475
opengl-es	glsurfaceview
i have an application that uses opengl-es 2.0 and uses a glsurfaceview and a renderer class to draw to the screen

25879505

25879559
udp	tcp
this can be done either over tcp transmission control protocol or udp user datagram protocol

25879559
skype	hangout	voip	xmpp
most voip services skype hangout xmpp chat and even youtube i think use udp for their streaming as it has huge gains on performances and it doesn t matter all that much if a frame made it to the other side of the line as the person could simply repeat themselves

25879559
udp	tcp
list of tcp and udp port numbers

25879559
udp	tcp
as you can see a lot of protocols support either tcp or udp

25879567

25879597
config	ini
or by my opinion better write it into an non accessible xml yaml ini file and then on initiation use config set

25879653
pop-up	dialog
the profiler detects that the last non-daemon thread has exited other than additional threads running in the jvm on behalf of the profiler so that s when it pop-up the dialog that says the profiled application has finished execution. it keeps the jvm alive though so you can continue to get data from it

25879664
margin	height
the margin-bottom causes the second line to be wrapped correctly but only for as many lines as the height of the radio button plus the margin

25879686
implements	extends
it implements concurrentmap which extends the map interface

25879709
inherited	properties
i think the biggest confusion over prototype inherited is that that objects inherited from their contructor s prototype via their internal properties

25879709
inherited	properties
so that puts an update properties on the inherited chain of all instances of enemy so they all inherited an update method

25879709
inherited	properties
you can continue to add properties and methods to enemy.prototype and they will be inherited by all instances even those already constructed

25879856
swift	objective-c
the error you re getting makes sense because swift can know at compile time that bear doesn t implement cough whereas objective-c wouldn t necessarily be able to know that

25879953
stdout	stderr
the exit code is returned and stdout and stderr are reference params if you need them

25879961
macports	homebrew
you need to install it first as it s not on mac os x using something like homebrew macports manually which will provide you with an installed copy that can be referenced using the user header search paths and library search paths as well as referencing the fltk library ies in the linked frameworks and libraries

25879973
libxml2	libxslt
use homebrew to install or reinstall libxml2 libxslt and libiconv

25880057
ember.js	qunit
i m writing a qunit unit test for ember.js

25880061
for-loop	arrays
you could use an arrays and a for-loop to do this so instead of hardcoding body parts like you are doing

25880088
width	height
appear before the lines where width and height are set to their actual values

25880106
swift	objective-c
the autoreleasepool pattern is used in swift when returning autorelease objects created by either your objective-c code or using cocoa classes

25880106
swift	objective-c
the autorelease pattern in swift functions much like it does in objective-c

25880106
swift	objective-c
the autoreleasepool allows you to explicitly manage when autorelease objects are deallocated in swift just like you were able to in objective-c

25880106
swift	objective-c
but if you re dealing with objective-c objects including cocoa classes they may be autorelease objects in which case this swift rendition of the objective-c autoreleasepool pattern is still useful

25880183
put	get
using the above put i get the following -

25880270

int	double
you are doing int division i.e only keep the int part of the result and implicitly cast it to a double

25880499
swift	objective-c
what s left is a number of objective-c protocols and some code that should use swift idioms in place of objective-c style

25880499
swift	objective-c
its complaining that the 3rd argument my swift protocol can never participate as part of objective-c

25880499
swift	objective-c
this seems like it would be a widespread limitation for swift objective-c interoperability

25880504
int	chars
what i did to convert string x to int was first converted each individual chars in the string x to a single chars in a for-loop

25880504
post	get
id figure id post this because i took me a while to figure out how to get a binary such as 01010101 into integer form

25880513
getter	setter
if you cannot find a duration type that can parse the format you describe and that is stored correctly in mysql i suggest using a simple long value in seconds and doing the conversion to from string in the getter and setter

25880519
google-chrome	firefox
however in the same jsfiddle on firefox and google-chrome there is no red border on the bottom like this

25880537
swift	objective-c
it seems that the best work-around is to add the objective-c directive to the swift protocol

25880551
fgets	getchar
i know the easy way would be to read everything in using scanf or fgets however my microprocessor cannot handle those functions forcing me to use getchar

25880581
g++	gcc
in my case i was using gcc not g++

25880583
namedtuple	dictionary
it seems like you can t use namedtuple in the shorthand notation of dictionary

25880629
qtableview	qtreeview	qtableview	qabstractlistmodel	qtableview	qabstracttablemodel	qtreeview	qabstractlistmodel	qtreeview	qabstracttablemodel	qabstracttablemodel	qabstractlistmodel
since it appears there is no dedicated abstract model designed purposely for qtreeview for qlistview there is qabstractlistmodel and for qtableview there is qabstracttablemodel and since i need to be able to display the headers i opted to use table s abstract model qabstracttablemodel with qtreeview

25880639
oncreate	findviewbyid
in the oncreate method put the following after you findviewbyid for the time picker

25880707
freebsd	netbsd
freebsd and osx have a version of stat derived from netbsd

25880738
qtableview	qtreeview	qtableview	qabstracttablemodel	qtreeview	qabstracttablemodel
you cannot use qabstracttablemodel properly with a qtreeview as that class is only for qtableview

25880738
qabstractitemmodel	qabstractlistmodel	qabstractitemmodel	qabstracttablemodel	inherited	subclassing	qabstracttablemodel	qabstractlistmodel
you must instead inherited qabstractitemmodel which is what both qabstracttablemodel and qabstractlistmodel inherited and implement index parent rowcount columncount and data as described in the subclassing section of qt s fine manual

to set the width and height properly

25880819
apache	nginx
most likely it could boil down to how you have apache nginx configured where and how you are loading your static assets and other variables

25880819
laravel	codeigniter
in my personal benchmarks laravel is undeniably faster than codeigniter due to lazy loading

int	chars
to convert betwwen an int such as 123 and the string of chars 1 2 3 you need to use a function

25891868
clang	llvm
stlport doesn t have c++11 support afaik. on macosx llvm libc++ stl is more likely if you use clang maybe also for gcc not sure

25891892
free	malloc
malloc manages in cooperation with free and a few other functions a zillion tiny individually addressed blocks within relatively large blocks which are generally obtained with sbrk

25891892
free	malloc
though one could allocated memory using sbrk exclusively you would be unable to free arbitrary chunks for reuse or coalesce smaller chunks into larger ones or split chunks without writing a bunch of bookkeeping code for this purpose - which ends up essentially being the same as writing malloc

25891892
free	malloc
additionally using malloc free .

after some simulations with fenics i saved the results in vtk format so that i can load it in paraview

hence set constrain width height for every dynamic view that you have

25892096
puts	gets
before you try to get the result tolist gets the result and puts it in a list you are just creating the query

25892153
put	get	post	get	post	put
it must be all set up correctly as after the exception is raised the application works across get post and put so i have a workable crud interface

25892181
vtk	paraview
i have had the same setup render things with vtk with better success so not sure what about paraview may be the problem

25892404
inherited	properties
i created a class that inherited dynamicobject and want to create a static method that can create new instances with pre-determined properties stored in the dictionary

however in google-chrome mac and safari mac i am seeing clientheight and offsetheight reporting the same value event when there s a horizontal scrollbar beneath

25892593
post	get
it s only for get request and if you try submit your form probably you use post method

25892593
post	get
if you don t care about method - all requests including post and get would be directed to the route

25892637
min	max
you can use the js math function min and max on arrays

25892664
google-chrome	firefox
the issue is worse in google-chrome than in firefox because the left hand section of the navbar does not sit at the top of the screen

25892664
google-chrome	firefox
if i can get google-chrome to look like the firefox screenshot this will help me fix the remaining issues

25892664
google-chrome	firefox
top is google-chrome bottom is firefox

25892666

get works fine but post won t do

25893037
swift	objective-c
this is identical in objective-c and swift

25893059
cout	cin
cout and cin are parts of the standard namespace std which means that you cannot access them unless you use the appropriate commands

25893080
min	max
the reason for this is that you need the min max timestamp per id which requires an aggregate query which cannot be used in an update query

25893082
division	multiplication
here s a variation that uses multiplication rather than division

25893093
viewdidload	viewwillappear
the viewwillappear occurs after the viewdidload is already finished

25893111
post	get
first get the value like this i assume that you have a form and you send it by post

25893173
keydown	keyup
since the problem is chrome doesn t register the keydown keyup events on the select elements until after the dropdownlist has disappeared we need to either

25893214
sorting	grouping
so the sorting gets the order right and the grouping picks the first occurrence within the grouping key where those fields exist

25893246
google-chrome	firefox
this issue is found only in latest version of windows firefox and google-chrome

25893247

google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this behavior is specific to firefox i tested in google-chrome ie and opera and there is not extra mouseup event

25893328
mouseup	mousedown
also there is no mousedown event so the log will have two sequential mouseup events

25893374
try-catch	exception-handling
i had to add the try-catch to the filter because it was returning unhandled exception-handling type sqlexception

25893383

and found its way into plenty of .net programs stuck on data providers of the 1990s or injected by code originally written in vb6 or vba the most popular programming tools in the 90s

25893739
pull	push
that is because you cannot switch to another branch because your changes will be erased as general rule you should do checkout for switching and optionally creating branches pull push merge rebase only if you have all changes commited

25893772
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it works in google-chrome and in safari just not in firefox

i am seeing 401 responses when making a cors request via jquery ajax from ios safari google-chrome or windows 7 firefox clients but not when made from ie google-chrome windows 7 clients

google-chrome	firefox
looking at the requests in the developer tools both on ios and firefox windows i don t see the credential being passed but i do in windows ie google-chrome

25893793
firefox	safari
ok i think it might because firefox and i presume safari and ios correctly implement the w3c specification which states that preflight requests should not pass user credentials

25893890
put	preflight	post	put
however something must be going wrong at the preflight level for the post put and delete.i am on angular js i have tried every thing put on server side header .like

25894230
spaces	delimiter
not tested for the assumption that the example provided may be one of many even if all of similar format but one way would be to copy columna assuming that is where your data is to columne apply text to columns there with spaces as the delimiter then in b1

25894251

wkhtmltopdf not working with https ssl even though i set ld_library_path for libssl.so and libcrypto.so

25894472
post	get
the following post seems to indicate how this can be done but i couldn t get this to work

25894513
maven	pom.xml
1 unlike v1.x there is no packaged pom.xml file in the v2.x repository so i can t use maven

25894556
maven	pom.xml
just perform a search in maven central repository to find the most suitable artifact according to all other libs versions and add the corresponding pom.xml entry

25894559
put	get
so for editing seeds in my version i need first to get glossary then glossdiv after i delete seeds and put new seeds with new value

25894568
libstdc++	libc++
libc++ does not implement many of the libstdc++ library extensions and also not temporary_buffer

25894588
wsimport	xjc
xjc options could be passed to wsimport

25894596
std	ostream
std ostream and std wostream are just specializations of a template class std basic_ostream

25894641
ubuntu	mint
now i moved to mint 17 ubuntu based and the background of eclipse s editor is now gray instead of white

25894683
getter	setter
just getter and setter and a default constructor

25894722
qcombobox	qstring
i tried to do this with connect but qcombobox on currenttextchanged emits only qstring with a new value

25894728
getter	setter
so i have three classes in the first class i make a serializable of departments where i make a setter and getter of id names and localization

25894769
folder	directory
personally i use named platforms such as application and setup in my slns so that when tfs archives the drop folder one class of files goes into one directory structure and another class of files goes into another

25894770
apache	nginx
with tools such an nginx apache 2.4 s event mpm or gevent which can be used with gunicorn these are asynchronous meaning a process can handle hundreds of requests whilst not blocking

25894792
folder	dir
may depend on how you invoke pybot working dir in command prompt or which folder you open in ride

25894813
min	max
the only way i could achieve a zoomable secondary y axis was to change the max and min of the secondary y axis to change when the axis view changes

25894820
spaces	delimiter
the main issue i am having is that the delimiter is spaces and then i want to treat everything that is within a double quotes as an argument but what if one of these arg contains quotes within quotes

25894984
put	get
as far as i understand the usual way to get a notification on a state change is to put a callback on the event like in this answer

25895021
stdout	stderr
you could use stdout stderr in php to split the output see stackoverflow question php cli doesn #39

25895058
addition	multiplication
the reason you re seeing similar initial output from nextdouble given similar seeds is that because the computation of the next integer only involves a multiplication and addition the magnitude of the next integer is not much affected by differences in the lower bits

25895065
nsoperationqueue	nsblockoperation
alternatively you can put a bunch of nsblockoperation s in an nsoperationqueue

25895101
width	height
the first two indices are the width and height

25895101

25895156
children	parent
all of my data classes inherit from this visited class and the visited class also exposes some simple functions for basic data all my objects need name parent etc and methods for managing the child list - which is exposed by the children method used above

25895182
overwrite	preserve
note that by calling querychannel a new scope is introduced that preserve the channel_id from being overwrite by the next loop pass

25895218
spaces	delimiter
you might have to modify the regex to capture all the spaces and special characters that can make up a delimiter

25895235
put	get
one is when i put before i get this error

25895235
put	get
the other is when i put before i get the following error

in prestashop root directory you should have a mails folder

25895276
folder	directory
inside the mail directory should be language folder

25895296
bufferedinputstream	zipinputstream
yes an exception in new zipinputstream or new bufferedinputstream would leak the enclosed streams unless you do a cascading check in the exception handling

25895296
bufferedinputstream	zipinputstream
however since bufferedinputstream and zipinputstream are mere wrapper around the fileinputstream the probability of an exception is rather low

25895322
hide	show
it seems the exact opposite problem to here - hide a button from layout in java swing - where is complaining that hidden buttons do still take up space but there s no sample code there to show it working in that way

25895330
inherited	properties
so basically you re changing the type of a properties you inherited which causes the compiler to complain

25895351
width	height
as for combobox the width is properly adjusted but height remains the same

25895391
post	get
single post get from the api

25895880
accessor	properties
the verbiage in the page says that if you have a field may be private and a properties def brake then the properties will add the accessor methods for that field instead of creating a new private field

25895941
apache	nginx
i don t want to use some heavy artillery like vagrant and nginx apache

25895974
int	boolean
if i had a byte instead of an int i could easily create a boolean array with 256 positions and check

25896015
button	checkbox
the 0 field could be checkbox but then the style wouldn t be the same as the radio button

25896016
int	chars
iterate over the chars of the strings and print them as int numbers where you will see the difference

25896079
post	get
i think that for get and post functions you need to use the url game.php

width	margin	width	height	margin	height
so if you designed for 480x800 in windows phone 8 and now you want to migrate to windows phone 8.1 you need to multiple all your hardcoded constants height width fontsize margin by 0.8 to achieve the same size of screen element for new minimal effective resolution

stdout	stderr
in both the log file and stdout one of the early examples in the cookbook does exactly this except with stderr

25897257
getter	setter
therefore we need a public getter and setter for the int value in the original class now named testobject and int now called num because i made the variable private visible only to the class

25897257
getter	setter
now that the getter and setter are created the second class now named testobject2 can call the getter from testobject to retrieve the int value

but double is not a super-type of int the common supertype instead is anyval

25897894
int	double
try casting the int result to a double instead

25897905
int	double
because you explicitly provide that the return type is double scalac resolves its common supertype as anyval because int and double are subtypes of anyval

25897905
int	double
in your second case scalac sees a type ascription so it correctly infers b1 and then casts int to double

25897908

also you can remove multiple classes within the switchclass method using spaces as the delimiter

25898745
submit	submission
my original idea was to add the blob url directly as value of a hidden form input and get the audio to the controller and carrierwave through a form submission the same way you can use remote_file_url to submit a link to a remote file rather than uploading a local file

b1 is taken as anyval because that is the lub of a int and double

25898862
int	double
the spec explains case 3 methods that the args are typechecked with the expected type of the param which is why you get the conversion to double there instead of having the method return an int that is widened to double in the assignment

hash	salt
it s a little larger than the typical 64 byte salt 512 byte hash and 1 000 or 2 000 iterations but then again login speed and app performance is an extremely low priority

decimal	ieee
the choice of 17 digits used for the repr in python versions prior to 2.7 is far from arbitrary by the way two distinct ieee 754 binary64 floats will have distinct representations when converted to decimal with 17 significant digits and 17 is the smallest integer with this property.

for-loop	loops
i would like to do the above without a for-loop or any kind of loops to be honest

for-loop	arrays
now at the end of the for-loop you have a list of 5 double values one for each day that you can use as a normal arrays

uitableview	reloaddata
i was using uitableview s tableview estimatedheightforrowatindexpath to return my minimum cell height and it seems that the tableview uses this inside reloaddata to create an idea of how big the content is before actually dequeuing the cells and caching their height

25900125
post	get
i am going to be revisiting the pages that are slow in an effort to minimize the number of requests of this type that are made by implementing some things with a more client side approach and possibly by implementing a post redirect get structure for these pages as well however this will take time and will only make the issue less frequent.

you generally take for granted that most if not all of those basic operations comparison swapping math like addition or subtraction etc. are constant time which lets you translate almost directly from operation count the actual complexity to time consumed

25900169
equals	gethashcode
you could provide your own override of gethashcode and equals if you truly intend that in all cases two items are equals if the two properties are equals

25900170
typedef	struct
pytypeobject is a typedef for struct _typeobject so we have

25900173
put	get
so you need to put the regex system into utf-8 mode in order to get it to recognize your character encoding

25900183
serializable	deserialization
if you include something that isn t serializable you have to declare it transient and deal with its absence upon deserialization or you have to create a custom serializable format

there are three streams for primitives intstream of int longstream of long doublestream of double and a generic stream for objects

25900284
accessor	properties
there was a period in the evolution of objective-c when properties were very helpful in managing memory -- if you used a properties s accessor everywhere you could worry a lot less about when to retain and when to release something because the accessor would do that for you

25900292
dictionary	map
the main difference is that dictionary is an abstract class and map is a interface

25900311

25900365
dictionary	map
dictionary is an abstract class whereas map is an interface hence it is more java-idiomatic

25900537
post	get
with this approach it does not matter how many parameters contains post or get you simply filter them through foreach loop and getting clean arrays with parameters also you can make it a function that returning array.and then you just need to check if_array_key_exests and do your things

25900580
maven	pom.xml
there is a maven dependency which you don t have in your pom.xml

if subclassing are allowed to set them directly they could violate the contracts of the superclass by setting invalid values

25900816
superclass	subclassing
and if the subclassing differ only in the values of those superclass fields then you shouldn t use subclassing at all

25900832

in the end it does not matter which technology you re going to use but i would suggest web service created in perl php python ruby running under apache nginx web server and just send a http request through android and receive the values

25900892
superclass	subclassing
therefore if you have a superclass that has common fields with subclassing then you should take a second look at your architecture

25900892
superclass	subclassing
to solve your problem remove any redundant fields that are in the subclassing but already exist in the superclass

25900910
hide	show
then you add css for styling the show and hide classes

dbcontext	objectcontext
i know i can use objectcontext instead but i like the features of dbcontext dbset

25901205
next	except
i don t think you need to care about any commits except the latest one since this git repo lives in the directory so its going to be lost next time the recipe cleans or is ignored for the next temporary build directory if you update your variable

25901257
switching	screens
and then when i want to switching to the login screens i do this

25901278

25901420
post	get
i m following the web api rest with symfony2 to build a rest api in symfony2 using fosrestbundle and jms serializer and for get routes works perfectly but not with post because when i m validating the form always returns false and even i followed the flow of the functions and in the last step returns true in form- isvalid so i m confused

i have a sample code which creates an arrays of size 10 and tries to initialize it with reverse values in a for-loop e.g 9 8 7 6 5...0

25901554
for-loop	arrays
when i use the regular for-loop to print the arrays it works normally

hide	show
the problem now that i need to show dialog before them and hide them after all data finished

25901809
int	double
but you re right that rounding errors are a potential problem hereâ which is why both nix and python avoid the problem by using separate seconds and nanoseconds int and windows solves it by using a 64-bit int instead of a double

25901825
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
if you have a uinavigationcontroller and pushed a couple uiviewcontroller s the interactivepopgesturerecognizer steals the swipe from anywhere on the screen

25902014
notepad++	sublimetext
notepad++ was giving the tab space correct but the indentation problem was finally found in sublimetext editor

25902021
portrait	landscape
you need to insert a section break before and after the table so the sections before and after can be portrait and the intervening section containing your table can be set to landscape

25902037
maven	pom.xml
it looks good - i like the dynamic aspect of columns without a pre-designed xml file - but this is silly that my maven intellij project cannot resolve these simple apis via the pom.xml

25902067
rspec	capybara
i m just getting started with feature specs using rspec and capybara

25902081

25902195
dbcontext	objectcontext
i just wonder if there exist ways to keep dbcontext objectcontext alive

25902200

nofollow	noindex
i m doing all development in the development site and every time that the development get pushed to production i need to make sure i change noindex nofollow to index follow

25902262
post	get
you could for example post the form to a server-side script with hardcoded users there and the viewer wouldn t be able to view source to get the info

25902267
portrait	landscape
most likely you re looking for 320x480 if your app is in portrait or 480x320 if your app is in landscape

25902335
width	height
as a consequence you cannot add top level constraints to the view width and height

25902336
width	height
if the view needs an intrinsic content size either override intrinsiccontentsize or define its width and or height via the nib file by simply add a sizing subview that is pinned to the top level view s the static view s top bottom trailing and leading constraints and has a width and or height constraint

25902336
uiview	subviews
dragging in a uiview from the object library as a subviews of another view produces a constrainable view even if you don t define any constraints

25902336
uiview	subviews
drag a uiview into another to create a subviews

25902336
width	height
delete all its top level constraints delete its width height constraints

25902343
serializable	deserialization
if your data does not allow characters from the unicode control picture block you can maintain human readability by substituting them for control characters upon serializable and back again upon deserialization

25902406
octal	decimal
so in my above example v3700 is in octal so it is actually 0x7c0 or 1984 decimal

25902406
octal	decimal
even if the octal part is too much and decimal values are all that will work i am okay with that

25902460
dictionary	map
i would suggest to define your regular expressions in a dictionary and map them to their respective descriptions

25902460
for-loop	loops
break breaks out of the innermost for-loop - in this case loops that checks all the defined patterns against the current code

but when i look at the results of the bcrypt function it appears that the salt is concatenated to the hash not the password

25902554
fflush	gets
it gets fflush to the real log buffer either when a newline arrives or when a different task printk s

25902585
textview	imageview
you d need at least an extra viewgroup framelayout around the textview for the counter and the imageview for the background to make sure they are positioned above each other meaning you d replace one textview by three other views

25902634
put	get	post	get	post	put
this seems to work fine but i don t see a way to register fixtures separately for each type of request put get post delete etc

25902676

otherwise it will be a candidate for swift s optimization inline or vtable the method which will make it invisible to objective-c

25902693
margin	font-size
the uneven xheight on the h1 strapline - caused by a positioning margin and the relationship between line-height and font-size messing with the xheight which can be seen in the inspector margin 30px 0

25902694
margin	font-size
was simply removing the margin in the css and positioning using line-height with a corresponding font-size instead

25902703
int	chars
that are int constants enumeration constants chars constants sizeof

25902727
ant	maven
i m trying to include the maven dependencies files while build war file through ant

25902747
google-chrome	firefox
i have also tried accessing the page through both firefox and google-chrome with the same results

25902752
int	double
your code is correct so i would double check to see if your field is a int

you aren t making use of the getter and setter referred to in your instructions as accessor and mutators functions the instructions asked you to use

25903097
put	get
i put that in just to try it and so now i get this error

25903114
do.call	lapply
use do.call with rbind and lapply for more simple and compact solution

25903164
udp	tcp
in contrast to udp tcp is not a protocol that allows sending of individual messages which get delivered to the receiver in the same form

25903164
sctp	udp
if you need that add size information as suggested by stephen cleary or use a protocol like udp or if you need reliability sctp

25903164
sctp	tcp
which however looks like overkill unless you are also interested in sctp s other improvements over tcp

25903178
onclick	onchange
that is most likely because event listeners onclick onchange and friends are only triggered on user actions not when you change some state programmatically

25903242

i want to put all the numbers i get from while loop into a list

25903272

i have a map view page in my project which contains google map.in my full view map container takes 70 width and 30 width of side container which is the list view corresponding to the map markers.side container having an arrow button in the right corner whenever i click on the button side container should hide and map container should show in the full view from 70 to 100 without moving the map

25903466
int	double
i would suggest reading the value as a double multiplying it by a hundred perhaps adding a small delta like 0.001 so as to avoid potential floating point precision problems then placing that into an int

25903471
hide	show
inside the click handler you can check whether the current item is already visible or not if it is visible then toggle will hide it so we can show the default item assuming there will be only 1 item visible at any time

25903497
post	get
your misspelling causes the server use the default get method to post the data for reference see here

25903504
getter	setter
i tried to follow directions as best as possible but when i look at my compiled classes using a decompiler they do not have any of the generated getter or setter

25903504
getter	setter
however if i try to use the getter or setter i get a compile time error that no such method exists

25903504
getter	setter
what i find odd is that the getter and setter annotations are removed implying that there is some processing occurring on my files

25903504
getter	setter
but the getter setter aren t being generated

25903508
led	electronics
if you know enough about electronics you can control an ir led with the headphone output

25903526

25903556
children	parent
if i submit a delete request on the grandparent s key the grandparent entity is deleted but its children and grandchildren remain and their path is still grandparent parent child even though the grandparent entity was deleted

25903583
explode	implode
to allow the user to input multiple words firstly take a look at the problems of sql injection but assuming you re using php you can explode an input string and implode the resulting array like this

25903590
printf	fgetc	printf	feof	printf	fgets	fseek	fread	fseek	ftell	fseek	fgetc	ftell	fread	feof	fread	feof	ftell	feof	fseek	feof	fgetc	fgets	fread	fgets	feof	fgets	ftell	fgets	fseek	fgets	fgetc	fgetc	fread	fgetc	ftell
fopen fclose fwrite fread ftell fseek printf fscanf feof fileno fgets fputs fgetc fputc

25903612
width	height
in the chrome developer view inspecting that button shows that the height and width are set to 30px yet the button is still tiny

25903624
int	chars
firstly the argument passing convention may mean int s are passed differently to s secondly sizeof int may not equal and finally even if printf extracts 32 as a at best it will just print random garbage from memory address 32 onwards until it coincidentally hits a nul chars - far more likely the process will lack permissions to read some of that memory and the program will crash

25903634
int	double
if for whatever reason you don t want to use a bigdecimal you can cast your double to an int to truncate it

25903649
getter	setter
removing aspectj now shows properly generated setter getter

25903686
getter	setter
i just finished posting this issue on so about lombok not generating my getter setter

25903686
getter	setter
if i disable aspectj then the getter setter are appropriately generated

hash	salt
there would be no security gain by storing hash and salt in different fields in the same database

25903873
hash	salt
i imagine that the creator decided to concat the two strings simply to keep the salt and hash together in a single field in the database or application

25903878
int	chars
hey i need help writing a program that will take a string and stretch out the chars in it by the factor of a passed int

multiplying	add
the typical way to draw with a texture or a color using a single shader is to set the one you re not using to white and multiplying or black and add

25904156
min	max
interesting way of going about teaching programming and i have a feeling this class is going to cause more stackoverflow questions to appear in the future but you can do it by combining max and min to make a function that returns either 1 or 0 depending on whether its input is negative

25904156
min	max
this function takes a number rounds it down with then the combination of max and min bounds the number to be between -1 and 0 then subtracts that result from 1

25904156
min	max
this works because it s just taking advantage of max and min s built-in conditional functionality to do conditional arithmetic

25904156
division	addition
the outer addition by 1 and then division by 2 turns this into 0 for negatives and 1 for positives and zero

25904176
stdout	stderr
the dots are printed to dev tty since your want to redirect both stdout and stderr

25904212
retaincount	dealloc
the thought was that the array would keep the retaincount alive until it could be removed from the array on the background thread and then i could guarantee the cost of the dealloc wouldn t happen on the main thread

25904213
uisearchbar	uisearchcontroller
the documentation for uisearchcontroller says that you can override - searchbar to provide a custom subclass of uisearchbar for the controller to use

it s not obvious but if you run sh.addtagrange with the same minimum in your case 1 or 100 and a different maximum then the existing tag range with that minimum value will change essentially functioning as an in-place update the addtagrange helper basically runs an upsert based on the _id field and with some sanity checking which can be seen by running it without parentheses

25914489
range	minimum	range	min
to alter a tag range minimum this won t work - you need to remove and re-add or you need to manually update the _id.min field in the sub-document as well as the min field in the top level document to avoid the inconsistency you are seeing

dictionary	map
on the other hand if you load the name age map once and it then remains stable and you need to do multiple lookups based on age then the reversed dictionary is potentially much more efficient than a solution that iterates through the name age dictionary for each search

for various reasons i need to have zoom locked on ipad to show the full width of the page in both portrait and landscape modes

25916993
portrait	landscape
this code works fine for the initial page rendering and even if i reorient the device during the page rendering but if i reorient the device after the page is rendered it fails miserably the landscape page is scaled at 0.75 and the portrait page is scaled at 1.0

25916993
portrait	landscape
unfortunately a bug or more likely a mis-feature in mobile safari messes this up when a device is rotated from portrait to landscape mode

25916999

a common trick i often use name your usercontrol that way you can easily bind to it s properties in this case the width and height of the outermost grid control

25917450
dictionary	map
you want all permutation between all of table dictionary values so you can use itertools module for find that which is more pythonic and map and join functions to concatenate them

25917456

bower	npm
for example npm allows for nested js and nested versions bower makes the entire dependency tree into flat siblings

25917886
bower	npm
that said bower is powered by nodejs so it makes sense that npm would be the method for getting access to bower

25917924
openbsd	ifconfig
but openbsd has no such manager so i came to use and like the standard ifconfig method

profiling	debugging
that path is the same regardless of what i build for - running debugging testing debugging or profiling release

25918883
profiling	debugging
my problem is when i build for profiling release the paths to the frameworks are still the debugging paths and thus the release version of the app links to debugging frameworks and the debugging frameworks get bundled into app- contents- frameworks via a copy files build phase

25918883
profiling	debugging
even worse if i do a clean or delete the derived data directory and try to build for profiling release it will not build or run because the referenced files debugging do not exist
