margin	height
edit sorry if you set the bottom padding margin of the div to the height of the footer plus the height of the gap you re trying to achieve it should work

14400013
google-chrome	firefox
now to the problem on firefox wmode window google-chrome works fine for reasons unknown the mouseevent is fired continuously until the cursor is moved out of the canvas handling the wheel event

14400060
maven	pom.xml
groupid and artifactid denote a single project within maven but version must be specified or inherited from a parent pom.xml in order to determine what version of that project maven needs to reference

14400088
getter	setter
you can either use getter and setter in your model class

14400108
width	height
you can then set a different font size when the p or div is within different height and width ranges

14400125
hide	show
consecutive show hide calls produces a bug animation stops and does not resume sometimes

14400140
width	height
i m trying to create a two column site the left column is a fixed width but it s the height i am struggling with

14400143
jwindow	jdialog
you need to have a jdialog or jframe visible on the screen and then you can wrap it with a jwindow

14400143
jwindow	jdialog
or you may use jdialog or jframe directly instead of jwindow

14400213
superclass	subclassing
the state belonging to the object s superclass or subclassing

14400233
width	height
you seem to be initialising your footer view with a width and height of 44px yet adding the label outside of its bounds

14400270
hide	show
i want to show a dialog for a while for instance 2 seconds when some event happened like when sms received and after 2 seconds it hide automatically

14400295
youtube	vimeo
does anyone know how to dynamically resize the dimensions of the video embedded from say youtube vimeo etc. and images in the mobile version of the website developed with jquery mobile

14400326
public	protected
there is no hard rule as to what should be private public or protected

14400335
actionscript	haxe
haxe wiki is a language meant to be easily transcoded to multiple languages amongst which javascript and flash actionscript

14400358
getter	setter
since you say that you know the theory and other answers have dug into the meaning of public private getter and setter i d like to focus myself on the why of using accessors instead of creating public attributes member data in c++

14400358
getter	setter
you can forget about getter and setter in personal small projects though i d try to make myself used to them

14400365
width	height
and you obviously want to keep the width of the textbox and only change the height of it

14400377
cassini	iis
one approach is to leave the project settings as they are i m assuming that you re using iis and everyone else is using cassini or iis express but create a website within your local iis

14400385
public	protected
i am observing different behavior when i am using protected and public access specifier

14400400
submit	submission
if you want to submit the form via ajax instead of submission and loading the action url you can do this using jquery s serialize function

14400454
hide	show
remove the .stop this will queue the show and execute it after the hide concludes

14400454
hide	show
if the element is partially show it will hide it ensuring that .show executes instead of being ignored due to the element being considered visible

14400491
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
when ever i have checked the checkbox i want to get the value of the dropdownlistfor that is selected

14400513
getter	setter
public variables or trivial setter and getter suggest that the design hasn t been thought through sufficiently resulting in an agglomeration of weak abstractions that don t abstract much of anything

14400600
getter	setter
my combobox es work but i don t know how to recover the element with my getter and setter of my object motif

14400619
getter	setter
from an oop point of view getter setter help with encapsulation and should therefore always be used

14400619
getter	setter
when you call a getter setter the class can do whatever it wants behind the scenes and the internals of the class are not exposed to the outside

14400619
getter	setter
when you access a public variable you know exactly what you get when you use a getter setter you have no idea

14400619
getter	setter
especially if you only do a small project spending your time writing getter setter and adjusting them all accordingly when you decide to change your variable name type .

14400619
getter	setter
c++ code commonly doesn t use getter setter when they don t provide real gain

14400653
postgresql	mysql
as for migrations the rails core team worked very hard to have migrations compatible with all the different databases from postgresql to mysql to even oracle

14400718
for-loop	arrays
the issue seems to be that the animation only happens to the third item in the for-loop arrays i m assuming because of the settimeout delay

14400767
pop-up	dialog
after submitting the form a file-save dialog pop-up asking me where to save the file

14400773
maven	pom.xml
to do that you first need to configure a maven repository server i recommend using apache archiva and then point your pom.xml and settings.xml to the server

14400831
put	get
i put this code in my environment.rb file and i get this

14400856
tolower	toupper
i want a solution to this problem that does not involve toupper or tolower as i use in the code below

14400899
mousemove	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mouseup	mousedown
so in other words i would need a behaviour where i can have the handle class active when clicking on it however still active on first mouseup then dragging it with mousemove without actually holding the mousedown and on other click it will drop

14400968
portrait	landscape
this app has only portrait mode without landscape mode support

14400993
matplotlib	scipy
when spyder starts it automatically imports a long list of modules including things from matplotlib numpy scipy etc

14401031
post	put
the truth is request.method always returns post no matter for a put or post request and no matter the controller method is a default update or a custom one

14401183
pascal	delphi
pascal inlined function calls result are bogus - delphi did not called them detecting they had no side-effects

14401190
post	get
i have been trying post a value back to the controller so i can update a balance elsewhere but i cannot get it to work

14401220
versioning	upgrade
so the first logical step would be to upgrade your stata to a versioning that can handle larger datasets

14401235
firefox	safari
it works fine in firefox ie8 safari and even ie6

14401238
ssl	https
youtube allows videos to be downloaded via ssl with a simple https prefix

14401249
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
check google-chrome safari ie and firefox all should work as expected the two empty should be gone

14401281
width	height
i decided to filter out some regions based on aspect ratio the ratio between the width and the height

14401282
uilabel	uitextview
just call below method and pass either uilabel or uitextview

14401385
screens	tablet
if you support multiple screens sizes and you set the sizes of this imageview for a tablet to 500x500dp scale your image near to this size

14401444
screens	tablet
so when your game launches it asks the phone or tablet for its screens resolution calculates what the scale factor should be for this particular instance and stores it and then you just have to look that up when you draw things and use it to convert

14401522
inherited	subclassing
don t inherited from typesobjectlistmodel of apple and subclassing only fruitsmodel

14401540
width	height
initial position 0 0 falls in the center bottom of the marker so i offset the image by half of it s width and height

14401556
afnetworking	sdwebimage
the simple fix is to retire icondownloader and all of the scrolling decelerating logic and just use the uiimageview category from either sdwebimage or afnetworking

14401622
free	malloc
also you have allocated memory for read char dynamically using malloc in free that memory in main

14401642
width	height
if you use any of layout panels you should use only layout panels throughout the hierarchy if you are setting the width and height in percentages starting from rootlayoupanel

14401648
border-color	background-color
currently you have it as all but it needs to be either background-color or border-color based on which you want to be transitioned

14401671
width	height
this would resize your stage to the width and height of your window but this would not account for the possibility that elements would be farther than your window but you can just modify the number inside the .set functions to account for the farthest right left one

14401681
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in google-chrome and firefox but returns extra results in ie

14401753
opera	firefox
other browsers firefox ie opera work fine if i explicitly give a width 110 to the image tag

14401776
uiview	subviews
one solution is to set both button2 and button3 as a subviews in another uiview and animate the view instead of each of the buttons separately

14401809
google-chrome	firefox
but this does not occur in firefox or google-chrome

14401819
min	max
in order to have 18 on left and 0 on right you can maybe specify the min and max value of your xaxis

14401821
width	height
each li has a width and height of 40px and a background image

14401822
hide	show
use show and hide

14401853
jobs	cron
i have a whm cpanel account and each hosting account that is created requires a list of cron jobs to be entered in cpanel

14401877
hide	show
try to use show hide instead

14401908
google-chrome	firefox
another strange thing is that this behavior always happens with firefox but with google-chrome it is typically ok

14401911
inherited	subclassing
don t inherited from typesobjectlistmodel of apple and subclassing only fruitsmodel

14401939
pop-up	dialog
i build a tree with qt double click a node in the tree a dialog pop-up edit it and then click okay

14401951
post	get
that s why i was using the iframe method and previously using get instead of post

14401987
width	height
you can try assigning the float width height to the image s container in this case the

14401993
pull	push
i would like to be able to push non-graphics code to both branches and pull just the code for one os

14402028
int	chars
this is telling you what s happening the compiler thinks you are manually pointing p to a specific memory location using the value of the chars returns as an int

14402045
width	height
i m getting a the method getheight from the type display is deprecated error when trying to get the height and width of the screen size code

14402075
gridbaglayout	boxlayout
if you don t wish to use a complex layout manager such as gridbaglayout you could use boxlayout which uses the component s preferred sizes

14402077
gridbaglayout	miglayout	gridbaglayout	boxlayout	boxlayout	miglayout
reimeus gave you an example of gridbaglayout and boxlayout and i would like to recommend you miglayout which is quite easy to use

14402140
udp	tcp
of course tcp would be the better choice but if you only have udp option i d wrap the data into a structure with sequence and buf_length field

14402153
mouseup	mousedown
in jquerymobile as long as you do a mousedown and mouseup on an element it is considered a click

14402208
google-chrome	firefox
why it doesn t work on google-chrome and working on firefox and ie

14402251
hide	show
what i wish to do is hide show the markers based on their time stamp relative to the slider value

14402251
hide	show
i attempted to use .setmap null .setmap map for my hide and show but this returns an undefined error on .setmap

14402251
hide	show
if i only use .setmap null if works fine and hide them but this is a one way street as i can not show them again without .setmap map

14402264
maven	pom.xml
either add the log4j class to your classpath as smcg has stated or add the following into your project pom.xml if you re using maven

14402293
ant	maven	jar	war
if you want to organize your jars either look at ant maven or at eclipse s build path and deployment assembly to automatically put the jar files which are organized elsewhere in web-inf lib folder of the built war

14402298
prepare	execute
the problem here is that statement_2 is prepare time and time again instead of merely being execute with different parameters

14402298
prepare	execute
i don t know if statement_2 could also be prepare before entering the loop so it is only execute and not prepare as its parameters are changed in the loop as happens with statement_1

14402298
prepare	execute
in that case you d end up with several statements being prepare first each of them to be execute in the loop that follows

14402323
rubygems	rvm
read rvm and rubygems especially the part that says

14402352
g++	gcc
you are compiling with gcc g++ 4.7 where the reference to pthreads have changed to glibcxx_has_gthreads so boost is unable to find pthreads and disable it

14402376
rspec	capybara
notably we changed the type that capybara assumes your specs run under in rspec to feature previously it was request

14402378
inherited	properties
in case of inherited a protected method or properties exposes the base class

14402387
prepare	execute
one single query prepare once execute once fetching all the data you need

14402398
getter	setter
i don t want to use getter and setter functions because they are wordy and annoying

14402401
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
uinavigationcontroller -- rootviewcontroller uiviewcontroller -- uitableviewcontroller -- detailviewcontroller uiviewcontroller

14402411
profiling	instrumentation
next choose profiling which will open instrumentation and allow you to choose what you would like to profiling -

14402413
ciimage	uiimage
i have a uiimage which is loaded from a ciimage with

14402413
ciimage	uiimage
if the uiimage object was initialized using a ciimage object the value of the property is null

14402416
postgresql	mysql
both tested in sql-fiddle test-1 works in all 4 postgresql sql-server oracle mysql except the 2nd query which doesn t run in postgresql

14402461
put	get
my only reason to put the line there is to get a clean look

14402493
put	get
how i can get id text_msg1 and put it into onclick

14402543
children	parent
in common practice if an item has some children checked and others unchecked the parent will show a checked+grayed state

14402543
children	parent
since in your implementation whenever an item is checked you check all its parent and also all its children so it could be that calling treeviewer.setchecked on parent in windows starts throwing events also and your listener gets called that checks all the children of all the parent hence everything gets enabled

14402560
google-chrome	firefox
i have removed the unnecessary margin from my work but am still interested to know why google-chrome is not collapsing the vertical margin when firefox and ie does

14402563
google-chrome	firefox
it all works fine in firefox google-chrome etc but in internet explorer the winow pops up ok but the gallery wont work unless you right click on the iframe and click refresh at which point everything works fine

14402600
ilist	icollection
side note change your ilist to an icollection

14402607
post	put
put versus post is not really about replace versus create but rather about idempotency and resource naming

14402607
put	get	post	get	post	put
now if you are taking the policy position that clients should never create resource names you then get post being the perfect fit for creation though theoretically it could do anything based on the supplied entity and put being how to do update

14402607
post	put
if the model being presented to the user was of a file system having the user supply the resource name makes a huge amount of sense and put becomes the main creation operation and post becomes delegated to less common things like making an empty directory and so on

14402607
post	put
put is really create-or-update and post is really do-anything-which-shouldnt-be-repeated-willy-nilly

14402622
post	put
- on iis enable post verb on static elements i don t know how to do and it s a trick to put up on all the iis i might use

14402651
getter	setter
ide can create getter and setter for you

14402690
lwjgl	slick2d
i am using lwjgl and slick2d

14402696
post	get
and without it server can try give a get request from you despite on conn.setrequestmethod post

14402728
ciimage	cifilter
also since you have a ciimage to begin with you could use cifilter to actually crop your image

14402756
int	chars
what i have in this method is an attempt to first check if the first chars can be an int and if it is i want to see how far that number will go in the input so if the user inputted 455+60 i d want to pull out the 455 and stop at the +

14402768
implements	extends
the state will implements statebase and internally declare a custom view which itself needs to extends iview

14402769
inherited	subclassing
see this example note it is separate classes fluent nhibernate automap inherited with subclassing relationship

14402828
button	checkbox
this has a checkbox in the details section and a command button in the footer

14402828
button	checkbox
this way the user can use the checkbox to select multiple records then click the command button at the button to run a script which updates the selected records

14402907
int	chars
if the value p being boxed is true false a byte a chars in the range u0000 to u007f or an int or short number between -128 and 127 then let r1 and r2 be the results of any two boxing conversions of p

14402907
int	chars
less memory-limited implementations might for example cache all chars and shorts as well as int and longs in the range of -32k - +32k

14402936
folder	directory
while searching around i realized that the gwt version was missing a file from inside the gwt-dev folder inside the gwt installation directory

14402968
post	get
hence we turn off model validation for the get request just make sure you validate the post request

14402997
mouseleave	mouseenter
as for js use mouseenter and mouseleave instead of hover

14403008
eventlet	gevent
you can however tell it to spawn processes that use gevent eventlet or tornado instead

14403008
eventlet	gevent
if you change the default worker class to gevent or eventlet or tornado you also get a lot more performance out of each process

14403031
mouse	keyboard
in that method you ll receive all mouse and keyboard events as well as window focus events

14403059
action-filter	onactionexecuting
all you need to do is to check the role at the onactionexecuting method of your action-filter

14403065
public	protected
here is the demo which turns public protected and private to red when typing just like a simple code editor

14403084
int	double
also you should use int variable instead of double for this case

14403092
awt	swing
i ve tried to use only thread it throws exception i forgot what the exception was but basically it says that i can t manipulate the swing component from non awt thread or something

14403108
pop-up	dialog
this setting s default value changed with update 11 of java 7 and it interferes with operation of an automated-test program which i am fixing now by having a security warning dialog window pop-up when ie starts java.exe unless this java control panel setting is adjusted a priori

14403173
requestfactory	gwt
i was searching for a complete simple example about logged user handling with gwt requestfactory

14403173
client-side	server-side
but i can t imagine how to build the complete client-side server-side requestfactory invocation response catching

14403187
equals	gethashcode
i would like to use a class as key in a dictionary which does not override equals nor gethashcode

14403224
folder	directory
after right clicking on the src directory in eclipse selecting build path and then use as source folder

14403280
equals	gethashcode
the equality comparer must implement equals and gethashcode

14403306
java.util.calendar	java.util.date
i have had to switch from java.util.date to java.util.calendar for utc reasons and now i cannot reproduce the above date

14403337
maven	pom.xml
i want to place a readme.md and maybe some other files next to the pom.xml of the project that is created by the maven archetype plugin

14403361
dictionary	map
i understand that your sortby string is not the field name but that s the easy part of the problem which you can solve by using a dictionary to map the sortby string to fieldname

14403374
getter	setter
another benefit of getter and setter is that if you are using an ide like eclipse or netbeans you can use the ide s functionality to search for every place in the codebase where the function is called

14403374
getter	setter
the getter setter functions would grab this mutex before accessing or modifying the variable

14403410
try-catch	exception-handling
check array length before you access its element and use using try-catch block to safely handle the exception-handling

14403430
hide	show
if you want to show and hide it from codebehind then you can use modalpopupname.show and modalpopupname.hide

14403430
hide	show
there is a sample that i found in this link that show and hide a modal popup based on a condition

14403506
inherited	subclassing	implements	extends
maps usually extends the abstractmap class that itself implements map making the subclassing inherited those methods

14403509
int	double
i know that it would be better to stick with structures if i have fixed size data like int double etc.

14403532
hide	show	fadein	hide
i am working on a jquery plugin that hide all the elements within a container and then show them over a set interval using either fadein or by jquery s animate function

14403551
jstl	taglib
you could consider to use some taglib jstl

14403572
puts	gets
the below script gets user info and date of birth and then puts these info a file called â œbirthday.csvâ

14403575
children	parent
you can either transverse your table using the find method for finding children and closest for finding parent and next for finding the next element

14403576
int	double
i know that it would be better to stick with structures if i have fixed size data like int double etc

14403583
children	parent
split your data into two tables parent and children

14403583
children	parent
parent should contain id and children should have at least two columns parent_id and child_value or smth like it with parent_id being id of a parent whether linked explicitly as foreign key db construct or not depending on database

14403583
children	parent
parsing should be trivial iterate line by line and on parent line change parent_id and insert into parent and read child rows as it goes and insert those into children table

14403623
post	get
i tried throwing a get line into my php to retrieve the same variable post would and that worked

14403635
google-chrome	firefox
i understand firefox google-chrome doesn t provide file path and ie provides with file path option enabled on that region

14403637
sorting	filtering
you just need to make sure you have proper indexes on the table for the columns you are going to filtering sort or join on and that you utilize the indexes when making your query only filtering sort or join on indexed fields and make sure you are not querying sorting on derived values from the table that would prohibit index use

14403637
many-to-many	one-to-many
express relations between objects using proper foreign keys for one-to-many relations or with join tables many-to-many relations

14403641
int	boolean
the boolean true converts to an int of value 1 which is assigned to m

14403648
cos	sin
you can get your new xposition by adding the center x position of your circle to the result of the cos inputting the radians we just got from before multiplied by the radius of your circle and the new yposition is obtained by doing the same thing just with sin instead

14403691
hash	salt
this works just as well as long as you can unambiguously tell the different hash formats apart and has the advantage that you can also include any other needed parameters such as the salt and the work factor for key stretching in the same string without having to add extra fields for each to your database

14403691
crypt	salt	crypt	hash	hash	salt
for example this is the approach typically used by modern unix crypt 3 implementations and the corresponding functions in various high-level languages like php a classic des-based and horribly weak password hash would look something like abjnggxhb ywi while a slightly more modern hash might look like where 1 specified the hashing method z75qousc is the salt and nnvpak1ftd0yvd62s3sjr1 the actual hash and the delimiter is chosen because it cannot appear in an old-style des hash

14403691
hash	md5
for example even a fairly old and weak cryptographic hash function like unsalted md5 would be good enough since its output depends on the entire input and has up to 128 bits of entropy which is more than almost any password will have and more than enough to withstand a brute force attack anyway

14403691
crypt	hash
on the other hand trying to apply this construction using the old des-based crypt 3 function as the old hash would be disastrous since old crypt 3 would ignore all but the first 8 characters of each password as well as the most significant bits of even those characters

14403694
ember.js	backbone.js
working well with all major client-side frameworks backbone.js ember.js angular

14403717
viewdidload	viewdidappear
i tried pasting the code from - void viewdidload to - void viewdidappear

14403724
udp	tcp
if you have to use udp to transfer a largish chunk of data then design a small application-level protocol that would handle possible packet loss and re-ordering that s part of what tcp does for you

14403724
udp	mtu
datagrams less then mtu plus ip and udp headers in size say 1024 bytes to avoid ip fragmentation

14403782
folder	directory
then you should be placing your assets folder in the same directory as the front controller index.php

14403782
folder	directory
if your application directory is below the web root it really should be you won t be able to load assets from that folder without a proxy script to load the file for you

14403802
width	height
i have an unordered list and some hyperlinked list items and i want to limit the width and height of the links list items to width 300px and height 1.5em

14403822
children	parent	lsp	principles
i think the liskov s substitution principles lsp is mainly about moving the implementation of functions that may differ to the children classes and leave the parent class as general as possible

14403822
lsp	principles
so whatever you change in the child class it does not break the liskov s substitution principles lsp as long as this change does not force you to modify the code in the parent class

14403864
hide	show
it just show or hide the tabs but with no animation at all

14403877
width	height
in this case the behavior of width and height properties changed and this is a violation of that rule

14403896
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i have a npapi plugin running in safari google-chrome and firefox

14403947
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
i should note too that this phenomenon seems to occur with firefox safari and opera

14403955
int	boolean
use int instead of int boolean instead of boolean if you really do not need to store in them null values

14404057

14413251
filtering	grouping
if you continue with using your own filtering solution as you ve already started doing and end up with something more comprehensive it d be worth mentioning it on the rest framework grouping so other folks can use it and so we can consider if it s worth pulling it together into a more easily re-useable 3rd party package

i think after you multiplying text coords by projection matrix you have to make a perspective division and move from 3d to 2d since the texture is 2d

14416031
apache	nginx
i have server with apache and nginx as proxy and in htaccess file i have clearly mentioned this code so that it can define server default charset to utf-8

post	get
shortly i will post a sample on github which will include some parameters tied to slider controls in the ios ui but you should get this version working first

14416390
noexcept	throw
i don t think it s a problem here because the only place in p_merge that can throw is inside a try block but you should also be aware that if an exception leaves the function run by std thread that will also call std terminate so it that s not what you want then you should pass noexcept functions or just non-throwing functions to std thread

14416408
put	get
the stockmodel.get setstockdata methods simply use reflection to get put the info back into the correct property

14416409

14416409
post	get
get the title of that post that i search or match with any other post meta value by ajax jquery-ajax

14416415
width	height
the idea is that you apply a series of transforms on the element which has overflow hidden in order to get a rhombus with an acute angle of 60 degrees and then you undo all those transforms in reverse order for a pseudo-element or a child element if you wish having the same height as the element itself but only .866 of its width because .866 is the ratio of the distance between two parallel sides of a hexagon and its big diagonal on which you actually apply the background-image

14416420

14416756
multiplying	subtract
multiplying the significand you get from math.frexp by 2 24 and subtract 24 from the exponent to compensate

14416790

14416803
pdostatement	bindvalue
instead of using bindvalue i just pass an array of parameter values to pdostatement execute which is much easier

14416806
goto	break
break jumps to the end of the innermost loop only and tcl has no goto

14416826
mouseleave	mouseenter
try using mouseenter and mouseleave instead

14416826

in my wpf application i use the console window as a debug message window - i have options setup to show and hide the window as the user desires and all that works great

14417037
int	double
in your case since int can be converted to double it converts your mixed list into a list double promoting your one int

14417037
int	double
tuple2 int string cannot automatically be promoted to tuple2 double string

14417077
int	double
however there is a mechanism called numeric widening which for example allows you to call a method that takes a double argument by passing in say an int

14417077
int	double
the int then is automatically widened to double

14417153
post	get
that said if you want to continue with has_and_belongs_to_many you need to somehow get the journal and post ids that you want to associate so you can correctly create the association

14417279
jobs	cron
now have long running processes or cron jobs or scheduled tasks check the queue regularly run the requested operation and email the result using ses back to the user

14417326
hide	fadeout	hide	show	fadein	fadeout	fadein	hide
animation animate fadein fadeout fadeto hide show etc

14417347
innodb	myisam
another possible reason is if you re not using innodb as the table engine otherwise those constraints are discarded with myisam

14417400
for-loop	arrays
this should be done with arrays instead of btn1 you would have btn and then you can access them with a for-loop

i stumbled onto this solution on my own while trying to figure out how to do something similar without resorting to tables make the central element s height 100 but then set the box-sizing model to border-box so that the height includes not only the content within the box but also the borders around the box make the top and bottom borders really thick like say 20px then use fixed positioning to overlay the header and footer over the crazy-thick top and bottom borders of the central element

so to summarize where in the rails directory if not the public templates folder should i put the templates that are retrieved by the get function in this code so that they can be retrieved on heroku

14420261
moq	nmock
and try to see if you can replace nmock with moq

14420352

14420767
hex	binary
storing it in a binary column or even just storing it in a varchar in hex format would be much more appropriate

14420774
objectdatasource	detailsview
this is because the dropdownlist has an objectdatasource outside the detailsview that it s inside of

14420912
public	protected
of the supertype s public protected and if accessible package

14420912
serializable	deserialization
so you will need to implement writeobject and readobject in b to handle the serializable deserialization of a.aa

i thought it was setuptools turns out it s pyinstaller

14420966

14421302
waitpid	fork
now c1 gets the input fork s c2 and waitpid s for it

14421302

61 the remaindering operation performed when a value of integer type is converted to unsigned type need not be performed when a value of real floating type is converted to unsigned type

14426295
width	height
to decrease overhead it might be wise to put these graphics in a single sprite sheet and store the x y width and height of each item like this

14426295
width	height
where the array is x y width height

14426295
width	height
the other way you can go about it is to draw the graphics with canvas drawing functions in which you could specify a x y width height for say a helmet then you draw the helmet at any size that you wish

equals	gethashcode
since i m using this class as a key i overrode equals and gethashcode

14428668
equals	gethashcode
this is why i implemented gethashcode with multiplication because distancecell x y .gethashcode must equals distancecell y x .gethashcode

14428668
equals	gethashcode
it turns out that it had nothing to do with my equals or gethashcode implementation

the only real answer to this is to install a ssl certificate then use https protocol

14429244
int	double
it doesn t matter that you defined y as a double the division didn t take that into account since it was using 2 int literals

14429255
int	double
as the result of int division is an int you need to make sure you divide double floats as the results of these divisions are double floats which can deal with the decimal parts of the numbers

14429255
int	double
even though you specified a double to put the result of the division into what you are actually putting in is an int dividing a double means the result is a double and so the answer contains the correct results

14429262
min	max
i have no idea why you have the min max terms

14429337

14429629
portrait	landscape
the issue happens when i go from portrait to landscape orientation and back to portrait this huge div is causing the width to miss-calculate and the result of that is that i end up with all the body pushed to the left by what appears to be a blank column

14429715
abstract-class	superclass
this is indicated in a note below the section that the above link points to if this were a situation where the superclass was not an abstract-class then yes abstract true should not be used

14429717
hide	show
if you want to hide and show on hover the jwplayer control bar you just need to place it over via the flashvar ...so the control bar will auto-hide when the mouse is idle and show up if you hover the video while it plays

width	height
use the proper width and height values of each video and in your fancybox script prevent the auto-resize using the api option fittoview false ..

14429827
pull	push
is the preferred way to pull every few seconds to check for newer versions and update if necessary or is it possible to push changes

14429828
qtkit	quicktime
this of course leads me to qtkit since quicktime itself isn t available to 64-bit apps

14429841
google-chrome	firefox
i found that google-chrome was easier to get working than firefox but firefoxes tools such as firebug were quite nice to work with

14429841
post	get
my problem was related to returning the same cors response for the options header as the post or get

14429841
post	get
for the options request you just need a standard response saying its ok to proceed then in the post or get response i believe you want your cors responses there only

14429845
width	height
my idea is to make div with width of 676px and height 230px which would have background image

i am new to qt 5.0 and i am trying to use a qgraphicsview called missionview of size 700x400 inside a qwidget to show a rectangle

14430173
integer	unsigned
then if the result is larger than 2 63-1 you can do some additional bcm calculations described above to convert the unsigned integer into a signed one

14430185
chown	chmod
this is where your classical chmod chown solutions are fixing the problems

14430209
int	double
you could check out the numeric library spire i believe it has what you are looking for namely the ability to treat numbers as numbers whether they are int double float etc

14430248
hide	show
originally all the elements are show but then you hide all but the first then you hide all but the second but you didn t show the previous so after first iteration nothing is show

14430269
multiplying	multiplication
due to the way matrix multiplication works the result matrix will have the same effect as first multiplying by the rhs matrix then multiplying by the lhs matrix

14430287
width	height
the issue i have is that whenever i try to get the height and width of the canvas i get 0

14430303
ssl	https
one subdomain has forced ssl so haproxy redirect any http traffic to https

14430344
equals	gethashcode
i ve actually solved this in another situation by overriding equals and gethashcode

14430350
apache	nginx
web servers like apache and nginx are well optimized for serving static files

14430394
versioning	upgrade
if they are fine then check the known bugs for your versioning of php and probably upgrade your server to use the latest available

14430437
for-loop	loops
the first example creates a new thread and runs a for-loop inside it loops gets all the way through as the thread is not a daemon thread so the vm will not exit until the thread completes

14430461
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	netbsd	freebsd	linux	solaris	netbsd	openbsd	solaris	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	netbsd	openbsd	linux
it is known to compile on linux netbsd freebsd openbsd solaris cygwin and macosx on x86 ppc sparc alphaâ

14430463
apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd	nginx	lighttpd
all major web servers that usually run php applications apache lighttpd and nginx have all support for xsendfile

14430463
content-disposition	content-type
the other headers will be kept so you can retain the content-type and content-disposition headers

14430470
backgrounding	multitasking
for more information i suggest you read the backgrounding execution and multitasking section of the ios app programming guide

14430472
printf	fgets
i m using the gcc c compiler as my compiler and i have a program that takes in inputs as stdin using fgets and then i m using multiple printf s to print results due to certain inputs

14430516
subtraction	addition
as for reading the addition subtraction from some registers read memory variables in the context of c you will have to play by reading it and come up with a near equivalent

14430520
folder	directory
step 1 connect to your blog using ftp and navigate to your wp-content plugins directory and download all of your plugins to a folder on your desktop

14430520
folder	directory
step 3 still in your ftp program delete all plugin folder and php files in the plugins directory

14430546
hash	md5
at this point it won t need large unid_id s like md5 or something else and you can use php hash like

14430552
put	get
well i have a service that runs with a notification i want to put an extra with the new intent opened when the user clicks the notification so when mainactivity opens i can get the extra

14430572
width	height
in my experience i much rather prefer just to use a javascript function to get the page width and height and set the div dimensions to pixels not percents

14430572
width	height
this function will get the height and width of the browser

14430594
put	get
make all of the view have vertical spacing constraints between them you should get this automatically if you put them right on top of each other when you drag them in

14430623
getter	setter
getter and setter are correctly set up as i could read in my .xhml it is the concrete class that i m referencing # domaincontroller.allitems there is only one postconstruct

14430631
int	chars
furthermore fgetc returns int for a reason inside the int will be an unsigned chars value or eof

14430631
int	chars
c should be an int not a chars

14430631
int	chars
this differentiates it from any possible chars because successful calls to fgetc will only return a positive int rather than a negative eof

14430639
hide	show
also it was possible to make different groups of results and show hide it in only one command

14430674
hide	show
if you need to conditionally show or hide items or certain parts of an item there and a couple of ways you can go

14430674
hide	show
if one of the item templates has explicit style code to show or hide part and the other doesn t then you ll get the result you re looking for

14430688
mouse	keyboard
i can change the item s focus by pressing the arrow keys on the keyboard or by moving the mouse over it

14430765
width	margin
you can use margin auto to center #header as long as it has a width set on it

14430792
implements	extends
i ve got a class that extends splfileobject and implements a __tostring method but i seem to get inconsistent behaviour depending on how the method is called

14430857
try-catch	exception-handling
it seems to me that either observer t .onerror should wrap observer.onerror in a try-catch or stubs.throw should swallow the exception-handling instead of throwing it

14430867
wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe
or you can use svcutil.exe or wsdl.exe to generate a proxy from the commandline

14430889
width	height
if you have some x and y coordinates in the window let s call them say window_x and window_y and you want to get the coordinates on a grid let s call them grid_x and grid_y and each grid cell has a width and height of grid_size it is relatively easy to calculate grid_x and grid_y simply integer divide round down

14430891
uiview	subviews
to make a uiview all its contents and subviews darker you simply draw another uiview over it that is all black and has an alpha transparency so that the black color of this shielding view mixes with the contents of the view below

14430905
getter	setter
i know you said all getter and setter are there but this one seems tricky so possibly you missed it

14430940
post	put
the crux of the problem is that the new js view is updating the database via put whereas the original django code used post

14430973
folder	directory
you can keep your data in .txt files in folder directory like

14430976
spaces	delimiter
for example assuming your input file and your list of undesired terms are spaces delimiter you could simply do

14430980
ubuntu	linux
this produces an arm linux c++ cross-compiler on ubuntu for me

14430990
ropemacs	pymacs
i tried installing rope rope mode ropemacs and pymacs

14431004
uiviewcontroller	uiwindow
on the first one i load the uiwindow and on other loginviewcontroller uiviewcontroller

14431021
children	parent
ideally the parent would perform a select loop on the child pipes or spawn threads reading from the child pipes so as to consume data as it becomes available to prevent children from stalling on a full pipe and failing

14431067
implements	extends
yes i could implements it without the array i m using but having that array there will be helpful if i extends this project s scope in the future

14431075
websphere	ibm
i created a top down java bean web service client in rad developer an eclipse based compiler used with ibm websphere and auto-generated a bunch of jax-ws .java modules

14431080
nstextview	nsbox
i also thought i might as well throw in some code that makes the nstextview a little more similar in appearance to the nstextfield by putting it inside of a nsbox

14431081
int	double
math.sqrt returns a double so you ll have to cast it to int as well

14431087
children	parent
assuming each bill coin is a separate element you can do this in 3 linear layouts which are all children of a parent linear layout

14431098
width	height
i can highly recommend the use of linearlayout using it you can use layout_weight on it s child elements to make the width height of elements equal

14431098
width	height
in this case i would use one linearlayout with orientation vertical with height set to wrap_content and inside it use three linearlayouts with orientation horizontal with width match_parent and height wrap_content

14431098
width	height
inside each of the three linearlayouts you set your imageviews and specify width 0dp height wrap_content and layout_weight 1

14431123
multiplying	subtract
if you want to keep your already-existing code i think you can do it approximatively the same the trick to get the mouse position on the zoomed image when the image itself is zoomed by a css scale transform and using transform-origin is to subtract the transform origin to your point then multiplying by the factor and finally re-add the transform-origin

14431161
post	get
well assuming you re using post or get on the form you can just loop through each form element as such

14431169
post	get
i have too much code to post here so i was wondering if i could get some code sample regarding iphone address-book frame work to get an idea

14431206
nurbs	shading
the glu nurbs library supported trimming curves which are challenging to implement in all cases using the opengl vertex shader pipeline vertex tessellation and geometry shading only

14431209
ssl	https
some people suggested to use https http over ssl but i see millions of sites applications that use http for these things

14431210
maven	pom.xml
back to dropwizard since they use maven as a build tool all you have to do to bring activejdbc is to configure the instrumentation plugin in pom.xml

14431305
mkmapview	mkannotationview
because this problem went away by finger moving the map a little bit so i found it is very easy to simulate this effect by put code in - void mapview mkmapview mapview didselectannotationview mkannotationview view

14431343
awt	swing
you might find a closer look at the paint mechanism and painting in awt and swing informative

14431368
post	get
after find user s friends via facebook api and with the friend s ids you should get his post from your server

14431376
awt	swing
you might find a closer look at the paint mechanism and painting in awt and swing informative

14431383
datamodel	relational-model
however as noted exposing such tables would still require one to not change or mess with cascade delete since that feature is required to maintain a intersection of features and a correct math relational-model between the complex datamodel xml and that of using two related tables to represent such data

14431387
glut	glfw
glfw is almost the same as glut for everything you want but it doesnt make everything a nightmare like glut does

14431396
int	boolean
mysql does have bool and boolean data types but they are synonymous with int 1

14431397
g++	gcc
you should use gcc g++ for compile c++ program as your compiler and use vi emacs as your editor

14431412
x86	64bit
during installation dont forget to check the x64 libraries for 64bit os and x86 libraries for 32bit os under windows headers and libraries

14431482
equals	gethashcode
an alternative would be create custom type which correctly implements equals and gethashcode and ideally also iequatable

14431520

14431644
google-chrome	firefox
oddly this works perfectly in both google-chrome and firefox

14431683
inherited	properties
you ll probably want to do some more checks on things like whether you actually have a polyline or some other object that inherited from geometry since the properties that contains the actual coordinates varies between polyline polygon point etc

14431685
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
i take the orginal time and subtract it from the current then multiplying it by 4 and add it to the orginal time

14431709
range	max	range	min	min	max
the max and min values for the range slider are set to 0 and 255

14431709
min	max
if the max and min are changed to 256 and -1 respectively similar behavior is observed

14431711
put	get
it had a range of 1 previously so only 1 row would ever get put in the text file. i also had to remove all previous input mappings in my write flat file activity and map the row in from orchestration to the data in to activity

14431728
portrait	landscape
when i flip the android device switching from landscape to portrait or vice verse my card game starts from the beginning

14431737
mp4	webm
i am trying to convert an mkv file to mp4 webm and ogv using ffmpeg and i am getting really drastic performance results

14431737

edit for your edit boost serializable will handle deserialization for you

14432047
int	chars
er object to int to unboxing int or int to lossy byte to positive chars

14432075
int	double
what would have happened with a proper java 1.4 compiler is that an internal cast from int to double would have been produced by the compiler to serve the proper constructor taking a double

14432077
int	chars
the warning comes from the fact that c considers chars to be an int

14432083
addclass	removeclass
using a quick and dirty method of swapping classes with addclass and removeclass

14432084
int	double
i mean there is method that calculate something working with int and returns object and usage of method where result casting to string generaly this metod can be overridden a few times functionality like this was used before java 1.5 were you define generic calss but without generics and returns of each method is object becasue there are a few childs and each can return own type i do not know but can be answer and double casting like this

14432169
stdout	stderr
my suspicion is that the process has filled up the buffer for stdout or stderr and the process which is supposed to be reading from that the buffer has stopped doing so for some reason

14432225

edit1 ok i tried running the same code on firefox i ve been using google-chrome and the balls are moving significantly slower on firefox minus the horrible stutter i ve been seeing on chrome.

14432230
mouseleave	mouseenter
hovering over the picturebox triggers the mouseenter event properly and sets the buttons visible state to true and the mouseleave event sets it to false

14432230
mouseleave	mouseenter
the buttons themselves have the same mouseenter and mouseleave events but as winforms passes mouse events to the form under any space on the form that is transparent my images used in the buttons are transparent around them as well whenever i go to click the buttons they disappear as the form thinks that the mouse has left both the buttons or the form

14432275

14432380
jobs	cron
anyway in my experience this issue 10000ms latency very rarely happens under any non-zero amount of load and many people had to revert to some king of pinging possibly cron jobs every couple of minutes used to work with 5 minutes but lately instances are dying faster so it s more like a ping every 2 mins to keep dynamic instances around to serve users who hit the site when no one else is on

14432388
hide	show
when i resize the window width less than 980px the .std .home-right can t hide when i resize the window width less than 980px to bigger than 980 the .std .home-right can t show

14432499
post	get
according to this link and this post if you break it down until you get a pixel-level mapping then the quality is improved at the sake of speed

14432547
client-side	server-side
the more powerful the solution the better as i will probably want to expand requirements all of which would be more easily handled by rdbms however i only want to know client-side options as i will fall back to using a server-side rdbms if absolutely necessary

14432615

14433721
client-side	server-side
from the perspective of mvc it may be best to focus on either a server-side php symfony or client-side javascript various solution and use the other to augment support that solution

14433721
client-side	server-side
another thing to consider is that node.js allows you to write server-side and client-side code in javascript so keep an eye out for tighter integration there

put	get
the page displays when it gains focus but i when i try to put an image on there i simply get at the most the red and white x box

14441129
post	get
if you post to somebody else s wall you will get the user to user message

14441135
width	height
another solution that i implemented is to put an imageview that fills the screen width and height both match_parent with scale type centercrop

14441154
portrait	landscape
the portrait layout stays even when i change to landscape though it is obviously redrawn because the items in it change their locations accourding to the new orientation limits

14441181
spaces	delimiter
your csv is a bit funny and difficult to conclude that | or spaces is the delimiter

14441251
appfuse	spring
well i will go right to the point i am a newbie in spring and i have used appfuse for creating a new web app

14441257

i can t use an md5 hash because each report is timestamped in the footer and the timestamps always changes

14441277
ord	chr
cool both variants end on the same and print chr ord q q .

14441277
ord	chr
then print chr ord can be simplified to simply print in that context as only picks the first character from

multiplying	modulo
so multiplying up the uv in the vertex shader interpolate it across the polygon correctly and then apply the modulo only when writing to the buffer

14441567
client-side	server-side
to populate the components client-side you ll have to create the server-side logic so it will enter the correct javascript that does so into the html of the pages

14441595
inherited	properties
since your instances inherited the method properties from the prototype objects you need to access them as properties and not as plain variables

14441611
ggplot2	lattice
i dont konw how you can do this using ggplot2 but using lattice you can easily do it with trellis.focus

14441632
for-loop	arrays
the important thing to remember is that the for-loop will give each item as it appears in the arrays so if ls is an arrays of boxed strings each file will show up as a single boxed string

14441659
punctuation	words
if you use a regex that allows for punctuation between words this ensures that the punctuation will not be lost

14441681

submit	submission
yes mechanize gem can be used to automate any interaction with a website including logging into a site by submission the userid password and clicking on submit button link etc

14441752
ssl	https
since varnish doesn t work in ssl we are setting x-forwarded-proto to https in pound and we are detecting that way if we are in https

14441793
terminate	timeout
while the host s tcp implementation probably do not timeout the connection even if there s no activity for a long period of time but be aware that some tcp option exist to handle and control that behaviour like rfc 5482 tcp user timeout option most networking equipments routers nat boxes firewall etc. have some timeout policy where idle connection will be terminate

14441793
udp	tcp
so if you are flooding your network connection with udp it is possible that a simultaneous tcp connection is not able to get a even a single packet out thus resulting in the router to terminate the connection

14441793
udp	tcp
while tcp try to be well-behave and prevent flooding of the network link udp don t care at all

14441793
udp	tcp
so if you can control the behaviour of the udp traffic either in the application or my network quality control tools that would help your tcp traffic a lot

14441822
onresume	onpause
perhaps you can move your flag to the onpause onresume

14441840
int	boolean
if you like however you can also use this version which employs mysql s implicit conversion of boolean to int true â - â 1 false â - â 0

14441871
inline	inlining
that being said even if you could force inlining of functions you should know that in any optimization level compilers can unroll some recursive functions to plain while loops so you wouldn t see any paradox in the final assembly the resulting loop would simply be inline

14441983
background-image	background-color
which is why we have separate properties like background-image background-color to start with

14441992
pop-up	dialog
here is how i created a modal pop-up - i used a pop-up dialog where the top and bottom portions are transparent so that anything behind it will show through

14441992
pop-up	dialog
the pop-up is a grid with 5 rows 3 for the dialog itself and 2 for the transparent top and bottom

14441992
pop-up	dialog	mouse	keyboard
since the pop-up fills the entire screen any input keyboard or mouse goes to it rather than the grid underneath making the pop-up act like a modal dialog

14442013
width	height
i initialize the window by awakefromnib and i hope when i resize the window it s width and height will double.the code run correctly at first but at the second time it appears with doubled size so i wonder how to forbid windowwillresize until i resize it it seems awakefromnib doesn t work.here s the code

macports	homebrew
after trying with macports and pip3 for many days and ultimately being unable to get a functional ipython notebook qtconsole going with matplotlib and numpy and sympy and all that wonderful stuff i gave up and switched to homebrew which ultimately worked for me but i had to do a regular install from source for several of the bigger packages

14442107
macports	homebrew
so i guess my experience was that macports with pip3 was not a good idea for my particular goal whereas homebrew with pip3 was better but still incomplete for scipy packages with python3

14442107
macports	homebrew
although perhaps if i had tried installing from source to supplement macports the way i did with homebrew then macports would have sufficed also.

14442631
folder	directory

portrait	landscape
i have a xib file with two different views one for portrait and one for landscape

14442660
portrait	landscape
but if i move it to portrait and back the landscape view loads fine

client-side	server-side
when developing client-side applications in the past i have always used some sort of server-side application to package and serve the javascript

14443415
width	height
in my experience i much rather prefer just to use a javascript function to get the page width and height and set the div dimensions to pixels not percents

this function will get the height and width of the browser

the limit clause on the outermost query is being applied after the entire resultset is prepare which means those two correlated subqueries are getting execute for every row in table the_data

14443780
folder	directory
update - use first test n part of file name for parent folder of year directory

14443783
width	height
this function will get the height and width of the browser

14443783
width	height
this should set the gallery height and width to be the same as the viewport thus filling up 100 of the screen

14443865
int	double
i would have thought this is ok but you re not casting the int i to a double so asking for problems if you reshuffle parts

14443909
subtract	add
to add and subtract them i simply add to the string or find a replace with to remove them

14443920
unsigned	short
unsigned short might not be exactly 16 bits although there aren t many implementations on which it isn t

14443920
integer	unsigned
use std uint_fast16_t rather than unsigned int if you want a fast unsigned integer of at least 16 bits

14443920
integer	unsigned
use std uint_fast32_t rather than unsigned long if you want a fast unsigned integer of at least 32 bits

14443932
innodb	myisam
that feature is available only with myisam and not innodb

14443944
ant	pom.xml
however in my pom.xml i have an ant script that gets run on the validate phase

14443947
width	height
you can amend the width and the height here

14444027
sml	curry
as you said yourself sml doesn t really have polyadic functions it only simulates using tuples or curry

14444037
sequence	permutation
to generate next permutation you are trying to find the first index from the bottom where sequence fails to be descending and improves value in that index while switching order of the rest of the tail from descending to ascending in this case

14444042
entity-relationship	diagram
the entity-relationship diagram would look like this

14444053
printf	strtol
calling scanf or strtol or printf is probably inacceptable to you as it s using a standard c library

14444068
qlineedit	qlabel
add horizontal layout fill it with qlabel and qlineedit

14444068
qlineedit	qlabel
add another horizontal layout fill it with qlabel and qlineedit

14444144
mouse	keyboard
i m writing a fps style game in opengl with sdl as a framework utilizing mouse and keyboard input

14444144
mouse	keyboard
for some reason whenever i change direction rotate using the mouse while moving the camera position with the keyboard simultaneously the movement drastically speeds up as opposed to moving with keyboard when the mouse isn t being used

14444160
fadein	fadeout
as to the rest the code seems correct to me aside from fadein fadeout fadesequence that are not used

14444168
hash	md5
according to this site it is apparently an md5 hash of the unicode representation of welcome1

14444169
filesystems	xfs
this depends largely on the filesystems in use ext3 ext4 xfs .... and the mount-time options given to it so there isn t an easy one-size-fits-all answer

14444317
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
on one of the sites i m currently creating i use a sticky footer which works just fine in firefox google-chrome safari and ie 9

14444436
opera	google-chrome
after some testing i ve found that google-chrome doesn t calculate the thead column width depending on the tbody elements as opera does

14444513
width	height
this will make sure the image is actually loaded before getting the image width hand height

14444517
put	get
you can put listeners on both divs and then whenever one of them changes make sure both of them get the same vertical offset

14444545
floating-point	integer
it produces the floor of the quotient of its operands without floating-point rounding for integer operands

14444549
multiplying	add
i essentially have three matrices that are pertinent call them x n x k y n x 1 and om n x n i need to break these three matrices up by rows multiplying them together in various ways and then add up the results

14444564
client-side	server-side
client-side validation based on server-side attributes like regularexpression con|prn|aux

14444605
nsoperationqueue	nscache
you should probably define a nsoperationqueue in your class and initialize it in viewdidload as well as a nscache and add operations to that queue rather than creating a new nsoperationqueue for every image

14444633
submit	submission
since you are not really submission a form and don t want to reload a page you can just use the click event from a button rather than the submit event from the form

14444678
folder	directory
on a file named this.php within the testsitedir folder i get the typical failed to open stream no such file or directory in ... testsitedir this.php error

14444704
width	height
in my web page i will have content in top left with 3 inches width and 4 inches height data

14444726
jgit	egit
when i go to the repository for egit or jgit for that matter eclipse tells me the plugins are already installed

14444726
cvs	svn
window preferences team contains no git item only cvs and svn

14444728
implements	extends
also you shouldn t insert the logic of the adapter in the custom view make the adapter a separate class and extends one of the concrete classes like baseadapter arrayadapter etc instead of implements the listadapter interface

14444806
google-chrome	firefox
works fine in google-chrome and firefox

14444831
width	height
to replicate open the above link in a window greater than 500px wide blue header and at a height that only just lets the content scroll off the page - then slowly reduce the width of the window until it goes red ie is less than 500px in width

14444831
width	height
assuming the height of your window results in the un-floated divs no longer needing a scroll bar or vice versa - at the point of transition between red and blue headings ie media query becoming being active you should notice for a very short period that the red header does not fill the entire viewport width

14444833
rss	feed
am creating a rss feed app

14444838
dictionary	map
it can be treated as an array list vector hash table an implementation of a map dictionary collection stack queue and probably more

14444847
ubuntu	debian
if you are on ubuntu or debian install libgtk2.0-dev and pkg-config then re-run cmake or configure script in cvnamedwindow file home srinath documents opencv-2.4.0 modules highgui src window.cpp line 598

14444847
ubuntu	debian
if you are on ubuntu or debian install libgtk2.0-dev and pkg-config then re-run cmake or configure script in function cvnamedwindow

14444862
versioning	upgrade
for me i upgrade to the latest versioning of worklight which is how i m building my hybrid apps and the problem was resolved

14444862
versioning	upgrade
i should ve checked before i upgrade but i assume the versioning of phonegap that comes packaged with it was a later build as that s where my problem was being created

14444875
textmate	sublimetext
github textmate theme by sbecker compatible with sublimetext 2 is the closest match i could find

14444893
width	height
if you re embedding svg in html you should specify a width and height for the element too

14444893
width	height
you may also need to specify a width height for the div as a style

14444914
google-chrome	safari
however we have noticed that some browsers google-chrome and safari among them include the origin header with ajax post requests even when originating from the same domain so not a cors request

14444920
hash	md5
md5 returns the hash as a 32-character hexadecimal number

14444921
portrait	landscape
i ve tried a rotation orientation solution from here but on my test phone with landscape sliding keyboard i had to reverse landscape and portrait to make it work properly which makes me think that on some devices it ll have to be other way around

14444921
width	height
comparing screen width and height like some other answers there suggest also seems iffy

14444937
post	get
they simply post the data to your script and if they get a 200 ok back from your server they consider it a done deal regardless of whether or not you post back for verification or not

14444974
hash	md5
one option would be to generate two md5 hash concatenate them together for a total of 64 hex characters and then take the first 36 characters of that

14444974
hash	md5
note an md5 hash is 128-bits

14445046
put	get	post	get	post	put
should i simply put the username and the quote as it is in the new post or should i only put the users id and regex it out and get the username from the db each time

14445102
matplotlib	colormap
i want to take a png image which has color tuples of the form 1 1 0 1 and use a matplotlib colormap to get an integer or floating point number out

14445174
width	height
then you can just set your width height to make it look great

14445201
submit	submission
in the case of clicking on links this would be following the link but the difference is most noticeable in form submit handlers where you can cancel a form submission if the user has made a mistake entering the information

14445282
udp	tcp
i am trying to build a server which can echo the input from either a tcp or a udp client

14445282
udp	tcp
what happens is that if i send a message from the tcp client the program works as expected but from the udp client nothing happens

14445326
udp	tcp
your program blocks waiting for a tcp message so it never sees any udp

14445334
getter	setter
compilers do that quite aggressively the second case even if it looks the same due to syntactic resemblance of properties to member variables has method calls getter setter and cannot be simply simplified

14445347
post	get
use post instead of get requests

14445363
textmate	sublimetext
github textmate theme by sbecker compatible with sublimetext 2

14445364
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
assuming that you want a 10-digit number in the box numeric characters only we can also use the pattern attribute on the element in html5 as a form of validation for newer browsers firefox google-chrome ie10 opera

14445367
uilabel	uitextview
lets say i have a uilabel or uitextview of frame 320 460

14445367
range	max	range	min	min	max
obviously there should be some min and max range lets say min as 8pixel

14445380
directx	direct2d
the directx 2d route is further hindered by windows phone 8 not supporting direct2d

14445380
directx	direct2d
directx has a subset called direct2d for 2d rendering

14445386
rss	feed
i am reading some data from an rss feed to display on an android device

14445423
ienumerator	idisposable
most likely for the same reason that implements idisposable but ienumerator does not--the earlier version was written before the authors thought of circumstances where one an a implementation might need cleanup but a factory returning such an implementation might not know about such need

14445427
folder	directory
but now that i installed auto-complete as an emacs package i don t have an auto-complete folder in my .emacs.d directory anymore so the second line above does not work

14445488
folder	directory
by default in newer versions of auto-complete the directory used will the the one in the site-lisp folder where emacs installed the package so that line is not required

14445507
for-loop	loops
then i use ajax in jquery and do for-loop to loops the json data

14445538
put	get
the below works fine when all on the same server but when i cross domains firebug shows the the put or get as options and it is not found on the server

14445592
int	boolean
another road to travel down is to create a method that takes an xelement that represents ltd as well as an int stycode and returns a boolean indicating the appropriate value

14445627
arraylist	treeset
i have even tried putting my treeset within an arraylist

14445633
stdout	stderr
1 is stdout and 2 is stderr

14445636
internationalization	translation
internationalization block languages field translation menu translation multilingual content multilingual select synchronize translation taxonomy translation translation redirect translation sets

14445680
put	preflight
it has to preflight the request because once it s made the put or delete it s too late to honor the response

14445680
post	get
get and post are a bit more complicated as sometimes the browser decides they are safe without asking first while other times the browser will also do a preflight check

14445694
nexus	artifactory
i use nexus but the following should also apply to artifactory

14445694
nexus	artifactory
some of the repository managers nexus artifactory archiva offer staging features which make it possible to certify or discard releases that don t pass your quality toll-gates

14445694
ant	maven
use the maven ant task

14445741
highcharts	highstock
parsing complex json into highcharts form | highcharts highstock jsfiddle

14445868
trie	tree	trie	dawg
however that space overhead can be reduced by compressing the trie using the patricia tree representation using a more efficient data structure to store child pointers or building a dawg from the trie

14445883
hide	show
you need to show the progress bar in onpreexecute do the work in doinbackground and then hide the progress bar in onpostexecute

14445888
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
its safer to override them in a uinavigationcontroller or uitabbarcontroller subclass

14445888
portrait	landscape
also this does not cover the scenario where you push present pop from a landscape view into a portrait only vc or vice-versa

14445903
roboguice	robolectric
the solution that worked out best for me or at all was to initialize a replacement injected implementation during testing only of roboguice s ln.print class to do system.out printing instead of android s log printing given i was actually using robolectric to avoid having to depend on the android subsystem to run my tests in the first place

14445903
roboguice	robolectric
that of course assuming the standard robolectric init to hook the module up with roboguice

14445914
accelerometer	gyroscope
so i am writing a piece of code where i have to detect different movement gestures using accelerometer and gyroscope in ios 4.3 above

14445917
versioning	upgrade
however if you then upgrade the app on the device it can still be the exact same versioning build it will error when opening the local database

14445939
profiler	visualvm
in any case download visualvm jdk includes jconsole dumbed down version of it and check what your threads are doing where they are stuck threaddump and if that doesn t give any quick answers turn on the profiler

14445964
ant	maven
we found out a simple way to explain to new users how to setup their maven projects but we also need to explain it to people using ant on android ant is the most common build tool

14446018
jar	war
the jar is located in my web-inf lib folder in my war file

14446019
post	get
i know i can t pass complex data through get method so i m using a post in order to send it

14446095
chown	sudo
2 sudo chown username . -r

14446101
spaces	delimiter
the issue of stripping white spaces will not arise and you can specify the delimiter not needed here in the argument of csv.reader function

14446148
google-chrome	firefox
it is playing in ie and google-chrome but working in firefox

14446174
for-loop	arrays
i m trying to create an arrays inside an arrays using a for-loop - here s my code

14446199
int	boolean
you ll notice though that we are then trying to assign a boolean value to an int variable

14446207
ubuntu	linux
and the same ordering of the results my linux box ubuntu x86-64 core i7

14446221
mp3	aiff	mp3	wav	mp3	ogg	wav	aiff	wav	ogg	aiff	ogg
its purpose is to provide developers with powerful and efficient sample stream mp3 mp2 mp1 ogg wav aiff custom generated and more via os codecs and add-ons mod music xm it s3m mod mtm umx mo3 music mp3 ogg compressed mods and recording functions

14446221

14446253
for-loop	arrays
first you need to declare a outside of the for-loop as an arrays

14446274
ant	maven
maven ant tasks is a simple way

14446285
versioning	upgrade
in our existing app we have a lot of ads everywhere and we now want to upload this new versioning as a pro versioning alongside the other one insted of updating the old one giving the users a choice between the old free ad-filled app and the new 0.99 ad-less and upgrade app

14446333
spaces	linefeed
one possibility would be to include the spaces character in your search term possibly after pre-processing your input to convert all sorts of white spaces spaces linefeed carriage return tab... to the same spaces character

14446338
children	parent
i think the way to do this is to create an mdi parent form and open the other forms as children of that

14446339
inherited	properties
if you cant add a bool properties to your remedy class consider creating a an inherited class or class extension

14446368
inline	inlining
except when i also use rules pragma in this case i may want to postpone inlining of the function in order to let associated rules to be fired. what kinds of functions are better to inline only at a particular stage of simplifying process

14446377
google-chrome	safari
so in theory i could paste in any html javascript and it would function just as if the mobile safari google-chrome was browsing the same content on a web server

14446418
doc	rtf
i tested this with a rtf doc that had the ----- lines in stand-alone paragraphs enter and line breaks shift-enter within other paragraphs

14446447
google-chrome	firefox
iâ ve tested this on firefox and it works but in google-chrome it just wonâ t work and it keeps giving me an exception 101

14446481
innodb	myisam
when my database was originally created it was all created as myisam for no particular reason - over time as new tables have been added they have all been innodb as this seems to be the phpmyadmin default

14446545
devise	cancan
rspec may be better for more exhaustive analysis though one would hope you can trust that both devise and cancan have done this for you

14446620
folder	directory
the best thing to do imho would be to put the uploads directory outside of the webapp folder

14446627
google-chrome	firefox
how do i stop flickering of this div when it s hovered it is only having issue in firefox google-chrome is fine

14446657
innodb	myisam
the caveats of switching from myisam to innodb are very few

14446657
innodb	myisam
also remember if you have allocated a large amount of ram for the myisam key_buffer_size config variable that will no longer be needed if you switch everything to innodb

14446657
innodb	myisam
innodb supports the same sql data types and query semantics as myisam except for a few exotic cases

14446663
width	height
if you want to have a 100 width variable height background image done with css instead of using cover which will allow the image to extend out from the sides or contain which does not allow the image to extend out at all just set the css like so

14446663
width	height
this will set your background image to 100 width and allow the height to overflow

14446663
width	height
to do this you set the height to 0 and set the padding-bottom to a percentage of the element s own width like so

14446663
width	height
in order to use different aspect ratios divide the height of the original image by it s own width and multiply by 100 to get the percentage value

14446665
profiling	instrumentation
profiling your app again in instrumentation after converting to arc and narrow down on any offending code that is creating large pools of objects

14446680
button	checkbox
my question here is when next button is clicked on this jsp page i need to send the list of contact objects whose checkbox were selected to servlet

14446739
google-chrome	firefox
it happens at different times it doesn t happen every time as a percentage of page submissions i d say it s about 5-10 and the only thing that seems even to be a constant across all errors is that they re from firefox and google-chrome not internet explorer

14446748
sorting	filtering
paging sorting filtering etc

14446760
jpql	hql
when you write hql or jpql queries you use the names of the types not the tables

14446796
post	get
it shows more information about get post requests which page we connected with xmlhttp request headers and information like this

14446796
google-chrome	firefox
it can be a standalone application google-chrome or a firefox extension

14446800
post	get
everything works successfully locally but when i deploy it to heroku and post i get the following error in my heroku logs

14446814
int	boolean
now this worked when i omitted the string and datetime conditions so that it only updated the int and boolean

14446865
int	boolean
this works since the boolean type in mysql is represented as int 0 and 1 just like in c

14446869
innodb	myisam
another piece of advice consider using innodb instead of myisam

14446892
winpcap	pcap.net
even if so the bug might be in pcap.net not winpcap

14446898
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
this class exposes 4 methods add subtract multiplying and divide

14446902
post	get
one thing to look out for is any get or post data being sent to the external script

14446917
cgpoint	cgsize
cgcontextref cgpoint and cgsize

14446917
cgpoint	cgsize
i am trying to use a current method where i have to include the cgcontextref cgpoint and cgsize

14446999
subtract	add
basically i want to add if the condition is add or subtract if condition is subtract from the total

14447002
treemap	linkedhashmap
so you have for a map the choice of hashmap treemap linkedhashmap and so on

14447009
draggable	droppable
if you are using clone as draggable helper you should be able to append to droppable when confirmed or do nothing when not confirmed

14447014
google-chrome	firefox
however if a user attempts to access the link in google-chrome or firefox the file content is displayed instead of forcing download

14447014
content-disposition	content-type
i ve added proper content-type and content-disposition headers and also added the mime types within htaccess addtype application x-rdp rdp but have had no luck forcing the download

14447022
for-loop	loops
before this i use for-loop in js to loops it but for some reason i have to loops in server side now

14447066
a-star	dijkstra
in terms of the path-finding implementation you might want to start by looking at a-star or dijkstra s algorithm

14447099
uilabel	nsstring
i have tried getting the mpmediaitem into a nsstring then the uilabel reflecting this but i m just getting null returned

14447225
int	chars
the nonstandard types u_char and u_int appear to be just aliases for unsigned chars and unsigned int respectively and the xcalloc function seems to be just a replacement or wrapper for the standard calloc

14447330
inherited	subclassing
as you see the various animals inherited from a class called animal. each subclassing also has a method make_sound

14447353
itunes	entitlements
note that apple will only approve an app that uses one of the temporary exception entitlements under certain conditions which are listed on the itunes connect webside you must login to see that side and you need an apple id with permission to use itunes connect

14447353
post	get
in the callback function you may do whatever you want to do to get a higher level event since the callback function is only plain c so you may want to post a nsnotification that you can handle in your obj-c code in your ui code or maybe directly call an obj-c method of some object stored in the callback context a global variable or which is accessible as a singleton etc.

14447354
isotope	masonry
i tried desandro masonry freetile and isotope as well as some others

14447354
isotope	masonry
while desandro masonry and isotope both worked in joomla for me in my tests i had decided on isotope as the most workable for my purposes so i went that direction

14447357
daemons	systemd
read the sshd daemons s error messages in your systemd log auth.log or security.log or some such

14447396
tablet	galaxy
i am testing with a nexusone phone device and a galaxy tablet

14447458
mouse	keyboard
it can t act like a keyboard mouse disk drive midi

14447475
gradle	ivy
i know how to publish using gradle and i have that working with a local ivy file system that gradle creates

14447481
width	height
var styleprops this .css border-bottom-width border-bottom-color border-bottom-style width height color background-color

14447494
portrait	landscape
you can go even further and make also different layouts for portrait and landscape views by specyfing another keyword in directory s name

14447516
waitpid	fork
simply fork and in the parent do waitpid and in the child compute the same into the shared memory location and just return and waitpid will unblock and the parent can do whatever it wants with that sum

it looks like you need to rename the plugin folder in the plugin directory

14447564
width	height
i was using the accepted answer for a while until we noticed that non-square rotations based on images taken directly from the camera seemed stretched they were rotated as desired just the frame width height wasn t adjusted

14447811
inherited	properties
you are correct that controllers should be able to inherited properties from other controllers

14447811
inherited	properties
by declaring an array of dependencies via the needs properties rather than inherited you will find over time that your application is less brittle and easier to test change

14447858
hive	hdfs
note that this behavior of moving hdfs directories only exist in more recent versions of hive

14447883
post	put
after much googling i now remember that i should be binding the repeater in the oninit method in order for the viewstate to put the captured data of the controls within the ucrequest control on them between post backs but when i try to do that i will always have a single instance of the control on the repeater since its items collection is always empty

14447934

accessor	properties
i can create my own accessor but this could be quite a lot of work if there are a lot of properties that i want to change.

14448027
width	height
it scales nicely you just have to change the width and the height of the .triangle element

14448027
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
for firefox google-chrome and safari only the orange triangle with rounded corners is sensitive to hover thanks to pointer-events none

14448027
width	height
otherwise this could be achieved by wrapping .triangle in an element having the same width and height and the same border-radius and overflow hidden

14448034

it accepts text string via get or post and provides json output with scores

14448108
octal	binary
then write out your three bytes three different ways - one each for hexadecimal binary and octal

14448159
octal	hex
it seems like this just requires you to look up the appropriate entries from the ascii table which in most cases lists hex and octal and the characters themselves

14448159
octal	hex	octal	decimal
ascii is a standard way of defining how characters are represented and most tables will list characters against corresponding hex decimal and octal values

14448159
hex	binary
most of the times you re not going to see binary listed but it s fairly academic to translate a hex value into binary - your windows calculator will happily do this for you

14448182
mutators	setter
kvo fires when a setter or other mutators is called

post	get
i want to get a count of how many post that fit a certain criteria are in each category and then order the results

14448332
dictionary	map
json strings map pretty well to nsdictionaries and nsarrays so the presumption is that you get your data on the phone side into a structure of nsdictionaries and nsarrays and then pass the root dictionary array to datawithjsonobject or better a different brand of json parser serializer

14448332
nsstring	nsdata
the apple api will return an nsdata object from that conversion which can either be sent directly or converted to an nsstring and sent depending on the network interface you use

justmock	typemock
blue pill buy a tool like typemock isolator essential or justmock and you ll be able to mock anything in your code and the story ends

14448458
min	max
so for the statement above mysql does the subtraction of each row 4 times - once for avg once for stddev once for min and once for max

14448525
minimum	max
it looks like your minimum target is 480x800 and max is 1080x1920 so i would suggest setting up emulators on all 3 sizes and testing accordingly

14448537
put	get
an ivy repository is just a file store and hence you need to set up a server apache httpd that allows to read and write those files via http get put

at the moment if i check the firebug post data after the form has been submit it does appear to get the username and password that have been added to the form however the page just reloads regardless of whether an incorrect username and password are added or if they are correct and no session is created

14449124
children	parent
self_first means that parent are yielded before their children 2009 before 2009 01

14449134

you could set a hard size width and height to the signature div

14449201
onkeyup	onkeydown
every onkeydown will always eventually have an onkeyup

14449209
hide	show
i have a layer that i want to show when the user does an action and hide after he is done

14449413
jquery	jsignature
jsignature relies on jquery for a lot of functionality

14449647
children	parent
however when i fade in a div using the first selector i only get the parent div and none of it s children

14449647
children	parent
i looked into the first-child selector but that seems to only affect the first child of multiple parent rather than all the children of the first parent

14449647
fadein	fadeout
what i did was add a callback function to the datatable function which forced the fadein and fadeout effects and the attribute changes to wait until the div s were fully formed

14449669
nsurlconnection	mbprogresshud
i m currently working on a tableview using mbprogresshud nsurlconnection

14449679

but i was thinking if i could save the database information on an encrypted table one entry for each combination of user-database and such information is encrypted using the hash user password as salt not the same hash as in the users table of course

14449679
hash	salt
and my idea was that when the user logs in his password is hash as in the database salt and saved as a cookie with a short lifespan to use it while the user is connected

14450281
inherited	subclassing
if you have methods in your base class that don t make sense in your subclassing then i think you need to re-evaluate if you should model these classes via an inherited relationship

14450281
inherited	subclassing
needing to hide members of a base class in a subclassing is a red flag that indicates modeling this via an inherited relationship is problematic

google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and safari

14450600
google-chrome	safari
in my opinion the google-chrome and safari rendering would seem to be the most intuitive what i might expect as a designer as i would not expect the background-color to render since the element is hidden but at the same time if i set a child as visible then i would expect the browser to let me scroll on behalf of that child even if the html wrapper is set to visibility hidden

qtkit	quicktime
after a little bit of research i found that qtkit is the quicktime kit and has nothing to do with qt

14451246

14459510
superclass	subclassing
most of the time the methods that are going to be called for the subclassing are contained within the superclass however each subclassing has a few methods that only relate to it

14459556
post	get
the other is a common mistake when you use oauth in a get you are including just the url in the signature but in a post you need to include the body in the signature too or it will not pass oauth validation

14459564
google-chrome	firefox
unfortunately this code throws an exception on ie works perfectly in google-chrome and firefox

14459571
free	malloc
there are several reasons to avoid malloc - the biggest one in my mind is that no malloc no free to paraphrase bob marley.

14459571
free	malloc
this is particularly the case when you hit malloc free calls in hot-paths - parts of the code that is called very often

14459571
free	malloc
it s wrong to use all global variables that are several times larger than they need to be just to avoid malloc - but it s equally wrong to call malloc free for every frame or every object of a graphics drawing loop

range	infinity	floating-point	integer
empirically it seems that when i convert a floating-point value regardless of its precision to a signed integer i get nice saturation whenever the floating-point value isn t representable in that signed integer range even in the event that the floating-point value is plus or minus infinity but i don t know or care about the nan case

14459710
floating-point	integer
my question is whether once the floating-point machinery has decided upon the integer that it needs to output which is platform-dependent but in the event that said integer lies outside of the target signed integer range which is platform-independent whether or not saturation is guaranteed by the spec

equals	gethashcode
well contains is going to call equals on the elements - and may also use gethashcode i doubt it but you should override it consistently anyway

14459850
equals	gethashcode
so you need to override equals object and gethashcode in filenode

14459850
equals	gethashcode
note that as soon as you start trying to use contains in a query which will execute in the database it could behave completely different - it wouldn t be looking at your equals gethashcode methods at that point

accessing the clipboard is a security concern and thus cannot be done easily in firefox or google-chrome

14460281

the only way i have found to run a release mode app that i have built is by building an archive signing it with my debugging profiling and doing an ad-hoc deployment to my device

14460290

in shell you probably better want to ass export to those variables you redefine to ensure subshell use the new value too like something | sort in bash sort will be in a subshell therefore using the default value of lc_ or using the exported value if you exported it

14460321
width	height

free	memset
however if i change the number from 100 to 500 allocate 500mb twice memset 500mb free works fine

14462348
int	boolean
however as you point out any time you cast a boolean that is set to true to an int it will evaluate to -1 for instance

14462348
int	boolean
since a boolean is stored as a 16-bit int it is easier to toggle between true and false states by simply not ing all of the bits rather than only not ing the least significant of the bits

14462356
int	boolean
this is because the boolean data type is stored as a 16-bit signed int

14462471

filtering	grouping
there s really no reason to add a grouping true check in there because you should have total control over your own filtering

14463190
filtering	grouping
but if that s a must for your application then you d want to add grouping true to the result of your filtering not the input

14463190
filtering	grouping
this will create a new property on your scope called scope.groupeditems on the fly which should effectively cache your filtering and grouping results

14463202
stdout	stderr
in a standard posix environment there are 2 standard output streams standard output stdout and standard error stderr

14463202
stdout	stderr
when viewing the script in a web browser stdout will be passed to the browser and stderr will be handled by apache and normally sent to a logger

14463392
factors	mean
as you can see i am plotting value for each bench constrained to every possible combination of exec.cfg and class.cfg that is what i mean with nested factors and using metric to create groups

14463461

versioning	upgrade
-- remember windows virtualstore when cleaning up broken systems which have old versioning of dlls on them including teechart fastreport indy and so on which tend to be involved in messes because they can exist both as out of box packages that ship with delphi as well as frequently installed as upgrade versioning if you purchased and installed them from the vendors directly or third you may have your own compiled copy in your company s mega-component-pack-directory

14463673
int	double
bar is of an integral type so 1000000 bar will surely be less than 1000000 which can be represented exactly by a double 1 so there s no way in which performing the calculation all in integral arithmetic can give better precision - actually you will get int division that in this case is less precise for any value of bar since it will truncate the decimal part

14463673
int	double
the only way you can have a problem in a long to double conversion here is in bar conversion to double but if it exceeds the range of double the final result of the division will be 0 as it would be anyway in int arithmetic

14463673
int	double
is equivalent to the previous one 1000000.0 is a double but you cast it to a long and then int division is performed

14463673
range	minimum
the c standard to which the c++ standard delegates the matter asks for a minimum of 10 decimal digits for the mantissa of double s dbl_dig and at least as representable power of ten before going out of range dbl_max_10_exp c99 annex e â 4

as vikas says the best way is to get an upgrade scan from people that have done this before they know what the problem areas are and quite frequently find extensions that you aren t even aware they were put in place like deployer extensions and obscure event systems or custom pages or from the good old r5 days gui hacks

if your operating system shares address space the child returning from main means that your environment cleans things up fflush stdout since you called printf free memory that was allocated by printf and such things

why this drives me crazy is that a near identical chunk of code that contains the input parameters is accessible from main using similar syntax only chars value of struct arguments vs int value of struct scans

14482091
vbscript	jscript
some options - vbscript jscript gnu sed for windows powershell .

14482451
jstl	taglib
i m using the jstl 1.1 library and the following taglib is included

14482478
getter	setter
using struct s to carry passive data objects without behaviour attached to the object have the advantage of default publicness of the members so they can be accessed without getter and setter

14482478
getter	setter
if some member data needs to be checked modified before assign or some member data needs to be computed modified before be getted imho they need a setter getter pair and the object is a class instead of a struct

14482519
folder	directory
try deleting the war and folder from the webapps directory manually and then deploy

14482527
kerberos	ntlm
the following answer is based on my understanding of ntlm kerberos and some speculation on how xmlhttprequest reuses the information known to the browser

14482527
kerberos	ntlm
note that in contrary to ntlm kerberos works only if both the browser and the server can contact the authentication authority

14482527
kerberos	ntlm
this is why usually in iis the negotiate is set as the authentication scheme - this tries kerberos first and then switch back to ntlm if the authentication authority is not directly available to the browser

to improve the management of database updates i have been looking at flyway and liquibase

14482644
flyway	liquibase
what i would like to do is run flyway liquibase against the database and generate an update script that incorporates all the updates needed to bring the database up to date - including any changes flyway liquibase needs to make to its own tables

14482766

14482782
post	put
additionally in the post problem in error handling using struts validator framework i ve described how handle exceptions during validation to put exception_key to the error attribute

executable	upx
this is not something that works by chance upx is intended to compress win32-pe and many other formats whether that s executable or dlls

14483244
executable	upx
however compression whether you use upx or another executable packer or windows filesystem compression has side effects

14483252
put	get
in the case you put a number smaller than 11 you will get an error which is normal beause you are giving access to your app to some android versions which will not support your app

14483297

14483307
google-chrome	safari
i am using the exact same script on my project it works perfectly fine one both google-chrome and safari

i need to add constrains on specific parameter lag if this parameter exceeds max value of 3 or min value of 1 i need it to get a default value of 1

14483332
int	chars
the error is this invalid operands to binary | have chars and int

14483371
int	double
that said afaik c has always distinguished between double return and int return so it could probably have made it ub for a function returning double to fall off the end had it been done at the right time

14483372
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari

btw i also have a sub-classed webviewclient and webchromeclient if they are of any use

14483436
put	get
for example if you put to entity fragments and then get the parent a subsequent put to the fragment only invalidates the fragment and the parent may then serve stale data

14483436
put	get
it s more straightforward to get a smaller parent entity which has links to each entity fragment and then get each fragment in which case a put to the fragment properly prompts subsequent gets to retrieve a fresh copy

14483447
gridview	detailsview
on an asp.net detailsview and also on a gridview i noticed that the tick mark in checkboxes are a light gray disabled colour even though i set it as blue

14483589
google-chrome	firefox
i opened the console google-chrome firefox and ran the following lines

14483610
draggable	droppable
i m having a problem with the draggable droppable objects

14483610
width	height
the droppable is the same height but the width is only about 80px

14483610
draggable	droppable
in order for the draggable to actually fire the drop listener the draggable has to almost be perfectly centered over the droppable in order for it to actually work and to fire the drop event listener

14483610
draggable	droppable
it would appear that it tests the draggable objects placement based on its width over the droppable to detect if it s being dropped

14483610
draggable	droppable
right now that draggable would have to be half way over in order to actually snap to the droppable object

14483629
posixct	strftime	as.date	posixct	as.date	strftime
i am struggling trying with strftime posixct or as.date functions to convert it to real time but so far without success

14483830
portrait	landscape
i m using auto-layout and the hopes were to use auto-layout to manage the cell layout on transition from portrait to landscape but that seems to be a complete bust

14483830
width	height
the size is stuck at whatever the width and height are defined as in the size inspector for that table

14483830

no matter where i check when i get the size of the display controller the width and height are fixed at the original size for portrait mode

14483839

to be honest if you already have a site up and running and you just want a cms joomla or wordpress is sort of overkill

14483845
hide	show
i did not hide show the navigation bar

14483882
int	double
you re telling printf to expect an int when you re really passing it a double which is a logic error

14483900
post	get
note to create rather than retrieve the likes the request needs to be an http post rather than get since this service has a restful architecture

14483925
pull	push
however git also allows you to push checkout and pull commit changes to other git repositories which is why it can be a bit more complex to work with -- you re now working with multiple levels of repositories

pull	push
i could pull code from one repository then have other users push and pull with my repository

14483930

wordpress	joomla
trying to shoe-horn an already-built website into a cms like wordpress or joomla

14483997
implements	extends
one reason might be that it permits retrofitting extends a to b without breaking any existing classes that already happen to implements both

14484025
inherited	properties
for example if you need to create a new page called b that s going to be similar to a previous one called a and you ve an object for a that haves all the properties and methods it needs use to make a new object b that will inherited all the properties and methods from a as a would be the prototype of b

14484025
inherited	properties
you can also override the properties that b inherited from a by just declaring them with their new value

14484028
folder	directory
creating a new folder in the repository directory wouldn t sync it

14484035
client-side	server-side

contrary to validation data annotations this library allows you to perform imperative validation instead of declarative

14484296
inherited	subclassing
using runnable is usually recommended as if you subclassing thread you can t inherited from multiple classes in java so you re restricted that way

14484302
implements	extends
it is always recommended to implements runnable rather than extends thread as implements runnable would force you to implements run method

14484302
implements	extends
extends thread wouldn t force you as thread class it self implements run method

14484302
implements	extends
also as java doesn t support multiple inheritence using class s when your class is already extends another class and you need threading in your class implements runnable is the way to go in such scenarios

i have a fragment where i m trying to display a map and a listview side by side when in landscape and top down when in portrait mode

14484815
portrait	landscape
now it works as expected when it s in landscape orientation but for some reason when it s in portrait mode the map is taking more room than the weight i have listed down

14484815
portrait	landscape
below are the xml layouts for both landscape and portrait as well as the fragment code and some screenshots of how it looks currently

14484816
portrait	landscape
the problem is when i take a picture while holding the phone horizontally landscape the photo will be taken in landscape orientation while the ui remains in portrait mode

14484816

this means in landscape mode i get a wide image of 3264 x 2448 instead of the tall image 2448 x 3264 i get in portrait mode

14484840
getter	setter
i m following the big nerd ranch s guide to objective-c in one of the challenges chapter 17 he asks you to make 3 instance of an object that you ve created i ve made the class implemented the setter getter and two instance methods i ve then created 3 instances of the object and defined all of the variables

i use the create entities from database entries but for some reason i don t have a getter and setter for either userid or username

14485127
google-chrome	firefox
this happens on google-chrome and firefox

14485214
implements	extends
it is a better practice to have your task implements runnable and pass it as an argument to a thread s constructor than to extends thread directly

14485296
ant	maven
you can use ant maven or gradle etc

14485296
ant	maven
while i won t start a war of ant vs maven maven is much more than just a build tool and that may help you in future

14485337
ant	maven
others are with maven i am with ant it is like religion.

14485337
ant	maven
until is my decision i am using ant until my manager or my client mostly they want maven

14485337
ant	maven
for small sub-projects it is perfect the ant i would recommend maven for bigger one

the navigation hide show certain sections of the 1 page site when selected

14485345
hide	show
so far i have some jquery set up to run the hashchange function hide show the different content areas but i m at a loss of how to accomplish my goal with the secondary navigation

14485357
accessor	properties
you re correct - the invocation.method will be the properties accessor not the properties

14485364
getter	setter
so you should expect a getter setter for usernameid but not the embedded fields like you expect

14485381
width	height
as a note they do not have the same width or height and that is were the animations are most problematic

14485390
dictionary	map
define a dictionary hash map from hd to sum

lets say i rotate portrait to landscape

14485464
google-chrome	firefox
platforms tested google-chrome v24 firefox 18 ie 10

14485464

should also work with google-chrome firefox for android

14485501

chown chmod first.

14485541
mouseleave	mouseenter
i have this code which fades some icons to opacity 1.0 on mouseenter and back to 0.3 on mouseleave

14485552
pop-up	dialog
beginning in the memberdisplaylist inside the td the firstname and member_pic display properly according to the array but when the member_pic is clicked on the dialog div pop-up keeps displaying variables from row 1 and does not display the variables in respect to the row of which member_pic is selected

14485566
width	height
you would just need to play with the height and width of in .imageclip to suit your purpose and you could also use different values via media requests for narrow screen widths as well

14485583
put	get
issue 3 the crazy string of characters i m trying to put in the command key contains a which is resulting in an error expected i ve played around with trying to get it formatted correctly like in issue 2

14485601
versioning	upgrade
the code should work if you upgrade to the latest versioning currently 2.3.2

14485605
mouse	keyboard
if all you need is to set breakpoints without moving the mouse then you can navigate the input caret to the desired line with the keyboard and then press f5 to toggle breakpoints

14485620
ssms	sqlcmd
in ssms you will need to change your mode to sqlcmd mode which is available under the query menu

14485642
getter	setter
edit i personally wouldn t do this because i don t feel getter and setter should be used for this

14485655
integer	unsigned
i also don t think i can buy an idea expressed in comments below that implicit conversion of signed integer to unsigned in comparison the idiom bestows some additional powers on c programmer compared to explicit cast

14485681
wmv	flv
if i try flv wmv or other different containers then the bitrate is not honored

14485681
wmv	flv
also the bitrate that is automatically set for wmv is different from that of flv

14485714
int	double
note that casting the second operand is optional as double int always uses floating point division

14485714
min	max
something you can improve in your code this won t solve the problem above instead of subtracting the min of the max of the difference just take the absolute value of the difference

14485714
int	double
this solution now works for your cpoint instance with int coordinates as well as a maybe upcoming cpointf class with float double coordinates

14485772
width	height
measured width and height once they have been calculated

14485772
width	height
your component s onmeasure method should calculate a measurement width and height which will be required to render the component

14485781
post	get
i want to get post last modification craetion dates by particular users and then echo it

14485785
integer	unsigned
while a signed integer can hold values from -2147483648 to 2147483648 +- one or two an unsigned integer can range from 0 to 4294967296

14485785
integer	unsigned
that means if you compare a signed integer to an unsigned integer it may lead to false results altogether because internally the sign is represented by the msb of the integer

14485828
google-chrome	firefox
according to batarang it s painfully slow and when i get little more rows on the app it slows down the app and crashes firefox although google-chrome still handles it

14485856
implements	extends
the problem is that whether or not the trait will work depends on how we implements addall in the base class the functionality provided by the base class is fragile just as would be the case with a regular extends in java or any other programming language

14485907
mouse	keyboard
currently my application uses system.windows.forms for mouse and keyboard events

14485911
ant	maven
here is an example of how to use a classifier with maven ant run tasks

14485912
xfce	gnome
xfce thunar solution is basically the same as gnome nautilus

14485957
layoutparams	viewgroup
specify some layoutparams when you create your demoview or create a viewgroup to give it a size

14485961
subtract	add
based on the codepoints in your sample i would venture to say that you could subtract 0xf731 from the character values and then add 0x30 to convert them to ascii numbers

14485968
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
as soon as the title gets changed i know there was something new loaded so i checked for the url of the browser using various techniques ndde for firefox and opera checking for a specific window class for google-chrome etc..

14485975
width	height
image is stretched to full width of uiimageview and does not even take full height

14485979
pascal	delphi
even if your answer is not in delphi pascal language i ll have a look at it

14485982
folder	directory
you can move the git directory from one machine to another or say you want to migrate your project folder

14485982
folder	directory
all the information about origin is stored in .git folder which is created when you initialize a git repository under a directory on your system

14486023
google-chrome	firefox
what i get in ie firefox and google-chrome when i pass a query string like q john+smith+ca and json.stringify the matches variable is this

14486023
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome do the right thing when i call y.array.filter on the array

14486029
post	put
my suggestion is to put a randomval field on your post documents

14486029
post	get
if you conceptually think of this as an array you can pick all the even indexed post and pair them with an odd neighbor to get unique random pairs within categories

14486067
put	get
if you still get the error then put this into your gemfile

14486087
addclass	removeclass
and lastly i moved your addclass call to the bottom of the page so your removeclass didn t accidentially remove the newly clicked button

14486172
oncreate	recreate
you didn t show that code but hopefully it drops the table then calls oncreate to recreate the table now with the seat_no column

14486184
jboss	glassfish	jboss	weblogic	glassfish	weblogic
considering the fact that it is a java web project you said you use servlets you have to deploy your web app to some application server like glassfish jboss weblogic websphere etc or more simple web container like apache tomcat

14486184
postgresql	mysql
for instance when it comes to using database drivers mysql postgresql oracle etc tomcat advises the following while configuring jndi datasource quote

14486188
wavefront	fbx
if fbx is not a requirement i would suggest looking into the wavefront obj file format

14486194
istream	getline
here is a version of getline that uses streambuf instead of istream

14486201
getter	setter
even though your getter and setter are trivial they might change in the future

14486223
portrait	landscape
when the screenshot was taken the error only could be reproduced by changing to portrait and landscape again

14486243
x86	64bit
i am using linux 32bit and 64bit on x86

14486247
maven	pom.xml
you have to define a maven profile better to define a specific profile for each cases in your pom.xml like this

14486307
post	get
about incorrect id i ve noticed that the graph api s returns a different id from that used to get access to the post by browser

14486309
x86	64bit
amd needed some room to add new opcodes for rex prefixes and some other new instructions when they developed the 64bit x86 extensions

14486309
cpu	processors
since some operating systems use gs as processors local storage they need a way to have a pointer to a structure for each cpu they need to keep it somewhere that won t get clobbered by loading gs in user mode

14486320
getter	setter
so generally speaking the only place you should be referencing the field foo is in the getter and setter for the property foo

14486320
getter	setter
i m sure there exists some obscure situation where you would need to bypass the property s getter and setter and that s certainly okay to do but such situations would be the exception to the rule

14486361
oncreate	onstart
the general guidance is to load data in oncreate but not start doing anything until onstart

14486440
google-chrome	safari
however while it works in google-chrome and safari in mozilla and ie the submission is still going through hitting an apology page but still something i d rather just not see at all

14486448
google-chrome	firefox
this is working for ie8+ firefox and google-chrome all those were tested

14486465
width	height
you can use this javascript script to get the height and width of the browser

14486465
width	height
the width and height of the browsers will be stored in the viewportwidth and viewportheight variables respectively

14486486
post	get
i followed the many post on stackoverflow and various blog post it linked to that claimed to get it working but even after following very closely i could never replicate the results

14486493
post	get
without a name attribute browser won t post this input box s data to server and thus you won t get it in server side c# code

14486520
folder	directory
i figured it out what was the problem i had to change the permission on var www folder in order to be able to clone into that directory

14486555
width	margin
than you have to calculate the width of and fix it and also to give margin 0 auto

14486582
move	drag
we theorize that it has to do with the number of dom elements it has to move when you drag the map

14486582
width	height
i have tried adding pushpins with a defined height width and without icons in hopes of having an easy to move element one that doesn t need to be redrawn that could fire mouse events but to no avail

14486587
setinterval	settimeout
then use settimeout or setinterval to run the query in the background again every so often

14486603
inherited	subclassing
if i have an exception with an applicationexception inherited true rollback true but i want a subclassing to not rollback

14486634
portrait	landscape
in order to get images for all layouts you can specify the -land landscape and -port portrait extension to the dpi extensions

14486699
put	get
this works fine but if i try to put this form on my homepage i get an error.

14486734
put	get
sql express is out because itâ s so big and this app needs to go on some embedded systems that i could not likely get permission to put it on

14486760
mouseup	mousedown
so my idea is to bind the mouseup event handler to the document when the mousedown event handler is fired

14486804
mouseup	mousedown
it just tries to emulate mouse clicks with taps firing mousedown mouseup and click events consecutively but double taps just zoom in and out tha page

14486804
mouseup	mousedown
if it s released soon enough it fires then mousedown mouseup touchend and finally click events

14486804
mouseup	mousedown
in case of long tap after about half a second it fires mousedown and mouseup and touchend when the finger is lifted with no click event at the end

14486804
mouseup	mousedown
firefox for android correctly fires the touchstart event and in case of short tap fires mousedown mouseup touchend and click afterwards

14486804
mouseup	mousedown
in case of long tap it fires mousedown mouseup and finally touchend events

14486804
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
opera mobile does the same thing of google-chrome and firefox for a short tap but in case of long press activates some sort of sharing feature that i really want to disable

14486804
mouseup	mousedown
chrome beta does the usual for short taps but in case of long taps it doesn t fire the mouseup event anymore just touchstart then mousedown after half a second then touchend when the finger is lifted

14486804
opera	firefox
when the finger is moved now it behaves like firefox and opera mobile

14486810
nsdata	nsjsonserialization
to make it work create a string from the url content at first with nsisolatin1stringencoding and then create the nsdata you want to use in the nsjsonserialization with a nsutf8 encoding

14486847
persistent	transient
the external object can make use of an internal entity of another aggregate however it reference should be transient - meaning that it is not persistent

14486910
google-chrome	safari
if i fire-and-forget an animation it is on par with google-chrome safari but if i drag and render i often end up only seeing the end frame after i release the drag

14486914
translation	localization
today i runt into this trouble when i tried to scan my plugin for translation and to create the localization files for it but i saw that poedit scanned all files but did not parse all the strings

14486923
getter	setter
i also defined getter and setter with property

14486931
submit	submission
this is the submission i get on the server side on submit formatted for sanity

14486955
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication
imagine you wanted to write a multiplication method that takes two numbers and multiplies them but you only have addition and subtraction at your disposal

14486960
int	chars
if i convert the int to a binary string representation and i iterate thru the chars the result is correct but i am assuming that i should not be doing this with strings

14486967
spaces	delimiter
the update attribute in many primefaces components will typically take a spaces delimiter string of component ids that should be redrawn after a jsf ajax request response has occurred

14486987
disk	ram
when i review the hardware requirements of many database backed enterprise solutions i find requirements for the application server os processor ram disk space etc for the database server versions ram etc and requirements for the client

14487039

put	get
the point i get a little bit confused over as well is where to put the xml.

14487603
for-loop	arrays
then use a random number generator in a for-loop to choose each digit from your arrays

14487629
for-loop	loops
but node.js runs for-loop and command after loops at the same time

14487640
outputstream	inputstream
an inputstream that works exactly like an outputstream

14487725
accessor	properties
also the properties accessor in class1 is params so it should be.

14489961
int	double
num2bit by setting the 51st and 52nd bit to 1 this forces the exponent to be a specific number otherwise there would be overflow - then when you return int32_t o.u32.lo you know you are getting an int back with the same value as the low 32 bits of the double since the exponent is fixed

14489961
int	double
so this is a trick to get the int value of most double quickly

min	max
if in that case when you fill the map or even if with your approach the list build another map for min max price of a countrycode

unification	inference
because the unification performed as part of type inference transcends quantifier scope you can sometimes end up in a situation where ghc would have to unify a type variable in an outer scope with a quantified type from a nested scope which is how you get compiler errors about escaping types and skolems and whatnot the latter i assume being related to skolem normal form

width	height
in order to do this i am seeing what is the smallest dimension of the image height width making it 100

14492378
width	height
so height becomes 150 and width becomes 400px so now i calculate the offset

14492885
int	double
when converting a double value greater than 2 63 to an unsigned int something bad happens perhaps saturation so the author subtracts 2 64 to make it a negative number then casts that to a signed negative int then casts the result to an unsigned int which will have a value greater than 2 63

clang	llvm
so you will need to switch between the open source and apple llvm clang in order to compile for both 10.6 and tvos watchos since bitcoding is required for those oses

14494515
clang	llvm
so the version of clang llvm that ships with xcode checks to see if the deployment target is set for 10.6 when using libc++ and prevents you from compiling

14494515
clang	llvm
however this flag is not included in the open source version of clang llvm

14494515

also take a look at silex as this has lower overhead than symfony and works with symfony forms

14501349
symfony	silex
move your symfony or silex front controller s to a sub-folder probably named signup in your case

14501349
symfony	silex
above the and below the symfony or silex code in your front controller s

14501367
tablet	galaxy
it works fine in samsung galaxy tablet but fails in galaxy s2 s3 mobiles

14501377
width	height
i really tries to create a list its width and height will be nearly equal size of the longest list item and number of items on the list respectively

14501412
post	get
so if we do on the data you post above we get

14501423
post	get
i got the post request but after that i have a redirect code 302 and i didnt get the response with html rigth

14501550
postorder	inorder
while this can be a valid approach design patterns do have variations i think that in this case is better to decouple the tree structure from the traversing order pre-order inorder postorder

14501550
postorder	inorder
for evaluating the expression you will generally use a postorder while for printing the expression you can use inorder as in your example

14501596
public	protected
unset all private protected or public variables that reference other objects

14501597
button	checkbox
if you have custom image selector for checkbox or radiobutton you must set same button and background property such as this

14501597
button	checkbox
you can control size of checkbox or radio button padding with background property

14501630
strftime	strtotime
second for compare date as string or int you should still use strtotime and not strftime

14501728
onkeyup	onkeydown
onkeydown onkeyup onprepareoptionsmenu oncreateoptionsmenu didn t

14501743
getter	setter
the locks around the setter and getter don t help this as there s nothing to stop the lock blocks themseves being called out of order

14501788
oncreate	setcontentview
i think you have wrongly initialized your setcontentview of the oncreate

14501804
jar	war
this however assumes that you have a pojo and or a jar war .

14501806
int	double
since d prints int value and not double value

14501818
min	max
use the same font ie ttf for both text view and use android ems in textview to define max and min value of it

14501831
min	max
the reason is that when you remove a min|max point ace calls initrange which iterates over every point to recalculate those min max points it uses internally

14501831
min	max
as i m processing 1000 telemetry frames per sec and a have a small viewport forced by ace memory allocation strategies i hit min max points very often on the remove function

14501885
jar	manifest.mf
when you have an executable jar myapp.jar with entry in the manifest.mf

simply add view with autoresizing mask flexible top margin and flexible width

14502112
equals	gethashcode
the struct need more code and i get a compiler warning about how i should override equals and gethashcode because i m overriding and but if i do that i m not getting anything from using a struct from the semantic and syntactic point of view because it wold be exactly the same code with a conventional class

14502114
width	height
the inline styles are generated in php and can t think of a way of passing a numeric value other than by style width height etc that js can detect

14502169
udp	tcp
one ip address can only hold a 2 bytes port as is defined in tcp and udp protocol

14502170
google-chrome	firefox
note html5 data attributes are supported only in modern browsers like ie 9+ google-chrome 12+ firefox 5+

autocomplete	multi-select
you should investigate igor vaynberg s wicket-select2 project which offers very nice features for autocomplete multi-select etc

14502332
width	height
i randomly atribute css properties like height width or animation-duration with jquery

14502376
openni	kinect
openni 2.0 is not working with the current sensorkinect to interface the kinect in linux

14502393
inherited	properties
you state that your interface inherited from inotifypropertychanged so it can reasonably be expected to notify listeners of properties changes through the propertychanged event

14502402
superclass	subclassing
i have a superclass called piece and subclassing for king knight queen etc

14502409
rtsp	rtmp
i know the flash video players out there usually support rtmp or rtsp but i ve never heard of a player that supports http video streaming

14502423
serializable	deserialization
the base class should be publically distributed or else you will have to write serializable deserialization mecanisms

14502472
inherited	properties
the rotation properties of a ccnode and ccsprite which inherited from ccnode is measured in degrees with clockwise rotation being positive

14502474
superclass	subclassing
if your subclassing override the canmove method on superclass piece mypiece.canmove endx endy will be enough.based on the object type pointed by the mypiece reference at runtime jvm will decide which method it should call.this is called dynamic method dispatch

14502488
implements	extends
i would then have classes which implements extends the piece class each denoting their own behaviour with a canmove method

14502493
mongodb	bson
serialization towards bson format for mongodb

14502541
folder	directory
if your program will start from the directory containing the sources and images folder then you can refer them by images imagefile

ubuntu	linux
to change fonts in the eclipse workspace with linux ubuntu 10.04 lucid lynx i modified system fonts desktop â system â preferences â appearance â fonts

14502597
int	chars
if you want to convert a chars into int here is your answer get chars value in java

14502601
getter	setter
i don t want to declare the variables with this as i want variables to be private which can be accessed only through getter setter method

14502611
folder	directory
this morning i copied a directory from my local networked drive to temp folder for testing

14502688
gmail	hotmail
to avoid this problem with spacing between images in gmail which occurs in hotmail as well you have to put as an inline css style in your images

14502786
int	chars
the funcdtion should handle int and std string or chars

14502789
pull	push
this will add an alias in your .git config file for the remote clone push pull site url

14502791
implements	extends
since you have several views for each listitem or row in your listview you need to implements extends your own arrayadapter and override the getview method

14502794
put	get
now what i need to get is the name and the id and put these values into a dictionary

14502830
base	fractions
i ve checked out websites about real-world betting but they all base it on fractions not decimals which i can t do in js as it can t deal with fractions like that as far as i know

14502833
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
in my case the application is navigation based and the problem was that the main uinavigationcontroller s view was being added as a subview of an uiviewcontroller s view

i have a problem building an android maven project eclipse m2e android for maven

14502899
ssl	https
however when i use a ssl encrypted connection https all my ajax calls fail

14502909
post	get
like the get requests it is extremely simple to send post requests using android-annotations

14502942
children	parent
now let s say i ll fetch all parent and i want to know how many children each of the parent has i ll do something like

14502942
children	parent
it will generate a query for each parent even if i include the children as above in the query

14502943
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
any other browser safari firefox opera shows the same bug but all the time

14502964
versioning	upgrade
migrating will update the core file and database tables and thus should show all the core joomla modules in the module manager however it does not upgrade your 3rd party extensions therefore you will need to download the joomla 2.5 compatible versioning

14503050
popupwindow	dialog
it doesnt matter if i use dialog or popupwindow

14503055
backgrounding	multitasking
note that this topic is part of the broader topic multitasking for windows phone which includes the backgrounding file transfers tasks etc

14503091
wmv	flv	mp4	h.264
therefore i was using the default for flv which as you mentioned is flv1 and h.264 for mp4 or msmpeg4v3 for wmv

14503138
visualvm	yourkit
i have used yourkit and visualvm to take dumps and have analysed dumps but these spikes are momentary and by the time the dump is taken nothing remains

14503149
google-chrome	firefox
alternatively some of the browser testing libraries like splinter work by loading the page up in an actual browser like firefox or google-chrome before scraping

14503193
width	height
width and height of myview2 is 200 200

14503205
subtract	add
to do this i guess i have to parse the string 10 gb to get the integer value and then add or subtract depending on the radiobutton chosen

14503228
post	get
so based on that you can identify whether it is a get or post request

14503242
tunnel	vpn
i can imagine something like a tunnel proxy or a tcp-based vpn where that might make sense but in general case some higher level protocol still imposes some request-response semantics that again would impose require arbitration among sending and receiving threads

14503250
mdpi	hdpi
yes they ll scale so if you put a 133 x 133px drawable in the tvdpi folder it ll be 100px on mdpi 150px for hdpi and so on

14503255
mdpi	hdpi
i believe they will android always picks the best available image inside your directories if you have an mdpi phone and two resource types hdpi and xhdpi it will try to pick the one immediately above the requested density hdpi instead of the bigger one because it correctly assumes it going to be enough

14503329
ceil	floor
if the number of executions for a given probability x is to be limited to floor x and ceil x and never floor x -1 or less or ceil x +1 or more so 1.5 is 50 1 and 50 2 and 0.7 is 70 1 and 30 0

14503349
versioning	upgrade
if so please upgrade to a more recent versioning of itextsharp

14503352
robotium	calabash
if you need to automate native mobile applications take a look at appium calabash frank or robotium

14503362
superclass	subclassing
instead of using a mkpolylineview you can use your own subclassing of mkoverlayview superclass of mkpolylineview and then override drawmaprect zoomscale incontext where you draw the lines yourself

14503420
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
works in ie firefox and opera while google-chrome and safari give the user prompts

14503429
designer	design-view
i recently stepped into the shoes of a web designer who was flash-crazy and used dreamweaver s design-view exclusively

14503430
width	height
just specify the width and the height of your image

14503480
clang	icc
which g++ and clang accept but icc rejects correctly imho

14503515
post	get
some post on so like stop the tag builder escaping single quotes asp.net mvc 2 have posted away to get around this but i personally would not take that route

14503516
centos	linux
i have a vhost on a centos machine linux i-8941-35408-vm 2.6.18-308.11.1.el5xen #1 smp tue jul 10 09 29 47 edt 2012 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 gnu linux

14503516
folder	directory
the directory listing of the public folder is as follows

14503526
for-loop	arrays
you are then looping over the nodelist which can be thought of as an arrays with you for-loop

14503570
for-loop	arrays
it s a common pattern to use a for-loop to iterate through all elements in an arrays so you can do something to each item

14503596
public	protected
if you really need something called polmorphically at destruction you can enforce two-ohase destruction with a private protected destructor and a public destroy method that first calls the virtual function and then self-destructs

14503606
rubygems	bundler
you can declare multiple rubygems sources and bundler will look for gems in the order you declared the sources

14503607
min	max
using min and max users fewer resources than count distinct

14503616
chunked	transfer-encoding
transfer-encoding chunked

14503625
integer	fractions
then on each iteration add x to the carry value return the integer part and carry forward the fractions part

14503642
gzipinputstream	gzipoutputstream
the simplest and most compatible approach is to gzip the file as you write it by wrapping your stream with gzipoutputstream and reading it wrapped with gzipinputstream

14503666
domcontentloaded	onreadystatechange
currently i use document.addeventlistener on domcontentloaded or if not available document.attachevent on onreadystatechange and if both not given i use window.onload functionality

14503686
eventlet	gevent
you can use python s select module to do this yourself or you may find it cleaner using a library like eventlet or gevent

14503758
udp	tcp
the problem is on the live server which is far away geographically clients can receive and send tcp messages and they can send udp messages but they do not receive udp messages

14503765
pascal	delphi
no js knowledge needed - write in pure delphi pascal

14503782
explode	implode
the solution i ve made is a fulltext search for the whole string without doing any explode implode functs

14503784
mouseleave	mouseenter
since that may end up a little too sensitive so you could go with the alternative of just moving on hover in which case you d use mouseenter and mouseleave events instead and just start an interval on mouseenter using that moves the background image a pixel then clear that interval clearinterval interval

14503797
google-chrome	safari
update i made a jsfiddle with the issue and realised it s only occuring on webkit based browsers google-chrome and safari

14503817
jobs	cron
this is needed because usually the environment in which cron jobs are run is pretty restricted

14503824
x86	64bit
on a x86 system a memory location can hold 4 bytes 32 8 of data therefore a single memory address in a 64bit system can hold 8 bytes per memory address

14503863
width	height
if you point a element at a the width height of the are ignored according to the svg specification

14503863
width	height
that way the width height of the use will apply to the rect

14503863
width	height
you probably want to make the rect s width height 100 within the symbol

14503957
mouseover	mouseout
on mouseover mouseout high light the respective div

14503969
udp	tcp
the file endpoints are resource based endpoints such as ftp and sftp endpoints as opposed to event based endpoints jms and vm or tcp based endpoints tcp http udp etc

14504026
subtraction	addition
it is because it will not be defined where you will reach in the code when you do addition and subtraction operation on the function pointers

14504123
qtableview	qabstractitemview
i looked at the documentation and saw that qtableview is derived from qabstractitemview class which have a signal called activated and a slot called edit

14504126
post	get
as mentioned by johan post shouldbe used here instead of get

14504129
put	get
i will get this out put

14504145
int	chars
an int constant expression shall have int type and shall only have operands that are int constants enumeration constants chars constants sizeof expressions whose results are int constants _alignof expressions and floating constants that are the immediate operands of casts

14504157
google-chrome	firefox
ie 8 firefox and google-chrome work

14504162
getter	setter
my first guess is that you don t have any synthesize anywhere so there are no setter getter

14504163
ant	maven
if so then perhaps you can use ant with maven and use ant s copy task which has a preservelastmodified property

14504173
wordpress	joomla
wheresrhys solution below is for me the best i ve just been using it to create a menu for wordpress joomla where the css can automatically change the colour when a new li is added

14504204
hide	show
i managed to make it work exactly the way i wanted utilizing show and hide

14504226
spaces	linefeed
returns first second and the linefeed was lost to just a spaces

14504236
post	get
you should also not mix post and get parameters i would recommend to stick to one of them depending on your action get for data-retrievel search post for user-input

14504236
post	get
if you need any further information i suggest lookup http verbs in wikipedia and phps handling of get and post parameters

14504249
getter	setter
i guess above variables are not having setter and getter mean you would be require to synthesize them

14504258
int	chars
the really bad ones are when you mix string with int formatting - strings will print nicely as strange perhaps numbers but numbers are unlikely to work when passed as strings - because a string is a pointer to the address of the first chars - and most numbers are not valid pointers in a typical system so it will crash

14504260
rss	feed
if this is a small blog and you want to load all the posts with their related tags and comments in a home page or rss feed you can load the entire dataset in memory with 4 queries using linq2objects to join them with something like

14504289
mp3	ogg
if you want compatibility with html5 you will want to encode in mp3 and ogg vorbis

14504304
blogspot	blogger
i use javascript in blogspot blogger post

14504364
serializable	deserialization
the serializable runtime associates with each serializable class a version number called a serialversionuid which is used during deserialization to verify that the sender and receiver of a serializable object have loaded classes for that object that are compatible with respect to serializable

14504364
serializable	deserialization
however it is strongly recommended that all serializable classes explicitly declare serialversionuid values since the default serialversionuid computation is highly sensitive to class details that may vary depending on compiler implementations and can thus result in unexpected invalidclassexceptions during deserialization

14504366
rss	feed
i m trying to load the contents of what should be an rss feed in a .ashx file on a client s site

14504411
pop-up	dialog
following is the code to pop-up the dialog

14504495
ilist	iqueryable	ienumerable	iqueryable	ienumerable	ilist
the datacontractserializer special cases collection interfaces like ienumerable and ilist but it doesn t special case derived interfaces like iqueryable

14504499
portrait	landscape
i used the states feature that fb has built in to handle portrait landscape and phone tablet configs

14504516
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome 23 and firefox 18 is driving me nut

14504528
getter	setter
adding setter and getter is ok and does not impact serialization but the compiler might generate another uid when you recompile the class which will lead to an exception when you try to deserialize your data

14504543
firefox	safari
my signalr test app works fine with with ie9 firefox and even safari on my iphone

14504636
hash	salt
it is also possible to store a hash of the key but i would treat the key as a password and take all the defensive measures you would take in storing a password in your database use bcrypt salt the hash etc

14504649
width	height
along with setting up some variables height and width of the grid and then getchilddrawingorder itself

14504661
yacc	bison
at that point you may want to look at the yacc bison features for operator precedence

14504665
getter	setter
alternatively you could make a getter and setter for the id field you need setting getting for example if you have an id called user_id

14504693
width	height
for an iphone 4 screen width is going to be 320px and for a typical ip camera you probably have a 3 4 aspect ratio so you want a screen height of 240px just as listed above

14504693
put	get
just like anything on the web if you put it out there unsecured anyone can get a hold of it

14504697
post	get
now i m a little stuck with ajax calls because i use two kinds of calls offcourse the get and post

14504697
post	get
so an include for a post and a redirect for a get

14504718
fortran	ada
--enable-languages c c++ ada fortran obj c obj-c++ --disable-sjlj-exceptions --with-dwarf2 --enable-shared --enable-libgo mp --disable-win32-registry --enable-libstdcxx-debug

14504728
hash	md5
when a page is clicked my system searches the db for username + userloggedin if its true then allows access to the page but what it also does is deletes the record its just searched for and inserts a new record for the username + userloggedin with a different md5 hash

14504758
width	height
see what has been changed and try to play with width height values in the inspector

14504766
post	get
i am trying to do a simple post request with form-data to an api but i always get a status 401 in return

14504784
chown	chmod
i also edited suoders to add the rights for apache s user www-data to execute all the commands i need echo chmod chown script.sh ... still don t works

14504807
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i ve come across similar issues where a font will look fine in safari google-chrome firefox on a mac but be too thin in windows especially ie

14504832
rss	feed
i m working on getting special terminology out of rss feed from online news papers

14504832
rss	feed
i had the same problem with lwp simple and xml rss parser and i managed it by using filehandle but know i want to get the feed from multiples sites saved in an array

14504869
next	except
however i would like the x axis labels from this 2nd example to match that of the first example except with a kind of negative log - first tick moving from the centre to the left could be -1 then the next could be -10 the next -100 but all equidistant

14504894
put	get
how to do this inside your getview method you will get the position just put an if statement to check whether position is equal to the size of the list then add the button else add your actual list item which you have inflated from a layout

14504926
postgresql	mysql
our core knowledge is php so our initial idea is a lamp stack maybe replacing mysql with postgresql with memcached

14504970
folder	directory
you can include multiple directory if they re comma-separated or use the add folder option

14504975
put	get
just as when you put a table name twice in a from clause they don t get implicitly joined or bound together they are considered as two independant sets of rows

14504979
submit	submission
and when i submit the form i have a little checking done for post back and if the post back is set then i again include the same class but perform other function in the class.so when at first when i refresh the page the first class included in the form works fine but when submission the form then class included in checking post back work but not the one in the form

14504985
nlopt	alglib
i ve tried using alglib levmar and nlopt

14505054
openscenegraph	maya
however it might be time consuming to write a program based on openscenegraph .so i was wondering of writing a plugin for maya and use the strong rendering of maya to apply my algorithm

14505079
stdout	stderr
i replace all printf to syslog so i thought of redirecting stdout and stderr to syslog

14505163
apache	nginx
if you don t need all the bells and whistles of apache maybe you could go with something smaller nginx

14505245
slideup	slidedown
first of all you don t need to use callback function which manipulates css display block none after slideup slidedown because these methods automaticly element after complete

14505246
apache	nginx
writing your own is unlikely to perform as well as something like apache or nginx even if you do write it as lightweight as possible and it s almost certain to have major security holes

14505248
ctime	mktime	difftime	mktime
the asctime ctime difftime gmtime localtime and mktime

14505248
solaris	aix
similar documentation can be found for other systems such as aix hp-ux solaris etc

14505251
pop-up	dialog
i remember that when i started a new internet project i got a pop-up dialog for log in and registration by default

14505287
folder	directory
1 added it in the lib folder present under the root directory of my new application and then added it to the java build path

14505291
width	height
if the image height and width values are the changing parts this should do the trick

14505401
post	get
i can login and see the admin dashboard but if i visit a scheduled post then i still get page not found

14505410
pop-up	dialog
i believe the pop-up dialog you re referring to was just the jquery ui dialog that the sample project used to use

14505410
pop-up	dialog
the project was built to support both a straight request to login and one via the jquery ui dialog which was slimmed down to look like it was only a pop-up

14505412
scheme	racket

let s say you have a batch of images of varying shapes and sizes some landscape some portrait but all of course rectangular

14507493
portrait	landscape
right so here s the css for both portrait and landscape

14507493
width	height
the most important things are the width and height and the overflow hidden

14507493
width	height
for the landscape image declaration .landscape img the height is fixed at 175px which resizes the original height and the width is set to auto which resizes the original width but only to the point of relating to the bounding square which in this case is 175px

14507493

it works the same way for portrait only that the width and height is switched where height is auto and width is 175px

14513423
for-loop	loops
i usually just use a for-loop to loops between tickets by using ticketid column auto increamenting however when i use this one i might have ticketid 1 and then ticketid 4 since i m filtering it by the issuer

14513470
cifs	smb
smb cifs is the prime example although probably no one uses smb over internet as-is

14513506
range	max
unfortunately this approach doesn t take in to account the current date you can solve for that by sorting the data by ascending date and then limit the max and match functions to the date range you are searching inside i m not enough of an excel master to figure out a way to do this without some form of pre-organized data

14513518
google-chrome	firefox
also i do not see this issue in firefox google-chrome but only in ie8

14513541
gtk	cairo
just drawing it per se is not a huge deal - i can already manage that with what i know of gtk and cairo

14513566
width	height
in order to have the child linearlayouts take up a percentage of the parent linearlayout linearlayout a then you need to set the parent s weightsum total layout_weight of child linearlayouts and then set the child linearlayouts width height property to 0dip and set their layout_weight to the desired percentage

14513593
addclass	removeclass
try addclass and removeclass they re jquery functions

14513741
ivar	subclassing
background if i subclassing a uitextfield and override the getter for delegate the built-in behavior of uitextfield that relies on the delegate appears to be using the backing ivar to access the delegate and not touching the overridden getter

14513754
children	parent
the problem is these need to occupy the same el in the dom so i can t nest the children inside the parent

14513754
children	parent
that s because from the outside i want parent views to only refer to contact as if the children were private

14513768

if you need a reliable order of iteration use either a treemap you ll get entries sorted by key or linkedhashmap you ll get insertion order

14514056

note that the treemap has a different mechanism of deciding the equality of its keys so you would either make the keys comparable or provide a comparator on the side to deal with the key ordering

14514087
button	checkbox
i have several array checkbox 1 submit button and 1 dropdown menu

14514087

14514476
gridview	entitydatasource
the gridview gv is bound to a different entitydatasource than the ddl

14514491
min	max
but if you take into account also local extremes min max which are the first derivatives of cubic function and force breaks on those all then the sub curves are all quadratic and can be presented by quadratics

opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i ve done a quick test in google-chrome ie opera firefox and it seems to work ok

14514761
width	height
i think the explicit height and width rules you are applying to your ul elements are what s doing it

14514819
nsurl	nsstring
the method urlforresource withextension returns an nsurl not an nsstring

14514855
portrait	landscape
ive built plenty of camera related apps before but they always were built in an activity where i had locked the view to landscape or portrait after the user took the picture

14514871
onmousedown	onmouseup
i would try using the onmousedown and onmouseup events to get the start and end points and go from there

14514873
shapefile	geojson
you mention the ability to convert from shapefile to geojson but in case any others have questions on how to perform this operation you can use quantum gis to export to geojson

14514939
for-loop	arrays
what will happen is i suppose there are 5 strings in arrays for example when the updatetext runs....the for-loop gets executed instantly....i becomes 2..3..4..5 very fast and the text changes from string1 to string2 ... string3 .. string4 ...and finally string5 so fast that you see only going from string1 to string5

14514972
fflush	gets
otherwise tail -f won t see it until the buffer gets fflush and i imagine that you d like to see each output operation as it occurs

14514975
aggregate-functions	sum
because aggregate-functions eliminate null values you will sometimes encounter a pattern similar to the sum case... you are probably accustomed to seeing whose expression returns a 1 or 0 which get added up

14514975
min	max
in this case you can use a max or min aggregate because again since the null values will get eliminated by the aggregate only the one that actually has a non-null will be returned and hence be the max

14514998
hide	show
this code simply show hide the div mp3content containing a slider with all the playlists

14515033

i m using linux ubuntu os if that makes a difference

14515045
realloc	calloc
you will likely want to wrap calloc realloc c

14515045
free	malloc
define your own malloc and free functions and access the system versions using dyld rtld_next malloc as shown here

14515045
realloc	calloc
again you will likely want to wrap calloc realloc c

14515045
calloc	malloc	realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc
for completeness you will likely want to wrap calloc realloc and the other functions defined in malloc_zone_t in usr include malloc malloc.h as well

14515057

its height is 2x its width

14515073
filesystems	hfs+

geany	gedit
this appears to be a bug that i ve found using javascript in gedit when you change the font from ubuntu mono to monospace and geany so far

14515189
put	get
also you probably want to put all the statements related to self.svc inside the if block otherwise the setuserlocation and the nslog get executed even if the if condition fails

14515194
free	malloc
if set causes abort 3 to be called if an error was encountered in malloc 3 or free 3 such as a calling free 3 on a pointer previously free

14515224
getter	setter
as the actual contents of myclass1 is an implementation detail the getter and setter provide a unified way to get and set the class contents even if they are interdependant here _z does not exists internally but for the user z is a variable like x and y

14515224
getter	setter
now to avoid to have to write getter setter for x and y one can use a wrapper like this

14515224
getter	setter
my question is very general is it dangerous to replace getter setter of classes by the proposed wrapper when the getter setter just return set an internal value

14515264
x86	64bit
i would also note that your code looks like x86 not 64bit code at all

14515350

update the .change method to use show hide explicitly based on checked state instead of using .toggle

14515459
jar	war
i inserted the jar in war web-inf lib xxx.jar add to build path

14515479
google-chrome	firefox
you should really try and use the inspector that is built into your web browser preferably google-chrome in my opinion or perhaps firebug for firefox

14515482
cpu	hyperthreading
what you do is heavily cpu and memory bound so better have drawing thread count same as real core count not counting hyperthreading

14515518
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i have been trying to develop a simple extension for safari firefox and google-chrome in wich a form is presented to a user on a pop-up and after being filled out is locally evaluated and the response to the user is defined on that evaluation

opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
the code works find on every other browser we have tested on android google-chrome firefox and opera

14515818
uiview	subviews
the second method works for uiview but not so well for uitoolbars and is impossible for uibuttons so the cleanest solution i ve found when you need to include lots of different subviews is to attach a single secondary uiview to your view controller as a container that never gets shown put all your secondary views in there and use the uitableviewcell trick to make everything visible

14515822
maven	pom.xml
here are my maven dependencies from pom.xml file

14515832
getter	setter
as you mentioned the main purpose of getter and setter are to provide a unified way of accessing and setting your private instance variables

14515832
getter	setter
from your wrapper solution if sometime down the track of program lifecycle you decide to change a setter you can just throw away the wrapper and replace it with the original getter setter like in myclass1 -- without having to change all other components of the code that calls it

14515833
implements	extends
2nd way could be writing your own proxy extends ext.data.proxy.rest and implements buildurl such that it checks for data and append it to url

14515867
int	chars
for all elements of alist check against all elements of blist and where the chars of the alist element pair is equal to the chars in the blist add one to the int value of the alist element pair and remove the chars from blist

hash	md5
the md5 hash of the current session identifier becomes the new session identifier and a flag is set to indicate that the regeneration has occurred

14515936
16-bit	64bit
at different times both 16-bit and 32 bits have been reasonably common and for a 64bit implementation it should probably be 64bit

14515936
int	chars
you d use int8_t instead of chars if and only if you want an int type guaranteed to be exactly 8 bits in size

14516011

the orbit function will dynamically determine the height and width of your set of images and scale accordingly but make sure all your images are the same size or the larger images will peek out on the sides

14516191
hash	hmac
need to generate hmac sha256 hash in objective c as in java

14516221
hash	salt
we create a random unique salt and append it to a password and then hash it and finally store the unhashed salt and hash password salt combination together in the database

14516253
hash	salt
the most efficient way to salt a hash would be to have a dynamic record-specif one and a static one stored in a read-only file on the system

14516283
dpkg	aptitude	dpkg	apt
you can then remove it using the system package manager apt synaptic aptitude dpkg

14516286
int	chars
the data structure you are looking for is a finite map map chars int

14516286
put	get
i would also get rid of the meaningless assumptions such as that keys are char -- you can just say they are any type k for key that satisfies the necessary constraints that you can put it in a map which requires that it is ord erable

14516326
post	get
i know that for whatever reason images in a post are held within an array so i thought doing the following would suffice to get the first image

14516407

entities has associations to other objects this may be an association to a single item many-to-one or an association to a collection one-to-many many-to-any

14516678
subtraction	add
you do get into indexing overruns with the subtraction of 1 from indices at the high end of the scale so you probably ought to add an extra element on the lookup vector after you decide what result you want to see

as its just java code and if you are using routebuilder then you can juse have getter setter for orderhandler and then set the desired implementation on routebuilder

14516898
width	height

one-definition-rule	inlining
in modern compilers providing this inlining hint for a function is mostly ignored except for the effects it has on the one-definition-rule

14517689
getter	setter
the designers of c++ wanted to enable object-oriented programming with good data hiding so they expected to see lots of getter and setter functions

i was expecting that beforepagehide will fire before the transition and hide the menu div and that pagebeforeshow would show it again coming back

i ve tested this in firefox and safari and both behave the same

edit code about mouseover mouseleave

14527298

min	max
my idea was to build a local queue for every turn and then extract the max min value from that queue to bring it to the upper queue the queue from the preceding turn

14527609
mouseleave	mouseenter
another option would be to play with the mouseenter mouseleave events on the link and use a common flag between the event handlers so that they know about each other

i know some cms s like joomla or drupal or even wordpress are very good at it but as the number of users grow i m seeing some performance issues

14527726
octal	decimal
so if you simply used 0010 in a context where a number was expected the value would evaluate as 8 because 0010 is a number in octal notation to cmd and 8 is its decimal equivalent

14527728
rsa	dsa
also you can found some answers on small rsa or dsa lib without dependencies

14527777
mouse	keyboard
even taking for granted that the users have had time to process the directions on screen there s also transition time between moving from keyboard to mouse or touch where it s even worse as you have to deal with the ui shifting to hide the soft-keyboard which means there s even more variance between different users and their ability to follow the directions before the time limit you ve chosen is over

14527794
curb	libcurl
i m working with curb a ruby wrapper around libcurl

entities	entitymanager
not entirely sure i understand the question but just to be clear the breeze entitymanager does not support multiple entities of the same type with the same key -1 in your case

14528184

it sounds like what you want to do is retrieve a bunch of fake entities into the entitymanager and then conditionally convert a few of them into real new entities and save them causing these records to be added to the database

14528267
instances	transient
pass a transient instances to a session method that expects a

14528267
instances	transient
baking a transient instances make sure you have loaded references before passing that transient instances to the save method

onmouseover	onload
i have a page where i am trying to load same page on facebox style and if i place onmouseover link on that page and hover it just works fine but when i try with onload it is not triggering the event

14528295
onmouseover	onload
for testing with mouseover you need to change the onload to onmouseover in firebug

14528339
std	ostream
specifically std fixed indicates the same basic format as f in the format string so that for example precision means the same thing for both the format string and the ostream

no matter whether mutable or not the element equality and hashcode methods in hashmap are inherited from hashtable and hashtable.utils and are protected meaning any subclassing can override it easily

14528527
sorting	filtering
custom models combined with views are more flexible they allow the use of proxy models especially qsortfilterproxymodel which makes basic sorting and filtering quite simple

14528533
post	put
you need to extract the authenticity_token from the login page and put it into your form post

14528562

mp3	aiff	mp3	wav	wav	aiff
aiff is a leading format along with sdii and wav used by professional-level audio and video applications and unlike the better-known lossy mp3 format it is non-compressed which aids rapid streaming of multiple audio files from disk to the application and lossless

14528798
sorting	grouping
to avoid the overhead of sorting that grouping by produces add order by null

14528802
avcapturesession	avassetreader
as far as i can tell the problem is that the method addoutput exists on both the avcapturesession and avassetreader classes

14528802
avcapturesession	avassetreader
apparently the compiler thinks my mocksession is an avassetreader but i don t know why it chooses that class instead of avcapturesession

14528802
avcapturesession	avassetreader
if i expect a different method on avcapturesession that does not exist on avassetreader then it compiles

14528838
int	chars
if you know the maximum number of chars for the string which you are going to handle means use array and int data type inside a structure

14528973
min	max
this means that for every point in time x you must draw a vertical line between the min y1 and max y2 value

14528973
min	max
this would be simple to implement but the problem is that if i would just draw individual vertical lines there is the possibility to have gaps in the signal namely if the previous min is higher than the next max or the next max is lower than the previous min

14528973
min	max
when drawn using standard polyline routines the pen will draw from the last position max to the start of the new line min which is a much larger distance causing the signal look thicker than it would be if i just connected the previous min to the new max if the trend is downwards or the previous max to the new min if the trend is upwards

14529012

hide	show
this is a crude proof-of-concept demonstration using your show hide code

14529241
width	text-align
after removing that you could make the list inline-block so it takes up the width of its children and then using a simple text-align on the div

14529353
subtract	add
if you add the previously computed totals for the bottom left and top right and subtract the total for the top left and bottom right you will get the number of cells in a rectangle - the cells outside the rectangle are either never counted at all or get cancelled out

14529353
subtraction	addition
however given the two corners defining a rectangle you can count the sum within it by retrieving four numbers and doing addition and subtraction

14529364
post	get
if you use https get instead of post and a bearer token it works

14529367

you would still have to write an assembly routine that forwarded the call to the superclass implementation - before doing any work whatsoever in your subclassing implementation - and then returned to yours all while minding the same things objc_msgsend does such as the need for _stret and _fpret variants and implementations on at least three architectures armv7 i386 x86_64 - and depending upon your need for backwards and forwards compatibility also potentially powerpc ppc64 armv6 and armv7s

if the subclassing changes the value of that instance variable and the superclass accesses it it gets the value set by the subclassing

14537742
superclass	subclassing
when a subclassing is instantiated it acts as-if it s also an instance of the superclass

14537742
superclass	subclassing
the way ruby is implemented means that if the superclass has an instance variable foo the subclassing can access it

14537742
superclass	subclassing
this makes a distinction between the subclassing s foo and the superclass s foo meaningless

14537742
superclass	subclassing
this is how subclassing may alter superclass behavior by setting a value the superclass might use

14537742
superclass	subclassing
if a subclassing sets and a superclass method accesses foo it sees 42

14537742
superclass	subclassing
an instance of the superclass is just that an instance of the superclass and it s meaningless to talk about how an instance of the subclassing will affect it because they re completely unrelated

14537742
superclass	subclassing
subclassing can be risky when you don t control or are unfamiliar with the superclass implementation

14537742

being slightly contrarian yes getter and setter aka accessors and mutators are mostly evil

14540455

here is a short example i made which will increase decrease the width and height of the square to the amount on the slider i.e at 50 the squares width and height is 50 and at 60 they re 60 and so on

14540468
getter	setter
this is done via getter and setter which allow access to the instances fields we than add a changelistener to the jslider to detect changes of value and in there we set the vlaues of the instance using our setter and call repaint which calls paintcomponent of jpanel which will call draw graphcis2d g2d of the shape to reflect the changes on the container

14540469
put	get
if you want to pass the position you get bace from tellg to cstring format you ll need to cast it or put it in a temporary intermediate variable

get the width of the button dynamically using and then use the value returned to set the height mbutton.setheight x

14540547

children	parent
the 1 parent reference and 2 children collection

14549742
xlib	xcb
while certain widget toolkits like qt offer you the possibility to use an existing display struct and create widgets out of existing xlib window handles you ll still have to use xlib xcb to do the nasty job of communicating with the x server for wm specific operations

14549798
setinterval	settimeout
settimeout setinterval functions did not work because the code pre-executed before the time was out opera

14549801
profiling	debugging
first of all these are warnings and not errors secondly looks like you linking debugging version of qt libraries with release profiling of vc libsâ something wrong with build profileâ but it is just warning and if you donâ t need debugging facilities of vc components you can just ignore this warningâ

14549810
setinterval	clearinterval
this means that you need to store the identifier returned by setinterval and pass it to clearinterval when needed

14549827
width	height
as well as learning how to code for your own benefit dreamweaver s visual view doesn t always use the best standards - for example it s adding the tag in and adding a width and height to the images when this should be achieved using css - which is the way to visually style your website

14549846
express	node.js
i am trying out node.js express framework and looking for plugin that allows me to interact with my models via console similar to rails console

on the iphone a navigation bar is shorter in landscape than in portrait so different images are required gradient images don t scale well

14549980
superclass	subclassing
i am creating a superclass and then 2 subclassing

14549980
superclass	subclassing
there is a static method in the superclass that should return either of the 2 subclassing depending on the result

14549983
put	get
or is it better to put all the games in a list dictionary and get the correct slug that way

14549989

post	get
i need to make a mongodb query sql is fine i ll translate it to get a specific post in the blog and the immediate post made before and after that post

14550073
inherited	properties
the new operator sets the inherited of the instance to the object that the constructor s prototype properties currently points to

14550073
inherited	properties
first the inherited constructor properties you are getting comes from the old prototype - an object that is initialized together with the function and having that hidden constructor properties

14550073
inherited	properties
second you are overwriting the prototype properties with an empty object and your foo created after overwriting inherited from that

14550073
inherited	properties
and since empty objects inherited from object.prototype the constructor properties now points to the object function

14550073
inherited	properties
since you assign a name properties to that new object from which foo inherited from you can access it on foo as well

14550085
google-chrome	firefox
you should use a javascript console like google-chrome console or firefox firebug to debug your code

14550092
inherited	properties
this makes the objects you create with that function inherited all the properties of the prototype of its constructor function the one you invoke with new - so you should beware what prototype is the moment you create the object

14550112
width	height
you will have to resize your image according to the width and height you want than simply add it to the jlabel and the jlabel will size to fit the image

14550134
width	height
sdl_rect doesn t have a constructor to set your members to 0 by default so you get uninitialized memory for your width and height

cout	cin
there is a problem i can t change the souce code but there is in almost all methods used cout and cin

14550188
qthread	qmutex
this is actually quite convenient pattern you can hide all actual thread interaction code in the slots of your qthread subclass remember they do not execute in the thread where run runs as long as you take care not lock any qmutex used in these for too long time

14550221
ienumerable	ienumerator
microsoft s documentation for ienumerable and --non-generic names will refer to both recommends that any time an object implementing those interfaces is changed it should invalidate any instances of ienumerator which it has previously produced causing them to throw invalidoperationexception on future access attempts

14550221
ienumerable	ienumerator
although nothing in microsoft s documentation has documented any change from this stance their actual implementations of ienumerable seem to follow a looser rule which is that an ienumerator should not behave nonsensically if the underlying collection is modified

14550231
tiff	png
why it refers to tiff i don t know as the source images i ve been testing with are jpg and png

14550253
inherited	properties
you could also use the tag properties for this pourpose but i think that inherited will be more clear adding semantic meaning to your code

14550285
versioning	upgrade
when the application starts it checks for newer versioning and upgrade if necessarily

14550306

just take a screenshot of a normal button and save it as bmp or png image

14550449
accessor	properties
in your mainwindow codebehind create the a public properties with a public get accessor something like this

14550449
accessor	properties
by default all objects you create in xaml are private so you have to expose them explicitly with public properties with get set accessor to make them accesible from outside

14550454
packets	multicast
if you listen to the same multicast traffic from within multiple processes using old school sockets on one single server any multicast packets is copied from the network kernel buffer to each listening application

14550497
libpcap	jpcap
the problem is that jpcap libpcap is just a sniffer library and does not handle low-level protocol issues

14550499
cout	cin
assuming you can control main or some other function called before the functions to be tested you can change where std cin reads from and where std cout writes to

14550512
uiview	uiwindow
iphone - get position of uiview within entire uiwindow

14550525
getter	setter
you must not have any business logic in your getter setter method because it will be executed for every in your jsf code more info why jsf calls getter multiple times

mysql does have spatial extensions but the de facto standard for open-source spatial databases is the postgis extension to postgresql

14550587
uiview	uiwindow
this is ã duplicate of iphone - get position of uiview within entire uiwindow

14550634

the only time it s valid within the thread confinement pattern is to reach across cousin contexts where a parent has multiple children and one child s changes are saved to the parent and the parent pushes those down to the other children

14550687
portrait	landscape
all worked great in portrait but in landscape the uitableview didn t resize

14550705
clang	llvm
i built the llvm and clang version 3.2 on windows with the help of cmake and mingw

14550712
cout	cin
you can improve testability of your classes by not using cin and cout directly

14550712
cout	cin
that said you can achieve a similar effect by turning cin and cout into stringstream s at least temporarily

14550799

web.py	cherrypy
i have a web.py application running on built in cherrypy server

14551044
int	chars
i believe slugonamission is correct about the pointer issue but if i understand the problem correctly the int is stored in the file as an int and the reason you are dealing with a chars array is you are forced to from the way you are doing read

14551278
ienumerator	idisposable
although the non-generic ienumerator does not implement idisposable that does not mean that it does not require cleanup

14551278
ienumerator	idisposable
if ienumerator implemented idisposable code could simply call dispose whether or not the class needs cleanup

14551278
ienumerator	idisposable	ienumerable	ienumerator
it s important to note that even though very few implementations if ienumerator require disposal any code which calls getenumerator on unknown implementation of ienumerable must for correctness attempt the cast to idisposable

14551281
width	height
here we ll just assume that your video is in landscape format so we can set the maximum width to 280 and forget about the height which should be 180 for a 3 2 video and 158 for 16 9 content

14551751
src	attr
you can pass a function to attr which will pass in the current src

14551761
getc	putchar	stdio	getc	stdio	putchar
edit i happened too look at gnu linux stdio some notes putchar getchar are not macros but putc getc are so using those instead might be a slight optimization probably avoiding one function call changed code to reflect this

14551767
width	height
line up all the images in a single row by fixing the height and choosing the width in such a way that you can preserve the aspect ratio

14551767
width	height
you could compute for each ratio the preferred image height which would lead to a desired image area and then combine images with similar height requirements until the width resulting from scaling to a common height matches the width you desire for your final rows

i ve tried converting it to a float and then to an int or to another double and then an int

14552079
int	double
i should point out previously in the code the double is less than 1 i.e 0.987 and is then multiplied by the number of decimal places to make it a real positive int though it s stored as a double still at that point

14552298
sorting	grouping
i am not familiar with the inner-workings of pytables so this may not be in-line with what you are looking for but the groupby function in the itertools module is very useful in these types of situations note the sorting step below - this is important in this case in order to get groupby to grouping all items with the same date

i have repeatedly read that onpause and onresume must be called for the glsurfaceview during the onpause and onresume methods of the enclosing activity

14552372
onresume	onpause
however when i log each iteration of the ondraw method of the rendering thread i see that ondraw stops being called when i press the home or back buttons and when i return to the app onsurfacecreated and onsurfacechanged get called and then the ondraw call resume - even after i remove the calls to the glsurfaceview s onpause and onresume methods in the corresponding activity methods

14552400
children	parent
set the parent field to null for those without a parent and let the children use the parent field to specify who their parent is

14552421
src	attr
if it was img src i would have used prop or attr i tried this for data-thumb but it doesn t work

14552426
eventlet	gevent
since you want to parallelize the requests you should use requests with grequests if you re using gevent or erequests if you re using eventlet

14552452

14552734
mouseup	mousedown
try doing this in the mouseup method instead of mousedown

14552734
mouseup	mousedown
also you don t have to set up a tracking area to receive mouseup or mousedown events

14552755
versioning	upgrade
you can even upgrade modules at runtime and have the new versioning of the module override the words exported by the old versioning

14552755
versioning	upgrade
perhaps you need a particular versioning of some function and don t want to be upgrade

14552755
versioning	upgrade
you can tell whether an older versioning of a module was there earlier and maybe upgrade it

14552766

14552912
mouse	keyboard
most games these days use standard windows messages for the mouse and either directinput or their own custom keyboard implementation

14552912
mouse	keyboard
from here you could select keyboard and mouse or hold the ctrl key down and select deselect individual messages from the list

14552912
mouse	keyboard
after that hit ok and test your keyboard and mouse in the target application

14552933
keydown	keyup
supported types are keydown keyup and keypress

14552933
opera	safari
or opera safari will not pass those events to the dom at all

14552933

again this works fine in gmail hotmail etc the linked resource image shows up and everything but not outlook

14553099
onresume	onpause
update updated the code to avoid leaks and making sure the activity is still active onresume onpause

14553109
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
the for-loop has the meaning go through each element in a set whether that s consecutive integers or every nth integer or elements in an arrays list deque etc. so a programmer reading your code knows that immediately and doesn t have to figure it out from your while loops

14553109
for-loop	arrays
your use of i two times to mean different things is confusing and in general single letters don t mean much as to what the variable represents although sometimes they re sufficient a for-loop where i is the index of a list arrays

14553109
for-loop	loops
after that innerloop executes the outer loops continues going through the next numbersâ no need to start from the beginning or even type out another for-loop to find the next prime

14553147
post	get
sometimes _request is preferable since it access both get post data

14553156
width	height
now you should be able to define a new rectangle from these 3 points 4th one is optional because width and height can be calculated from 3 points

14553174
hide	show
edit i should have also linked to the hide and show options which control the fade in and fade out animations

14553175

you should use post or get to send it to the server and then grap it from there and fire the function and catch back the result

14553201
inherited	subclassing
i was also thinking of a abstract class addetails and adrealestatedetail would inherited from it but this is not possible with rails as all subclassing will share the same table

14553208
post	get
can i use the facebook api to get the last post without creating a facebook app

14553264
post	get
with both you can choose to restrict the method from which the values are read pass get as a third parameter to any getvar function and the value will be read only if it s from a get otherwise you can test cookie post etc

14553278
integer	fractions
some devices may pass you data in exotic formats like for example first 2 bytes are the integer part of the resulting value second 2 bytes are the fractions part

14553302
cpu	processors
lazyset can be used for rmw inter thread communication because xchg is atomic as for visibility when writer thread process modify a cache line location reader thread s processors will see it at the next read because the cache coherence protocol of intel cpu will garantee lazyset works but the cache line will be updated at the next read again the cpu has to be modern enough

14553310
express	node.js
we have a node.js express application sitting behind stunnel for ssl termination

14553322

for-loop	loops
1st for-loop using the dictionary as loops sequence will result in keys only you want key value so need to use items or iteritems

multiplying	add
it seems that if i want to add two vectors or multiplying matrices or do any other matrix computation i should use a for-loop

14554271
min	max
i passed to function coordinates of center radius min and max angle arc angles

14554304
for-loop	loops
what you are asking is not directly possible you will need to use loops to work on vectors and matrices actually you would search for a library which allows you to do most of the work without directly using a for-loop but by using functions already defined that wraps them

14554308

google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome provides a built-in pdf viewer and firefox soon will too

14554842

14555546
int	boolean
if a pl sql procedure contains boolean values you can work around the restriction by wrapping the pl sql procedure with a second pl sql procedure that accepts the argument as an int and passes it to the first stored procedure

14555785
portrait	landscape
the first screen also works fine if the device is in portrait orientation but not for landscape orientation

14555785

the problem looks to me is that the app always assumes the device is in portrait orientation so the first screen is always shown in portrait orientatio n even if the device is in landscape orientation

14555787
button	checkbox
in my code i have to check the checkbox means the saddress is invisible know.that time i have to click the button means the baddr value is inserted...if i have to uncheck the checkbox means the saddress value is visible.that time i have to insert the saddr value

14555886
maven	pom.xml	jar	war
i guess you used this code due to the annotationconfiguration object creation is not working.better create a maven hibernate project with pom.xml and export the war file to tomcat with the changes of annotationconfiguration ...and also use log4j jar for showing the details of tomcat execution with the debug outputs.so that tomcat output will print all of execution flow

typedef	struct
struct has to be declared in header before you do typedef

14556169

14556169
typedef	struct
2 just make sure you put your typedef after or at least as part of your struct definition

14556173
awt	swing
there should be no difference in the behaviour of warnings for javafx versus swing or awt applets - if there is one that would be a critical bug to be reported to oracle

14556283
post	put
if your application is likely to encounter heavier write usage you may need to consider using other means for example you might put recent post in a memcache with an expiration and display a mix of recent post from the memcache and the datastore or you might cache them in a cookie put some state in the url or something else entirely

14556283
put	get
remember if you do a get a put or any operation within a transaction you will always see the most recently written data

various resources might advise you that if you need to add reliability over udp you should consider tcp but my experience has been that if your app runs in a controlled environment with very minimal chance of packet drops and you need fast connection setup and tear down adding a lightweight reliability over udp has its merits

uicollectionview	uitableview
when you tap one of the buttons it changes out the uitableview to a uicollectionview or vice versa

14585750
uicollectionview	uitableview
you want to keep track of the current contentoffset for whichever is being displayed uicollectionview and uitableview are both subclasses of uiscrollview so you will be able to get this from both and then set the contentoffset on the view you re switching to

14585750
ivar	subclassing
setup an ivar for the uiview header subclassing so you can easily re-use it

14585769

int	chars
isalpha checks if the value passed as parameter is an alphanumeric chars - but you are passing the int value which you have just read

14586037
int	chars
but if no int was entered the chars are not discarded so that the next scanf will again try to convert them which leads to an endless loop

14586078
fgets	strtol
you better use fgets and strtol for this

14586110
cobertura	emma
the usual open source tools like cobertura emma etc. require running the tests

14586445
stdout	fflush
therefore try flushing awk s stdout using its built-in fflush function

14586492
typo3	templavoila

14586712
mouseup	mousedown
edit i only want to lock the icon appearance not restrict location or movement and only between mousedown and mouseup the issue i would like to avoid is that chrome changes the cursor while dragging to whatever is under the cursor -i-beam while over text input control hand while over hyperlink etc

14586712
mousemove	mouseup
by watching mousemove and mouseup events on the document object instead of the element that was clicked i m able to still get most of the setcapture behavior in that i can track mouse events that happen outside of the element and even outside the browser window

14586776
range	max	range	min	min	max
the longer answer is that is is possible although impractical to perform the kind of string manipulation required to pull out the individual min and max components of each of the range in that list

cryptographic hash like sha and md5 are one-way hash

14586907

obviously it would make sense to hand dx and dy to a hexgrob -- not having the width and height of a hexagon is like specifying a circle by center without giving the radius

14586942
atomic	interlocked
i d probably use interlocked instead to achieve atomic updates to the variable

14586945

you can subtract your actual values from a set of that s probably the fastest you can xor with -1 -1 -1 -1 all ones and then add 1 1 1 1

14586981
mouseup	mouseleave
edit i added mouseleave too since if the mouseleave the element and then triggers mouseup it won t stop the timer

14587008

just watch both mousedown and mouseup and calculate the difference

14587015

i have no clue how to check if mms rtsp rtp rtmp links are available and streaming data.

14587105

14587146
put	get	post	get	post	put
so the best thing would be to put your post and get requests concerning room into a room.js and require it inside your main app.js

14587186
inherited	properties
but let s face it that s not the real problem you already have to be careful when using nested controllers because child scopes inherited parent scope properties and non-isolated scope directives

14587186
getter	setter
it would be the same as re-calculate c using change events or a setter getter approach

14587224

14588538
for-loop	loops
if you must modify a collection while iterating if it can be indexed use a for-loop and disassociate the object with loops declaration...but you want to make sure you use the lock statement around loops to make sure you are the only one manipulating the object...and that you keep in mind your own manipulations on the next pass of the loop.

you can use findviewbyid to find the textview you passed to setcontentview and call settext on that

14588969
avro	thrift
1 obviously you are imposing that the client uses avro thrift which is another dependency

14588969
avro	thrift
2 under the avro thrift scheme you are pretty much forced to bring the entire value across the wire

14588969
avro	thrift
3 updates if required will be more challenging with avro thrift

14588969
avro	thrift
avro thrift you will be forced to delete the row and create a new one with the added field

some other options are 1. type all 26 jar files on the command line using the -cp argument as you have mentioned 2. use ant or maven or some other build tool and list those 26 jar files in the config file for said build tool or 3. write a quick-and-dirty shell script that will set the classpath environment variable for you and then run your javac command

14596736
width	height
if you have auto layout turned on it is by default you should center the view both horizontally and vertically and give it a fixed height and fixed width

this will keep it centered in any sized screen in portrait and landscape

14596786
post	put

14596810
portrait	landscape
the activity that contains the webview supports both portrait and landscape orientations and the webview is configured setinitialscale and websettings in oncreate

14596810
portrait	landscape
this occurs if the device is in portrait or landscape orientation when the initial page is loaded

14596810
portrait	landscape
rotating the device to landscape and back to portrait solves the problem causing a re-load of the activity as if the displayed page were the first one but navigating back to previous pages while in portrait orientation causes them to again have widths that exceed the device display even when returning to the primary page which was displaying correctly

14596858
int	double
an approach i would consider if i had this requirement would be to use two columns one of them int the other double and specify a precedence and allow a null value in the int column to represent that the value was stored in the double column

14596871
ant	maven
i would also suggest using eclipse and staying away from maven and ant until you get a good grasp on webdriver that s assuming you re new to these applications

i m looking to turn a 1-bit bmp file of variable height width into a simple two-dimensional array with values of either 0 or 1

14597074

i ve created a function that as far as i can tell should be able to take an array that has been pre-populated with the directory in the root folder using a previous glob function and then look into each of those and keep delving deeper until there are no new directory to be found...but that doesn t seem to be what s happening here

14597131

14597604
put	get
you could chain both actions off of another function say in root.pm that would get these db records and put them in the stash for you

14597610
xslt	xquery
if both xquery and xslt are an option you re probably using an xslt 2.0 processor

14597635

as i have an thumb image having width and height of 30x70

14597702

hide	show
if you want to hide all the other elements you can use .not to exclude the current show element

14598178

if you think jackson and stax-api dependencies bundled with jersey are causing this problem i suspect that is not the case you can exclude them from jersey-json dependency in your maven pom.xml

14599775

then you need to find the midpoint of the bottom of that rectangle - seeing as the xna rectangle gives you its height width and centre point location this is also trivial

14600094
post	put
thus each successful mutation request post put delete in the atompub binding have immediate effect to subsequent requests

14600179
post	get
also if you set that this controller delete action only can be accessible by post method then you will not be able to delete by using get method

14600362
gson	xstream
playframework 1 uses the xml library xstream and it has annotations similar to gson s expose annotation but it is inverted

14600387
maven	pom.xml
usually there is no need of any of this tag unless you want one pom.xml file to build all modules at once maven reactor use dependency and throw out parent-child structure

14600409
pop-up	dialog
1 you can pop-up your own custom dialog with whole text

14600423

this is where the controller which receives the post redirects using a get request after processing

14600686
post	get
then echo to get the id of the post that was created

14600687
qobject	qlist
i have several qobject classes which may have qlist properties which store lists of qobject derived classes

14600703
entities	entitymanager
it means that entities fetched during transaction t1 are fetched in an entitymanager session that is bound with t1

14600703
children	parent
at this point i hope you understood that when you fetch the parent and children in the same tx calling getchildrenfor long id there is no need to merge since both parent and children belongs to the same entitymanager

14600727
sudo	passwd
than you can use sudo restriction for normal user who wants to run that command with passwd or without passwd

14600767

i have a dao layer and one method returns both max and min value for something

14600791
children	parent
if the children height surpass the parent set the height to the maximum boundary

14600800
width	height
then i figured i could create a png image with a transparent circular area in the middle surrounded by opaque background-like region to hide things outside the circular region but once again it is yet another illusion and it would be useless when the background is not static but changes accordingly to the screen width height

14600808
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
ha proxy does this work well but when we are trying to use amazon elastic beanstalk service for our deployment amazon-web-services creates a load balancer but didn t associate it with any key-pair

14600838
innodb	myisam
the database is myisam by default but all tables are innodb with utf8_general_ci

14600858
traceroute	nmap
i use nmap to discover alive hosts and to make a traceroute toward all of them

14600858
traceroute	nmap	subnet	traceroute
after that i can draw the network topology using the traceroute info but i can t associate every host ip with the subnet it belongs to because nmap can t supply this info

14600907
google-chrome	firefox
the thing is unlike firefox google-chrome needs separate chromdriver.exe to act as bridge between browser and driver

14600936
sorting	filtering
the default filtering for sorting and matching some patterns are working fine in table s column headers

14600972
flask	web.py	flask	django	django	web.py

14601054
put	get
now i m using ext-all.js which has 1.3mb minified which is pretty large imho...and things get magically loaded while he does the second check...but i think those 2 functions are not the same as they definitions suggest because if i put another document .ready instead of ext.onready line things break again

14601081
stdout	fflush
or just fflush stdout after your printf

14601087
post	get
you don t actually need to make both get and post requests simultaneously

14601087
post	get
what you re missing is that a post request can actually have get parameters as well as post ones

14601092
sorting	filtering
the latest fiddle is at with twinturbo s help sorting the rank attribute of comments in its post parent controller is working along with basic filtering

14601092

14601205
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
in such a case the ideal solution is cross-origin resource sharing cors spec although this technology requires ie8+ firefox 3.5+ safari 4+ or google-chrome 3+

14601216
stdout	fflush
or if you are on python 2 instead of python 3 where print is a statement not a function you can directly fflush the stdout buffer

14601216
stdout	fflush
by default stdout is line-buffered so python normally should fflush the buffer whenever you print a newline

14601232
put	get
so i have been trying this for over a week and a bit i put it to rest because i couldn t get it to work but this is what i am trying to do

14601233
zlib	libpng
directfb which depends on libpng which depends on zlib

14601233
zlib	libpng
libpng is linked against zlib but since the paths on the build system don t match the paths on the target system ld can t find the zlib that libpng is linked against during the compilation of directfb

14601242
client-side	server-side
php can not add security to js since js run at client-side while php run at server-side

14601256
post	get
when i send a post request to the server i get an error telling that the signatures the one i send and the one the server calculates by itself don t match so i guess it has to do with the base string they are signing and the way the post signing works since they re handling the same keys and secrets in both sides checked

14601279
filtering	grouping
the where clause filtering the result set prior to grouping whereas the having clause filtering the final result set after grouping and aggregation

14601301

if you re seeing a very large performance difference between innodb and myisam it s very likely that the reason is due to transactional guarantees that innodb is making

14601477

do this to get any post variables

14601479
explode	implode
you can use explode and implode php functions to get it

14601601
maven	cobertura
in order to get code coverage report i instrument the decorator bean by cobertura maven plugin

14601601
maven	cobertura
the root cause is maven cobertura plugin identify the class file is instrumented by adding an interface to the original class i works for most of the cases

14601739
children	parent
for example i have en entity parent and a collection of children in it

14601760
children	parent
if you have a lot of themes within which you want common functionality make them children of a parent theme

14601760
children	parent
the parent can hold all the common code in its own functions.php file and the children will be able to use it

14601785
width	height
i wouldn t like to use the last parameter of thumbnailimage because the input image does not always have the same width and height and i wouldn t like if it filled the thumbnail in those cases

14601814
children	parent
let s say if i have a nested list of children object within the parent object

14601814
children	parent
with grouping you have to create a new datatype that contains the properties of the parent and children

14601831
maven	cobertura
so when instrumenting compile first with maven normally then place yourself in the directory where the sourcecode of the classes you want to instrument exists and then run the following command mvn cobertura instrument

14601831
maven	cobertura
this will make cobertura instrument all the classes and maven will automatically add the files not instrumented

14602930
int	double
cannot implicitly double to int

14602957
int	double
when you multiply by 0.25 which is a double the resulting value is a double that you try to assign to a int

14602957
int	double
or if you don t want to keep the precision declare n not as an int but as a double

14602968
int	double
your variable n must be an int but the result of your calculation is a double since it involves multiplication by a double 0.25

14603001

let s say that i create an object called employee which has id firstname lastname and email for instance variables and corresponding setter getter methods

14608695
folder	directory
since there is not easy way to do a folder chooser i thought what i would do is to have the user select a file from a folder and from there i could retrieve the directory path and from thre i can retrieve all the files that fit the requirements

14608696
post	get
what i get new post in both instances

14608728
hex	binary
you will have the space requirements tackled but you could get some performance hits translating your hash from binary to hex back to binary

14608804
profiling	debugging
it turned out i was using my distribution profiling instead of the developer profiling in debugging mode

14608804
profiling	debugging
make sure you are using your developer profiling in beta and debugging mode

14608824

use a bash for-loop which loops over files that have the string osl-guest and .tar.gz in your current directory using the â lsâ command see sample output below and runs the command â tar -zxfâ on each file individually only if the file is not set with executable

14609306
class-method	delegation	initializer	class-method
having said that if you desperately need block-based methods and cannot extend delegator then i d lean towards option 2 except rather than making those class-method make them instance methods and have blocker initializer delegator and define wrapper methods so that classes that would have used delegator can now use blocker but with completion blocks rather than delegation callbacks

14609310
versioning	upgrade
you really really really need to upgrade your php versioning

if you can t do that for legacy reasons storing them in a 32-bit unsigned integer that s part of legacy code that you can t change then be sure to cast those unsigned values back to signed values when making the conversion back to 64-bits

14609643
filtering	grouping
double-clicking on a file in default grouping filtering could open diff to backed double-clicking on a file in modified search could open diff to most recent

14609961
ibatis	mybatis
look at mybatis formly ibatis

14610452

it does not inherited from javax.servlet.http.cookie so it takes a bit more juggling to get everything to work correctly however it does provide a properties set httponly and it works with servlet 2.5

14610460
button	checkbox
i just made on the first fragment a button that re-create some of the function assigned to different checkbox spreaded other fragments

14610522
getter	setter
i m serious tired of getter setter clogging my code when i don t need to control access to the internal state of an object

14610522
getter	setter
the only real reason i have to still generate getter setter is because jsf2.0 el 2.2 works by locating methods not fields

14610541
bash	subshell
edit as pointed out in the comments this is the better option since it allows the script to read from stdin by running dos2unix and not bash in a subshell

14610558
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox didn t work

14610599
isotope	masonry
you also need to take care of wich version of infinite-scroll your using since if you use the ones that comes with masonry isotope version 2.0b2.110713 both need a little hack in order to call the function and not use the predefined array

14610601
getter	setter
you can use getter setter annotations from project lombok if you don t want to write generate getter and setter method s on your java bean

14610604
folder	directory
a new site that i m building has a directory we ll call it folder that s the same name i want for the query string--that is instead of looking for an index file inside the newsite.com folder directory www.newsite.com folder should route through index.php and use folder as a search parameter

14610613
folder	directory
git ignores empty directory actually ignores folder in general

14610722
google-chrome	firefox
that worked good out and solved my problem in firefox and google-chrome but has no effect on ie

14610767
cos	sin	cos	sqrt	sin	sqrt
firstly maybe fall back to c strings and then exploit the fact that sin cos sqrt pi a b x and y almost all start by different characters

14610791
getter	setter
you can either create your own subclass of application with setter getter for your graphuser and call set get in your activities or you can do something like

14610887
google-chrome	firefox
tested it on google-chrome firefox and ie9 and it works for me

14610901
folder	directory
one of my view folder was accidentally moved to my project s root directory

14610901
versioning	upgrade
if you see this problem on later versioning it s probably not due to the upgrade

14610906
post	get
what you could do is the get the number of total post the number of days since the first timestamp in your database and calculate an average from those two numbers

14610927
width	margin
normally i would set body width 600px and margin auto but then my topbar is shortened

14610947
post	get
if for example you wanted just the title and author of all post with method 3 you could get just those fields

14610960
rdflib	dotnetrdf
dotnetrdf has full sparql 1.1 query support see sparql 1.1 implementation reports from the w3c - note that the python library you ve been recommended rdflib also has near full sparql 1.1 support

14610978
subtract	add
if the numbers are already in the correct format you just use the suitable move instruction to load them into a register or a memory operand for to use the memory content as a second operand for a add subtract etc

14610988
getter	setter
using getter setter to set the values in the labels of the widgets next instancies doesn t obviously work as i need because when i change any x.value the following instancies start and end will be actually updated only when recalled afaiu

14611020
sin	sqrt
create an nsdictionary that maps your operation name sin sqrt - to a selector like so

14611022

i assume you mean that you want the image to maintain itâ s natural width height but stay centered within itâ s container if the window width is less than the image width

14611097
post	get
due to security reasons you are not able to call a resource using the ajax functionalities like getjson ajax post get outside the domain of your application

i upgrade to versioning 1.18.5 and this issue went away

14611183
submit	submission
here is a snippet from the submission php the runs after you submit the form that the is messing up on

14611228
elementtree	beautifulsoup	lxml	elementtree	lxml	beautifulsoup
i also wouldn t use beautifulsoup for this and though i like lxml that s an extra install and if you don t want to bother this is simple enough to do with the standard lib elementtree module

14611243
uiview	uiwindow
uiwindow is a subclass of uiview which is why you ll see the backgroundcolor property

14611245
free	malloc
a lot of c++ programs spend most of their time in malloc free so this might seem appealing but i don t think it s worth it

14611258
libzip	zlib
i just compiled zlib and libzip with cygwin to use them with code blocks in windows

14611286

i ve worked with expressionengine before but am not as savvy as i am with wordpress and i understand expressionengine also has a multi site functionality

14611380
int	chars
this code must get chars from console and convert it to int - will be used as q-ty of elements in matrix

14611394
put	get
kind of a short cut to put everything in the controller but hopefully you get the idea

14611439
min	max
this input element supports min and max date attributes so you can apply your limitations

14611488
daemon	cron
cron is a daemon that executes scheduled commands

14611502
put	get
note the if you ll want to make sure you get a valid index and that adding one to it doesn t put you out of bounds

14611533
armadillo	openblas
so far the fastest i ve found is armadillo using the openblas package as well

14611533
armadillo	openblas
it runs on two of my cores whereas armadillo without openblas only uses 1

14611553
typedef	struct
there s no need to use distinct identifiers for the typedef name and the struct tag

14611580
public	protected
what this means is that obj- property will first try to set a public property with the same name then go to __get then try to call the public method setproperty then go to __call and finally set the protected _property

14611692
typedef	typename
pos_type is defined in as typedef typename _traits pos_type pos_type

14611703

i tried as suggested on numpy get min max from record array of numeric values view function it failed to recognize s7 as valid field

14611726

i use firefox it does not happen in google-chrome or ie

14611767

3 browser ie firefox google-chrome

portrait	landscape	width	height
i want the landscape and portrait photos to have an identical height of 427 but the width i want it to self-adjust to the actual image size

14611820

14611827
rss	feed
i tried using an iframe with an outside-hosted javascript using google.feeds.feed that pulls the rss feed from the announcements template but i can t configure the order of the articles

14611833
width	height
you need to calculate this by taking the old width and dividing by the new width or old height new height

14611851
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
but your viewwillappear viewdidappear methods will be called only when the actual view appears and by then settag has been executed so it shows correct value

14611857
width	height
source and is destination max width height

14611857
width	height
it gets the lowest ratio of the width or height

14611857
width	height
you just do width height and forget height width

14611879
width	height
the width and height configurations are there to restrict the size of the image you can upload

14611886
min	max
if you won t need to do many other numerical operations and you have a reason for preferring the data to reside in str format you can always use the native python min and max operating on a plain list of your data

14611886
min	max
but it s just another option to consider if you need to or if you have a special reason for working with strings such as you re only ever calculating the min and max and all you do with them is display them

14611914
next	except
next there should not be a colon or semicolon after calc except on the second line when you are defining a function

14611946
mouseover	mouseout
hover is the conclusion mouseover which begins an hover and mouseout which stops the hover event

14611978
int	chars
another issue is that you declared number as chars rather than int

14611979
mouseleave	mouseenter
.hover is a function not an event and it uses mouseenter and mouseleave so it most certainly will not have a type that matches focusin or focusout

14612031
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
both of my browsers give me a javascript error null is not an object using safari firefox and google-chrome

14612228

i ve read somewhere that one option is to hide the real console pythonw and create another console and just redirect everything from the real one to it every time you want to show the real console

14612264
int	boolean
boolean are cast to int too the key true will actually be stored under 1 and the key false under 0

14612266
width	height

the tree view is working fine with nvda coupled with ie9 google-chrome firefox opera and safari as well as jaws paired with firefox and google-chrome

14612526
getter	setter
__call seemingly has to determine if the function it s calling is actually a setter or getter function which is the entire point of __get and __set in the first place

14612532
ffmpeg	libav
i have been working with ffmpeg and libav for several years and also have found no decent recent api-level tutorials

14612538
disk	ram

14612542
cpython	ironpython
to be sure you could file a bug with ironpython which is probably your best chance of finding out why ironpython behaves different to cpython

14612566

i finally figured out how access the show and hide methods so all i need now is to figure out how to reference other .ui files so i can show or hide those also

14612661
hide	show
once i changed that the show and hide worked in android

14612696
hide	show
you can show or hide the navigation bar for your controller programmatically via setnavigationbarhidden animated

however the servlet-api is always provided by the application container hence the provided type of the dependency in the maven pom.xml

14613776
width	height
the file contains a width and height so the extra pixels can be thrown away when the image is decoded but there s no way to move the clipping from the right bottom edge to the left top edge

14613776
width	height
as you ve discovered the way around this problem is to make the width and height evenly divisible by 16

14613857
multiplying	add
the code for the second arc is as follows note the only difference between the two is goose1a and goose1b - i don t want to add a bunch of cruft here in which i was randomly multiplying random variables by random integers

14614006
factors	matrix
block.random from the psych library is a good tool for creating block-randomized experimental designs however the function as-written requires that you do some calculations before you can start and generates a matrix that only includes numerical indices for the levels of your experimental factors

14614012
coalesce	nullif
if the strings are empty instead of null you can use nullif in conjunction with coalesce

14614044
google-chrome	firefox
this works for me in google-chrome and firefox

14614075
maven	pom.xml
additionally you ll need to generate and upload the maven pom.xml file

14614075
maven	pom.xml
maven on the other hand uses a pom.xml file for it s module metadata and this needs to created and also published to the maven repository

14614075
ant	pom.xml
if you were doing all this from within ant you d have makepom task to automatically generate the pom.xml fileand the ivy publish task has a publishivy attribute that can be used to suppress the upload of the ivy.xml file

14614108
children	parent
this is not strictly possible because css does not provide any method for selecting parent based on the properties of the children

14614111
stdout	stderr
see the cron plist system library launchdaemons com.vix.cron.plist and use a stdout stderr path to debug cron itself

14614111

if so you change the http get to put something like this

14614377
subtract	add
for my specific purposes i would like to know how to add subtract 11 to from numbers that appear in that range

14614393
apache	nginx
so probably something went wrong when apache tried to send data to nginx or when nginx tried to send information to apache

14614402
coalesce	isnull
i have tries using isnull coalesce to account for this but im not doing it right apparently

14614456
folder	directory
you could extract the jar as a zip file and then look inside the folder and check inside the meta-inf directory

14614456
jar	manifest.mf
the manifest.mf file will tell you what version of the jvm the jar was compiled with

we need to use post rather than get because the length of the data is too long to put in the querystring

14614512
pandas	pytables
i finally tried with the combination of pandas and pytables by writing table b to disk and then iterating over table a and selecting from table b the matching rows

14614517
put	get
however uploaders of the zips have sometimes put accented characters in file names so when php extracts the file names i could get some name with messed encoding expecially when the zip was created in windows

14614598
hide	show
i did show instead of hide because you said you want them to not be invisible...which means visible

14614625
next	except
however when they press the login button the next view is presented and it should have a uinavigationbar at the top except it doesn t

14614666
hide	show
i would like to show a spinner in my actionbar using actionbar.navigation_mode_list but i would like it to hide show based on some application context

14614669
post	get
i can post 1 column at a time without trouble but can t seem to get it to accept multiple columns rows

14614714
filtering	grouping
just filtering before grouping

14614736
width	height
edit if you want the cube width to match the visible width let aspect be the aspect ratio of the canvas canvas width divided by canvas height and set the camera field-of-view like so

14614742
width	height
the logic they are using is to look at the values passed for height and width and compute aspect ratios for each comparing the new value to the current value

14614742
width	height
whichever value height or width has the greater aspect ratio gets its value computed from the other value

14614742
width	height
this will cause hratio to be larger than wratio and then height will be computed based on width

14614744
children	parent
but i guess because my subviews are all contained within the parent view which was still being removed and unbound jquery clears all the children fine

14614750
opera	safari
importantly it has no support in safari ios safari or opera mini

14614803

14614803
kerberos	ldap
is there a way i can just capture how many ldap kerberos dns packets were exchanged

14614807
apache	nginx
if you get the idea it should be straightfoward to adapt this to other webservers such as nginx if you re not using apache

14614809
listview	gridview
i have a listview with a gridview multiple columns layout

14614828
int	chars
details may vary depending on the compiler but in general int s must begin at an address that is a multiple of 4 short s at a multiple of 2 chars s can begin anywhere

14614828
int	chars
so assuming that your 4+2+1 means an int a short and a chars then if you arrange them in that order the structure will take 7 bytes but at the very minimum the next instance of the structure must begin at a 4-byte boundary so you ll have 1 pad byte in the middle

14614838
post	get
http post only not get

14614838
firefox	safari
script needs to work in ie firefox safari most standard browsers

14614884
filesystems	ntfs
the filenames which were read from ntfs and serialized by .net contain a single character for the accented letter but when i read the filename from the filesystems using mono on osx i get the two character representation which doesn t match the serialized representation

14614884
int	chars
for example the letter ã was gotten from a filename using .net on windows and was serialized as a single chars with int value 233

14614884
int	chars
on osx i use mono to read the filename of the copied file and that letter is represented with two chars of int values 101 and 769 which represent the letter and accent as distinct chars

14614925
tiff	png	tiff	bmp	gif	bmp	gif	png	bmp	png
the images can be in bmp jpeg gif png tiff of any dimensions

14614960
content-disposition	content-type
the only different with that question that you have to setup content-type header instead of content-disposition

14614978
width	height
i know how to vary the height of the popover but i can t seem to figure how to vary the width of it so a name does not get truncated

14615016
google-chrome	firefox
works perfectly fine in google-chrome and firefox but in ie9 the console gives me an error on this line

14615054
hash	salt
if i go in manually and use the salt saved to the user the password and generate a hash password it is different than the one that is saved in the database

14615060

14615118
cpu	processors
sql enterprise can use more hardware number of cpu processors and memeory each edition can use

14615126
coalesce	isnull
another method could be to left join your query as a derived table unconditionally to a row of default values and use isnull or coalesce to either return the data from the subquery or fall back to the defaults

14615128
subnet	packets
router a device capable of routing a packets form one ip subnet to a different ip subnet

14615128
subnet	packets

14615157
nsstring	nsdata
convert the nsstring to a utf16-encoded nsdata by using

14615162
int	chars
before i looked into this i suppose i knew it subconsciously but i never actually thought about it but a 5 chars is smaller than a 6 chars in the same way that 5 is less than 6 so you can compare the chars as int essentially for this intent

14615165
getelementsbytagname	htmlcollection
while all browsers will return an htmlcollection from getelementsbytagname there may be crucial differences in how they allow you to treat them

14615261
cruisecontrol	teamcity
if you are going to be building for many more than three customers then i think you should look to switch from visual studio building to some other automated build system - msbuild from the command line or from something like teamcity or cruisecontrol

14615281
int	chars
so yeah you can compare chars just like you compare int

14615315
mouse	keyboard
i managed to reproducibly freeze os x well keyboard and mouse input at least with a silly misuse of pyserial

14615315
mouse	keyboard
keyboard and mouse cease responding altogether though the power button works

i ve read you are unable to do a mongodump of a 2.2 and correctly mongorestore to a 2.0 but i m just doing a versioning upgrade

14615401
int	chars
the key here is that chars are just like any other int to the machine

14615440
mouse	keyboard
but the driver is clearly mashing up the usb subsystem within the kernel which kills your mouse and keyboard

14615475
udp	tcp
it also means you won t get reliable results if you optimize and only capture 40 bytes per packet short tcp or udp packets will be reported instead

14615527
profiling	instrumentation
profiling it in instrumentation i can now see that although the overall allocation memory is going up the live memory remains low and static showing that the runloop is cycling and the old uibutton s are being deallocated

14615566
keyup	mouseup
the problem is that the event handler is watching for paste mouseup keyup change

14615583
background-color	transparency
in the fiddle i could achieve desired effect by overriding the nested list background-color property however this is not what i want -- in my specific circumstances the parent list has image as a background the 1st level li elements should have red background but the elements of the nested list should be again transparency so that the background of the root list is visible

14615610
acs	adfs
sso for employees within company s domain adfs already federeted with acs

14615653
stdout	stderr
now i want to capture both stdout and stderr

in your html code both only this item should have red background text node and the nested are children of the parent

14615703
google-chrome	firefox
that google-chrome and firefox are both loading the libraries correctly

14615703
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is that jquery is not reliably consistently loading in ie 9 10 google-chrome or firefox

14615714
junit	testng
this is also the class where i include things like testng junit test annotations and dataproviders not strictly required but if you use those things that may be helpful to note in this class you can instantiate the classes for the pages you will interact with as you need them since the webdriver object you created controls the browser not the page classes

14615755
jgit	egit
the jetty and compress libraries are used by part of the jgit infra but the egit support in eclipse doesn t need everything that jgit has

14615755

width	height
ensure when your canvas is passed in to the ondraw method it is the width and height of the screen with the getwidth and getheight methods

14615843
width	height
but for set1 it will return nan for x2 y2 width and height - but not for x and y which work fine

14615843
width	height
set1 does however have width and height since it also contains r1 and set2

14615898

clang	llvm
you re free to use an external decompiler that translates machine code into c and then compile that into llvm ir with clang

14616086
folder	directory
if that s the case just remove the .git directory and you ll be left with a folder that isn t tracked by git at all

14616126

14616333
hide	show
the viewing part contains some sort of back-button which hide the viewing area and show the form again

14616343
free	malloc
this is to prevent external fragmentation upon the freeing of this memory where blocks of free memory are too small to be used in the general case to fulfill new malloc operations

14616343
free	malloc
a block allocated by malloc must also be large enough to store the data required to track it in the data structure which stores free blocks

14616401
superclass	subclassing
i d like to move this up to the superclass however if i do then the static variable will be shared between instances of both subclassing and only the json map corresponding to the class that has an instance created first will be load and all subsequent instances of the other class will be returned the wrong map

14616411
google-chrome	firefox
note everything i m about to say applies to google-chrome with the built-in developer tools up or firefox with the firebug extension up for sure

i know habit of making fields private and making getter and setter for them

14622514
getter	setter
i also understand idea of hermetic however everywhere i read about philosophy of making getter and setter i get only one reason you must do getter or setter so you are sure that one variable is not directly used in other part of program

it s generally a good idea to make all fields private and to implement getter and setter as needed

14622679

it probably doesn t make a lot of difference in your small project because you know not to set fields to the wrong values or screw up otherwise - but if other people use your classes or your project grows in size you will appreciate the fact that the actual fields are private and you can control access via the getter setter

14623615
vtk	itk
mitk vtk and itk are managed by cmake

here you can create one class with getter and setter for arraylist and that class as a object in shared preference

14623644

listview	gridview
i am using listview containing a gridview to bind the data

14623686
nscache	uiimage
in cellforrow function each image is first loaded from core data and then stored into nscache in memory so next time cellforrow fires we will use the uiimage from nscache directly if available

14623702
width	height
the mistake you made is that the width and height of the perspectivelh function are not the pixels of the final view but instead describe the dimensions of the local view plane at znear 0.1

14623741
rvm	bundler
i had the same issue and it seems that bundler with rvm is not integrating well with gems that use native extensions

14623741
thin	unicorn
my question for unicorn here and thin here

14623746
memcpy	strcpy
strings are arrays and therefore have to be copied using the strcpy or memcpy functions

14623772
width	margin
use marginleft and marginright auto with a width for the ul tag so that the left and right margin is automatically taken

14623794
crypt	hash
that user has an ancient crypt hash

14623794
crypt	hash
you can verify this by looking at the hash in etc shadow and if it doesn t start with a marker to indicate the hash method then it is using the original unix crypt hash which only uses the first eight characters

14623794
hash	salt
incidentally in those old style hash the salt is just the first two characters of the hash which is why you thought there wasn t one

14623794
hash	salt
newer hash look like which is probably what you are used to to but old ones are just thirteen characters with the first two being the salt

14623835

14623867
width	text-align
if you don t want to give fixed width to the ul then add a outer div to ul and give text-align center to the outer div

14623875
range	max	range	min	min	max
your analog data using analogread will be an int in the range of 0-1023 though depending on your sensor it could be much less than that but those are the min max values

14623927
width	height
still if you want to use weight you have to use linearlayout in relativelayout with fill_parrent height and width

14623978
mako	genshi
pyramid besides mako comes with chameleon xml html template engine like genshi

14624066
super	extends

however when i create a bin folder within the sub directory the webforms application complains that it is unable to find a reference to a project which is not referenced in the webforms application it is however a reference to the mvc application

14624356
post	get
without you showing the code it would be difficult to determine exactly what is going on but my best guess would that your form method is set to get and not post

14624386
hide	show
the simplest solution i can think of is cloning the headgroup tag in the source code and place the copy before the figure tag thus making it possible to show hide the appropriate tag according to viewport size

14624413
for-loop	arrays
create the arrays outside the for-loop

14624435
margin	height
add height 100 to html body and remove tag instead use margin 0 auto to #container

14624455

14624664
width	height
this will also update the label on orientation changes as well will constrain the height to the text and keep the label s width at it s original size

14624692
for-loop	loops
a a a_array i in the second for-loop creates a copy on the stack which is deleted again after loops scope

14624697
jstl	taglib
i d like this scenario because the jstl xml taglib is only available in jsp

14624741
range	minimum
the built-in excel method works to an extent but when the range of the chart data gets a bit wider it just sets the minimum scale to 0 which can result in very squished lines with loads of blank space beneath it

14624741
min	max
the code i wrote attempts to improve on excel s method by choosing a suitable max and min limit for the y-axis based on the data in the chart

14624749
post	get
i need to be able to get this code to work on the remaining post that are paginated and shown with an infinite scroll event

equals	gethashcode
works by calling the virtual methods equals object and gethashcode which are defined by system.object but may or may not be overridden by t

14624807
equals	gethashcode
and of course string is a sealed class so no other class could derive from string and override equals and gethashcode in some strange way

14624809
ssl	https
https ssl certificates issues

14624931
implements	extends
you could implements this by having two different classes one extends mapfragment and one extends fragment or activity and then checking for the availability of google play services

14624990
x86	64bit
do you mean the final value will be updated in one go yes on x86 that s definitely guaranteed for a byte value - and any correctly aligned value up to 64bit at least or if i set this to true or false no other thread will read a different value after i ve set it that s not quite such a certainty - you need a lock prefix to guarantee that

14625024
button	checkbox
maps v3 will always condense the four available maptypeids hybrid roadmap satellite terrain into two button plus a checkbox for each of these button

14625024
button	checkbox
satellite + hybrid will give you a satellite button with a labels checkbox and roadmap + terrain will give you a map button with a terrain checkbox

14625024
button	checkbox
please note that the checkbox is only shown when you hover over an active button so you will have to be in map mode to see the terrain checkbox under the button and you must be in satellite mode to see the labels checkbox

14625024
button	checkbox
just like the button there will be a maximum of two dropdown items plus a checkbox for each of them

put	get
only thing is you need to put some delay before to get image from fbprofilepictureview

14625189
post	get
the idea is these urls would be sent via a phone ap edit and would use post and not get

14625194
ilist	icollection
the alternative would be to write a full-blown ilist wrapper for the array or icollection or some other collection type

14625379
getter	setter
i might also want to note that getter and setter are often not want you want when writing python since you can do without the need of a getter or setter

14625399
instances	transient
the down side of kvo is if the observing relationship is dynamic and transient you must take much more care about how these objects were torn down or you could get a lot of crashes like sending updates to a dealloc ed instances etc

14625408

14625511
google-chrome	firefox
to do this i tried showing a div with jquery but it only works in firefox not in ie or google-chrome

14625511

14626062
profiling	instrumentation
looking at the gcc documentation it looks like -fprofile-generate does activate some specific code transformations to make profiling easier cheaper so the instrumented code isn t really the original code + instrumentation

14626100
folder	directory
the other alternative is to place your includes folder outside of your web-accessible directory

however with box-sizing border-box that border is now counted as part of the box size making its calculated dimensions 50x50px

width	height
reasons measurestring uses usual string formatters as delimiters for its own width and height

14629440
width	height
depending on the string and its font and number of lines these both variables can carry values which are sometimes useless to be used as width height values of a textbox because they can be bigger than the parentform s values and this would resize the textbox to a size with left and bottom borders beyond those of the parent form

14630676
int	boolean
well firstly i will say that mixing short-circuit boolean with side-effects is a common source of bugs in code - if used well among maintainers who understand it as an obvious pattern then it may be okay but it s very hard for me to imagine programmers becoming at all used to a hole in the int at 0

qgraphicsscene	qgraphicsitem
the worst case scenario that i see is that i disable the itemismovable flag on my custom qgraphicsitem objects and handle movement entirely in the qgraphicsscene mouse events but reimplementing that functionality properly seems quite complicated i checked how qt does it internally and there is quite a lot of code for handling complicated cases such as where an object and some of its children are both selected

bad news i tried to set texture width and height with power of 2 value 1024x1024 and it worked

14631529
int	double
an int can be widened to a double but not the other way around

14631529
int	double
this means that 10 can call b.p double or a.p int but 10.0 is a double and will not be implicitly converted to an int only b.p double will be called

14631562
inherited	subclassing
its because your method p is not an overridden method it is just inherited in your subclassing when you use

14631562
int	double
in this case as your super class has a method which takes double as a parameter and aa an int can fit into a double your super-class s method is invoked the one which accepts double

14631562
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
in this case however as your subclassing doesn t have a method which takes a double for sup.p double call it uses the inherited method from superclass if you pass double as an argument

14631565

int	double
when the object has declared type b the double version is invoked because it s compatible with an int argument since in java int is a subtype of double

14631648
int	double
so when you pass an int the first version is picked because it s more accurate and when you pass double the second one because it s the most specific signature

14631658
cvs	rcs
did you try to use cs-converter it s conversion tool used to migrate from various legacy version control systems such as rcs cvs subversion and visual sourcesafe to microsoft team foundation version control tfvc system

14631684
int	double
in your first case you are using a reference variable of b and assigning an object of a to it.since your reference is b the method p double from b will get binded statically even if you use an int since int can be widened to double

14631684
int	double
in the second case you are using reference as a itself.in this case you have two p methods available.one is p double from b and other p int from a.so p 10 will call p int and p 10.0 will call p double

14632305
hide	show
when you are in step 1 show the div 1 and hide all other divs

14632308
min	max
unless you put an aggregate function min max etc. on e.valor or turn table e into a derived-table that will put it into a one-to-one relationship with table a then the resultset you re getting is correct -- e.valor is making those rows different distinct from each other

your best bet to to put the mouseenter mouseleave events on .img_wrapper instead of the image itself that way the events will actually fire

14632474
hide	show
if there is no unique identifiers and you cannot change the top_list page you can use jquery hide to hide everything you do not want show

14632502
google-chrome	firefox
i renamed the function name from â removeâ to â removeitemâ and it works in google-chrome now as well in firefox .apparently â removeâ is a built in function in jquery that was causing the remove button to disappear in google-chrome instead of the calling the function we had defined

14632588
put	get
you re adding scrollarea directly to verticalwidget but to get it to lay out the way you want you need to put it in a layout

you have built-in functions like .val which is mainly used for getting the current value of the form inputs when you have different types of them like textbox checkbox radio textarea and each of them use different types

14632665
getter	setter
the expected behavior is that the getter should return the value that has been set by the setter

django	web2py
i d like to ask web2py and django users which tools modules they use to scan user-uploaded files for malicious software viruses etc

14632706

if you can receive a successful get request then your access token is valid and you can look at how you re sending your post parameters

it seems to be getting all the alphanum words but i want all punctuation to be considered a words to except underscore

14632919
int	double
this class can be changed to use floats strings double int etc

14632925
min	max
the simplest way to get min max of a multi-dimensional array is by doing this

14632925
min	max
you would need to use a specialized data structure that keeps elements sorted or keeps track of min max elements to get better performance

14632945
width	height
the figsize takes a tuple of width height in inches

14632969

it s weird that the width height at 100 didn t work

my app works in both portrait and landscape

14633213
portrait	landscape
the problem is that when i am in landscape and push the view controller the new viewcontroller is in landscape as well until i rotate it to portrait

14633213
portrait	landscape
and this code works until and unless i am not pushing from landscape how to force a uiviewcontroller to portrait orientation in ios 6

14633244
tabs	tabpanel
seeing that you already have your tabpanel defined in the variable tabs if you want to make your first tab visible the easiest way would be this

14633259
uiview	subviews
you could try putting a transparent uiview alpha 0.0 over your scroll view but as a sibling in the view hierarchy not as a subviews

14633260
jar	war
i have a war that i have deployed to jboss 7 that dynamicially loads jar resources using its context class loader

14633261
websphere	ibm
i have developed a web application in ibm websphere 8

14633263
folder	directory
but if you think no one know your specific path so an quick and easy way is to create plain index.php to echo some wording to who want to access that folder in every folder you have can help you to protect the list of directory in your folder path

14633283
postgresql	greenplum
since greenplum database is based on postgresql end-users interact

14633283
postgresql	greenplum
it seems you can use the postgresql connector and point it to the greenplum master

14633295
equals	gethashcode
since the resourcesinsectionbridge contains a composite key i created a poco composite key identifier called resourcesinsectionidentifier and also defined an equals object obj method and a gethashcode method

14633386
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
in case you re using a uitabbarcontroller just replace the uinavigationcontroller for uitabbarcontroller

14633487
children	parent
so i have found my self in the need of android s attribute activated for some selector control and this property is perfect as it will change the value of all children as well and not just the parent element

14633561
mouseup	mousedown
this is better because it doesn t change the click behavior by making things happen on mousedown instead of mouseup which can be unexpected

14633565

14633620
execvp	fork
i assume you are applying fork or forkpty followed by execlp or execvp

14633652
profiling	debugging
basically efficient haskell execution doesn t use anything resembling a normal call stack so to get that kind of information on an exception you have to be running in some special mode debugging or profiling which does keep that sort of information

14633653
post	get
my question is this referring to the diagram linked at the top of the post - if a user chooses any leaf or parent node of a subtree i need to get that entire subtree not including root

what you need to do is grant the account of the application that runs under for example network service or iis apppool read execute list contents permissions along the path c windows syswow64 config systemprofile appdata local microsoft windows temporary internet files and then full access to the content.mso folder itself

14633807
config	ini
another option is to use one of the commons config hierarchical config techniques like a hierarchical ini style

14633814
button	checkbox
now you can simply create a function that takes the value of the checkbox then loops through the matching div checking all the radio button within it

14633849
pull	push
design patternsâ implementation point 7 describes the pull vs push models

14633849
pull	push
it is perhaps also worth mentioning that with the pull model the programmer is required to add lines of code to each event handler that would not exist with the push model

14633849
pull	push
another thing worth remembering is that we can implement the pull model using a push model but not the other way around

14633857
inherited	subclassing
notice that we use public virtual for the subject inherited so if subclassing of scrollmanager decide to re-inherit the protocol we donâ t get the interface twice

14633879
pull	push
from an architectural standpoint i figure that i would need a centralized couchdb database that both clients can pull push

14633883
folder	directory
i can see in my directory structure that the edmx files model1.csdl model1.msl model1.ssdl are housed in a folder called edmxresourcestoembed and they can be found in c sp_codegenerator sp_codegenerator obj x86

14633968
google-chrome	firefox
happens in both firefox and google-chrome on windows and linux

14634001
decoder	encoder
you could make a decoder but not an encoder because encode only takes images binaries or strings

14634033
post	get
i had a similar question and found this post the fontconfig documentation is a little difficult to get through

14634048
folder	directory
if the application needs to make changes to any of the files in that directory only then would is start creating a distinct copy of the original folder

14634086

sudo	nohup
nohup sudo . myscript arg1

14634571
subnet	packets
in doing so the arp broadcast packets will be broadcasted to all hosts in the same ip subnet including you

14634571
subnet	packets
arp broadcast packets in fact all ip broadcast packets are broadcasted only within the same ip subnet and will never jump to a different ip subnet

14634571
wan	lan
in other words even if you don t have a firewall configured the arp broadcast packets won t jump over from the wan interface of your router to the lan interface

14634571
wan	lan
if you are seeing arp packets on your machine within the lan then the arp broadcast packets must have originated from within unless the router is mis-configured or broken in some way that it is letting arp broadcast packets through from wan to lan

14634595
width	height
the image is 770px width and 200px height

14634627
int	double
to solve this use the double type instead of int for the operands for a good accuracy about 17 meaningful decimal digits are possible with double

14634654
int	double
it is better to cast one of the operands to double to avoid int divison issue assuming you care about decimal points

14634707
svg	vml
if you are only interested in a 2d view i would not suggest using three.js instead maybe render to a canvas or svg vml

14634735
min	max
i have a mapfragment in my android app and now i would like to know the min and max lat long that is shown on the map actual

14634735
min	max
i need the min max coordinates to do a db query for selecting poi-db-entrys

14634756
width	height
i m trying to scale an image s height to its width

14634756
width	height
the problem is that the width scales with the user s window size everything is size and inherits and there is no height to inherit as the height is dependent on the content

14634756
width	height
i d like the height of the images and the slideshow element to scale to 75 of the width of the slideshow element and or images

14634756
width	height
css scale height to match width - possibly with a formfactor

14634805
prepare	execute
the only way i have found to execute queries with a dynamic table name is to prepare the query

14634834
post	get
changing to causes things like index.html to work again but then consoleresource s post method doesn t work i get a 404 whenever i access resources console

14634840
width	height
i threw a position relative on the .image class and set the width and height on the image element that way it doesn t resize when it loads

14634843
int	double
that said you can turn your declaration into something like which will let you pass in int double biginteger etc

14634843
subtract	add
the other option would be to create a custom container class that has methods for add subtract etc

14634868
int	chars
you can t represent two chars with a chars or int

14634874
haskell	sml
many functional programming languages such as sml haskell don t have null but option maybe are present as useful tools for modeling problems

14634879
box-sizing	border-box
if you need borders check out the the box-sizing border-box method which forces the border inside your div

14634893
prepare	execute
it s enough to execute the prepare query

14634918
portrait	landscape
despite any app info.plist settings or -shouldautorotatetointerfaceorientation or -shouldautorotate method overrides view controllers start off in portrait and are then rotated into landscape by ios

14634923
client-side	server-side
you are getting confused between server-side and client-side code

14635067
put	get
i suppose what i m asking is to get a previous commit on c and e to the head and have those changes made be put into their own branch on the side for now

14635074
children	parent
the tree positions are defined by an integer index in the same way a binary heap often is with the parent of a node n being n 2 and it s children being and with the root node being 1

14635087
box-sizing	border-box
if you need borders check out the the box-sizing border-box method which forces the border inside your div

14635095
spaces	delimiter
you have split at the spaces but then you need to split again at the delimiter

14635175
for-loop	loops
i want to set the values for jmxport and jmxhost within the for-loop and use them outside loops

14635258
pull	push
you need push pull architecture to initiate sending messages from the server side

14635273
mp3	ogg
i can create and read mp3 ogg .

14635303
for-loop	arrays
why is it my global arrays values cannot be used inside a for-loop

14635307
queue	fifo
i am building a fifo queue using postgres and the answer based on apinstein answer to job queue as sql table with multiple consumers postgresql

14635347
screens	tablet
i am developing a web app in house for children with autism for touch screens browsers 55 touch screens pcs and nexus 7 tablet

14635347
onmousedown	onmouseup
problem is the active state gets taken over by the onmousedown and onmouseup events i have read that this is because they are both part of the click event - makes sense

14635352
clang	llvm
if you want to generate llvm ir from c code you can also link clang as a library

14635392
for-loop	arrays
in the 1st for-loop i am passing the data fetched from the database from the php arrays into a javascript arrays

14635392
for-loop	loops
the count variable increments properly within the for-loop but my problem is that it resets after each loops

14635423
button	checkbox
but other form components exist which developers might want to use of course such as radio button checkbox spinners etc and these have not been covered with the same sort of validation

14635425
margin	height
for extra clarification as to why i want to use outerheight when one of the selectors has a margin or padding on the the top bottom height won t do the trick

14635428
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox they behave properly

14635430
serializable	deserialization
it s good you aware that you also need to replace the built-in xml serializable to get strict xsd compliance in the soap deserialization process because that is the only way to achieve what you want

14635467
hide	show
dwb took out the hide show all together and used .toggle to switch the display on the page

14635500
width	height
i know that specifying only a width or a height in percentages will allow images to maintain their correct proportions however it seems if i try something like

14635578
width	height
when i modify the left or top or just removechild the object it leaves behind a black box in the original svg area of it s height and width

14635599
put	get
i would like to get the data currently stored in the windows clipboard and save it in a variable then put the data back into the clipboard

14635600
outputstream	inputstream
i read that we should use reader writer for reading writing character data and inputstream outputstream for reading writing binary data

14635603
subclass	accessor
if there is not a better way to do what you re trying to do subclass image and make a public accessor for the attribute you re trying to access

14635669
put	get
so i ve put a validationmessages.properties on the root of my classpath and i m not able to get my custom messages with the following key notempty.employee.company

14635726
folder	directory
i read that i just need the main emf compare lib so i exported the project org.eclipse.emf.compare in a deployable plugin and fragment which i put inside the plugins folder in my default eclipse directory

14635736
dictionary	map
what you need is a dictionary to map regular spelling of english words to their international phonetic alphabet equivalents

14635739
rspec	capybara
i try to pass this friendship features specs using capybara rspec and factorygirls on rails

14635756
width	font-size
16 is default font-size and 320 is the width in px our app was designed at initialy

14635760
width	height
setting a width and height in the object tag defines a specific amount of space for the flash to take up

14635771
children	parent
for duplicating one parent and many children with identities as the keys i think the output clause can make things pretty clean sqlfiddle here

14635776
free	malloc
the answer to the malloc 0 free calls not crashing you can find here

14635787
free	realloc
but if it does return pointer to some memory it d be wrong to rely on it as the pointer is only supposed to be passed either to be passed realloc or free

14635808
implements	extends
the main problem i see with this there may be numerous others is that all ts have to extends from a class rather than implements an interface which is pretty restrictive

14635819
portrait	landscape
i recently had similar problem but i wanted to change from landscape to portrait by force i knew in old versions there were built in methods but unfortunately we are never sure when and what is working for us but i gave this code a try and it worked for me but my scenario was to forcing from landscape to portrait which is opposite to your scenario but anyways it works here is the code possibly for your scenario

14635844
portrait	landscape
note that if you disable automatic rotation whilst in landscape mode the orientation typically returns to portrait

14635860
int	chars
each enumerated type shall be compatible with chars a signed int type or an unsigned int type

14635871
configure	libtool
i run . configure --prefix c tmp jpeg-6b-build --enable-shared --enable-static like the install doc says but libtool isn t having it

14635876
width	margin
you ll want to incorporate some margin space anyways which should account for a a good portion of width differences

14635895
google-chrome	firefox
when i originally set this up i tested it with ie8 google-chrome and an older version of firefox 5 or 6 maybe and they all natively support the ntlm authentication

14635909
google-chrome	safari
use google-chrome i m using version 24.0.1312.57 or safari 5.1.7 to go to the given address

14635909
move	drag
grab the scrollbar drag bit and move it to the left

14635920
try-catch	exception-handling
correct your custom tostring method or block him from throwing exception-handling a big try-catch inside or remove it completely and retry

14635923
free	malloc
and i d reccomend to allocate dinamically at runtime the space for the c string with malloc and then free it when you don t need it anymore

14636025
try-catch	exception-handling
no matter what kind of try-catch i placed around the method-call catching the exception-handling catching a base or even catch â the termination handler was always called which resulted my program to abort

14636027
setinterval	settimeout
if you change settimeout to setinterval it would make a new request every 3 seconds but there would be no guarantee the previous request will already have completed when a new one is made if one request takes 3000ms

14636050
move	drag
problem is you can drag the first two divs up and down when you click inside them and the whole lot left and right when you click inside the 2 right empty divs but you can t move the whole lot horizontally when you click in the first two as jquery thinks you are trying to control the up down movement of the contents

14636073
google-chrome	firefox
this is working as expected in firefox and google-chrome

14636137
emacs	gedit
this way emacs will fire up even faster than gedit promise

14636139
children	parent
in other words one parent many children copies all residing in different home accounts

14636172
client-side	server-side
i don t quite know your environment but generally urls cannot be changed on server-side because they are displayed in the browser on the client-side

14636193
post	put
i m trying to put it in the sidebar displaying testimonials which share tags with the current post and in the case of pages just display all in a rotator testimonials_widget rather than a list testimonials_list

14636196
children	parent
the difficulty lies in having the parent container clear the floated children

14636225
pull	push
gitolite is just an authorization layer which will accept or deny your git clone push pull command depending on your username

14636284
width	height
if height wasn t an issue but filling the vertical of the window as well as the width is what s throwing me off

14636342
getter	setter
so after you do this you should have corresponding bean values and corresponding getter and setter

14636408
folder	dir
or you can use dos path instead in command prompt go to c and execute dir x it will display the dos version of program files x86 folder without spaces

14636413
searchable	searchview
pd a solution using searchable api or the provider will be better because i use searchview in newer android versions and search dialog in older ones

14636415
mp4	webm
currently i use multiple sources mp4 ogg and webm for cross-browser compatibility

14636504
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
my environment is linux mint 14 which is based on ubuntu 12.10 using the sun jdk 1.6.0_38

14636520
chmod	mkdir	chown	passwd	chown	chmod	chown	mkdir
as for the fileutils module the cd passwd mkdir rm ln cp mv chmod chown and touch methods are all to some degree outsourced to os native utilities using the internal api of the streamutils submodule while the second thread is left to wait for a signal from the an outside process

14636527
uiview	calayer
this class uses the -renderincontext method of calayer to capture the contents of a layer or uiview but that method does not work with the caeagllayers used for opengl es

14636535
vorbis	webm
so youâ re left with the formats that quicktime supports â œout of the box.â this is a long list but it does not include webm theora vorbis or the ogg container

14636535
mp4	h.264
however quicktime does ship with support for h.264 video main profile and aac audio in an mp4 container

14636535
mp4	h.264
mobile phones like appleâ s iphone and google android phones support h.264 video baseline profile and aac audio â œlow complexityâ profile in an mp4 container

14636535
mp4	h.264
adobe flash 9.0.60.184 and later supports h.264 video all profiles and aac audio all profiles in an mp4 container

14636535
mp4	h.264
internet explorer 9+ supports all profiles of h.264 video and either aac or mp3 audio in an mp4 container

14636541
centos	linux
however our device uses a linux environment somewhat based on centos 5.8

14636547
google-chrome	firefox
using both google-chrome and firefox browsers in and out of selenium xmlns is set to an empty string when i view it which is why the above code works for me

14636599
ubuntu	linux
this is all on linux ubuntu 12.04 installed in a virtualbox guest using the latest highcharts download as of two days ago and wkhtmltopdf version 0.10.0_rc2

14636606
free	malloc
this is probably a good option for an implementation as it would allow you or the system to track pair together malloc calls with their corresponding free calls but in essence it s the same as returning null

14636666
folder	directory
fyi my directory structure is content css which contains an images folder for css images

14636739
folder	directory
i m uploading a zipped folder that contains a folder of text files but it s not detecting that the folder that is zipped up is a directory

14636758
mp4	h.264
android 2.x does not play mp4 with h.264 baseband from scratch

14636758
decoder	encoder
how to append the encoder decoder to the videoplayer within the app to make sure that this format is supported without external dependencies

14636771
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
the sdk is for debian ubuntu and it has the same code for linux and windows

14636779
int	chars
that means your file contains 336mb of t and 336mb of int stored as 1-byte chars

14636779
int	chars
r reads those 1-byte chars stores them as 4-byte int and.

14636804
sudoers	visudo
before you start tampering with sudoers i strongly suggest you to get a basic knowledge of visudo and the sudoers syntax as messing that file may causes serius issues to the system

14636808
pop-up	dialog
a script error dialog box pop-up with

14636907
versioning	upgrade
i just upgrade my jquery jquery ui to the latest versioning jquery 1.9.0 jquery ui 1.10.0 and it seems to have broken some of my jquery ui dialog functionality

14636908
getter	setter
you can use getter setter referencer member functions to abstract away the access to the vector

14636937
children	parent
the usual way to create controller s is to extend a parent class then in your parent class __construct method you can initialize your children controllers however your system isn t in a good shape

14636956
width	height
using the web inspector i found that the canvas elements have width and height attributes that exceed the placeholder size

14637058
hide	show
you can use the addinstance command to add an instance of a new form and it s possible to add additional rows to a table but other than that the only method i have found that works is to add the objects from the toolbox and then show hide them

14637165
hide	show
since you re referring to showing and hiding content you may need to implement a small amount of javascript to bind click actions to hide show functions when the nav links are clicked

14637165
width	height
this will allow them to expand to the exact height width of the browser window provided that html and body also have 100 width height

14637189
getter	setter
in your activity class declare a private string variable and getter setter methods for it

14637206
opera	firefox
works for firefox and opera unfortunately i do no think it can search js or php code but will search html output

14637223
folder	directory
i had them in the an includes folder and i thought i had specified that directory

14637265
viewdidload	viewdidappear
you should instead call in the viewdidappear method since layoutsubviews method which in turn calls addsubview in the nmrangeslider class is called after viewdidload and before viewdidappear so whatever you do in viewdidload will be reset as the subviews are initialized in addsubview method

14637270
put	get
the problem is i get this error after trying to put the pointer in the dictionary

14637338
post	put
backbone uses this to determine whether a model is new and should be post ed or existing and should be put

14637355
for-loop	arrays
a for-loop where the arrays pointer is advanced after each iteration obviously has no problems with changing the arrays at any point

14637382
children	parent
for example if i have a parent div with rotatey -45deg all his children will be -45deg

14637387
addition	multiplication
addition multiplication etc would be exported which is defined all throughout the other parts of the library

14637400
put	get
both the string and the jsontokener contain the entire file but once it gets put into the jsonobject it s always the same thing - main and sections get cut out and only products remains

14637415
hide	show
the hide show are orderd now in the same order you listed them in your expectations

14637592
google-chrome	firefox
i tried it on both firefox and google-chrome and both cannot load

14637600
jobs	cron
try setting your path variable before the jobs your cron is probably not able to find ruby

14637617
serializable	deserialization
the nspersistentstore is what does the actual serializable deserialization

14637637
packets	multicast	igmp	udp
multicast can be utilized as follows computers periodically send igmp joins for a predefined multicast group 224.1.1.1 and ios device sends the multicast udp packets destined to 224.1.1.1 when it wants to scan the network

14637637
packets	multicast
the multicast udp packets s will be received by the computers since they have already joined the multicast group of 224.1.1.1 and then the computers can start communicating with the ios device now that the ip address is known

14637640
width	height
another thing is about the weight you set - you should set the width height to 0px so that the weight won t cause the layout process work in a weird inefficient way

14637664
width	height
i m not sure what your point is exactly but i think you mean that your cells resize with the amount of content but there is the colgroup where you can set a number of columns and set width height and so on

14637680
ubuntu	linux
in ubuntu linux i did

14637684
mongoose	mongojs
other drivers like mongoose or even mongojs manage not to force to use the callback

14637688
thin	webrick
i ve received this error both deploying with thin and webrick

14637712
division	multiplication
doing multiplication and division is a little harder

14637712
subtract	add
it s a good learning experience to write that but don t expect it to be something you knock up in half an hour without much thought add and subtract perhaps

14637716
cout	cin
in c++11 unlike in c++03 the insertion to and extraction from global stream objects cout cin cerr and clog are thread-safe

14637761
maven	pom.xml
the simplest way i ve found to do this is to click the little + icon in the maven projects window and then select the additional pom.xml file you want to import

14637764
for-loop	arrays
it also wouldn t behave quite the same for empty slots new arrays 25 as the for-loop would iterate over these

14637764
for-loop	arrays
it is generally recommended to use a for-loop for an arrays or foreach method or related

14637777
width	height
the numbers are not important it must be in the width x height form

14637788
folder	directory
i m assuming that you re using to grab the name of the folder in which the file lives that is the last directory name before the filename

14637802
integer	fractions
this works because integer division truncates any fractions part

14637837
mp3	wav
for example if i have a network source element which could download an mp3 m4a or wav file can i select which element to pipe the data to based on the file type received

14637874
put	get
on my page there s a bread crumb trail that says products. i m trying to change that to categories. i can get it to do that within the inspector but when i put the code in the customization script which is only the main page gsfnmichelle on the platform i m using it doesn t work

14637882
put	get
put at very least the code that can get called from multiple locations in a function

14637937
google-chrome	safari
on safari on ios and on google-chrome on the mac and on pretty much every other browser it prints out like you d expect

14637948
folder	directory
customization made to this folder has no effect unless the default user profile directory is changed by sysprep

14637950
ubuntu	linux
i m on linux ubuntu

14637950
folder	directory
for example if the actual card code is in the directory deck then the hand and discard_pile folder have a symbolic link to that directory in them

14637962
jax-ws	jax-rs
cxf will do jax-ws and jax-rs as well

14637966
cos	sin
what you have first calculates the expression sin || cos || tan and then tries to compare the string with that

14637987
spaces	delimiter
attribute value selects elements that contain a given word delimiter by spaces while attribute value selects elements that contain the given substring

14637989
hide	show
i use also the jquery that i wrote above to show or hide the shadow

14638012
width	height
an inner div with a background colour of white or whatever positioned 0 0 and width and height 100

14638040
cos	sin	subtract	add
the simplest solution would probably be to use arctan to get the angle from the horizontal of the line segment from a to b then add or subtract 52 to that and use sin cos to get a new point on the outside of the circle

14638052
mp3	ogg
for some formats i have found signatures that i use for identifying easily mp3 ogg with another formats i have a big problem like mpeg adts - i just cannot find what kind of signature can be used for it

14638078
multiplying	division
the assignment says if a and b are the two integers to be multiplied we repeatedly multiplying a by 2 and divide b by 2 until b cannot divide any more and is not zero integer division

14638078
multiplying	add
during each set of multiplying a and dividing b if the value of b is an odd number you add whatever the a value is to a total

14638096
int	double
tip should be int where guesses represents the number of times he answered and linenum represents the number of lines.there is no need to double here

14638096
int	double
int takes less space than double on ram

14638115
auto	nullptr
learn the latest c++ standard c++11 as it adds many new things to the language auto nullptr threads lambda functions new containers etc.

14638120
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
it checks in firefox google-chrome and safari

14638158
post	get
i have read allot about function expressions vs declaration callbacks hoisting and i get the general idea of most of this but i guess i can t quite grasp the concept because of the below code let me post the code and then ask the real questions

14638171
entitydatasource	detailsview
i have a simple page with entitydatasource and detailsview control that will be used to capture the user input

14638209
goto	break
one of the few sensible uses of goto in ordinary code is to break

14638211
getter	setter
the second one is plain ruby it s a helper to create both the read and write aka getter and setter methods for a given instance variable

14638222
epl	zpl
my recent research seems to indicate the the lp-2844 and tlp-2844 are epl only and the lp-2844z and tlp-2844z support zpl

14638260
median	max	range	median	range	max	range	min	min	median	min	max
tablelabels_tableinfosites id lat lon range theta bmht pntvlu min max avg median p95 absdev var sd skew curt

14638272
put	get
in addition if you put a threshold on the value of some semantic similarity measure you can get a boolean true or false

14638339
stdout	fflush
the ruby process is probably just buffering it s output to set stdout to always fflush its output set sync true for stdout

14638342
google-chrome	safari
you can also check how it renders in a recent version of google-chrome or safari

14638409
tax	shipping

14643171
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
seems the sorteddictionary might be your best bet as searching goes but since you want to search by multiple attributes this drops so if you want a good balance between searching and inserting for that large amount of data maybe a sortedlist will yield better results at the cost of memory usage

superclass	subclassing
when instantiating a subclassing the superclass constructor is called first and then each successive constructor in the hierarchy

14643415
superclass	subclassing
you create new constructors in the subclassing and each subclassing constructor must chain possibly indirectly to a superclass constructor

14643415
superclass	subclassing
if you don t explicitly chain to a constructor an implicit call to the parameterless superclass constructor is inserted at the start of the subclassing constructor body

14643522
getter	setter
ideally you would want a different getter and setter for each property

14643522
getter	setter
this way you can break down each property into a getter and setter method as above and also there is absolutely no need to override __get and __set in your derived classes

14643522
getter	setter
simply declare additional getter and setter for the properties you are interested in and the base class __get __set will correctly forward to these methods

14643552
subclass	abstract-class
furthermore you d have to subclass uitextselectionrect it s an abstract-class like uitextposition uitextrange which you d return an array of from this method

hide	show
my plan is to show hide this user-list over a menu item but i don t know how

14644362

it seems that pysphere vix fit

14644646
width	height
first of all define your width height secondly you can modify size of chart by parameter

14644716
int	chars
i guess this is because cout always treats chars signed chars and unsigned chars as chars rather than 8-bit int

14644734
inherited	base-class
i would prefer for mymodelform to inherited instead of setting the __metaclass__ attribute the base-class could then be easily reused and would allow me to easily override the clean- and __init__-methods

use layoutparams for set height and width dynamically

14644882

window.onunload not working in safari opera and firefox

14645035
getter	setter
since i did not find any solution in underscore or jquery giving me such a special object i came across the possibility of defining getter and setter for properties in javascript objects with object.defineproperty since i can rely on ecmascript 5 standard i can use it

14645035
getter	setter
what i am searching for is something like a default getter and default setter which applies on the object if no getter and setter has been defined for the property

14645046
width	height
add height 100 to li it force li to cove the entire available height and give the same bg color for both so that it looks like it has occupied the available width

14645052
getattr	setattr
you almost never need to use getattr and setattr and it almost always ends up with something blowing up and infinite recursions is a typical effect of that

14645069
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
you must use the same objectinputstream and objectoutputstream for the life of the socket at both ends rather than creating one or the other every time you need one of them

14645160
nunit	nsubstitute
i want to introduce unit testing to the company and am looking into using nunit and nsubstitute

14645210

if i put some jibberish in the .htaccess i get a server error so i know it is being read

14645454
post	get

14645475
post	get
i m currently using post as a get request with a body feels wrong but post doesn t really fit

14645504
abc	subclassing
subclassing of the abc are still free to implement required_property as an attribute instead

14645516
hex	binary
i think reason is it writes hex representation of each byte into file not binary

14645543
post	get
as get utilizes the querystring via a parameterized key value pairing adding the json as one qs value would not feel right to me where as a post feels absolutely the right choice

14645560
width	height
i only have a tilesystem that fits the width height of the screen so i should see when he s moving but he s standing still at the center and the ground and the player is moving

14645593

qmenubar	qpushbutton
i want to stack some qpushbutton objects on the other side of my qmenubar

14645631
udp	tcp
it s not entirely clear whether you mean to ask about tcp or udp transport here but i assume tcp since that s how gmetad-gmetad and gmetad-gmond communication is done

14645633
centos	linux
i m hoping to install and run the tesseract gem on my linux server running centos 6

14645657

try generating a rss xml feed or do some research into json you can find parsers for both to bring the data into the app

14645854
starttls	smtps
openssl s_client -starttls smtps -crlf -connect 127.0.0.1 587 already does what you re trying to do with telnet it opens the connection to that server sends the ehlo smtps command sends the starttls smtps command and then starts the handshake

i assume your using ie as its better in google-chrome and firefox but footer in wrong place

14646138
docx	xlsx
when i try to view a file using google docs from my dedicated server domain the file is not viewed correctly only for docx xlsx

14646145

no properties will be inherited by your application textboxstyle

14646194

14646197
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
the columns do not align with their headers in ie but they do align properly in the other major browsers google-chrome firefox opera safari

switching	screens
the issue with this is that when switching the item of a avplayer it will show a white screens for a short time while loading the new item

14646299
width	height
you can however do some basic tricks like setting height and width hide the address bar change the color of the scroll but not much

14646320
hide	show
clicking on another hide the section and show this error

14646345
stdout	stderr
you will have to use os specific facilities to create separate pipes for both stdout and stdin and stderr if you want to

14646345
stdout	stderr
on posix platforms you can use dup2 to place appropriate pipe ends to stdout and stdin and stderr

14646478
width	height
well i did few changes and i get the canvasview in linearlayout2 the ontouchevents of canvasview detects the touch events but in canvasview public void surfacechanged surfaceholder holder int format int width int height method does not initialize a canvas and therefore it is always null

14646483
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
it is my understanding that you can only run an amazon-web-services elastic beanstalk with one git repository feeding it

14646497
maven	cargo
using maven uploading to server seems to be done via cargo plugin or the tomcat plugin

14646581
hide	show
android visibility is used to show and hide view s but it s not valid for a preference

14646618
int	chars
since int is larger than chars this allows eof to be somewhere inside the space of numbers expressible as int while being outside the set of chars

14646619
versioning	upgrade
this issue will be resolved if you upgrade to the latest versioning 4.0.19

14646632
width	height
i want to zoom on the contents of a div but i want the div to maintain position and height width regardless of it s zoom level

14646636
google-chrome	firefox
tested in google-chrome 22 and firefox 18 perhaps this is the best workaround

14646652
int	chars
change chars x to int x as getchar returns int and that is what you are trying to print

14646679
google-chrome	firefox
i m trying to display a couple of our ssrs reports in an asp webapp we ll use internally i opted to go with local reports over remote recreated one of them and put together a quick asp forms site from the vs2012 template and a page with a report viewer control the report seems to be rendering with a lot of extra space between the various gauges and graphs below if a link to pictures of the report in report designer and report viewer in firefox it renders this way in google-chrome and ie10 too as you can see the amount of extra space isn t the same across all of the objects and moving the gauge panels in the report to have less or more space between them has no affect i tried it with a panel half way overlapping another and it displayed the same way in report viewer

14646689
genfromtxt	textscan
if you pass a list of types the format condition use a try block and use yield to use genfromtxt as a generator we should be able to replicate textscan

14646710
mousemove	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mouseup	mousedown
to emulate the button you ll need to handle to mousedown mousemove mouseup events of the tabcontrol

14646752
integer	unsigned
-1 in c internally is represented as 0xffffffff in which case it would be a positive number if i cast it to unsigned integer

14646788
svg	vml
columns are genereted as objects in svg vml not as html

14646882
hide	show
ideally you put a current_user method inside your application controller and also make it available as helper in your views because you may want to conditionally show hide change things in your view based on a logged-in user

14646935
stdout	fflush
fflush stdout first using sys.stdout.flush for backwards compatibility with python 2

14646935
stdout	fflush
in python 2 the sys.stdin.readline call fflush stdout automatically in python 3 this is no longer the case

14646948
hide	show
i need to hide the file extensions .jpg .exe on the search result show in listbox

14646952
google-chrome	firefox
when a user attempts to download a file it works well in google-chrome and ie but not firefox firefox returns part of the file name and no extension if it does not recognize the extension .pl and .csv

14646954
keydown	keyup
as adviced by bmleite you shouldn t listen for keypress but for keydown and keyup

14646954
keydown	keyup
problem was that keydown does not work in firefox so only keyup did the magic trick with listening for esc

14646954
keydown	keyup
in the end i had to listen for both keydown and keyup events

14646954
keydown	keyup
so keyup clears the model and keydown checks if model is empty and does appropriate action

14646962
keydown	keyup
the events seem to not follow strict sequential rules second keydown comes earlier than first keyup so the timer gets initialized multiple times

14646970
put	get	multiplying	add
put that timestamp in a 64-bit integer multiplying 100 to get 10 millisecond resolution and add the systemtime wmilliseconds field divided by 10 and you have your filetime

14646984
ssdp	upnp
which is hilariously recursive because upnp is based on microsoft-invented ssdp

14647010
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu 12.04.1 lts gnu linux 3.2.0-35-generic x86_64

14647018
yacc	bison
the fact that in real world grammars yacc bison etc. this empty right-hand side part of the rule is not explicitly marked as empty troubles me it is easy to miss the fact that an rhs is empty or worse to forget to insert | and actually use a mid-rule action

14647048
subtract	add
to increase the area covered by the rectangle drawn from these points i add subtract sub values from them

14647053
keydown	keyup
unless the user types really slow the keydown and keyup won t come in the order that you think

14647053
keydown	keyup
you can for example get two keydown events followed by two keyup events

14647057
hide	show
i am required to use the colvis plugin in order to dynamically show or hide columns of this datatable

14647057
hide	show
the problem is that when i click on the show hide columns button the column list does not render on the modal dialog

14647059
opera	google-chrome
it is not server-side trouble because there are no problems in opera and google-chrome and i tested 2 different handlers php and node.js

14647138
addclass	removeclass
i m having trouble chaining these events together using javascript and have had to resort to a combination of css3 transitions and jquery addclass removeclass calls

14647159
google-chrome	safari
cros x86_64 2913.331.0 applewebkit 537.11 khtml like gecko google-chrome 23.0.1271.111 safari 537.11

in addition to the sum i also need to be able to multiplication division subtraction and sumproduct for arrays

14647187
margin	height	width	margin	width	height
when the internal div grows shrinks the external div will modify its height width to keep the specified margin with the internal div

14647187
width	height
somehow the internal div is controlling the width height of both divs

14647207

in firefox 16.0.1 after clicking a link that generates a report the file is generated in c documents and settings local settings temp tmp cache with a random file name not ending in .pdf

14652909
noexcept	throw
even if t bar is noexcept dereferencing an may throw if there is nothing

14652937
int	chars
because it doesn t appear there your definition would imply that graph g int int is an instances graph g int maybe chars is another instance etc. contradicting the functional dependency that requires that there is precisely one

14652937
int	chars
then it would be ok as there are no type variables in int and chars

14652940
submit	submission
i am preventing the first submit making the ajax call and submission the form again upon competition

14652962
versioning	upgrade
if you don t have vs 2012 and are still using 2010 then once you upgrade the project to the new versioning say from 2008 to 2010 you can no longer open the project in the older versioning unfortunately

serializable	deserialization
as for your original question among the serializable i m familiar with which is mostly what you see on the spyne web site the most suitable to pipe through a stream transport is msgpack as it supports the iterator-over-file-like-object a.k.a the streaming deserialization interface

14653524

the page appears centered in google-chrome and firefox

14653573

trick is using keytimes set it to where and are time fraction when you want to show or hide element timeinseconds duration

14653825
google-chrome	firefox

14653832
fadein	fadeout
fadein and fadeout only change the visibility of an element

14653847
printf	getchar
still you can try removing the getchar immediately after the printf in your program

14653849
fadein	hide
a quick way to get around this is to add a hide to each element before the html happens then the content is added to the hidden area and then after that fadein kicks in

14653880
g++	gcc
in that case you re actually using the same backend as with gcc and g++ and you just use --static to make sure libgcj and everything else gets statically linked

14653883

14654194
children	parent
what is not clear from your model is whether a parent can have multiple children

14654201
google-chrome	firefox
well i solved this problem switching to another browser google-chrome i was using firefox

14654499
sorting	grouping
the problem is that the engine is doing a full table scan of the table then sorting the results for the grouping by

14654505
filtering	grouping
this is particularly useful because then i can do other things like merge grouping filtering them etc

14654593
width	height
in the activity i am passing values of 200 and 150 for width and height

14654616
keyevent	keyrelease

i have a simple method to move a folder to a new directory

14654797
int	chars
it ll strip out any non-numeric chars and convert the variable into an int

14654861
internationalization	translation
the rails internationalization i18n api guide describes the translation load path

14654877
move	drag
i know this is a horribly old post but i needed to implement this exact thing and found the accepted answer is quite flawed - the left two drag handles move the entire image and act very much unlike an image editing program would for instance

14654962
children	parent
find all parent who have children

14654962
children	parent
find all parent who have children who s name starts with k

textview	imageview
i have a larger view with a textview and an imageview inside of it

14654969
textview	imageview

rss	feed
i have an rss feed that i need to transform into a different xml schema

14655163
superclass	subclassing
i switched file s owner to the superclass then back to the subclassing and now all outlets are showing not greyed out

14655185
spaces	delimiter
this is something i wrote once when i had a specific and very strange parsing requirement that involved parenthesis and spaces but it is generic enough that it should work with virtually any delimiter and text qualifier

14655187
maven-dependency-plugin	maven-jar-plugin
the problem i ran into was that the maven-jar-plugin included the resolvedversion of a dependency --.jar while the maven-dependency-plugin as of version 2.5.1 copies dependencies preserving their baseversion --snapshot.jar

14655205
google-chrome	firefox
firefox google-chrome ie threw the exception in the browser console

14655302

i want to be able to display two bufferedimages on a component which then will be able to be move around the component using mouse drag and also overlap one another if dragged over the top of the other image

14655369

14655384
inherited	properties
what i m not quite sure about is whether i ll be able to use it in the classes that inherited from this abstract class to set the inherited properties as well as the child class specific

14655424
uiswitch	uibutton
looking at a few of the suggestions in a related post uibutton making the hit area larger than the default hit area i ve tried to increase the frame around the uiswitch using the below approach however it results in the entire uiswitch stretching to fill the new frame

i usually use a getter and setter all the time even if the getter and setter doesn t do anything more than setting the variable

14658048
width	height
the onmeasure method is being fired and i get the correct screen width and height

14658060
getter	setter
for example if you want to do something to get exampleobject some way other then keeping as a field and returning it and you werent using getter and setter it would be a pain to change everything

14658071
getter	setter
now you might want to follow proper object oriented methods like declaring all your fields as private and writting getter and setter

button	checkbox
an apply button on my standard winform is disabled on loading and i want to enable it if a state of any other control changes checkbox radioboxes textboxes etc.

14658075
getter	setter
1 use getter and setter only when they are required

14658075
getter	setter
for example if variable does not need to be read and write by outside world you don t need to create generate getter and setters.similarly if outside world should only read variable then getter should be defined not setter

14658075
getter	setter
2 even if the getter and setter doesn t do anything more than setting the variable there should be no business logic in getter and setter

14658078
getter	setter
a lot of people argue that you should always use setter and getter regardless of the use of the class

14658078
getter	setter
getter and setter allow to add extra logic to the class without changing the api

14658078
getter	setter
personally i prefer a more pragmatic approach unless you are writing a library do not write getter and setter if you don t need extra logic in them

14658078
getter	setter
it is really simple to refactor a normal member into a getter and setter code once you need it

synthesize in objective-c just implements property setter and getter

14658183
getter	setter
also note both the setter and getter can still be manually implemented

14658183
getter	setter
if you implement both the setter and getter though you need to also manually include no idea why this is

14658185
post	get
the get function works without any issues it s just the callback function from the post that cannot push the resulting data

14658186
getter	setter
the point of synthesize pre-ios 6 is to automatically create getter setter for instance variables so that and are generated

14658186
getter	setter
because they are declared with property you also get the convenience of dot syntax for the getter and setter

if you have a basically rectangular image which is rotated around its center the maximum width and height during rotation will be when a diagonal of the image rectangle is horizontal or vertical

udp	tcp
libpcap and the capture mechanisms it uses are not intended for use when writing tcp udp ip servers

14667078
udp	tcp
if you have a process running on some machine listening for packets using libpcap that will not create a socket on that machine to receive packets sent to some particular tcp or udp port

14667078
icmp	udp
the first time your program tries to send a packet to the udp port in question the machine to which you re sending it probably sees that it s being sent to a udp port on which no socket is listening and sends back an icmp port unreachable message

14667078
icmp	udp
however as you connected the socket in the client program the client machine s icmp implementation if it sees the icmp port unreachable message will set an indicator on the socket to tell the program that the previous udp packet couldn t be delivered as there was nothing to which to deliver it

14667078
icmp	udp
you d have to make another attempt which will i think succeed in sending the packet although it will again get an icmp port unreachable if there s no program listening for that udp port on the server

integer	unsigned
the reduction functions i saw in c++ mostly used unsigned 64bit integer what java isn t capable of natively now and i d like to find another solution

14667387
int	chars
i know that the second statement defines a function which receives a pointer to chars and an int and returns a pointer to chars

14667415
width	height
you ll notice the simple mathematical relationships between the size of the border radius the width and the height

14667426
intersect	contains
return a list contains all sprites in a group that intersect with

14667432
width	height
i m not sure setting it to 50 50 is a good idea since the transformation itself may vary the element s width and height top and left

14667453
hide	show
my solution involves a service all of the hide show magic for the modal is handled by bootstrap s javascript and angular just worries about the data

14667485
int	chars
chars myfunc1 chars int

14667485
int	chars
chars myfunc2 chars int

14667524
nsmutablestring	nsstring
at first i was confused about even being able to change the .notes property at all because in the documentation it s an nsstring not an nsmutablestring so i m assuming when you save an ekevent or in my case edit one it saves over the existing one since there is no replace method for saving an event

14667558
width	height
when i maximize the form in my delphi application i get a width of 1688 and a height of 1058

14667580
postgresql	mysql
it s easy to do pagination using mysql or postgresql by using the limit x y clause

14667580
postgresql	mysql
i would like to know if there is any technical or licensing reason why the limit x y clause that it is very useful for web development pagination and has a very clean and simple syntax in mysql and postgresql has complex syntax sometimes involving subqueries in other rdbmss

14667612
hash	md5
for example if i have the md5 hash fac2a47adace059aff113283a03f6760 the value of which is stack i will load 10 000 values from a csv file and check to see if the md5 hash in that line matches up with my given hash

14667646
websocket	pusher
if you would consider outsourcing the websocket connections then you could use a hosted service like pusher who i work for

14667689
client-side	server-side
ok you might be thinking that rails is a request-based server-side framework after all and that spine is a client-side event-based framework - so the difference is understandable

14667693
post	get
the most common reason for this is that your post is redirected for some reason and redirects are always get

14667721
google-chrome	firefox
however the two links don t response mouse hovering in google-chrome and firefox

14667729
for-loop	loops
and just to help let s move the inline for-loop into a more verbose loops

14667763
google-chrome	safari
webkit is a layout engine used by google-chrome safari

14667779
portrait	landscape
at this point i m just using a small font size so they fit the smaller buttons in landscape mode however i d like to have bigger text on portrait than in landscale

14667843
for-loop	arrays
this would create a randomly ordered arrays of the elements the first four of which would be iterated by the for-loop

14667862
int	double
next question was how to get from a double to an int or vice versa

14667862
int	double
in the case of going from an int to a double we d use frominteger as well

14667924
post	get
so i was trying to just get an array of post that do not include post

14667941
hide	show
the basic concept is to either hide or show the based on the actions behavior intended

14667944
int	double
so depending on context this can be specialized to be of type int int float double rational and more as needed

14667944
integer	fractions
and integer is not in the fractions class

14667963
post	get
is for getting parameters from get path post cookie

14667964
uiview	cashapelayer	uiview	calayer	cashapelayer	calayer
using cgcontext in either way isn t wrong and there probably are cases in which it s best but cashapelayer is the easiestâ way for most purposes particularly in cocoa touch where every uiview is backed by a calayer that you could put the cashapelayer into

14667978
bibtex	latex
however this will have the downside that you re basically binding c-c c-c to the latex command you cannot use any of the other commands such as bibtex or view

14667979
int	double
it has no way of knowing whether you intend that 20 to be an int int float double rational etc

14668000
next	except
at the end of the task all threads except the last one to complete would call pthread_cond_wait and the last thread would call pthread_cond_broadcast to tell the other threads to move onto the next task

14668023
width	height
i can set the max width height for the lightbox in the config as a percentage of the screen ie 95

14668068
getter	setter
the getter and the setter should be synchronised to prevent that the background thread and the web request thread would conflict

14668088
int	chars
i m using a subroutine to send a byte that takes an input as an int and just converts it to a chars to print it

14668091
post	get
i tried several things i ve found online includeing some stackoverflow post but seems i cannot get it work

14668132
qobject	qvector	qthread	qobject
hello i m trying to build a qvector of qthread objects but when i try to build i get this error qobject qobject cannot access private member declared in class qobject

14668141
int	chars
this pointer can either be an int chars or float

14668171
margin	border-box	box-sizing	border-box	box-sizing	margin
you will have to remove the margin on the .input_edit and #holder and apply box-sizing border-box

14668218
int	double
this still works because the double is implicitly convertible to the int

14668243
post	put
you can retrieve post info from php by using _post name of field then put it on the webpage by using echo value

14668246
youtube	vimeo
what s good about youtube and vimeo are the privacy options and doing the web-format rendering for you

14668277
width	height
i am trying to get the window s width height + a div s width height to find the adjusted width

14668300
box-sizing	border-box
what box-sizing border-box

14668300
width	border-box
so instead of 1px border + 50px width 52px total width border-box will always force the total-width to be 50px

14668300
google-chrome	firefox
alternatively you can get rid of the border-box and manually nudge any changes you see back in place use firefox s firebug or google-chrome developer tools for this

14668354
post	get
no need for functions and filters all you need to do is to use get_adjacent_post instead of next_post_link and prev_post_link note that get_adjacent_post is used to get previous and next post you can read about it here

14668354
post	get
to get previous post and it s title attribute use this

14668354
post	get
to get next post and it s title attribute use this

14668365
post	get
most of the communication between client and server is rest get and post calls

14668399
width	height
also you don t need to add px when trying to change the css width or height

14668460
hash	md5
the alphanumerical characters are from an md5 hash but that s about all i can tell you

14668485
textview	imageview
each image has the following info title textview date textview image imageview so what i actually do is the following

14668490
textview	imageview
instead of using a buttonview use a linearlayout that contains both a textview and imageview

14668521
portrait	landscape
my app has two fragments one a listing and one a detail view which are both shown in landscape mode and only the listing is shown in portrait

14668530
int	boolean
i had various problems with this algorithm and eventually i realized that to do it efficiently i needed not 1 not 2 but 3 boolean flags i don t necessarily mean you need three explicit boolean variables you might store the information indirectly via special values of variables that are usually int but you need to access those 3 pieces of information one way or another

14668534
vim	emacs
text editors like vim and emacs do reparse on every keystroke but they optimize by caching context at line endings usually so that the reparse is only on a few characters

14668539
qthread	qsignalmapper
looks like you are using a different qthread to update each row so you could use a qsignalmapper something like this

14668560
floating-point	integer
this is the thinking that motivates saying that the result of the analogous floating-point computation may be regarded as the representation of an integer .

14668601
for-loop	loops
i know how what the run time of this function would be if the for-loop wasn t in the function but loops is throwing me off a little bit

14668607
hash	md5
if so the issue here is that for n in dicttosearch sets n to the first key of dicttosearch - which will be an md5 hash

14668607
hash	md5
writerow n then interprets that md5 hash string as a dictionary in its own right consisting of single-character keys and values not as a string

14668621
submit	submission
in the submit handler i prevent the form from submission and look up the address with google

14668657
width	margin
the why is quite simple the margin gutter of the fluid columns is based on the parent total width

14668665
switching	screens
i am trying to make a window with a rectangle in it that i can dynamically switching between the left and right side of the screens using the grid.column property

14668679
int	chars
my idea is to use immutable strings with a struct called rstring for robust string that has an internal and int length such that operations like rstring_concat and rstring_substring return new rstring objects with their own newly malloc d chars pointers

14668701
for-loop	loops
i know this is incorrect because i m calling the while loops inside the for-loop and that just doesn t seem right to me - as every iteration of the a-z tab creation process will have to run through the while loops

14668703
opera	firefox
on firefox and opera the dom does not seem to be loaded after document close

14668711
free	malloc
any memory you allocate using malloc must be free

14668712
google-chrome	firefox
then you ll be able to execute it from the console in google-chrome or firefox

14668756
hash	md5
for the key why not try either concatenating the parameters into a string i ve seen this done many times before or doing an md5 hash on the request

14668756
put	get
if it doesn t exist get it from the database put it in cache and then serve it

14668767
hash	salt
if the salt is included in the hash string it s not needed to store it separately in the db

14668790
move	drag
i am wondering if in the realm of ui design the case exists where you drag one treelist s item and drop onto another treelist item only to invoke a new window to perform some functioanlity but not to actually move the source and drop it onto the target

14668790
move	drag
i thought drag and drop in a tree list is only to move one item to another branch of the tree not to trigger a pop up

14668796
google-chrome	firefox
in an mvc3 application i use a jquery datepicker plugin that is displayed completely different in firefox and in google-chrome

14668796
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome the string mm dd yyyy is invariably displayed even if there is a date already present after the date was input and saved in firefox i expect to see it in google-chrome too on refresh but that does not happen

14668796
cassini	iis
this happens both on cassini server and on the iis both local and in a virtual box

14668844
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i have the latest version of silverlight installed and i ve tried with google-chrome firefox and opera

14668847
implements	extends
before we start our shipping class needs to extends and implements

14668850
folder	directory
i ve been trying to figure out how to simply list the files and folder in a single directory in go

14668855
width	height
the header s height is determined by the image s height which is set to auto based on the image s width which is what gets altered with the jquery to create the resizing of the image

14668907
folder	directory
here is a basic example that lists the name of everything in the current directory folder are included but not specially marked - you can check if an item is a folder by using the isdir method

14668916
hash	salt
what you want is a hash of the user s ip address a timestamp and some nice long secret salt preferably generated uniquely for every user

14669027
post	put
put them in the post body

14669032
for-loop	arrays
increase your for-loop and all arrays by 1

14669033
glfw	devil
i am using the glfw to manage the opengl context and devil to load texures

14669055
implements	extends
unless your class either extends the linkedlist class or some other list class or implements the list interface it won t be a list

14669113
hash	salt
2 you don t need to update all the hash if you use a unique salt for each password

14669113
hash	salt
using the same salt value across the site means that every user s password would be susceptible to the same hash tables

14669138
folder	directory
in the directory chain to the repository one of my folder had a name that contained a forward slash

14669182
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
in firefox 2 3 safari 3 ie 6 + 7 and it works in opera 9

14669191
japplet	jwindow	awt	swing
the only components that overriding paint graphics would work with are components of the awt swing top-level containers such as jframe japplet or jwindow

14669219
profiling	debugging
which leaves a bunch of options 1 start node without the --debug option and once it is running find the pid for the worker process you want to debugging profiling and send it a usr1 signal to enable debugging

14669262
free	malloc
manual call malloc and free for every object

14669262
free	malloc
this is just as tedious and error prone as malloc and free but it lets you handle complicated cases where the string s lifetime may end in any of several separate chunks of code

14669302
for-loop	arrays
â using a for-loop print the contents of the arrays

14669307
for-loop	loops
you for-loop finishes smoothly you don t need a break in loops

14669321
int	chars	tolower	toupper
btw the func s toupper int c tolower int c can save typing when you re testing a lot of chars you may get by without the casts

14669398
folder	directory
i could see we can use sftp.remove path to file .wait to remove files and sftp.rmdir path to directory .wait to remove folder

14669413
oncreate	setcontentview
later inside oncreate method you need to give activity her layout file by writing simple line setcontentview r.layout.activity_activity_two

14669444
next	except
so if you finish the except statement and let that part run and then paste the next print statement it will work

14669447
queue	fifo
usually i just lock a mutex add a command object to a fifo queue unlock the mutex and then send a single byte

14669447
queue	fifo
when the child thread receives that byte it responds by locking the same mutex popping the command object off of the fifo queue unlocking the mutex and then executing the command

14669475
subtract	add
i would have expected the offset to match the sign of the timezone - ie i need to subtract 300 minutes to get to gmt-5 and add 120 minutes to get to gmt+2

14669486
ftell	fread
fread ftell apparently broken under windows works fine under linux

14669489
folder	directory
what has worked for me is to place the folder with the module into the resources directory of your tidesdk project and use your usual import to load the module

14669511
portrait	landscape
i d recommend using directories that define font size for both the portrait and landscape orientation

14669517
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
namely write a dictionary that maps each choice a s m d respectively to operation add subtract multiplying divide of a function pointer type

14669517
int	chars
the other problem is get_choice void return chars but you declare operand as int

14669560
google-chrome	firefox
use them and use resolution test kind of plugins in firefox or google-chrome and take some screenshots of your past work or just the framework so you can at least show the goodness involved or limitation of what can be done and cannot be done

14669611
width	height
framelayout can certainly display stacked child views that each take up its full width and height just fine and if you set the visibility of the unused views to invisible or gone they will not intercept screen presses or take focus if they happen to be located above the visible view the user is interacting with

14669623
fadein	fadeout
i have tried a number of variations of the fadein and fadeout

14669627
post	put
you could also put the comment-form inside the post directive template simplifying the html even further

14669656
google-chrome	firefox
if i use alert text instead of jquery html it is run and alert is shown in ie google-chrome and firefox

14669659
fadein	fadeout
fadein fadeout only deal with opacity and display

14669662
children	parent
once these 3 children have finished modifying the value and finished executing the parent process releases the shared memory and then the program exits

14669732
iaas	jclouds
wso2 elb supports iaas integration using jclouds apis

14669732
iaas	jclouds
theoretically this means we can support any iaas that is supported by jclouds

14669742
setinterval	settimeout
the only way function2 will run before function1 is complete is if function1 has any asynchronous code with callbacks to finish like ajax calls or another settimeout or setinterval

14669751
setinterval	settimeout
with setinterval it s like settimeout but instead of queueing up in the next available spot after the fact it sets itself in the queue whether it s ready or needed or not

14669777
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
in google-chrome firefox safari it works fine

14669779

14669779
accessor	properties
and b always use the accessor methods when setting properties

14669781
post	put
you will have multiple post out put in json format

14669786
superclass	subclassing
is it a compulsion to use only throwable superclass for any kind of exception rather than using any specific subclassing exception

14669807
width	height
just to avoid confusion the entire navbar is one image at a fixed height width and a position that changes to change button state

14669841
firefox	safari
edit now i see that the functionality is there images display correctly in firefox version 18.0.1 but images do not appear at all in safari version 6.0.2

14669874
onsubmit	onblur
the form functions like onsubmit and onblur are not working i used an alert also to check but its not being called could someone please check and tell me where i am going wrong

14669887
min	max
loopstart loopend variables have the min and max value of loop execution

14669896
width	height
in the end though it might be better easier to just set up a watch in your directive on whatever is bound to it then check to see if the height and width have changed when the text changes

14669902
google-chrome	firefox
this page will always run on the latest google-chrome browser so any ie firefox issues can be ignored

14669903
prepare	execute
to handle system calls properly you ll actually have to prepare the cpu state and execute them and then go back into the emulator

14669941
layoutparams	viewgroup
notice that you still need to provide a viewgroup because it will be used to determine the value of the layoutparams

14669949
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox they are working ok but in opera they are very dark

14669949

spaces	delimiter
my program is supposed to take input from a couple of spaces delimiter text files and spit out a csv file

14670002
for-loop	loops
firstly instead of a while loops you can use a for-loop in a range

14670005
for-loop	arrays
now i need to read two file lines by line in a single while or for-loop and i should push the corresponding line to the 2 output arrays

14670013
swt	swing	awt	swing
java web start jws is the oracle corporation technology used to launch rich client swing awt swt desktop applications directly from a network or internet link

14670033
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome don t seem to be having any problems with it but does that have the potential to break certain browsers

14670044
width	height
set bounds to the rect 0 0 width height

14670048
mouseleave	mouseenter
apparently the hover event is not a real event it is just a shorthand for mouseenter and mouseleave added together

14670069
put	get
if you request data with consistency strong so long as your get begins after the put you will see the updated data

14670071
maven	pom.xml
the bug appears only if you have this code in maven pom.xml

14670095
int	chars
as soon as your user enters more than sizeof int chars this can cause a segmentation fault

14670172
filtering	grouping
the filtering is using underscore.js groupby to return an object with properties for each grouping see example at bottom of app.js

14670330
typedef	typename
i ve tried template typename and typedef keywords in various different places in the templated class def n and where i try to create the object with no success but various interesting and often misleading error messages with gcc such as

14670331
put	get
in fact you can put absolutely anything in there and you ll get exactly the same result

14670380
free	malloc
since you used malloc your memory is on the heap which will never deallocated until you specifically call free ptr which will release all of the memory that is pointed to

14670450
inotifypropertychanged	icommand
first of all as brendan said ischecked property has to be binded with a general property which has inotifypropertychanged not an icommand type

14670483
google-chrome	safari
in safari and google-chrome on mac when a user focuses on a text field with a placeholder attribute the placeholder will remain until a character is entered

14670522
try-catch	exception-handling
i ve tried to try-catch exception-handling on wait in the continuewith and later but still got the unhandled exception-handling

14670587
integer	unsigned
it uses the guaranteed arithmetic properties of unsigned integer types

14670629
multiplying	multiplication
i tried a str_replace to remove the . and multiplying by 1.02 instead of 102 but while size is echoed correctly 345 the multiplication total_price shows that size is still treated as an ineger 3

14670645
decoder	encoder
the output from the encoder and the input to the decoder are bitarray

14670728
google-chrome	safari
i have noticed that while retina apple-touch-icons work in safari google-chrome for ipad seems to only render the lowest resolution icon

14670728
google-chrome	safari
the very same page as it appears in safari and google-chrome for ipad respectively

14670760
factors	mean
this does of course mean that you have to identify common characteristics of b and c to factors out into d to allow substitutability

14670771
folder	directory
this will be the base folder for the following directory in the next step if you are compiling for ansi

14670771
width	height
as you can see the units here are x y width height so now you get to modify these controls

14670782
width	height
you need to give the svg element width and height attributes

14670782
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome doesn t implement the sizing correctly and firefox does although in your case the default behaviour of google-chrome is closer to what you want

14670805
width	height
font size affects both height and width of text

14670824
filtering	grouping
you can use filtering nested in foreach to remove tuples from the bag created by grouping by

14670824
filtering	grouping
or just filtering null names before grouping

14670834
public	protected
yes if you need to call the savedata of another class it needs to be accessible from that class - so public or protected

14670887
for-loop	loops
and in python you can loops over the characters of a strings using the for-loop

14670887
int	chars
so if you want to convert each chars to an int you can even do something like this

14670903
scatter	graphing
even if you don t do that you can still do plot time_values maxvalues . to get a scatter plot which won t mess up your graphing with lines

14670914
width	height
if you want it to scroll you will need to set a fixed width and or height depending on whether or not you want it to scroll horizontally and or vertically

14670914
width	height
the parent of body and html is the window so setting it to 100 will mean it is always the full width and height of the window

14670924
jar	war
i understand what a war file is and conceptually i understand the purpose of an ear file is to package together war modules and or other jar resources so that the whole deployment can be seamless

14670928

assuming src is a source folder in eclipse it will copy all the non-java files to the classes or bin directory or whatever directory name you chose for the compiled classes and the employeeinfo.hbm.xml should be directly under src since you re telling hibernate to load it from the root of the classpath

the exists needs to detect only one unwanted record to yield true solutions with aggregates min max count may have to scan and aggregate the whole group to establish the desirability of the record

14674311
width	height
you could get the screen bounds and then subtract the height of the status bar to get the label width

14674311

note mainscreen bounds always returns in portrait mode so you don t have to worry about orientation but statusbarframe can be rotated so you need to check if the width or height of the frame is the correct value to use

if effect stacks - so each mouseover mouseout is stacked

14674566

14674574
keydown	keyup
my above code still didn t work when used in keypress event as the correct solution is to use keydown or keyup events to catch the arrow keys

14674590

note that keydown and keyup provide a code indicating which key is

14674590
keydown	keyup

i have a program that creates a data file via serializable and the file is created successfully and i can read the data deserialization using the same program package

it s the often error with setting sizes you can t set size of empty display object object that width and height are zero

14675135
width	height
unfortunately as rory mccrossan has already suggested when using jquery you must add the element to the dom before any of the width or height functions will return anything other than 0

14675135
width	height
having a hidden element will also return width height of 0

14675170
int	boolean

portrait	landscape
normally rotating device by 90 degrees portrait to landscape or reverse causes a configuration change activity is destroyed and re-created etc so it can just save value of display.getrotation at start and work with it

14675340
portrait	landscape
however when rotating device directly from 0 to 180 portrait to portrait or 90 to 270 landscape to landscape no configuration change is done device simply re-maps the screen

14675374
serializable	deserialization
but the values are not serializable as expected because they return a string on deserialization instead of object

all i have to do is prompt the user to input an int a chars then another int

14676248
int	chars
if the chars inputted is + the two int should be added together

14676248
int	chars
if the chars inputted is - the two int should be subtracted

14676276

14676309
min	max
it s possible to answer the query without branches if the hardware can answer min and max queries without branches most cpus today can do this

14676309
min	max
the appropriate min max functions should be chosen for int float

14676309
min	max
if only positive floats are present then it s possible to use integer min max directly on the floating point representation this could be desirable since integer operations are generally faster

14676309
min	max
in the unlikely scenario that the hardware doesn t support min max it s possible to do something like this

14676309
min	max
however this isn t correct when using float operations since the exact min max is required and not something that s close to it

14676309
min	max
luckily float min max has been supported in hardware for ages on x86 from pentium iii and onwards

from the rendering point of view when using rgba for color background-color border-color we tell the browser explicitly which dom elements and which graphical layers of elements are affected

14677373

the std endl io manipulator will fflush the content of the stream buffer so you will have to change it into a n if you later want to process the stream before its content gets fflush

14678530
ostringstream	std
also under the assumption that the reason you actually want to do this is because you need to manipulate the string which is going to be written after formatting i shall make you aware of the fact that you can use an std ostringstream to exploit the functionality of formatted streaming and gather the result into a string which you can then manipulate and normally write to a file

14687302
submit	submission
submission the form if not in the submit event

14687307
qlist	qvector
well this is the more generic answer but i hope you will see by comparising qlist and qvector why there is no need of manually expanding the container

14687307
qlist	qvector
for example if you are using 32bit system 4 bytes per pointer and you are storing 50 items in the qlist and each item is 1mb big qvector buffer will need to be resized to 50mb and qlist s internal buffer is need to allocate only 200b of memory

14687307
qlist	qvector
this is where you need to call resize in qvector but in qlist there is no need since allocating small chunk of memory is not problematic as allocating 50mb of memory

14687307
qlist	qvector
however there is a price for that which means that you sometimes you want to preffer qvector instead of qlist for single item stored in the qlist you need one additional alloc on the heap - to keep the real data of the item data where pointer in the internal buffer is pointing to

14687307
qlist	qvector
but if you are using qvector and you call resize you are able to fit all the items in the single alloc call - so don t use qlist if you need a lot of inserting or appending prefer qvector for that

14687307
qlist	qvector
and finally note qlist and qvector have reserve int alloc function which will cause qlist s internal buffer to grow if alloc is greater than the current size of the internal buffer

14687344
rpm	yum
i declared the additional yum-repo in etc yum.repos.d and running the command yum install jdk-jdk.x86_64 the rpm installs succesfully

14687467
width	height
changing the orientation on the jasperprint object does not change the width or height of the generated pages

14687515
width	height
althought all 3 child divs start with percentage widths and height to fit their parent when they re resized they get flat sizes and when you resize the window to less than the original size they overflow from the parent container making the .container3 floating left under .container2 or having less width that their parent if the window gets a bigger size than the original

width	height
it has a viewbox with different dimensions from its height and width attributes which are the attributes that processing looks at for determining shape .width and .height.

14697530
width	height
as it turns out the height and width are set to 432 and 855 respectively but the real dimensions are actually 1396 and 2500 respectively so no matter what you try it will always look wrong unless you load this file as an xml file and also check what the viewbox attribute reports as render dimensions then using those instead of the shape s .width and height properties

14697534
width	height
i m assuming createbitmap width height is creates an image

width	height
the canvas had a height and width specified which was larger than the grid row which also had a height and width specified

14697710
width	height
so correcting the canvas height and width and also setting a height and width to the drawingsurface control instantly fixed the issue

14698609
int	boolean
string name boolean turn int rollednumber

14698634
getter	setter
my idea was that i would have a getter setter in which the getter would return a float int string private variable but return some extra data with it such as a verbose name

14698634
getter	setter
this works perfectly until i use the setter which once used seems to ignore the setter and getter

14698648
getter	setter
the individual class member variables can still be accessed via setter getter

14698825
getter	setter
in order to store information into state in this case name turn rollednumber variables within the player class you need to either set them in a custom constructor make them public generally a bad idea or provide getter setter methods

14698825
getter	setter
given that you will likely want to change the data in turn and rollednumber later but not name one possible solution would be to implement a class with a constructor and getter setter methods as follows.

outline	border-color
i already set the border-color to be blue and outline none but that is still there

14699562

dhcp enabled 192.168.1.1 with subnet 255.255.255.0 this means the wan port of this network is not connected

then you realize what a terrifying nightmare it actually is as you learn how firefox and google-chrome go about this specification in their own special way and seem to completely ignore all of your needs

14700441
google-chrome	firefox
the dragleave handler exists only for firefox as in firefox the drag-drop would work google-chrome denies you by default when you tried to drag it outside the contenteditable so it performs a quick check against the firefox-only relatedtarget

14700441
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox have different ways of acquiring the range object so effort had to be put in to do it differently for each browser in the drop event

14700441
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome builds a range based on mouse-coordinates yup that s right but firefox provides it in the event data

system.data.oracleclient	odp.net
in our .net framework 2.0 based application we were using system.data.oracleclient and now migrating to odp.net the volume of the project is too high

14709587
system.data.oracleclient	odp.net
so we cannot do the entire migration on one go as a result the application is using 2 providers system.data.oracleclient odp.net as of now

14709587
system.data.oracleclient	odp.net
1 a query executes in 1 sec using system.data.oracleclient odp.net 10g 64bit oracle.dataaccess.dll version 2.102.2.20

14709587
system.data.oracleclient	odp.net
2 however the same query is taking 2-3 mins to execute using system.data.oracleclient with odp.net 11g 64bit oracle.dataaccess.dll version 2.112.3.0

14709587
system.data.oracleclient	odp.net
we have to use system.data.oracleclient with odp.net 11g 64bit oracle.dataaccess.dll version 2.112.3.0 on windows 7 64bit os

14709587
system.data.oracleclient	odp.net

once you show the alert there is no option in your code to hide it since you hide it only on

so you can just hide the alert in the beginning of the button click event by default and show it only if the condition is true

14709667

as i know the subclassing constructor calls the superclass constructor by using super

14709709
getter	setter
if you declare it as a property and override the getter setter then you have access to using dot notation to change or retrieve the value

14709748
getter	setter
in this example the getter setter for the text property should can only be inside the textlabel class

14709748
getter	setter
those two methods are just convenience methods to set get a property of a property fine but they re not getter setter and shouldn t look them

14709753
getter	setter
to have methods that look like standard accessor methods getter and setter but are really updating ui controls is only going to be a source of confusion in the future

14709753
accessor	properties
by the way the standard auto-generated accessor methods provide other useful functions doing the necessary memory management on the basis of the qualifiers you specify when you define the properties enabling key value observation for some future date where you might need such functionality etc. so i would be reticent to replace them with your own methods unless you are expert in these concepts

14709755
implements	extends
than you have to create your own attribute class which extends one of the attributes and also implements iclientvalidatable

14709774
pop-up	dialog
the maketoast call will display the text in a pop-up dialog box

14709805
getter	setter
1 no getter setter

14709805
getter	setter
2 all getter setter

14709809
autofixture	xunit.net
in case you use autofixture declaratively with the xunit.net extension the test could be simplified even further

14709813
for-loop	loops
i know i should loops through while a for-loop somehow but am not quite sure how to implement it

14709835
inherited	properties
the only position adjustment properties available is list-style-position but the only permitted values are inherited inside or outside

14709854
accessor	properties
3 using properties you could put some memory management code in the accessor

14709875
integer	unsigned
an unsigned vector is not the same as an integer

14709906
for-loop	arrays
then it will insert all elements of copyarrays into a 2d arrays using for-loop

14709909
winbugs	openbugs
for your second question the coda output from winbugs and any software which calls winbugs or openbugs will only include the thinned sample

14709924
for-loop	arrays
note your for-loop was under-optimized getlongitude would construct an arrays just for the sake of reading its length and you d do that at each iteration

14709961
onchange	onkeyup	onchange	onblur	onkeyup	onblur
i think the most reliable will be to use onkeyup rather than onchange or mouse events onblur etc.

14709977
folder	directory
go to your python 2.7.x installation directory for encodings folder ex

14710008

14710100
mouse	keyboard
i have a thread that watches for keyboard and mouse input

14710103
int	double
it provides methods for testing whether the next input is an int double etc. or even testing whether the next input conforms to a given regular expression

14710131
width	height
so all the questions i ve seen so far are about resizing the columns to the content but i want to resize the whole control - the datagrid itself - and change the width and height to be that of the columns - basically so that there s no wasted space to the right below

14710133
16-bit	64bit
you could even get creative with the interface and use c union s to make the underlying representation be a 64bit type while allowing structured access to subsets like suits or positions perhaps by saying that each suit corresponded to 16-bit of the underlying type

14710191
put	get
even when i commented out defaultconnectionfactory and put connection string i still get the same old database name

14710278
superclass	subclassing
as your superclass constructor doesn t have an no-args default constructor defined you should explicitly make a call to your superclass s 1-args constructor from your subclassing constructor

14710338
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox blocking submits after the onbeforeunload-event

14710359
translation	transliteration
the most likely explanation is the translation of code is more of a transliteration -- and therefore likely optimized around c s low-level idiosyncrasies among which is a tendency towards aliasing

14710365
directx	gdi
windows forms relies on the old gdi apis which are not hardware accelerated unlike wpf which is built on directx making it a poor platform for any kind of serious graphics

14710416
mouse	keyboard
note that it s usually not a good idea to use a thread to watch keyboard and mouse

14710418
.htaccess	httpd.conf
doing it via mode_rewrite in httpd.conf or in .htaccess will be more efficient than doing it via a php script

if you just want to get started using a bahavior to solve your immediate problem you don t necessarily need to understand all the nuances of these two approaches but eventually you will probably find that both of these approaches have their place so i d suggest reading this post about them

put	get	accessor	properties
you never ever put validation code inside of the accessor methods get set because dependency properties are stored by wpf in a table that it itself manages

14711455
accessor	properties
the upshot of this though is that wpf can and will completely bypass your properties accessor because it has direct access to the real data

min	max
i also noticed on some mobile devices the min and max attributes don t actually prevent you from entering lower or higher numbers than specified so the plugin will account for that too

you would set the property bag like so

14712489
width	height
to do this i basically calculated the width and height of the grid using this code

14712489
width	height
and then passed the width and height into rotateputter where the the width and height was divided by two to get the centre point of the grid see below

14712489
width	height
would anyone have any idea how to dynamically get the grid width and height as the window size changes so to calculate the correct position for the ellipse ball

14712504
viewdidload	viewwillappear
you should move you initiation code from viewdidload to viewwillappear

the problem is that i want to assign a separate button to each file to each image or folder so that by clicking each button its corresponding image or folder directory gets deleted from the main folder and no more being shown as a preview

14712556
pull	push
i have used git before and am comfortable with it but now when i made the commit and pushed it to a remote repository on bitbucket.org i found that the .vcxproj files while still retaining their correct file structure also retained the include and lib directories for the device it was pushed from meaning that when pulled down to another computer those include lib directories would be looking in the wrong directories meaning i have to revise all of them every time i pull push

14712557
google-chrome	firefox
this solution is only supported by google-chrome since v4 firefox since v2 and ie10 beta

14712567
submit	submission
it would be better to use the form s onsubmit event instead of the submit button s click event because onsubmit will handle submission from the enter key as well as the submit button being clicked

14712588

they turn web applications which are intended to be stateless into stateful

14712750
width	height	actualheight	actualwidth
so if the goal is just to get the grid width height the actualwidth and actualheight properties should give you that information

14712755
width	height
i faced a similar problem so i retrieved the optimal width and height dynamically and then set my infobox dimensions accordingly

14712755
width	height
now you can grab the height and width of html content with the following

14712763
int	chars

14712865
for-loop	arrays
then use a for-loop to iterate through the sorted arrays from 1 to 100

14712865
for-loop	arrays
in each iteration you compare the number in the arrays with your for-loop increment if you find that the index increment is not the same as the arrays value you have found your missing number as well as the missing index

hide	show
i have a show and hide div fade loop that i am using like a short interactive tutorial with tips

14713173
pop-up	dialog
without knowing exactly how your presetstyles property is implemented in the component itself and what it represents it probably does not make much sense to invoke a pop-up dialog for a string property except maybe for things like filenames and such

14713173
pop-up	dialog
to invoke your pop-up dialog the component editor would allow the user to right-click on the component itself and choose edit or whatever other string value you decide to name it from the pop-up menu or just double-click on the component in the form designer

14713208
children	parent
there are parent teams with children teams under them

14713258
post	put
but the type of one form becomes put not post

14713295
hash	md5
if they match then it s up to you to assume they are the same or to hash the contents i d try first assuming they are the same if all timestamps and size matches the backup copy and if this heuristic proves wrong - resort to hashing but find the fastest algorithm possible - your application of hash doesn t seem to require high security but rather high performance sha and md5 would both be an overkill with dreadful performance

14713300
opera	firefox
firefox 18 and opera and ie10 and many others in the near future expects the w3c property without the vendor prefix

width	height
in ie9 on windows 7 and ie10 on windows 8 it looks disastrously different with boxes stacked rather than side by side with the width and height of the boxes specified in the css totally ignored and bizzarely with the controls in the first div seemingly each being in their own div with a border rather than in the same div together

14713442
width	height
as you know an html element can have a lot of geometry variation for width and height of cells and the whole table overall

the double value gets truncated when cast as an int

14714150
int	double
comparing double to int is not recommended

14714167
int	double
the pow function works with float and double not int

14714167
int	double
that being said if you work with double values instead of int you ll likely see the results you are expecting

14714170
multiplying	add

16-bit	64bit
consider unsigned multiplication of 2 32-bit integers via multiplications of their 16-bit halves each of which produces a 32-bit product and the total product is 64bit

14714770

rss	feed
for instance i m working on saving a bunch of educational videos by chapter each chapter has an rss feed so i m parsing them using mwfeedparser all at once using this logic

14714889
rss	feed
while this does the job if the chapter 3 rss feed finishes parsing before chapter 2 the content of chapter 3 is saved in chapter 2 s spot

14714897
filtering	grouping
instead of tree if you can use grid with grouping then use you can use grid with filtering like this with pagination

14714953
postgresql	mysql
i can list databases with mysql but the postgresql command show doesn t seem to do it

14714955
int	double
in order to detect cases where the power is an int the math library provides overloaded functions for example double pow double int

14714955
pow	math.h
call the pow function in the library explicitly std pow to make sure that s the version you get and not one from math.h

14714964
apache	nginx
with main difference that you don t need to install webserver apache nginx for interpreter like in php or python because node.js can create webserver for you

14714970
innodb	myisam
i m only aware that transactions can break when mixing innodb myisam

14714970
innodb	myisam
when a row on a myisam table is updated the whole table is locked whereas innodb just locks that row

14714970
innodb	myisam
disclaimer a lot of people claim that innodb is just as fast as myisam if correctly configured

14715054
clang	llvm
unfortunately however the version of clang that s installed on mac doesn t support mips so you ll have to either get clang directly from llvm s website or do it on a linux machine

14715077

it seems to work in recent opera and google-chrome but i haven t tested it in any other browser

14715087

the delete was working just fine with a jquery click event when we were using the default infowindow s but it is very peculiar now that i am using the infobox instead

14715192

before using the infobox class the regular infowindow did not require a domready in order to use jquery to change the title and description and the click event was never bound over and over

login.java is quite easy as it only contains username and pasword attributes and their setter getter

14715279
maven	pom.xml
best is to start a basic maven project manually or through a maven archetype import the sources in the standard directory layout and start adding dependencies to the pom.xml in order to get it to compile

14715335
implements	extends
i want to extends it further to implements auto-generating of collections for associations etc

14715335
post	get
this is to get arround the issue that self returns activerecord base and not the model itself like post or comment

14715346
backgrounding	multitasking
take a look at the backgrounding execution and multitasking section of the ios app programming guide

14715381
post	get
this is ignored by all handlers except http handlers â and there it should be a byte string and will change the request to be post rather than get

14715440
pull	push
my server needs to send an apple push notification with an alert that goes something like your driver will arrive at 2 45pm. it would be nice not to have to pull the user s time zone and time formatting preferences up to the server and instead just pass some kind of universal point-in-time indicator epoch seconds or utc timestamp and have the ios device turn that into a timestamp in the user s preferred format

14715444
portrait	landscape
once the problem manifests itself it will happen nearly every selection switching between landscape and portrait seems to clear the problem but it will start again

14715457
getter	setter
right click- generate getter and setter does the job well but if you want to create a keyboard shortcut in eclipse in windows you can follow the following steps

14715457
getter	setter
list for quick assist - create getter setter for field

14715457
getter	setter
now in your java editor select the field you want to create getter setter methods for and press the shortcut you setup in step 4

14715458

to get the lma app you need to at least show an intent to put your app through a security review and you generally to sign a term sheet with salesforce.com regarding your app even if you don t intend to list your app publicly

14715464
atoi	getchar
switch on rx chars instead of numbers then in your r case block only call the getchar function to return the next two chars and atoi them

14715473
stringstream	fstream
i have a function that creates std stringstream or std fstream depending on condition like

14715473
stringstream	fstream
the question is how can i create either std stringstream or std fstream and pass it to the object so the object becomes an owner of the stream note object stores std iostream because it doesn t know what type of stream will be passed

14715474
post	get
change from post to get use below in controller

14715494
sudo	passwd
i know that sudo passwd must be presented thought the keyboard but can u do that with java or is it impossible

14715494
sudo	passwd
i don t have an example because i don t want to start on a program that don t work but i did some research but all the examples is about running sudo directly from java without asking the user for the passwd

14715523
put	get
the worse i can get is that he has to buy my app and will sure put 1 bad review

14715533
stdout	stderr
redirect stderr to stdout and pipe to your c program

14715545
stringstream	fstream
you can pass around a pointer raw or smart to dynamically allocated instance of either std fstream or std stringstream typed as pointer to std iostream

14715559
fiddler	pac
so we had to check use pac script in tools - fiddler options - connections

14715594
min	max
now often the array needs to be looped through to find the sum average max and min values

14715594
queue	fifo
i though that a queue in the form of a dynamic array or linked list or anything else you can think of seems like the perfect data structure for this based on the fifo method of entry exit

14715626
put	get
put all the checkbox fields outside of the form element so they do not get submitted

14715638
multiplying	subtract
what it seems like i need to do is get the 0.96 digits to be subtract by some number and then in turn multiplying that by 100 but the 0.5 being 50 always throws my math off..

14715687
initializer	class-method
behind the scenes the runtime passes an initializer this argument to all class-method

14715705
min	max
max and min will then pick the highest and lowest value respectively from that list

14715758
many-to-many	many-to-one
i can t seem to conceptually differentiate between many-to-one and many-to-many relationships in django

14715770
min	max
if you take a look at the documentation for max and min they actually give you the syntax there an note that it requires an iterable type such as a non-empty string tuple or list

14715863
pop-up	dialog
i m trying to get form dialog pop-up in a rails application

14715878
min	max
but here you need both min and max to traverse the scores which means it has to be a list or something else reusable

14715935
int	chars
alternatively you can use the wrapper classes int chars etc. and only set them if the values are null

14715957
post	put
so for the second run the script thought it was a put request instead of a post request

14715957
put	get	post	get	post	put
now because it was a put it didn t even get inside the if-clause where i checked if it was a post so it would return to the input and try to create a post request

14715957
post	put
so you will cover a put as well as a post request

14715957
post	put
it is a put post based on if the id is set in the form

14715968
int	chars
as for the switch statements they only work with int or single chars values

14715994
mouseleave	mouseenter	slideup	slidedown
i have just created a very simple slidedown slideup menu box container which uses mouseenter and mouseleave to do its stuff

14716012
post	get
recently i have been asked by a client to log into a legacy site using post and not get from a 3rd party site all of the needed variables are now sent within a post instead of a query string

14716012
post	get
while this works perfectly while calling the page using get a post call will lose all of the session variables after

14716044
apache	nginx
before using nginx with apache when i was rewriting an url i could share a page on facebook and it puts the correct url in the sharer

14716052
hide	show
you could test for create mode and then show hide the section depending on whether it is in create mode or not

14716121
move	drag
in this case i cannot simply move .call drag to g-level

14716124
ubuntu	linux
i tried to compile shallot on ubuntu linux gcc . src shallot.c but i ve got this error

i don t know why the checkbox button grows when the content is replaced

14716238
cpython	ironpython
you can learn the details of how it works in cpython 2.7 cpython 3.3 ironpython etc. and how cpython 3.3 handles exit differently on unix vs

14716241
client-side	server-side
this means that even if yo sort out your server-side client-side issues you re still playing with fire since some scenarios might work others won t and others will sometimes work and sometimes cause your process to hang because excel attempts to open a pop-up notification when there isn t a console user logged onto the server

14716247
moq	mspec
moq or mspec don t have anything specifically built in that will help you do this except for some interesting syntax or features that will help you organize your test

14716257
post	get
i normally like to have the post method redirect to a get method after it is done

14716257
post	get
you keep the post method in place but you always redirect to a get method to display a resulting page

14716257
post	get
if the get method needs some data example a record id then the post can store that data in the user session and the get method can look for that value in the user session

14716257
post	get
this is an easy way to pass data from the post method to the get method and it keeps that data in the user session if they do hit the back button to return to the page again

14716286
google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome safari square bullets are visible next to product titles and the alignment is incorrect

14716305

button	checkbox
i would like to know how to select a single checkbox and display it as a total when i click submit button and it display my single checkbox number as a total in a label end if i select and checked both checkbox it must add up both checkbox radiobutton button numbers and display as a total so if single checkbox is selected display the single total end if both checkbox is selected add up the two numbers and display total in a label when you click submit

14716394
width	height
drawback you will loose px width and height in the content areas themselves but your box model math is not so bad

14716400
innodb	myisam
see here for a comparison of innodb vs myisam

14716425

14716688
post	get
the post and the get

14716746
qstring	qfile	qstring	qtextstream	qfile	qtextstream
you will need to include qfile qstring qtextstream and qstringlist for this to work

14716750
width	height
they ve got rid of the fixed width height option in the media settings of the new version of wordpress

14716885
mouse	keyboard
alternatively you can cheat by simply controlling the mouse pointer with the keyboard through a nifty system accessibility feature called mousekeys

14716893
folder	directory
i made a folder called caitlinhavener put dvmcustomer directory in it and an etc folder within that

14716906
qmainwindow	qvboxlayout
i ve found that a qmainwindow will not work as the parent widget when using the qvboxlayout and qhboxlayout to arrange child widgets

14716906
qmainwindow	qwidget
if you create a qwidget and use that in place of the qmainwindow then the layouts will work correctly

14716913
width	height
i m also planning on making the infobox grow in width and height when new content is added in however it must always be centered above the div

14716925
vmware	virtualbox
and you may need to play around with network settings on vmware or virtualbox

14716933
cout	cin
streams work just like cout and cin

14716958
firefox	safari
the volume control is correctly positioned in safari and firefox i haven t had an opportunity to test it in ie

14717006
getter	setter	mutators	getter	mutators	setter
a classic accessor mutators getter setter is usually like the following

14717024
tcpdf	fpdf
i don t want to install the entire framework on the server and i don t want people to tell me to use fpdf or tcpdf or anything else

14717056
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome if i give an initial tag such as p the editor will create new lines as p tags however this doesn t carry over in firefox

14717096
google-chrome	firefox
when setting a cookie for the user_id and encrypted password i noticed that with a simple extension on google-chrome or mozilla firefox for that matter i was able to edit the user id cookie to another user s user id and access the site like i was them

14717159
mongodump	mongoimport
looking at the mongodb-linux-i686-2.2.2 bin directory i see about a dozen executables most of which weight 10.3mb that s a little curious that so many weight 10.3mb such as bsondump mongodump mongoexport mongofiles mongoimport etc

14717162
min	max
this example uses max but min would work too

14717169
hash	md5
this can be done by putting an md5 hash in a cookie on the users machine and storing a copy in the database - this way any further attempt from the same machine over a specified time can be ignored and stopped from being inserted into the database

14717173
google-chrome	firefox
firefox google-chrome ie all have the same result

14717173
width	height
in this example i have only changed the width of the container to 300px the result is that the height of the inner items are within the container no overflow

14717173
margin	height
the height of inner divs are in percentage and have the total sum of 100 including the margin

14717173
width	height
in my knowledge 100 of 300px height is always the same and should be independent of the width

14717205
google-chrome	firefox
you also have similar errors on google-chrome s developer tool but firefox stops working and doesn t load the rest of the resources after encountering an error

to get an exact result you must know the width height of the marker and of the infoboxes assuming both are squares

14718498
width	height
furthermore the width height of the marker must be divisible by 2 and width height of the label must be divisible by 3 first problem here it seems as if the width height of the infobox is 25

14718498
width	height
assuming the marker has a width height of 10 and the infobox a width height of 24 remember it has to be divisble by 3 this should give the desired result

outputstream	inputstream
however it s probably easier to just use raw inputstream s and outputstream though and just pass the needed one to whatever method or code uses it..

14718700
folder	directory
one possibility is somehow you are starting the server with a user that does not has read write access rights to file store files or can t change current directory to the folder containing these files again because of access rights for example files belong to root and you start server with some other user

int	chars
note the jls requires that chars byte and int values between -127 and +128 be cached but does not say anything about long

14720573
int	chars
you can only use switch statements on basic types such as int chars enums etc

14720573
int	chars
also just because chars are represented as int in the ascii table does not mean you should use int in the case statements of your chars switch

14720580
int	chars
thanks to xploit i have been reminded that you can also directly place chars s into a switch statement since all a chars is is an int

14720991
mouseup	mousedown
it is by design that the mouseup is not sent to the object which received the mousedown if the cursor is moved off the item before mouseup

afnetworking	sdwebimage
i ve noticed that the afnetworking and sdwebimage categories on uiimageview have the same method name

in xcode when i command-click the sdwebimage method it redirects me to the afnetworking method and vice-versa

14722089
src	attr	youtube	vimeo
the youtube vimeo content requires that you load information via the attr src approach instead of .contentwindow.location.replace

14722089
src	attr
experiment 2 another possible solution i tried was changing the order of the attr src and history.pushstate call

14722089

that appeared to work ok until i noticed that it completely screws up undo of course because undo is handled by nstextview not nstextstorage

14722225
direct3d	directx	xna	spritebatch

works in safari ie 9 and google-chrome i did not get a chance to test in firefox though

14723002
pull	push
the other option as the other answer mentioned would be using websockets which is a persisten connection to the server that you can push and pull data from

14723002
apache	nginx
with old technologies like apache this could be a big deal for thousands of connections but with things like nginx node and intermediate caching it s not a big deal

14723007
git-svn	svn2git
i don t want to get into hot water here by pitching one against the other but i will say my experience with subgit has been far better than that with git-svn or the wrapper svn2git

14723165
inherited	properties
however we are talking about a background which does not inherited therefore i do not see how the background properties on the body tag could actually ever be vital as in it will break the layout if you remove it

14723192
folder	directory
after the folder is downloaded from the server into my project the zs console says current restricted directory is

14723255

then of course do the layout thing after each show hide of the different panels and 36 hours of head-bashing later i m cured

14723285

14723295
subtract	add
whenever you insert or remove an element update the sum accordingly add or subtract

14723295
min	max
for the max and min the most efficient data structures are max min-heaps

14723295
queue	fifo
you would need to have them cross-referenced with the elements of the fifo queue in order to find immediately the element that has to be removed every time

14723295
min	max
every node would contain also the sum min and max of its subtree

14723295
min	max
every time you update a node you have to update the sum max and min in all the path from that node to the root

14723295
min	max
in the root you have the global sum max and min

14723295
min	max
though since you only want the sum min and max of a fixed number of elements and you always insert at one end and remove at the other you can make it much simpler

14723295
min	max
the tree would contain partial sum min and max values as in the augmented trees described before

14723313
slideup	slidedown
using slideup and slidedown

14723591
put	get
to get it out of the way now i m sure i will be asked to justify why i put this question here rather than on wordpress answers - the reason they would tell me this is not a wordpress specific question although i wonder if the jetpack edit css module may come into play as the css in the module is loaded after all style sheets are defined in the theme

14723684
portrait	landscape
this should work in portrait and landscape

14723706
httprequest	httpresponse
the second task has absolutely nothing to do with the class employee and a lot to do with strings and httpresponses and in this case how we get the httpresponse which is to get it from the httpcontext which means we must be on a webserver in a httprequest

14723765

14723945
integer	unsigned
earlier versions had only a few integer types with a signed unsigned distinction

14723945
clang	llvm
you don t have to use these types of course - and i m guessing that as you ve mentioned any c c++ frontend to llvm clang would probably only generate i1 i8 i16 i32 and i64

14723945
integer	unsigned
yes llvm does not make a distinction between signed and unsigned integer type so both will be lowered to i32

14723945
integer	unsigned
the operations on the unsigned integer though will be translated according to the original type

14723945
unsigned	short
as for why no distinction was made in llvm between signed and unsigned read the details on this enhancement request - in short having both signed and unsigned versions led to a large ir bloat and was detrimental to some optimizations so it was dropped

14723947
portrait	landscape
i had a scrollview in my xml but the scroll view should only work in landscape mode of the phone but not in portrait mode of phone.can this is possible and if possible so i should go with the xml file or through programmatically.if code require please ask me.thanks

14723986
allocator	stl
an example from the standard library are the allocator which are policy template parameters of all stl containers

14723986

the c++11 std allocator_traits avoids these pitfalls by enforcing that all stl containers can only extract properties from their allocator policies through

14723991
viewdidload	viewdidappear
instead of opening the modal in the viewdidload method i open it in viewdidappear

14724857
getter	setter
so i want to define the getter and setter methods in my interface

14724912
getter	setter
if you declare the getter and setter in the interface any reasonable ide will tell you that you have to implement them in a class that implements the interface

14724945

free	malloc
it depends on the requirements for instance say you want to create embedded software where it sometimes it is not allowed to do malloc free during runtime or because of performance reasons

14725032
free	malloc
you could then instead create your own version of malloc free that do not allocate free memory but instead just takes retruns blocks from a preallocated heap

14725123
free	malloc
if you are talking about hooking malloc and free calls you can do that with something like this

14725132
free	malloc
add logging structures to the malloc free library

14725157
free	malloc
to implement this the malloc library usually has many data structures depending on implementation - for eg the malloc implementation may choose to keep track of free blocks of memory using a linked-list

14725157
free	malloc
when a call to malloc is made say of size 10k your malloc implementation traverses through the freelist to find out the smallest free block that would satisfy the request in this case a 4k block would not be sufficient so it ll fetch an 8k block remove it from the freelist and return it to your program

14725166
post	get
i searched into the documentation but i saw nothing about the request type get or post

14725189
min	max
a small optimisation would be to precalculate the max min length before the loop so you don t need to recalculate it every time

assuming we have a list containing integers and we need to find min max

14726565
min	max
now to get min and max we can just get first and last element of this

14726638
min	max
assuming you can observe any mutation to the list you could store cache the min and max values and possibly update the cached values when a number is added removed

14726660

you can also use a min max heap like data structure red black tree to keep the integers

14726707
min	max
get min max will take o 1 time and inserting a new element will take o log n time

14726716
min	max
you can have a custom list that maintains the min and max values

14726716
min	max
this will give you o 1 insertion o 1 reading of min and max and o n deletion but only in the case where you are deleting min or max

14726727

u can find ur answer in this post get image data in javascript

14726889
min	max
assuming you do have frequent deletes although more reads than writes you may hold an array of items object which represents the integer with two references to the min and max of already added items with cached reference to the previous min and max value the difference from akaidiot solution is that this are only references

14726889
min	max
each value in the stack point to the previous max value and previous min value

14726889
min	max
what if you have multiple max or min values

14726905
textview	imageview
before you add the textview you could add an imageview and do something like

14727072
maven	pom.xml
maven has not parsed any pom.xml files at this point in time

14727072
maven	pom.xml
now maven has enough knowledge to start parsing the pom.xml files

14727072
maven	pom.xml
once the set of projects has been validated maven now does some more parsing of those pom.xml files to construct the list of build extensions if any and the list of plugins

14727072
maven	pom.xml
in order to do this maven must parse the list of project dependencies defined in the reactor projects pom.xml files

14727072
maven	pom.xml
before it calls each mojo goal bound to a phase or directly specified from the command line maven evaluates the pom.xml for the effective of that mojo

14727072
maven	pom.xml
at this point maven has available the system properties the properties specified in the pom.xml and any properties injected into the mavensession by previously executed mojos

14727072
ant	pom.xml
what you could do is use an external system ant to generate the pom.xml from a template with the versions replaced into that file

14727096
int	chars
note that might be a negative value when viewed as an int which happens when passing a chars -type value to sprintf which can cause sprintf to disregard your field width and precision directives in order to format the full value

14727246
box-sizing	border-box	width	border-box	width	height	height	border-box
you can use box-sizing border-box on the element and the width and height will be calculated the way ie did it in quirksmode

14727246
box-sizing	border-box
fwiw i ve built a site using box-sizing border-box as default on all elements and i would actually not recommend it

14727249

nexus	artifactory
nexus artifactory and other repo manager like smw pointed out are able to act as a proxy for you

14727297
system.in	system.out
i have several little applications which uses the standard console for retrieving user input and for showing messages troughtout system.in and system.out

14727297
system.in	system.out
now i would like to realize some swing based class which called from these applications it shows a frame with 2 text area one for input so associated to system.in and another one not editable that shows the messages hence associated to system.out

14727297
system.in	system.out
the only problem i have so far which took me here is about the swapping of the standard system.in and system.out to some custom ones which are associated with the 2 jtextarea

14727297
system.in	system.out
meanwhile a keylistener checks for vk_enter click in order to get the text from the jtextfield used as prompt once this happens the text is displayed using the system.out itself and it effectively appears in the previous jtextarea hence the swingworker described above works and then i wrote the same line of text in the inwriter the printstream object associated to the pipe related to the system.in so the line should be available to be read from reader objects which are present in the original application

14727349
folder	directory
my understanding is that this would go to root directory find a folder called api find a function called function and run it

uilabel	uibutton
if your want to add uilabel and uibutton in your view then

14727521
put	get
one little grappelli thing to get the autocomplete and related lookups going you need to specify autocomplete_lookup_fields and or related_lookup_fields on some object and pass that object to helpers.adminform as model_admin normally this would be your modeladmin but it doesn t seem to care what the object actually is so i put them on the form and passed that

14727536
width	margin
yes...as suggested by kolink the margin border and padding are not zero for the text box.so it spans out on 100 width

14727536
box-sizing	border-box	width	border-box	width	height	height	border-box
thus by using box-sizing border-box any padding or border specified on the element is laid out and drawn inside this specified width and height

14727556
getter	setter
i think you can perform some magic with getter setter and object.defineproperty since the function is declared globally

14727571
client-side	server-side
the problem is although i m escaping the possible single quotes and that i can see that in server-side the escaped string has the desired value the code i get in the client-side is note the double backslashes as if storing the escaped string in a json object prevents java to insert the actual value of the string

here idx_t is int and real_t is single or double precision

14730349
put	get
but the problem is that i get an error message as below though i put null for tpwgt

14730349

int	boolean
this could be stored as boolean int or whatever you like

14730494
int	boolean
public boolean checkdoorpermissions int doornumber

14730494
int	boolean
others have suggested making 8 boolean permissions or 8 int s private int doornumber8

14730510
inotifycollectionchanged	icollectionview
so at the end of the day you need a class that implements inotifycollectionchanged and ienumerable such as observablecollection or icollectionview

14730562
gif	png
in the following model only image png image gif and image jpeg are valid content types for the image attachment

14730569

if you data series are not live then you could parse through all the y-values in all series and get the min max and then assign those to your yaxis min and max parameters

14730768
range	max	range	min	min	max
if your data is live updated every x seconds or something then you will need to check the new value to see if it is within the min max range and if not then assign a new min or max

14730794

14730844
post	get
consider this my admin.php references an external .js file with all these ajax calls a common user doesn t have access to the admin page but they can very well navigate to my js folder and see my admin.php ajax scripts these scripts have of course sensitive information in the parameters stuff like the url the type post get

14730890
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
if your classes are serializable you can use objectoutputstream to save them and later objectinputstream to load

14730908
implements	extends
implements an interface is much different from extends an abstract class

14730908
implements	extends
so if dog extends animal implements runninganimal along the inherited move he will also have to implements his own run which might find it s way in the overridden move inherited from animal

14730909

google-chrome	firefox
it works under google-chrome but doesn t work in firefox

14731220
uiview	uipageviewcontroller
i don t think there is an easy way to do it with the standard uipageviewcontroller the trick is to simply set the uiview animation of the frame to be shorter but you would have to implement this behavior in your custom pageview controller

14731233
stdout	stderr
the second part of this command will redirect stderr to stdout ensuring that both appear in the same file

14731235
min	max
the expected output is the min max difference from the base values during the measurement

14731649
google-chrome	firefox
the site is now live and i quickly discovered that in firefox ie that the website is not quite right and after some adjustments that when i make adjustments to try and fix the issues there is around a 5 pixel difference in spacing between google-chrome and firefox ie and i tested now in ie 7 and it was

14731649
google-chrome	firefox
using google-chrome dev i reduced the top-padding in rt-body-bg to 0 and in the logo itself decreased the top-margin to -30 and bottom-margin to -25 and it looks close to what i want but has a 5 pixel gap between the logo and the menu on firefox and in ie the login button starts to move off in some odd direction

14731656

14731792
getter	setter
in the database an array of int is stored in a varchar and i split join this string in the setter getter

14731801
division	modulo
the modulo performs division on the two values and gives you the remainder as the output

14731807
post	get
and you can specify the method get or post

14731841
subtract	add
this returns the first operand modulo the second operand which is the remainder when you subtract or add as much of the second operand off to of the first to get as close as possible to 0

14731855
int	double
edit javascript represents int using ieee double precision format so there is no way to store arbitrary 64 bit int without loss of precision except through custom big int libraries

14731894
for-loop	arrays
it hangs after inputting all the elements of the arrays in first for-loop

14731894

pull	push
later when i tried to push my local repo changes to a remote repo it fails with a non-fast-forward error and prompts me to pull before pushing

14732065
distance	polygons
you need a geometry library that computes distance between two points the center of a polygons etc

14732105
apache	nginx
i do not believe that either nginx or apache would be a bottleneck for my app if configured correctly

14732223
inherited	properties
the problem is that with strict option on i can t find a base type that both inherited and exposes the 3 properties that i need

14732256

but still you will have problems filling exactly the height or the width of the window keeping the right proportion

14732280
multiplying	add
i would just like to add another item into the csv file that is generated by multiplying the number of copies by the type which is technically the price per copy when the form is submitted

14732296
distance	polygons
for 2 non-overlapping polygons the simplest code from the programatical point of view would iterate through one polygons points and find the distance between every point in one polygons and every line in the second polygons and then do the same for the second polygons every point to every line

14732336
slideup	slidedown
you are hiding element before calling slideup or slidedown

you could download the file and filter through the data on the client or you could write server-side code to do the filtering for you then output the result to the caller -- your client-side javascript code

14732347
minimum	max
that code should work when selecting a minimum date it will then set the mindate of the second datepicker to its value vice versa for max

14732404
128bit	64bit
instead the 128bit argument is truncated to 64bit and the resulting count is used to determine the number of bits to shift

14732404
sse	avx2	sse	avx
while the title may be somewhat of a misnomer the document contains descriptions of all sse sse2 ... avx avx2 instructions and descriptions of their intrinsics available in intel s c++ compiler which are typically also available in gcc and others

14732426
min	max
i know that i have to give the methods the positional arguments but i ve left them out because this code will give results they are just the same min max and such over and over

get a boundary point and the center point of the polygons and use the function google.maps.geometry.spherical.interpolate centerpoint bundaypoint distance

14732490
sudo	passwd
you should be able to add sudo access without a passwd for your local user to allow managing this service

14732535
inherited	properties
the prototypal inherited in javascript is based on __proto__ properties in a sense that each object is inheriting the contents of the object referenced by its __proto__ properties

14732535
inherited	properties
note that constructor properties does not exist in created objects but is inherited from the prototype

14732595
google-chrome	firefox
note this behaviour only happens with google-chrome default cursor and firefox text cursor

14732598

14732694
websphere	ibm
starting with websphere 6.1 ibm changed the behavior of filters and these will not be executed if the url you re calling doesn t actually exist on the server

14732711
multiplying	add
you should add the q s together before fftn transforming and multiplying by x

14732715
squash	merge
squash the merge will not change the fact that there are conflicts if the same lines have changed on both files of the commit

14732769
openfire	ejabberd
note that you might as well consider setting up your own xmpp server as there are many free xmpp servers ejabberd prosody openfire jabberd2 and there are free xmpp-enabled web chat clients with jwchat being one example in case you ll want to enable people to chat directly from the web ui

14732800
atomic	interlocked
however that it works is in a sense only accidentally and not guaranteed by any standard so if your platform supports it it is still advised to use some form of atomic interlocked etc

14732803
put	get
perhaps using the workaround that is often mentioned #define expand x x however i don t know where to put this in order to get for example the latter generalised part of this answer to work in vc++10

14732820
prepare	execute	prepare	bindparam
yes i m using pdo prepare statements bindparam execute to prevent sql injection and to store the data safely in the database i m also using

14732825
width	height
also you do not need to change the width and height of the stage and picture each time since it is always 500 this really slows it down

14732832
folder	directory
i tried to make the following script from examples i have seen but the problem is that it creates the folder archive in the directory where the script is instead of the directory where the file is found

14732833
versioning	upgrade
i am using ruby 1.8.7 and tried to upgrade the rails versioning from 3.0.7 to 3.2.11 for the existing application

public	protected
as long as the property you re looping through is acessible from the aspx ascx page declared as protected or public you can loop through it

14732945
getter	setter
due to the virtual entity framework overrides the getter and setter to provide the lazy loading functionality

14732946
maven	pom.xml
this enables you to sort the dependencies in your pom.xml using a maven command

14732975
getter	setter
in order to make aproxy resemble the a class i reimplemented the __call function the setter and getter for properties may also be overloaded

14733013
integer	unsigned
the pdf string is given as a cgpdfstring which is a series of bytesâ unsigned integer values in the range 0 to 255

14733051
getter	setter
actually a lot better approach is to use setter and getter in person class and then use

14733077
width	height
the idea is to trick chrome to re-calculate the width by giving the image a new height that is almost the same on the li hover state

14733093
hide	show
create a handle that can show hide the panel baed on user s action onclick

14733161

14733162
rss	feed
so i have a wordpress plug-in that runs a cron job that reads rss feed then parses the rss feed title and excerpt into new posts

put	get
ok since you can t get it working and i don t want this whole conversation to be a total loss i put together a working project and tested it

14733235
pop-up	dialog
if however you re looking for something more like a dialog box or pop-up menu then a whole new window with its own separate buffer is what you re after

14733267
getter	setter
i think you shoud use a private instance field c like and public getter and setter this

14733272
cgpoint	cgsize	cgpoint	cgrect	cgsize	cgrect
and you can see that cgrect is a struct made of a cgpoint and a cgsize and if necessary please look those up as well to understand how they are defined

14733318
integer	fractions
since an integer doesn t hold fractions parts the result is 0

14733374

14733479
int	boolean
java.lang.string int boolean

14733580
put	get	post	get	post	put
it shows how i can create some controller that handle in this case a simple tasks list so i thought to create one controller for each table and implement the get post put etc for each table

14733585
width	height
one thing i noticed was if i edited the storyboard manually to disable autolayout the ui objects were all still in the storyboard just with a height width of 0

14733603
width	height
what i am trying to do is to make the height of the td auto so whenever a message was submit its width won t expand

14733616
children	parent
thats the beautiful thing about inheritance you declare the method in the parent and implement it in the children and the underlying system handles calling the correct version of the method depending on what type of class the instance actually is

14733635
post	put
i have put in two things since the first post

14733635
ssl	https
i also applied a rewritemap for ssl check so it automaticly puts you to https or http using the server variable https

14733675
coffeescript	haml
i have a haml file content.haml and a coffeescript file main.coffee

14733675
coffeescript	haml
short of manually reconstructing the haml in the coffeescript file by joining an array of strings like this

the okcancelevents method is a way to wrap keyup keydown and focusout dom events around a single function that curates the details of each function s outcome into a custom ok or cancel event

14736036
keydown	keyup
this yields an eventmap object that is bound to the template.todos.events implementation so that all keyup keydown and focusout events come through as ok or cancel via the eventmap

14736036
keydown	keyup
the evt argument is the passed-in event from the keyup keydown and focusout methods and target and target.value are baked-in properties of this native event object

stdout	stderr
in other words you want to pipe stdout into one filter tee bbb.out and stderr into another filter tee ccc.out

14737103
bash	zsh
in bash and ksh and zsh but not in other posix shells such as dash you can use process substitution

but i want to delete just one specific file that could be for eg in my dir filespath other folder file.txt

14739268
mouseleave	mouseenter
instead it should be replaced as .one mouseenter mouseleave function .

14739286

this has been tested with web api mvc 4 and the site from google-chrome and firefox

14739631
post	get
i was somehow thinking that was used for httppost signalling that the parameter was in the body of the post and would therefore not be needed for a get

14739702
google-chrome	firefox
checked it on ie9 google-chrome and firefox

14739708
folder	dir
similarly to select all the files in that folder you can use dir

14739722
setcontentview	findviewbyid
as you can see you are using findviewbyid method but before use it you should call setcontentview

14739735
tpagecontrol	tframe
instead of forms make them individual frames then use the tframe component in individual tabs on a tpagecontrol object to produce the tab layout you desire

14739893
actionscript	mxml
here s a version of janusz s .text reassignment technique in actionscript rather than mxml

14739926
post	put
the simplest way would be to just set update a formgroupid property when you perform a post or put to the forms resource

14739932
spaces	delimiter
note that i renamed the trigger i m guessing the name of the article_id column on the warehouse table i used the new variable instead of shoppinglist within the body of the trigger and you need a spaces before the semicolon in delimiter

14739951
screens	tablet
i realize that for android large means a lot of the current phone screens at 480 x 800 pixels as well as a 7 tablet like the nexus 7 which has 800 x 1280 pixels

14740016
google-chrome	firefox
i ve been experiencing this issue in google-chrome firefox and ie9 where it miserably always fails and it is driving me mad as i cannot figure out why this is happening.

now here is the tricky part we are unable to redirect stdout or stderr to the log because it locks up the server

14740068
intersect	contains
next i filter the results to only the objects that contains a collection of keywords that intersect with our keyword list and has the same number of resulting elements as our keyword list

14740173

14740258
button	checkbox
what the user clicks on the upload button and the user has multiple checkbox selected for this column i like to show a message

14740362
for-loop	loops
instead of a for-loop if you re careful you could probably get away with a while loops that goes off the count of your items returned then just increment that variable by the number of tweets returned on each pass

14740362
next	except
i use something very similar to what you have except i just merge the next set of tweets to a total array then work off that big list of tweets

14740364

14740523
inherited	properties
if all above solutions not fitting your requirements and you don t want to change the base class adding properties from derrived classes then you should also think not only about your inherited design as mentioned by most comments.

14740537
width	height
set itemscontrol s width and height as your layout algorithm tells you to

14740580
width	height
you also give both html and body a width and height of 100

14740580
width	height
if you had not set the width or height properties then they would have defaulted to auto causing both html and body to expand with their contents and always be the same size as the entire viewport area including the area below the fold

14740580
width	height
if you remove the overflow-x declaration or the width and height declarations from html and body the scrollbar that you see belongs to the viewport instead

14740594
client-side	server-side
of course if it s possible to do the processing server-side instead of client-side the situation becomes fairly trivial as well

14740634
for-loop	loops
instead the code moves directly onto the for-loop despite my done call leading to an exception when loops tries to get similarlist.length

14740655
post	put
ok so after reading that post i grabbed the namespace function and put it in its own file

14740670
width	height
you can set width s and height to percentages and have min-width min-height

14740678
width	height
so there you have it you can actually get a c in a rectangle of 1 height and 5 width

14740716
width	height
the center one must have fixed width and height because it s an image

14740716

i was originally going to use a template for an array-style class and just pass it a chars or an int but i ran into problems when trying to implement things like

14740815
int	chars
i was originally trying to use a templated class because both array types have the same functionality but there are some fundamental differences in how memory is allocated in this case for chars s and int s

14740854

so i m trying to get input from the user specifically their passwd before we run some commands through sudo

14740861

14740891
dictionary	map
will retrieve all the attributes and values which can conveniently be placed in a dictionary array or map

14740895
onresume	onpause
the problem is the fragments are managed by the viewpager and the fragment can be recreated without ever executing its onpause and or onresume

14740911
put	get
i want like a loop with a random number i for example and put like i know this is not right but i hope you get the point

14740948
put	get
i created an example eclipse project which is both a hello world app engine app which you can deploy or run locally and a trivial testclient.java which use the remote api to perform remote memcache get and put calls

14740954
width	height
conversely a height limit cannot be used to control float drop but a width limit can

14740964
inherited	properties
so if you re not using the prototype to inherited properties or the keyword this to create new properties in the constructor--you don t really need to use a constructor

14741029
children	parent
i ve also tried a method involving floating the parent container and the children whcih didn t seem to have any effect either

14741109
range	max	range	min	min	max
create a that spans the range between min and max element if you knew the array elements at compile-time i d suggest the std bitset instead but then you could just compute everything in the compile-time using template meta-programming anyway

14741127
decimal	ieee
note that some modern cpus ibm powerpc have ieee 754 2008 decimal floating point arithmetic built-in

14741202
switching	screens
the biggest downside which isn t a big deal is that when you switching to another app say to read your email when you come back you aren t where you left off in your app withing applab but you start over at the applab main screens

14741220
width	height
if you replace the element with a div and you manually set the width and the height of that div to be the same as the replaced element then you are almost there

14741281
int	double
int to double is a widening conversion

14741292
int	double
either cast the int s to double or just use double s

14741320
dbcontext	objectcontext
apparently dbcontext implements iobjectcontextadapter which in-turn exposes the objectcontext

14741332
division	multiplication
btw if you wish you can also have the result as an integer by using the same method of swapping the order and use multiplication before division for example 14 100 49 instead of 14 49 100

14741360
iboutlet	ibaction
i have dragged the segmented control into my vc and then i made an iboutlet and an ibaction connecting to the segmented control

14741368
post	get
action specifies the url to access for the form request and method is either get or post

14741369
min	max
this is probably not the cleanest looking way but you could use an ordinary for-loop to iterate over your min max and then use .slice

14741378
comparator	comparable
and then we can sort the array by making sure person or employee implements comparable or employee implementing comparator person other ... or employee and calling arrays.sort people

14741390
interpolation	splines
i have been trying to implement a binary search on a sorted array of data with an application for cubic splines interpolation

14741590
spaces	delimiter

while having a parent be resolved when all its children are resolved in a behavior i believe is appropriate in some cases i am not at all sure that resolving sub-tasks when the parent is resolved is at all appropriate

14741618
spaces	delimiter
the idea is to capture all the relevant information in pattern spaces with newline delimiter

14741641

14742454
fastcgi	scgi	gunicorn	uwsgi
if you are talking about using nginx more as a proxy through to a wsgi application running as fastcgi scgi with uwsgi or even under gunicorn as a backend then you are fine as although nginx will block for the specific request while waiting for the wsgi application it has a high capacity to handle concurrent requests when proxying due to its asynchronous design

14743525
int	chars
if by letters you re referring to the chars primitive type then they are already represented by int behind the scenes

14743525
int	chars
so you can assign a chars literal to an int variable for example

14743533
int	chars
if the given letter is of chars then convert the type int yourword

post	get
i want to use http get and post for getting the request and response of certain url request

14743673
instances	transient
i wouldn t be surprised if the original developer was using serialization somewhere in the inheritance or implementation chain and that they were avoiding a compiler warning by marking the non-serializable instances variable as transient

14743695
super	self
one thing i don t what the difference is is super class self vs super parent self i have asked this question

14743837
getter	setter
the reasoning is that your jaxb annotated model objects essentially are the contract for the business domain logic that you re trying to represent on a transport level and pojos obviously give you excellent control over getter setter validation and you can control your element names and namespaces with fine granularity

14743908
post	get
however i still get the validation error mentioned above when i check the value in the post data of this particular field it is

14743909

but i am struck how i can do this in django how i can use multi-array inside while loops if i use for-loop or while loops like this

14743986
sortedmap	sortedset	treemap	treeset
ok so sortedmap sortedset is an interface and treemap treeset is it s implementation

14743986
treemap	treeset
so why do we need treemap treeset

14744010
sortedmap	sortedset
but there s no code inside sortedmap sortedset that implements how to actually achieve this functionality

14744015
sortedmap	sortedset	treemap	treeset
sortedmap and sortedset define functionality which is implemented by using trees with a treemap and a treeset

14744019
children	parent
the shell passes a copy of exported variables to it s children as their environment but there is no way for them to pass their environment back to the parent or any process other than their children

14744025
super	self
this class has a save method which makes a super accountform self .save ... call

14744025
super	self
thus bar.save is equivalent to foo.save - it also calls super accountform self .save ...

14744025
super	self
as we noted before foo.save calls super accountform self .save ...

14744028
sortedmap	sortedset
sortedmap sortedset are interfaces so you cannot instantiate them

14744028
treemap	treeset
treemap treeset are classes and can be instantiated and used

14744028
sortedmap	sortedset
the reason why do we need sortedmap sortedset is that there could be implementations other than sun s tree-based ones

14744053
sortedmap	sortedset
sortedmap and sortedset are interfaces

14744053
treemap	treeset
treemap and treeset are implementations of these interfaces

14744060

14744357
background-image	background-position	width	height
you are using img but background-position property wont apply on img element you need to use background-image property in your css and need to set the width of the element here so if the character width is say around 100px and height of 200px than set height and width as 200px and 100px respectively

14744361
width	height
then add the width and height properties to suit your needs

14744452
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
inherited have a superclass of myspecialviewcontroller that has methods you find useful to be available and be able override in subclassing to add additional functionality for that class

14744452
superclass	subclassing
you mention that you don t have time to do this ahead of time thats fine figure out what methods are common and create a superclass after the fact and have your view-controllers be subclassing of it

14744453

mp3	wav
that is can it convert a wav stream to mp3 stream

14744495
int	double
i d expect calculated column to be a double float since we re dividing a number but no matter what i do it always ends up an int and any decimal portion of the result is simply removed so for ex 3.7 ends up 3

14744525
apache	nginx
i would use nginx as a reverse proxy instead of apache because nginx has a way smaller footprint and is evented so can handle way more traffic

14744534
getter	setter
this works if i modify the class in question directly instead of via an extended class removing the declaration of the variable and introducing the setter and getter methods

14744542

i convert uiimage s from ciimage s with something like this

14744642
uilabel	uifont
you can get pixel-perfect baseline alignment for any pair of uilabel by using the uifont ascender value in a simple calculation

14744708
folder	directory
i am working on a tool for my job i hope others could find it useful too that will create security groups in ad based on a provided file path from an smb share assign appropriate permissions on the directory last folder in the file path and then give the groups list permissions to each parent folder above it so users can navigate to the directory while not seeing other directory they have not been given access to we use access based enumeration on our file servers so they will not see any other folder unless they already have access to them by another security group etc...

14744708
folder	directory
what i think i need to do is basically make a list that will contain a path for each of the parent folder for the directory then use a foreach loop to assign the list permissions on the acls of each directory

14744747
disk	ram
unless you have 24 gb in combined ram + swap then you might churn through at the speed of your disk

14744825

14744879
yacc	bison
of course the production is in some sense not really empty if it contains an action since it s hard in yacc bison to remain unaware of the fact that actions are transformed into nullable non-terminals behind the scenes

14744879
yacc	bison
the idea being to slightly decrease the pain of figuring out exactly what language yacc bison has actually implemented after all the heuristics have kicked in

14744901
google-chrome	firefox
this site ajax autocomplete works fine in firefox and google-chrome but the page from this repo ajax autocomplete dropdown is not working

14744993
pull	push
so i can t pull or push

14744997
superclass	subclassing
its like when you type cast to the superclass variable you just can t access the subclassing properties of the object but the object remains intact

14744997
getter	setter
but when you type cast back to the sub-class basically unwrapping the sub-class getter setter methods are visible to you again

14745010
ready	each
as you can see this works great when you have the data right there and ready to serve up but in my case i need to fetch the data for the two lists in the callback and set the respective store for each list

14745013
folder	directory
on c inetpub wwwroot there are only 3 files 1-aspnet_client 2-iisstart 3-welcome and no enterprise directory so i was not able to web share the folder which i can then find on inetmgr

14745040
pull	push
then pull then commit and push

14745048
hide	show
you show all of them and then after this bit of code you do to hide only the one you ve clicked on

14745057
hide	show
you code says if the div with the additional text is visible then slide it up hide else slide it down show

14745069
put	get
after all the last argument is the result class so its basically saying create me objects of that type with these result fields as arguments or use setters with names consistent with those two result fields and you can easily enough put as alias in the select clause to get the result fields to match bean property names in the result class

14745085
getter	setter
what i need is all the users that are in the relationship table as the setter or getter with the logged_in_user

14745094
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade tfs 2010 to tfs 2012 versioning and i faced with problem

14745113
deque	multimap
you can use a deque double ended queue cross-referenced with a multimap tipically a binary search tree which allows duplicate keys

14745113
pull	push
this way you can search in the map in o log n and you can push pull at either ends of the sequence in o log n

14745133

apache	nginx
if that s not acceptable then you might consider using apache or nginx for hosting your static content instead of tomcat which is a container for dynamic web apps written in java

14745263
ssl	https
this is because most of the performance overhead of https connections are associated with the ssl handshake which involves some minor cryptographic signing if i recall

14745263
apache	nginx
again this configuration is easier done in apache or nginx than tomcat.

consistency	acid
but if only store the paths ids to external files that are not managed by the db you lose acid consistency one or more db records could point to one or more files that aren t there or one or more files could exist that don t have one or more associated records in the database

14754647
consistency	acid
another argument for storing files on the file system is that you can stream files but pg large object stores files on the filesystem in a way managed by postgres to both ensure acid consistency and allow streaming which you can t do with a normal blob rails binary type

consistency	acid
some find storing in separate storage using path references a better option and some prefer acid consistency via large objects

i might be wrong but i know that rails actually is simulating the http verbs by adding a hidden parameter _method with value put and the actual request is a post due to some browsers not supporting all the verbs

yes p prints a pointer in whatever format the implementation sees fit usually hex - and that s what you are seeing now and u prints an unsigned integer

14755916
children	parent
help i ll do my best to get sponsorships from bread making companies so that meanwhile we re helping the parent to find their feet we can make a descent school lunch for their children every school day.n

14755959
mockito	easymock
use a mocking library like mockito or easymock

14756023
google-chrome	firefox
since i can t find any reference to pixel sized text on google-chrome s default css or firefox s default css i assume this setting comes from the rendering engine

14756023
google-chrome	safari
my ip is dynamic so i can t provide a live example but here are the screens comparing the same site in iphone s safari and google-chrome on the desktop

14756036
folder	directory
if you have to add images in the same folder as the js code then at least it won t pollute your working directory

14756049
width	height
setting a width height will keep it in the center but it will not let it grow

14756101
gridview	onclientclick
in the gridview instead of setting an onclientclick attribute for each edit image button i just set a commandname of accessedit don t use edit

14756119
sorting	grouping
you need to apply a sorting expression to the matrix row grouping that only takes total variance into consideration and ignores the other columns

14756119
sorting	grouping
apply this to the row grouping sorting expression

14756132
stdout	stderr
note that the output of print goes to stdout the standard output and warn writes to stderr the standard error

14756132
stdout	stderr
in the bourne shell and its derivatives we can also merge stdout and stderr with

14756132
stdout	stderr
the shell first processes which means send stderr to the same destination as stdout â which it already is the terminal

14756132
stdout	stderr
the order is different but remember that stderr and stdout are different streams

14756132
stdout	stderr
perl dup2 to send stderr to stdout â s destination

14756132
stdout	stderr
in preparation to attempt running perl forks a child and in the child process causes stderr to be a duplicate of the stdout but there is another side effect

14756132
stdout	stderr
it doesnâ t go to the terminal because of the dup2 that pointed stderr to the same place as stdout the write end of the pipe back to the parent

14756132
stdout	stderr
the echo completes normally and then dne fails in the shell and the shellâ s stdout and stderr go back to the parent process

14756185
gson	jackson
you can easily serialize this with a variety of json libraries like jackson or gson

14756211
actionlistener	focuslistener
my adding an inputverifier two actionlistener and a focuslistener seems wrong

14756231
width	margin
so you need to make the width less then 100 for margin auto to work

14756262
width	margin
for margin auto to work you need to have a width on the item

14756282
ubuntu	linux
when i compile and run this with gcc in ubuntu linux i get the following helpful output

14756314
min	max
establish a min and max for the current value taking into account that

14756314
min	max
these min and max are near enough to p i so that changing other elements later can compensate changing p i to this min or max that s what the margins above and below indicate

14756314
min	max
change p i to a random value in the calculated interval min max and update the sum and the margins i m not 100 sure of how the margins should be updated here...

14756329
children	parent
with the extra attribute parent you can still easily get all the children of an element like this

14756337
google-chrome	safari
this all works fine as i said in google-chrome ie safari

14756337
opera	firefox
but doesnt work in firefox and opera

14756352
kde	gnome
in gnome kde on linux the user is prompted to enter his password to authorize access to the keyring on a per-application basis

14756392
mouseover	mouseleave
i recommend using just mouseover and then a mouseleave instead of hover

14756407
super	implements
you only ever need to call __setattr__ directly when implements a subclass and then preferably through the super call

14756408
showwindow	cdialog
you can call cdialog create and cwnd showwindow like the others have suggested

14756423
bash	zsh
unfortunately bash has no built-in which like zsh which tells me immediately that kill is a built-in shell command and usr bin which has no way to know of your shell built-ins

14756451
public	protected
you will need to change the access modifier of base class constructor which is probably private or internal to protected or public

14756454
dbcontext	objectcontext
i use items to store things like the objectcontext or dbcontext in ef which i only want to be shared for that given request

14756467
onresume	onpause
you can use the onpause and onresume methods from the application class too in your class to interact with the app state changes

14756492
ord	chr
i wonder also if the xor ord and chr php would have the same result as delphi

14756533
homography	keypoint	orb	keypoint
my code most of it is from the feature homography example in the opencv documentation reads two different images computes their keypoint and descriptors using sift but i have also tried surf and orb matches them using the flannbasedmatcher and computes the homography matrix

14756554
midi	osc
for me the interface is the important part - that means it s ok for me just to get midi osc commands which are processed in a separate pc

14756578
vb.net	vb6
this comes straight from an article discussing techniques to use now that control arrays have been done away with going from vb6 to vb.net

14756579
profiler	aqtime
i try to execute unit tests in nunit console and ask aqtime to launch nunit when i run aqtime code coverage profiler

14756580
children	parent
when you create a qobject with another object as parent it s added to the parent s children list and is deleted when the parent is

14756588
ssl	https
currently i am tearing down and setting up iis every time the build script is run however i am now looking at adding some ssl additions so will want to deploy the iis sites with a self signed certificate and set up the bindings to allow for https

14756633
metaclass	subclassing
most recipes around dealing with metaclass deal with subclassing the __new__ method - automating actions when the class is created

14756646
width	height
i ve gotten this to work in all instances of height width etc...but for some reason with margin-bottom all classes take on the size of whichever of my javascript functions come last

14756659
post	get
parse the request with php extract the get or post variables and insert them into your database

14756661
int	chars
let s say you want three layers which are int float and chars

14756674
width	height
notice where it says if 0 is provided as a width or height parameter aspect ratio is maintained

14756674
width	height
i ve seen plenty that allow both width and height to be specified but not just one

14756691
clang	icc
this behavior can be observed both on gcc 4.7.2 and on clang 3.2 while icc 13.0.1 and vc10 compile both versions without problems

14756746
google-chrome	firefox
this works as intended in firefox and google-chrome

14756768
google-chrome	firefox
it seems to display the same behavior in both google-chrome and firefox

14756801
pop-up	dialog
i m trying to create a pop-up dialog progress bar preferably an indeterminate but that s not too important

14756801
pop-up	dialog
i m pasted my code below of my action listener and the dialog will not pop-up

14756809
width	height
the slider i have in mind has only 2 panels slides both should have fixed height and width

14756938
pop-up	dialog
i suspect the conditions that cause the dialog to pop-up are not being met

14756966
folder	dir
the easiest way is to put a property file in the class path if there is only one war running per server in tomcat lib dir or if there is several war in the war web-inf class folder

14756974
unsigned	short
i always subtract by 32768 when i have an unsigned short that i want to convert to a signed one

14756979
children	parent
i potentially want to animate the children within the parent and only show the visible region defined by the bounding box

14756991
children	parent
it is always the parent of a view that calculates the dimensions of its children

14756991
children	parent
that would suggest taking a look at the parent of the view or rather the first parent whose dimensions are independent of the dimensions of its children

14756991
children	parent
that parent could refuse layouting and thus drawing its children until all children have finished their measuring phase which happens in a separate thread

14756991
children	parent
as soon as they have the parent requests a new layout phase and layouts its children without having to measure them again

14756991
children	parent
it is important that the measurements of the children don t affect the measurement of said parent so that it can absorb the second layout phase without having to remeasure its children and thus settle the layout process

14756994
put	get	post	get	post	put
i know browsers only support post and get requests and laravel supports put requests using the following code

14756996
width	height
i need my output images to be a specific pixel width and height even if it is disproportionate

14757056
ubuntu	debian
i ve the same problem when running the application from eclipse on ubuntu or when deploying the tag in a jar on a debian server

14757079
cpu	processors
we get the option to force restart or cancel if you take the cancel option the java control panel hangs and the javaw.exe process is running at 25 cpu this is on a quad processors server so i assume on a single processors this would be running at 100 cpu

14757093
equals	compareto
then implement override its equals hashcode and compareto methods

14757095
put	get
when i put bytes as data in an envelope object and manually send it via http request on the server i get an array of bytes but when saved to the disc it is a bad broken zip archive

14757112
gmail	hotmail
gmail or hotmail the receiver will get a invitation

14757125
pull	push
if your goal is to eliminate certificate fingerprint warnings during push pull there s a better way to do this

14757132
hide	show
you could use one controller and ng-show hide to show the create or edit version of the page as indicated by a scope property scope.editmode

14757149
slideup	slidedown
for more control over the slide behavior it s better to use the separate slidedown and slideup methods instead of slidetoggle

14757157
int	double
you should change the field to be one of the concrete implementations of the number class int long double etc

14757159
onresume	onpause
so our solution was to grab a partial wake lock when the device goes into the background which is done in the onpause method and release the lock in the onresume method

14757206
folder	directory
perhaps then you could create a .private folder up one level outside of that user s home directory

14757210
outputstream	inputstream
i tried pulling the otiginal inputstream into an apache commons teeinputstream to create an outputstream

14757226
unsigned	short
if the unsigned short value can be greater than shrt_max about the only legal way to convert it to short is

14757233
google-chrome	firefox
i have taken the decision that since firefox google-chrome can be set up to automatically download a file you can verify it s existence afterwards

14757282
cout	cin
there are obviously situations where in c++ scanf is preferable to cin i was wondering if there are any situations where printf is more practical than cout

14757311
int	boolean
or you can switch the tabs using jtpan.setenabledat int tab_index boolean enabled

14757328
oncreate	recreate
it is my understanding that adding in the configchanges to that activity prevents the activity from being destroyed and recreate but the oncreate still gets called and messes up the fragments

14757364
pull	push
if you re working localy git shouldn t ask for passwords obly when doing remote operation such as clone push pull etc

14757373
hide	show
i need to hide the quantity field where one enters the quantity before adding to cart in woocommerce on the product detail page and only show the add-to-cart -button which would then put the quantity of 1 in the cart

14757389
subclass	abstract-class
you can declare a clone method in the abstract-class and override it to return a subclass in the subclass

14757453
filtering	grouping
some misplaced braces for the for and assuming you want to filtering you need to add the grouping array rather than the original recipients string

14757458
hide	show
the other one could be to use data-position fixed and data-fullscreen true provided by the library which will hide show your navbar at the bottom of the page when clicking touching somewhere on the screen

14757468
sorting	grouping
merge the parent and child grouping move the parent grouping and sorting to the child grouping or vice versa

14757472
post	get
although i m not entirely sure why you re using a post to pass get params that would at least be how the formatting and correct syntax would look

14757500
uiapplication	uiwindow
uiwindow keywindow uiapplication sharedapplication keywindow

14757511
post	get
remember this is a class you ve missed the self argument in the definitions of get and post

14757532
pop-up	dialog
since the user wants a confirmation pop-up dialog before saving the entered data i ve replaced the auto-generated h commandbutton with a a4j commandbutton and attached a modal panel to its oncomplete event

14757647
ubuntu	linux
when packaged and the run on linux shell ubuntu 12.04 it fails on the next to last line right before the print with

14757674
wordpress	joomla
much faster on large database sites like joomla or wordpress

14757727
portrait	landscape
if your app has landscape orientation and your lock screen has portrait orientation that s a configuration change

14757727
onresume	onpause
that should stop android from rebuilding your activity every time you lock the screen and will stop the many onpause - onresume callbacks

14757739
subobject	instances
the reason is that the compiler needs a way to get from any instances of d to its a b or c base class subobject

14757739
subobject	instances
so there is no fixed offset to get from a complete object that is an instances of d to its base-class subobject because of the possibility that this complete object is an instances of the as-yet-undefined e

14757745
children	parent
what you will need to do is navigate from nbr to it s parent td then from there to it s sibling td and then down to it s children

14757753
integer	unsigned
association with the type simply the compiler generates code that treats that address as the beginning of a 4-byte unsigned integer e

14757754
queue	fifo
queue typically order elements in a fifo fifo manner while stacks in a lifo last-in-first-out manner

14757754
implements	extends
although there are classes implements a stack like stack which extends vector arraydeque which as stated in the javadoc is likely to be faster than stack when used as a stack and linkedlist with its push and pop methods there is no specific interface for stack collection types

14757792
hide	show
i am trying to hide div when user clicks on checkbox and show it when user unchecks that checkbox

14757802
put	get
as i am not the greatest with expression blend design xaml paths...i found an image peice of toast traced it in inkscape to get the coordinate data and put the data into a path in wpf

14757830
innodb	myisam
how the indexes are implemented may vary but i know they are implemented in the table types memory innodb and myisam

14757831
children	parent
this is because jquery can t put the click event on the element as it doesn t exist on page load so this puts the event on the parent but affects the children

14757846
rsa	aes
normal practice is to generate a random aes key encrypt the key with rsa and then encrypt the plain text with aes

14757893
gif	png
compression is handled by the various file formats themselves jpeg png gif etc

14757893
gif	png
for example small images with a small number of colors and little smoothing pixel graphics will do well with png and gif format

14757898
gif	png
creating the jpeg png or gif

14757898
gif	png
as far as actually creating the jpeg png or gif from the java bufferedimage

14757925
gson	jackson
one is using gson another is using jackson

14757963
addslashes	htmlspecialchars
the reason i think it is not working is that the following message which is pulled from mysql where it had mysql_real_escape_string addslashes and htmlspecialchars applied to it before adding to the database

14757970
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
edit it seems that for firefox and opera you must first focus your input but not on safari and google-chrome

14758008
gson	jackson	org.json	jackson	org.json	gson
i ve used gson jackson and the org.json parser

14758037
put	get
also if i try to put util.log teams.hometeam.name i get the following

14758089
innodb	myisam
and what engine are you using myisam innodb or something else

14758166
folder	directory
the fileinputstream operates on the local disk file system and all relative paths are relative to the current working directory which is the local disk file system folder which is been opened at exactly the moment the jvm is started

14758177
int	chars
i have a problem in the fact that i need to compress around a 6 gb std vector 1.5 billion float s in it and up to now i have used lz4 but it only handles int count of chars s

14758181
vsto	add-in
i have a bare bones vsto outlook add-in

14758198
implements	extends
the exception to this would be in cases where you have larger groups of implements classes that all extends from abstract classes

14758211
mongodb	bson
bson specification says arrays are key-value pairs so you need to use your layer number as the key in the array. mongodb uses bson to store data

14758237
superclass	subclassing
the latter is often the case when you think first of the subclassing and just refactored out some common parts into a superclass

14758237
superclass	subclassing
however when you abstract away from the implementations and clients usually work only with the superclass like in jason s answer then you should follow the strategy of putting each subclassing into it s own package

14758242
titlebar	window
which is not in general the design size of the form your user might have altered the size of the text in the window titlebar or may be running the video adapter in a different dpi setting from yours

14758286
onchange	onblur
notice the use of onchange instead of onblur

14758293
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
if you want a headache it can be done for a variety of browsers - namely latest versions of firefox ie safari and opera

14758293
post	get
you can then get js to encrypt the data base 64 etc and send it along with the other stuff as a post

14758307

my handler per connection have a socket sock printwriter out and bufferedreader in then i associate the socket to printwriter and bufferedreader

14758313
jlist	jtextfield
i have a jtextfield and a jlist in my program

14758313
jlist	jtextfield
i d like to filter the jlist based on the text on the jtextfield

14758313
jlist	jtextfield
when the user changes the value of the jtextfield i would go trought the original list update the temporary list and update the jlist

14758348
hide	show
using links and the target you can make all the images show up when the select is clicked but you still need a way to hide other images when a selection is made

14758436
dbcontext	objectcontext
i have been toying with casting the dbcontext into an objectcontext and running with something like this with a stored procedure spgetmyderiveditems returning all of the derived resultsets ordered in one db hit.

14758437
queue	fifo
conceptually a webcrawler is just a fifo queue of urls

14758477
mocha	node.js
it seems like i m missing something fundamental here but this is my first time using node.js jsdom mocha etc

14758594
dbcontext	objectcontext
i had originally been working with the objectcontext but i changed to the dbcontext to see if that would solve my issue

14758604
min	max
i am creating some summary variables mean min max etc. by group

14758621
hash	salt
you really ought not store passwords at all rather store a salt cryptographic hash of the password

14758631
range	max
edit the images values are in binary range so lowest value is 0.0 and max value is 1.0

14758634
sorting	grouping
everything else was printed with the two english lines grouping by sorting

14758672
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox when the function runs it displays alert-success or alert-info

14758713
integer	unsigned
all this information is used when generating object code so the compiler backend knows to allocate space for it and to treat it as an unsigned integer

14758785
user-controls	elementhost
i found this blog post here memory leak while using elementhost when using a wpf user-controls inside a windows forms project

14758796
gmail	hotmail
gmail hotmail etc

14758809
put	get
now i could just ensure that they re put into the dictionary in the right order and hope that the arbitrary order they get enumerated in maintains that sequence â i ve never seen a dictionary be enumerated in some other sequence but the order of an icollection is not guaranteed

14758832
button	checkbox
i recently had to implement a few widgets such as button checkbox toggle-button with svg dojo-based and i am facing now more widgets combo-box lists and a few more

14758863
put	get
reason you get so many messages is because the messagebox.show is inside the foreach loop just put it outside the loop and you will only see one

14758937
gif	bmp	gif	png	bmp	png
therefore you will not be able to use the same process on jpg and png gif bmp etc

14759018
put	get	post	get	post	put
you didn t put a space between the method and the uri also the post data is not part of the uri as it is when using get requests

14759040
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
second if you have a java client and a java server you can use a much easier way to send your objects to the server objectoutputstream objectinputstream

14759043
fadein	fadeout
maybe minimizing fadeout and fadein time or fadeout slow

14759047
post	get
if a form s action attribute directs it to an https destination then the content is encrypted and transmitted securely to the destination regardless of how the form html itself was originally transmitted when the user submits the form the browser starts a new connection and issues a post request i m assuming your form s method is post not get against the destination not the current browser location

14759055
disk	ram
decompressing several gigabytes only takes a few seconds if all the data is in ram it may then take a while to write the uncompressed data to the disk and loading it from the disk may add to the total time

14759085
google-chrome	firefox
for further optimiztion try measuring you js performance by using firebug on firefox and page speed on google-chrome

14759097
portrait	landscape
the goal is to display two fragments frag a frag b on the screen in a different layout depending on the screen orientation portrait or landscape

14759142
rss	feed
i have written some code to do to get some information from an rss feed and it s working great

14759167
hide	show
there are two ways to hide and show that bottom control

14759167
hide	show
thus i might visually hide the app store control not by playing around with it s hidden property but rather by changing its height to zero or to show it to 77

14759281
bash	tcsh
you source your script which is perfectly valid for into your running shell which happens to be bash and not tcsh

14759433
oncreate	onstart
add to oncreate or onstart

14759453
idictionary	icollection	ienumerable	idictionary	ienumerable	icollection
it s too bad idictionary is not returning ienumerable instead of icollection for the properties keys and values

14759472
instances	transient
you are trying to save a transient instances of usermaster

14759494
lan	localhost
use ifconfig command to see network device on localhost it may be lo and on lan its eth0

equals	gethashcode
i didn t implement the equals and gethashcode correctly

14759506
uiview	subviews
i created a uiview added the search bar as its subviews and then added the uiview to the uitableview

14759518
hide	show
i could probably hide the corresponding elements until the request finishes and then show them but i would prefer some more generic technique if there is any

14759577
crypt	salt
php crypt has a particular way of generating salt and also of putting itself into different modes

14759577
hash	salt
with a randomly generated salt of sufficient length greater than 128 bits an attacker cannot easily brute force your password hash and each password hash must be brute forced individually even if users use the same password

14759583
getter	setter
you can do something similar with properties using getter and or setter

14759595
google-chrome	firefox
but doesn t work with disabled google-chrome s pdf viever and firefox

14759605
many-to-many	one-to-many
the code will depend on type of relationship your want to use - one-to-many or many-to-many

14759620
min	max
i think a combination of isnull and min max should do the trick

14759631
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome work fine the calendar appear under the textbox that was clicked

14759695
rsa	dsa
the _dh_rsa_ or _dh_dsa_ cipher suites also use rsa or dsa for the authentication of the dh key exchange not for the key exchange itself to prevent mitm attacks

14759708
for-loop	arrays
runs a for-loop on the arrays of matched selectors which will give you performance problems if your matched set is too large

14759708
children	parent
to take it a step further do not apply a class to every set of matching elements rather add the class to a parent element and let the children inherit their styles from the updated parent class

14759764
int	chars	int	boolean
as a result jvm was implemented based on int and other smaller data types like byte chars boolean were added for convenience only

14759778
vertica	infobright
ideally i could buy a data warehousing tool vertica infobright etc... but that s not in the cards or the budget

google-chrome	firefox
note 1 i use last -# cause on this page it says ie5 and later says 0 is the first not and not 1 like firefox or google-chrome which in a sense makes sense since that s how an array s index works for full compatibility i start from the last node and work backwards which last would work with ie5 and later and the logic of moving backwards though the nodes should be the same unless microsoft wants to redefine that logic

free	malloc
an interesting point has arisen with some colleagues of mine some of who claim that you should always free memory that you malloc no matter what

14764553
free	malloc
7.22.3 memory management functions dictate the behaviour of all our favourites like malloc and free

14764553
free	malloc
i cannot find anything in the standard that mandates this free on terminate behaviour so an implementation where allocated memory survived process termination is feasible think of a malloc that uses persistent shared memory for example

14764590
nsstring	uifont
where somestr is an nsstring containing any unicode characters a user can type somepoint is a cgpoint and somefont is the uifont to use to render the text

14764613

14764788
folder	directory
i want to check if there are any filenames in this folder which are not in the mysql database but i cant seem to find a way to do this as the loop for fetching the mysql data has to be inside the loop for reading the directory as far as i can figure which messes the whole proccess up

14764790
children	parent
as you can see i use jquery to determine what this element is and then find the input relating to children parent etc

14764790
width	height
i have tried even getting as complex as detecting item_wrapper s position and width height and positioning a fixed div over it but that doesn t seem to be the right solution there has to be a better way

14764807
for-loop	loops
i should somehow be able to insert instead another for-loop which multiply and pass the result but i can t find a way to do it without falling into an infinite loops

14764824
addition	multiplication
in the same way that exponentiation is repeated multiplication so multiplication is simply repeated addition

14764873
xlib	xcb
i thought there would be a straightforward way to do this via xlib or xcb xpyb but in my experiments the best i ve been able to do is detect when a window is created destroyed or moved

put everybody in a room and talk it out doesn t work if there are too many people - maybe just get the dept heads

14765031
hash	md5
the first approach that came to my mind was introducing a new column with mandatory unique value and place there something like md5 hash

14765031
hash	md5
i expected that if a new upload with the same md5 hash is attempted the service must prevent the document contents duplicate from reaching the library by virtue of unique hash column value constraint

14765031
hash	md5
while it is not a problem to change implementation a bit and check the document library for equal md5 hash value existence prior to calling setsavestream this feels like an excessive effort that totally defeats the purpose of declaring the unique constraint for md5 hash value column

14765032
x86	64bit
these files are 32 64bit specific so i have two include folders in my build path include x86 and include x64 with their respective .dll files in each

1. i would like to modify the width and height of this content and can t figure out how to do it

14765283
integer	unsigned
you re getting a weird value because of the unsigned to signed integer conversion

14765345

start by having a read of creating guis with swing and then have a read of performing custom painting and finally i would highly recommend you take a look at painting in awt and swing

setinterval is different from the settimeout because it will run your function every 500ms without any action

14765465
entities	entitymanager
each can have its own entitymanager instance which caches its own set of entities and you could think of that cache as smaller in memory database if you like

getter	setter
if you need it to be more complicated give one of your preloader graphics an instance name and set up a getter setter pair for it then use the setter to trigger your logic that accesses the stage

14765816
setinterval	settimeout
that s because settimeout and setinterval makes the code asynchronous and continues to execute the code

14765819

int	double
while it is true that the single-argument overloads math.round double and math.round decimal will always return an integral value these overloads still cannot return an int value type

14766247
int	double
so math.floor will return a double which could be casted to int or long based on the size and developer

14766247
int	double
if you tried math.floor outside range of int it d have failed if math.floor returned an int but it doesn t it returns a double which you can cast to long

14766281
google-chrome	firefox
browser is firefox or google-chrome

14766289
onclick	onchange
note that i changed the event from onclick to onchange but that s really up to you whether you want this function to run when the element is clicked or its value is truly changed...it can reduce some unnecessary calls

14766343
hide	show
the script currently tells the first child class of the two corresponding divs to show and to hide any other sharing that class

14766370

you would divide by 2 because every parent has exactly 2 children -- every level uses twice the space of the parent level

14767004
put	get
also from the rest end of things you might consider using put for this resource instead of get because your endpoint has the side effect of updating uuid and or statuscode the state of the resource not simply fetching it

14767031
put	get
you can either get __contains__ to call contains or just put the whole code in that method instead

14767035

14775712
versioning	upgrade
the event versioning bleed into each other making it impossible to simply upgrade from versioning 1 to 2 during the replay

it should be easy to extends functionality by implements your own recommender extends abstractrecommender or by implements your own factorizer extends abstractfactorizer

14775727
hide	show
i think you re only getting the modal one time because the validate plugin only constructs the message one time then uses hide show

14775738

after playing around for a little bit using info provided by the others i found a solution that worked in ie firefox and google-chrome

14776179
width	margin
this is almost identical to abernier s answer but i found that including width would break the centering as would omitting the auto margin

14776231
width	height
this does create more work depending on how you would like the contents of the cell to be rendered as the width height of the cell is being updated as you scroll

14776246

now the problem is that i can t get i th post to display

14776322
superclass	subclassing
how would you implement a model where an abstract superclass a has 2 subclassing b and c

14776323

i tried popwin.el and want to add an entry to popwin special-display-config such that all buffers that start and end with for example or which is the name for the buffer with the output from the latex compiler popup in a tempoary window at the bottom width a height of 40

14776648
hide	show
it is supposed to show and hide certain icons

14776672
coalesce	isnull
to avoid this you can use coalesce function which determine result data type by first parameter also benefit of this function is that it s ansi standard instead of isnull

14776736
width	height
but problem is what it not quad anymore it looks like rectangle because our screen width not equal with height

14776790
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari

14776851
ant	maven
what i did was to use an ant script within the maven file it would find all the tld definition files under the projects i needed and looped over each file and do something

14776851
ant	maven
with maven you need to learn a little bit of ant script and know how to call java classes tlddoc or the xslt engine

14777029
width	font-size
the problem is safari 5 s default font-size seems to be independent of the em width in an unpredictable way

so at the end of the for-loop num will be equal to the number of lines in the files probably larger than 50 so it will exit from the while-loop

14777091
superclass	subclassing
generally your subclassing are aware of the superclass but your superclass doesn t know anything about the subclassing

14777091
superclass	subclassing
the reason for this is to avoid having the superclass dependent on the subclassing

14777091
superclass	subclassing
sometimes it makes things convenient to break that rule and have your superclass be aware of the subclassing and create instances of them but in other cases it s not possible

14777094
svg	vml
the best way to distinguish between fast svg browsers and slower vml browsers is to use the highcharts.svg boolean property

14777097
maven	pom.xml
typically a maven built jar artifact will have it s pom.xml included under meta-inf

14777097

14777449
firefox	safari
both firefox and safari have no background color to the forms

14777458

or sometimes you can multiplying by 1 3 x 5555 instead of dividing by 3 then multiplying by 3 which is a single addition and subtract to get the modulo

14777485
hide	show
normally i could put image inside div and hide it media screen and show with media print but i m not sure how to deal with sprites

children	parent
so i have documents with children and a list of keys in the parent referencing the children and almost whenever we want a parent we also want the children to come along

14780846
packets	pcap
packets ---len stored in pcap packets header

14780896

14781144
width	height
but when i zoom in zoomfactor was 1 the scrollable height width remain very small

14781184
post	get
would it be a better practice to upload the file first get some sort of token from the server as a response and then send the json in a second post referencing the token from post #1 so the server would know which file to associate with the incoming jaxb_trackbean instance

14781244

children	parent
in the template for the parent element apply templates not to all children but only to the first child

14781593
hide	show
if you are using php or asp or a different server side language - ie python you can make it nasty to view and hide some of it - ie all your php code to generate your page doesn t show which you can have if you want to obfuscate the code add junk data which is a nasty thing to do but is the closest thing you can do to hide your html code

i realize i should override the function but i m using an old versioning and will upgrade soon

14781727

14781727
std	ostream
what you should do instead is make out not a but simply a std ostream

14781727
std	ostream
the std ostream doesn t have a default constructor - it has to take a buffer pointer

14781735

14782399
width	height
i have no clue why you have xpersepective in your css ie10 is unprefixed in css however the perspective property must have some kind of unit for the depth perspective 1000 won t be applied because the browser doesn t know what unit it is in similarly like width and height etc you have to apply px em etc

14782446
for-loop	arrays
i have seen on a lot of posts that iterating through a 2d arrays via a double for-loop is horrible ugly etc.

14782446
for-loop	arrays
the x and y positions are already built in to the data structure as the indexes of the arrays so you dont need to add say a tuple as a dictionary key and by changing the for-loop paramaters you can very cheaply iterate through different parts of your grid while totally ignoring the parts you dont want to iterate through

14782459
post	get
you have to get it on server side the same with getting wall post

14782471

button	checkbox
now what happens is that if i click on the checkbox button quickly twice it turns on the button but then it does not turn it off it instead does a little text selection on the button

14782611
button	checkbox
my question is that for only the checkbox button how in javascript as i assume it is client side to sort this out how to prevent the text selection from happening only for the checkbox button not for the whole document

14782613

width	height
it is called with the attachment id the image url a desired width a desired height and a variable indicating whether the image is to be cropped or not cropped

14782780
width	height
ideally i would like to be able to specify the size of an image through the width and height variables and the function would produce an image with those exact size specifications not cropped

14782780
width	height
i thought the problem may be with the wp_constrain_dimensions function call so i attempted to comment proportional_size variable out and directly set the resized_img_path with width and height but it was unsuccessful

14782785
post	get
the modification you have made to the script has caused it to look for a request variable post or get variable with the name other instead of the name task

14782813
width	height
it looks like the chart api was having problems figuring out how to fit your text into the size you specified width 350 height 200

14782904
std	ostream
the only public constructor of std ostream accepts a

i am trying to run a program given by the path specified by the user using the fork exec and waitpid commands

14782943
put	get	post	get	post	put
the problem is changes requests into get requests although i ve had inconsistent behavior with post and put requests

14782973
waitpid	fork
with fork exec you generally do the exec in the child process and the waitpid in the parent process

14782976
post	get
even though you re using this controller with a get action but no post action the controller still gets its valueprovider instantiated upon creation so you need to do the same thing in your test scenario

14782987
post	get
it would be much easier if you would post all relevant ddl and sample data but you can try something like this to get your image_id

the short answer is that by definition -0.0 is less than 0.0 in all the methods provided by the double class that is equals compare compareto etc

14783451
equals	compareto
if you don t know that in the double class -0.0 is less than 0.0 you may get caught out when using methods like equals and compare and compareto from double in logic tests

however this doesn t mean that the firmware blob is the result of some ã¼bergeek furiously punching in hex code all day long these files most often start their lives in toolchains that support a workflow that is quite comparable to regular programming source code is produced in some higher language but not necessarily one of the common ones like c or c++ and that code gets compiled to a binary file - the firmware file

14792016
queue	fifo
on mac os x one can design a fifo queue that stores all the thread ids of the blocked threads and then use the nifty function pthread_cond_signal_thread_np to wake up one specific thread - which is obviously non-standard and non-portable

14792016
queue	fifo
i have something i call a conditionlockqueue which is very similar to the nsconditionlock class in the cocoa library but it maintains a fifo queue of blocked threads instead of a more-or-less random pool

14792030

in the c++ standard support.types 18.2 6 the type size_t is an implementation-defined unsigned integer type that is large enough to contain the size in bytes of any object.

14792097
integer	unsigned
it is an unsigned integer type big enough to hold the size in bytes of the largest object that the implementation can allocate

14792097
free	malloc
the book the unix programming environment by kernighan and pike from 1984 has no mention of size_t in the index nor of malloc or free somewhat to my surprise but that is only indicative not conclusive

14792097
integer	unsigned
c89 like k r defined the result of the sizeof operator to be a constant of an unsigned integer type

14792097
integer	unsigned
implicitly restricts size_t to be a synonym for an existing unsigned integer type

jboss	glassfish
new jboss and glassfish servers are java ee 6 compliant and implement the ejb 3.1 specification

14792641

t3 dom-ready-- however you get events addeventlistener domcontentloaded ... window.ondomcontentloaded ... etc. at this point the html has been completely parsed and js is 100 available including all functions that read or manipulate the html getelementbyid ... appendchild ... etc.

14792771
width	height
for example if you put them all in the drawable-mdpi yet the device is running on xdpi screen this would take 4 times more memory because we double both width and height

14792818
prepare	execute
fast because they are prepare once and execute many times

14792820
mouse	keyboard
i use wrap and linebreak and you can imagine that scrolling by keyboard and mouse is a nightmare since if you have a very long line it can wrap below the visible screen

14792845
inherited	properties
this will return only own properties not inherited ones

14792845
inherited	properties
elements all inherited from the same objects so they mostly have the same properties

i ve also run this same program through valgrind and i get an incredible amount of output most of which looks something like this varying only depending on which trigonometric function i m using sin tan atan2 etc.

14792939
equals	gethashcode
notice when overriding equals you also need to override gethashcode

14792940
memcached	apc
if that engine is memcached or apc it must be changed to avoid naming collisions with any other cake apps running on the server

14792940
memcached	apc
my development laptop was using file cache engine while the production server was using apc and later memcached

14792947

put	get
flip is used to flip the bytebuffer from reading from i o put ting to writing to i o get ting after a sequence of put s is used to fill the bytebuffer flip will set the limit of the buffer to the current position and reset the position to zero

14793037
put	get
this has the effect of making a future get or write from the buffer write all of what was put into the buffer and no more

14793043
inherited	subclassing
then when you subclassing person for trainer and sportler i guess rails assumes that you are using single table inherited so they all get stored in the people table

unless you are prepared to dedicate many years non-stop of your life to debugging and programming and mastering the tiniest nuances of timing sources inside of guests using various hypervisors with various hypervisor configurations at 1000 clock ticks per second as that relates to which codec you are using baed on whether or not you are going to have 1 call or 10 calls or 100 calls going and whether or not you will be recording those calls and whether or not any one else on the systemd will be having a conference call at the same time based on the exact version of the daemons and the driver then i would humbly and professionally recommend going another route now and saving your head and your hair for some thing actually worth your time

14793112

i could create a geometry shader and simply pass it the quads top left point as well as it s width height and texture position

14793157
mouse	keyboard
there are dozens of hardware devices keyboard mouse video card hard drive network card sound card etc and dozens of programs running at once and it s the operating system s job to mediate between them all as necessary

note you can make use of show and hide instead of toggle if you are applying a one-time effect

14793184
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
what makes it fast is the precalculation of tangential and radial movement factors and the actual loop has no trig function calls only multiplying add and subtract

14793184
cos	sin
the slowness comes from cos and sin which are repeated unnecessarily in loop

14793184
cos	sin
this can be solved by precalculating cos and sin as described in the above mentioned so post

int	boolean
is for primitive data types hashes lists strings boolean null int

14793450
int	chars
in xml basically everything is a text so you need to add some more information about the type see type attribute in the example above while in json the type is already defined the notation is the same as in javascript so 1 is one chars string while 1 is an int

14793472

the problem is you are reading shape as an int but switch ing it as a chars

14793592
hash	md5
if the application would work on multi-user system there might be user that would have two files with the same md5 hash he might be engineer and play with such files or be just curious - they are easily downloadable from i myself during writing this answer downloaded two samples

14793600

as i am a debian user i m not sure if this solution still works in ubuntu at least in version 2.30.2 of gnome-terminal it was possible to change it this way

14793676
base	fractions
in general the way to think about it is if you are halving or dividing your input by a third or any fractions and going upto 0 then it will be log base of that factor you re dividing by

14793679
stdout	fflush
explicitly fflush after writing to stdout without a newline

14793679

if i remove ttf section from below - firefox and google-chrome do not render woff font either

however when i put a top margin on the mainmeal div to push it down from the brower the space created by the top margin is white being styled by the css for mainmeal and it extends the whole width of the body

14793925
translation	localization
now i ve been managing localization projects for more than 15 years but i ve never heard of a translation tool that handles latex files

14793933
google-chrome	firefox
ps if all you really want to do is alter a page s look or css the stylish extension is the fastest easiest way to do that in either google-chrome or firefox

14793936

also i have thought about extends each class to implements a common interface.

14793969
post	get
i d post code i ve tried but i can t get a start on fading the entire box which would also suffice for my purposes i can add another div with the background underneath all i need is to fade the text

14794006
subtract	add
accounts are created with a balance and i want the transaction amount depending on its type to either add or subtract from the balance

14794014
ubuntu	debian
it will most likely be your .libpath setting -- which is why i instrument to the debian ubuntu package to use a system-wide rather than per-user setting

14794026
background-color	transparency
oh and by the way in this example i did not change the position of the div to absolute or set the background-color which means if it did popup the background would be transparency

14794050

you do not need group by as you have no aggregate functions min max etc

14794090
versioning	upgrade
if you are using c# 5.0 you can use the async await functionality which lets you write asynchronous code that appears synchronous but it will be compiled into asynchronous calls that utilize callbacks continuations which is what you would need to do if you have not yet upgrade to that versioning

14794111
post	get
if you were to use php this would work assuming you use get instead of post

14794139
put	get
if there are no items in the queue get will by default wait for items to be put into the queue

14794149
implements	extends
also the class extends thread instead of implements runnable

14794216
google-chrome	firefox
tried this with ie google-chrome and firefox

14794315

you should really be using a server-side language for cookie setting getting as client-side cookie setting getting can get messy not to mention be insecure and easy to exploit

your first problem is that the types of d are factors which are converted to int and not chars when you try to use it as indices in dist cbind d response d opt1

maven	m2e
i m using m2e plugin to develop maven project in eclipse

14794423
width	height
rather than formatting with css try setting the width and height values of the images

14794435
width	height
the problem is that you will have to calculate your image height and width first

14794435
width	height
calculate the original image height and width

14794439
hide	show
i have a table which i search show hide rows using quicksearch jquery plugin

14794521
hash	salt
personally i would use a single container for usernames and salt hash passwords rather than two separate containers

14794621
switching	screens
after switching accounts and uninstalling from the start screens it worked fine

14794625
free	malloc
so this post responds to the comment that if you have problems in c using malloc and free correctly you should switch to another language. if the programming problem is complicated and the solution needs heap allocations the even the best programmers will have to debug memory leaks

14794636
folder	directory
i dont know if this could also have a effect on it but i did just add photo upload functionality to my project and i also moved the uploads directory on my server side to the root folder of my server side folder but i did update all my code

14794658
width	height
what matters is the width height of the viewport especially since desktop users don t always maximize their browser

14794662
width	height
use following method for specific height and width that you want with image

14794721
short	base
in c++ you might want to use a class hierarchy instead though it ll be a pretty short bushy hierarchy -- in fact could easily be all the others derived directly from the base class

14794764
put	get
then put a breakpoint in the if statement and see if you get anything back

14794797
ubuntu	linux
i have two ubuntu linux bash scripts which take input arguments

14794870

the project runs properly in firefox and google-chrome but it appears mess in the ie even in latest version

14794987
super	self
since i am calling something on self when super init is yet to happen

14795012

you code this in such a way that each node has reference to its parent node and references to all of its children nodes so that you can easily traverse the tree from parent to children and then back

14795015
rss	feed
i have two xibs setup one starts up and there is a button on the xib that then loads a view separate xib which has an rss feed

14795015

on the second xib which is the rss feed i have a navigation button named home that returns to the original xib

14795026
super	self
self here works the same way as you write super

14795032
avd	galaxy
if same is the case with you having a old pc make an avd with small screen resolution rather than using the tab galaxy nexus

14795035
button	checkbox
other input types checkbox and button in example work well.

14795056
width	height
i have to iterate for-loop depend on the the height and width of the image

14795059
button	checkbox
and you should think about implementing the actionlistener in an anonymous class rather than directly in the frame class especially when you would like add some other button or checkbox

14795060
free	malloc
recall that malloc has to save the size of the allocated chunk of memory somewhere so that free can work correctly

14795060
free	malloc
when you overwrote that chunk of memory you left the internals of the malloc - free system in an inconsistent state leading free to report an error when this was discovered

14795060
realloc	malloc
some malloc corruptions will be detected the next time you call malloc but that usually takes more deliberate effort to achieve. calling realloc should give you a similar error message

14795088
google-chrome	firefox
i m working on a website and it works perfectly in google-chrome firefox but i m experiencing two issues in ie8 and 9

14795105
udp	tcp
moreover if you are sending requests this quickly consider using udp over tcp

14795108
document.write	getelementbyid
you re right..i just replaced the document.write with the getelementbyid like below and i m having some kind of conflict

this works in google-chrome safari and firefox

14795158
background-image	background-color
however in ie the background-color and background-image is not working it s still the twitter bootstrap blue

14795160
folder	directory
inodes store information about files and directory folder such as file ownership access mode read write execute permissions and file type

14795165
onclick	onchange
you d need to run something on the onchange event of the radio buttons or a button onclick event like submit answer which reads in the next questions and options

14795192
mouseout	mouseenter
mouseenter and mouseout are the brothers of hover method and more reliable for the enter leave elements event than adding a bit of .stop to clear the animation queues and the fantastic fadeto method should be the cherry to our recipe

14795207
performselector	delegation
however i don t think you d be able to write a generic proxy that could handle any delegation because although the proxy gets respondstoselector called it doesn t get performselector called - the selector is sent directly to the proxy and not via performselector

14795250
width	height
1 just strech more that means just try to increase the width height of your images just by pulling or streching them

14795251

basically how to i make the children element fill but fit within the parent div either in or out of fullscreen

14795344
google-chrome	firefox
it always works in firefox and google-chrome

14795345
post	get
below query might get you wrong results - please post table structure and sample data and i can create a demo for you

14795350
public	protected
most modern languages adhere perfectly to this scheme but only if you restrict yourself to private fields and public protected methods

14795423
width	height
it gives an element with id search bar the absolute position a width of 300px height of 27px and it sets the search bar 50 from it s normal position

14795444
width	margin
it is because you are using position absolute so the negative margin is half of the width of the element so that it shifts the element behind by 1 2 of it s total width

14795505
folder	directory
i think you need to actually move the text file to a sub-directory - something like resources and add that resources directory as a source directory to the project - project properties java build path source add folder

14795505
folder	directory
i don t think that you would have another option because if you would add the root directory as source folder eclipse would complain that it cannot nest source folder

14795506
superclass	subclassing
you are having a subclassing reference holding a reference to a superclass object that is simply illegal

14795506
superclass	subclassing
secondly you need to defined the method you have in subclassing also in superclass if you want to see polymorphism into effect

14795590
int	chars
is just printing the chars representation rather than the int representation

14795622
for-loop	arrays
for..in returns not the just the arrays elements but anything added to the arrays prototype meaning if you use a traditional for-loop you can be completely confident the code will work regardless of what external libraries may be included on the page

14795631
width	height
in opengl we specify vertices range start from -1 to 1.how these range maps to device where it ranges from 0 to width height

14795640
put	get
you must use the same name for the extra in put and in get

14795640
put	get
for example you put user_lat but then try to get user_latitude this obviously won t work

14795645
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i have created a uitabbarcontroller and within one of the tabs i have created a uiviewcontroller as a container

14795645

this viewcontroller manages the transition between a uiviewcontroller and a uinavigationcontroller

14795648
munin	cacti
set up any number of monitoring systems like cacti munin and others and be done with it

14795653
ubuntu	linux
i can t speak directly to ubuntu 12.04 but in general you can download the linux sources as a package for your distro and it shouldn t require you to download install gcc

14795659
button	checkbox
it may be easier to use just input for your textboxes and then either override for css or exclude with not to strip out checkbox radio button etc

14795713
hide	show
we even tried handling the check events of the columns menu show or hide columns manually

14795776
floating-point	fractions
first don t use floating-point types to represent money because normally floating-point types are binary and as such cannot represent all decimal fractions cents exactly further these types are prone to rounding errors

14795823
integer	fractions
5 2 2 we re dropping the fractions part since it s integer division

14795825
multiplying	transpose
i need to multiplying a matrix and its transpose but i get the following error

14795829

i put in a save_and_open_page to debug and i get this notification in the page

14795829
rspec	capybara
i m using devise rspec capybara and rails 3

14795832
g++	gcc
i used gcc and g++ both

14795833
width	height
i want to convert pdf to svg using pdf2svg without the width and height specification that is automatically added for the purpose to make it fit to the container along the lines of what is mentioned here

14795865
portrait	landscape	width	height
it works as expected in portrait mode but on changing orientation turning device page does not automatically convert for landscape view instead the page appears similar to portrait view with its width and height changed

14795865
portrait	landscape	width	height
in textbox focus method on click of the textbox landscape page turns portrait automatically with its width and height changed and doesn t even look similar to the correct portrait view

14795896
keydown	keyup
try handling the keyup event instead of keydown

14795931
put	get
now i imagine that one should probably refactor this and put it in the application_start method as mark suggested but you get the idea

14795944
google-chrome	firefox

14796069
mockups	prototyping
advanced mockups prototype tool that can be used for game animation prototyping wanted

14796134
mouseup	mousedown
it is because click requires mouse button to go both down and up and â as techfoobar noted â it must be done at the same place on the target element if coords of mousedown and mouseup are not equal the click event won t be fired

14796138
put	get
if you want to get the json data directly you should put instead of an url that retrieves that data

14796139
grizzly	netty
in general for something which should run reliable i will suggest to use nio framework like grizzly or netty

14796148
getter	setter
i was a bit surprised that angular used plain old js objects rather than requiring you to call some kind of getter setter so that it could hook in and do the necessary updates

14796170
qlineedit	qlabel
firstly i m using qlabel inside qscrollarea then qlineedit outside from qscrollarea

14796170

in the past i ve passed my view of type user-controls into my tabcontrol on my mainwindow and cast it to a tabitem and this works well

14796236
cgi-bin	httpd.conf
for same cgi-bin directory following configuration should be in httpd.conf

14796236
cgi-bin	httpd.conf
if not create a cgi-bin directory at some other place where you can have write permissions and provide rather its path in alias and directory attributes in httpd.conf instead

14796259
int	double
extract generically returns double precision int seems more appropriate for the number of days so cast to int int and use int for the out parameter

14796268
min	max
given that max flow min cut problem is really a linear programming problem primal dual respectively i reckon any method to check uniqueness of lp solution and finding alternative optimum solution if its not unique can be used in this context

14796331
free	malloc
although the malloc machinery must know the amount of memory associated with the pointer internally it needs it for a corresponding free call and apparently some implementations provide functions to return this information as far as i know there is not implementation-independent and portable way of doing this without handling it yourself

14796335
theos	logos
i did find a example for doing this using theos logos

14796342
int	boolean
also it is a better idea to keep the state as an int or boolean and not use the title to resolve the state each time

14796354
cydia	tweak
i am making a cydia tweak with a preference bundle using theos in my iphone

14796372

14796411
ienumerable	iqueryable
your problem is the call to asenumerable - it converts the iqueryable to a ienumerable

14796411
ienumerable	iqueryable
possible solutions rewrite the query to not use asenumerable if you want an iqueryable returned or you could change the return type to be ienumerable if that is a better fit for your problem

14796425
symfony	kohana	kohana	yii
you may use some kind of php framework like yii zend symfony or kohana

by the way you should really not compile stuff on device because the gcc that there s on cydia is very outdated i think it s from the ios 3.x days and using theos is a pain in the ass anyway there is another framework that ll help you building preference bundles and tweak siri extensions toggles for sbsettings ... it s called iosopendev and it lets you use xcode for these projects which is a major improvement over compiling on device from the command line so without code completion syntax highlighting and all those great improvements xcode can give you

14800423
mouseover	mouseout
i d like to be able to set click events as well as changing things like the fill color on mouseover and mouseout

14800446

14800537
opera	google-chrome
google-chrome and opera mobile behave as they should

14800550
folder	directory
i ve create virtual directory map it with physical directory then put all necessary files there including bin folder with all .dll s

14800557
google-chrome	firefox
it works in firefox google-chrome and ie9 but is broken in ie10

14800558
rss	feed
so my question is can rss and atom feed be considered as web service

14800584
super	abstract
you can access the constructor of the abstract class from the subclasses using the super keyword

14800599
int	chars
this function below simply takes a string that is being filled with 64 bits int and each value is separated by a delimiter chars which will be put into the vector

14800599
spaces	delimiter
while it seems the data uses white spaces as a delimiter with the code above the whole code will fail logically

14800616
int	chars
longestx is an int containing the number of chars of the longestx album etc

14800642
textview	imageview
adding them to a custom view is not a big deal but i don t know how to access those attributes in a basic view textview linearlayout imageview ...

14800647
int	boolean
unlike only takes up n bits takes up maybe 8n bits or whatever the smallest alignment is on your machine compiler and your actually takes up 32n bits since you re using 32-bit int to store boolean values

14800670
translation	localization
while we may have had linguistically bad translation updates werde always done quickly and we never ever had broken target files or functional problems due to localization

14800710
oncreate	onstart
make sure to call finish in oncreate since this will avoid the rest of the lifecycle methods onstart onresume etc. to execute

14800780
margin	height
just apply the following jquery command which basically just inserts an empty div having a height of 0 px but now matches the css selector adding the margin in every case

14800781
popover	tooltip	versioning	upgrade
the definite solution is to upgrade to the last 2.3.0 versioning or apply this diff github to your jquery tooltip plugin because popover inherits tooltip behavior

14800820
width	height
for some strange reason whatever cgrectmake size i put the result is the same the popover takes all the height of my view and half of the width

14800836
persistent	transient
the rule that is beginning to emerge for me as i follow this line of thinking is that value objects should only be created to represent things that are either static to the application or things that have already been persistent into the database but not things that are transient within the current domain context

14800856
gridview	sqldatasource
my gridview use sqldatasource and this is my code

14800888
postgresql	mysql
the problem with advisory locks at least with mysql and postgresql is that they don t respect transaction boundariesâ if the lock-holding caller doesn t commit their transaction before the lock is released other connections will not see those changes when they try to acquire the advisory lock so we need to be careful here

14800972
stdout	stderr
it spawns the processes and returns a file descriptor for each of stdout stderr and stdin

14801005
min	max
setting the min and max values on a chart is now possible with xchart

14801021
google-chrome	firefox
however the cookie does not get stored and sent with subsequent requests tested in both google-chrome and firefox

14801047
textview	imageview
or is something like this generally more primitive a textview with a 1 pixel horizontal image imageview

14801048

i use the entity manager to save data for several types like int byte string double etc and this works fine

14801050
opera	google-chrome
i ve tested it both on opera and google-chrome with the same problem in both

14801075
width	height
i want to be able to do it with other drawables like gradients and solid colours but on those cases the width and height are not set

14801093
tcpdf	fpdf
i am not familiar with tcpdf since i use fpdf but the way i handle a footer on every page is to create a function that explicitly writes footer data to a specific x y coordinate

14801097
children	parent
from what i can understand it forces a parent to wait for all of its children before continuing

14801126
width	height
ie width height

14801126
width	height
width i know is determined by the printer but im curious to height

when i get this post request to build my items it seems that i can t properly validate the uniqueness of the lineitems until after saving my order

14801242
rss	feed
it s a simple output of an rss feed but the rss is generated on the fly by dircaster

14801255
solaris	bsd
on bsd but not mac os you can wait on aiocbs using kqueue and on solaris illumos you can use a port to get notified of aiocb completions

14801255
for-loop	loops
also your solution of using a mutex is sub-optimal since you will synchronize each loops in the for-loop and just run one at a time unless it s a recursive mutex but in that case its state could be corrupt if your signal handler happens to land on a different thread

14801315
profiling	debugging
that means it s essentially useless except perhaps to debugging lifetime issues but there are memory profiling for that

14801326
children	parent
if bidirectional relationship is needed parent knowing children that can be done by adding following

14801362
swt	swing
on-screen using swing or swt

14801372
put	get
i d rather put them in a folder and get whatever details on the fly

14801428
getter	setter
we recently learned that all variables a class should be private so all the variables in game are accessed by gamegraphics through getter and setter

14801471
getter	setter
the reason you use getter setter is mainly to hide the implementation from the invoking class in your case gamegraphics

14801471
getter	setter
and your getter setter access the members directly so calling them while they call your instance variables is a bit redundant

14801471
getter	setter
however if your getter setter do something else than solely changing values like logging etc then you obviously always need to use them

14801483
htmlcleaner	jsoup
check out jsoup it s my recommendation for any kind of java html processing i ve used htmlcleaner to but then switched to jsoup

14801488
ati	nvidia
i m using an ati with the latest drivers maybe someone could try the code on an nvidia card

14801490
getter	setter
the two major reasons behind using accessor methods getter and setter to access variables of other classes are

14801490
subclass	accessor
an ability to override an accessor in a subclass

14801495
getter	setter
the point of getter setter is to provide safe access to fields for clients that don t know about the internals of the class but the class itself does know about its internals

14801495
getter	setter
if the getter setter do something additional that needs to be done even if they re called from inside the class call them

14801517
width	height
i have a website and for some reason the jqueryui dialog is opening at a height 100px smaller than it should be if i run the same code in the chrome console it works fine #dlgaddworklog .dialog autoopen false width 258 height 250

14801517
width	height
#dlgaddworklog .dialog autoopen false width 258 height 250

14801520
removeclass	next	next	addclass	addclass	removeclass	hide	removeclass	hide	show

14801528
width	height
i m storing the image data as rgb values in an int array of length width height of the image i want width being 320 height is 50

14801535
int	chars
and it means look for the chars int the string starting from the beginning and return the index of the first occurrence of that chars or std string npos if there is no such chars in that string

14801537
jboss	glassfish
jboss does so you have just to write your client following the jax-ws api and it should run on both jboss and glassfish or any other jax-ws compliant container

14801574
clang	llvm
it should be noted that if you have c++11 in your toolchain and if you re doing this on macos or ios you likely do as apple llvm 4.2 s clang is pretty good on c++11 compliance this can get even more efficient with judicious usage of move-constructors and move-assignment-operators

14801595
google-chrome	firefox
my experience is based on firefox and google-chrome

14801595
put	get	put	preflight	google-chrome	firefox
for example i had to add a special header on server side so that firefox would make the preflight options request and the actual request get put etc. using one connection as google-chrome does it

14801609
portrait	landscape
i am attempting to make the youtube video that is in my uiwebview go into landscape but my application is only set to portrait and i don t want anything else to be landscape

i have a drawstring method in my paintcomponent method

14801645
freebsd	linux
i have windows linux and freebsd on my computer

14801672
folder	directory
the .htaccess file tells apache to match any request to a uri that is not a file or folder in the directory that you are serving and forward it to your index.php controller also removing the need to reference index.php in the url

14801712
titlebar	window
what i m trying to do is move my window by clicking a sprite sort of like simulating a titlebar

14801713
getter	setter
here are the entity beans i removed the getter setter and the ddl generated by ebean

14801752
int	chars
you are sending the int value of the chars for digits

14801779
onmousedown	onmousemove
it looks like it s better to move document.onselectstart and document.ondragstart to the onmousedown handler since those events have already fired when execution moves to onmousemove

14801810
gif	png
i would like to redirect all jpg gif png links that appear in google images when someone clicks view original image to the post containing the image

14801850
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
i need all the foreign key fields to show up with dropdownlistfor for 1-1 or checkbox lists for -1 for fields to make it easy to enter data

14801867
switching	screens
now you should use a media query as seen in the responsive.less file to switching when the screens size jumps below a specific mark

14801869
put	get
get the coordinates of where the user first put his finger mouse down

14801869
mouseup	mousedown
run some kind of animation between the first two coordinates mousedown mouseup points

14801887
sml	curry
i m still learning the ropes on sml but i can t figure out how to call one of the tests as a recursive curry function

14801906
int	double
then you can convert it in int double or any other datatype as you want

14801992
uiviewcontroller	uipageviewcontroller
my uiviewcontroller has a uipageviewcontroller embedded in it

14801994
int	double
that s why you get instead which means that doubleme would work for all types a which are instances of the num type-class where + is defined which in turn means doubleme works for int int double at least if you don t specify a more restrictive type like .

14802030
crypt	salt
anyway all the crypt 3 hashing algorithms including the original des-based one always include the salt and the algorithm identifier embedded in it at the beginning of the output and ignore any extra data appended to the end of the salt input

14802030
hash	salt
thus to verify a password hash you simply feed the original hash into encrypt as the salt and check if it equals the output

14802036
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

14802113
daemons	launchd
so far i ve found examples of mongod installed as a launchd agent and as a launchd daemons

14802113
daemons	launchd
based on my understanding of launchd daemons vs

14802141
post	get
when i make a request post to linkedin rest api to get access token my url looks like this

multiplying	multiplication
i want to multiplying two complex numbers and assign the vaule of multiplication to the rinf ginf and binf

14802208
implements	extends
i have tried to implements this as a menuitem on the action bar which i was able to do successfully by extends drawable instead of extends a view or imageview

14802224
ubuntu	linux
this code works great in windows tested with windows 7 python 3.3 but fails in linux ubuntu 12.04 python 3.2

14802225
getter	setter
it s limited to browsers that support getter setter and maybe even proxies

14802225
getter	setter	accessor	properties
accessor properties with getter and setter are much slower than real get set methods

14802225
getter	setter
also the fancy-looking code can lead to misconceptions - normally you would expect property assignment accessing to be a short o 1 operation while with getter setter there might be a lot of more happening

14802225
getter	setter
yet i see the synchronous getter setter as a chance as well

14802274
put	get
im trying to put some information in my data base i get the information from a text file but i have the next problem there is some words which i want to insert that have a simple apostrophe so how you know when u make an insert for string you need a couple of for each string so when some word with a simple apostrophe comes in i got an error of syntax

14802281
free	malloc
you can see what kind of activity is going on by running your program under ltrace and strace to see if there are any malloc s that aren t free d or if there are any mmap operations that aren t unmapped

14802316
valgrind	glibc
d s runtime may be doing the same - though in glibc s case they have a function that s supposed to free that stuff when you run your program with valgrind in order to not have valgrind report errors

14802332
mdpi	hdpi
by converting from mdpi to hdpi your bitmap grows 50 and the cells should be 79.5 pixels wide

14802350
opera	google-chrome
google-chrome in particular has excellent tools with opera s dragonfly and mozilla both the built in developer tools and the excellent firebug extension getting an exceedingly honorable mention

14802368
free	malloc
i want to write a library wrapper class libwrap around a c library that uses malloc free

14802382
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
i do have a suggestion though and that is to upgrade your installation of xampp to the latest versioning

14802406
pull	push
you have to either pull changes first or push -f the changes

14802447
int	chars
you can use std to_string or std to_wstring to convert int to strings or wstrings and you can use c_str to get the raw chars or wchar_t from the string object

14802489
inherited	properties
here s an alternative answer which uses multiple inherited and properties to greatly simplify the implementation because once again you were essentially reinventing wheels

14802490
rtp	sdp
i have created a sdp file that describes the rtp feed

14802490
rtp	sdp
it appears that vlc at least the way i m using it does not use the client port you specify in the sdp it always assigns it own port that it expects the rtp packets to be delivered on

14802567
width	height
based on we have height x width

14802567
screens	tablet
and do not worry about deprecated warning since the new suggested method is for tablet apps imo which the ui is not full-screen and some spaces from bottom and top of screens occupied for title-bar and or back menu etc

14802567
width	height
rather the sizes are for the width or height in dp units that are available to your activity s window

14802578
hide	show
i have the exif info to display in a database so i just need to know how to show hide the div when hovering over the image

14802637
gif	png
since your png file or gif file is not xml you have to declare it as notational data ndata

14802646
spaces	linefeed
inside the character class you have which means matches any character that is not a spaces quotation mark tab linefeed carriage return or

14802649
post	get
see that would get translated into the non-www version losing your post values

14802662
width	height
if i change the drawrects to 0 0 width height it makes no difference

14802670
width	height
photoshop is the solution to my problems above once i set the width and height..it becomes fixed saved as image in desktop and when i open in office picture manager it widths and height doesn t change

14802695
screens	tablet
my java code to select which ad unit to show phone or tablet based on screens size

14802787
cpu	processors
i have a process id and i need to get the cpu usage a.k.a processors time of the process

14802797
setinterval	settimeout
i m aware of setinterval and settimeout methods but the problem with those is that it only delays how long it takes for a certain function to be called while the rest of the script continues to run

14802801
google-chrome	firefox
i have noticed this works exactly as intended on google-chrome but not in firefox or ie10 in these browsers it seems to just fallback to all files

14802841
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome borders do not appear

14802857
jobs	cron
both my test cron jobs first one and the last one work fine but not those commands in the middle

14802857
jobs	cron
they work fine if i issues them as standalone commands but for some reason not as cron jobs

14802871
typedef	struct
i have a typedef struct declared in one my headers

14802875
terminate	timeout
i am wondering if it is possible to set the timeout period or to intercept a general event in app.xaml.cs when the application itself has lost focus then perhaps call app.exit terminate the process

14802892
treemap	treeset
treeset treemap as well as their indexed counterparts from the indexed-tree-map project do not allow duplicate keys you can use 1 key for an array of values

14802899
nsdictionary	restkit
the real problem is you d need to define the parent object as a property of the child object in terms of nsdictionary this might be possible using a custom category but it s not something restkit supports to be used to transformed objects

14802977
inherited	subclassing
however a hash which is mutated using for example would effect the parent so you can ensure that a new copy is made when subclassing using rubys inherited method

14802989
express	node.js
node.js express web server

14803010
jobs	cron
if you have a local mail server configured you should receive an email about the output of the cron jobs which might tell you what s going wrong

14803010
stdout	stderr
if you don t receive emails from the cron job then redirect stdout and stderr to a file

14803021
unsigned	short	integer	unsigned
you would have to read the value into an unsigned short integer then type cast it to a signed short in order to see the negative value.

14803036
width	height
you need to add display block to your tags then you can set a width and height or padding if you want to make the clickable region bigger

14803119
packets	multicast
each endpoint therefore receives udp packets that are sent to the multicast group and also receives messages that are just sent to it using plain unicast

14803119
packets	multicast
so far it s working fine but there doesn t seem to be any way in boost asio to find out the destination address of a received udp packets using socket.async_receive_from - whether it was sent to the multicast group or the actual interface

14803131
uilabel	nsstring
having gone through cs193p i think the idea is to get comfortable with nsstring and uilabel versus using c

14803148
hide	show
apparently one must uncheck hide protected operating system files recommend in the folder options in order for them to show up in windows explorer and then when they do they have that little arrow on them just like shortcuts do and they are semi-transparent as hidden files are like appdata

14803148
robocopy	xcopy
i now understand that a windows specific tool such as xcopy xxcopy or robocopy probably is better for backing up but for now i prefer the simplicity of cp and not having to dive into windows command line

14803162
width	height
i have created a circular uibutton by setting the cornerradius property to half of the width and height values of the uibutton

14803166
maven	pom.xml
i needed to add some new libraries and i used the below maven pom.xml file

14803166
ant	pom.xml
i then use an ant task to retrieve the pom.xml dependencies and copy them into a lib folder

14803166
ant	pom.xml
however the following ant task misses the profile dependencies in the pom.xml

14803194
min	max
anyway if you have sqlite 3.7.11 or later records in a group by query are guaranteed to come from the record in a group that matches a min or max for that group

14803222
erlang	sml
in languages like sml erlang and in buch of others we may define functions like this

14803235
oledbcommand	sqlcommand
you should change your objects to sqlconnection instead of oledbconnection sqlcommand instead of oledbcommand and so on.

14803254
loops	if-statement
to display the header no matter what move the if-statement to just before the loops

14803274
onclick	onchange
i bind on the onchange event rather than onclick as the checkbox can be changed in many ways including via the keyboard

14803274
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i ve tested in firefox google-chrome and safari but i don t have ie to hand

14803293
width	height
and this would create a canvas using the id paper with a width and height of 100 pixels

14803301
google-chrome	firefox
another way would be to inspect the element using google-chrome developer tools firebug in firefox etc

14803302
inherited	properties
in a datatemplate that uses textblocks the foreground properties would simply be inherited

14803303
photoshop	paint.net
make a printscreen and use photoshop paint.net or any other image editor with a color picker

14803306
sudo	passwd
and configuring sudo to allow your user to run pip without prompting for a passwd

might mean that the question is stupid but i was trying to create a new php file on sign up so to provide rss feed for each person who signs up and i ve managed so far to create a beatifully empty file

14803359
setinterval	clearinterval
however the way to create a terminable repetitive action is to setinterval and then use clearinterval to terminate the repetition

14803359
setinterval	settimeout
you could replace the setinterval with settimeout

14803400
codeigniter	yii
i am about to start using yii for some small php projects i am used to using the codeigniter framework previously

14803400
centos	linux
a is it possible to move the framework folder outside of the web root on linux centos in particular for example var framework_here

14803401
int	chars
mostly int and some strings that relate to a chars

14803424
width	height
to answer your exact question in the title you would use paper.setsize width height

14803424
width	height
that dom element should have width and height enough to hold your canvas in this case 100x100

14803424
width	height
or you can leave off the width and the height and it will take on the width and height of the container very convenient

14803447
post	get
there is a blog post about good resources to get you started here

14803450
hide	show
the idea is that you should not be able to hide parts of the loaded source from being show

14803622
libstdc++	libc++
the static library depends on libboost_system witch i had compiled with libc++ and libstdc++ with the same results

14803639
google-chrome	firefox
opposite to what i ve found on tenths of threads getelementsbytagname is working only in ie8 and not in ie9 firefox or google-chrome

14803641
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome firefox it s ok but ie is not helping me at all

14803658
glew	qglwidget
i m struggling to get a subclass of qglwidget compiled that uses glew

14803684
int	chars
anyway for the other part of your question i suggest you use chars instead of int for num_array

14803684
int	boolean
there is no use using int to store a boolean

14803684
int	chars
by using chars you should be able to store about 4 times as many values in the same amount of memory assuming your int is 32-bit which it probably is

14803690
put	get
i get an error because the query is getting null put in it where the value of table should be

14803709
subtract	add
if all letters are capitalized then subtract 65 from a char such as a should be 0 and therefor add 1 to index 0 in the array

14803713
put	get
i get uri is null and nothing happens however if i put in an empty for-loop beforehand like this

14803715
getter	setter
replace the naked field access with a getter setter method

14803715
getter	setter
when you override the getter setter in the subclass then you are given control over what variable it reads to and writes

14803721
public	protected
they are only visible in your subclass if they are marked as protected public or default

14803724
portrait	landscape
only portrait for smartphones and only landscape for tablets

14803732
mouseleave	mouseenter
hover uses the mouseenter and mouseleave events in jquery which will prevent firing an event when mouse out from child to parent

14803732
mouseover	mouseenter
here s an explanation from the jquery docs about the difference between mouseenter and mouseover

14803732
mouseover	mouseenter
the mouseenter event differs from mouseover in the way it handles event bubbling

14803734
put	get	post	get	post	put

safari for example has specific guidelines on manifests in order to make a web site into an app firefox also has similar guidelines as does google-chrome

14803778

14803798
setcontentview	findviewbyid
since your current code assigns the result of findviewbyid before setcontentview is called you will always get storelist being null and so you ll get an npe

also both relative layouts have height match_parent and width wrap_content

14803936
memcpy	memset
i can have constructors for my basic data classes and still be able to use memset and memcpy and use them in unions etc

14804112
fileinputstream	objectinputstream
i tried using filereader method and fileinputstream - objectinputstream

14804129
comparator	comparable
you can use the same approach if you still want to implement the sorting yourself and change the method insertionsort to take an array of comparable items and inside it you call comparator to know which item comes before what

14804169
google-chrome	firefox
firefox seemed to understand the malformed version google-chrome did not

14804359
uicollectionview	reloaddata
as the title implies my uicollectionview doesn t update and display the cells immediately after calling reloaddata

14804366
for-loop	arrays
this way you can remove the for-loop used with the arrays of lat lons which is probably the slow part

14804435
width	height
you may want to chance some proppertys like width and height frame mode premissions and stuff like that

14804479
hide	show
the value is correctly selected but you didn t see it because the plugin hide the real select and show a button with an unordered list so if you want that the user see the selected value on the select you can do something like this

google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
cookies are stored just fine in firefox google-chrome safari but ie will not store them

14804489
dynamic-languages	typechecking
it s much less than ideal whenever you have to do typechecking in a dynamic-languages so if you find yourself doing this more than once it may be worth introducing polymorphism or at the very least extracting a method to do this

14804695
datamapper	activerecord
automatically works nicely for models based on activerecord datamapper or stone

14804712
width	height
q1 i can t answer completely but it looks like you can set most elements to a percentage width and height using setwidth setheight or setsize

14804763
hide	show
so the short answer is not really because the report and the underlying data that s generated is static and there s no event framework for generating more data - just altering the display of the existing data expand collapse sort etc. so in theory you could have the visibility of your textboxes be interactive based on clicking the textboxes and then set the visibility of various data rows in some master report to be equal to the textboxes visibility so they hide and show as the user clicks the different textboxes

14804788
jobs	cron
this would open the cron jobs for the root user for editing

14804857

width	height
i gave the blue square a set width and height in ib centered it in the long skinny view in the y direction and had one other constraint to the left side of that long view

14805058
put	get
an alternative is to put at the top of your file from __future__ import division which tells python to use the python 3 semantics for division you ll only get an integer from integer division if the result is an exact integer

14805058
integer	fractions
first you seem to want only the fractions part of the value not the integer part

14805078
cpu	processors
also if the processors is fast you ll need more than a 10000 iteration loop to get any meaningful cpu usage

14805101
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in google-chrome but depending from where i call the function that makes this ajax post it will be sent or not verified using wireshark in firefox

14805108

every chars of a string in c is in fact a small int which you can retrieve by simply indexing the array

14805123
uiview	caanimation
this would all be easier if you used the uiview animation helper functions instead but i figure you are trying to learn how to use caanimation

14805124

i was trying to make my jtextfield fill the width and set a height for it but still failed

14805125

14805225
mouseup	mousedown
using jquery i often like to use mousedown and mouseup events in conjunction for pushable buttons

14805225
mouseup	mousedown
this has no relation to the question that has been flagged as a dupe differentiate click vs mousedown mouseup

14805233
mouseup	mousedown
a click event requires the mousedown and mouseup event to happen on that element

14805233
mouseup	mousedown
the normal expectation is that a click requires both the mousedown and mouseup event so i d recommend the click event

14805233
mouseup	mousedown
from the possible duplicate it appears that mouseup and mousedown events can also be caused by mouse buttons other than the left click button

14805242
mouseup	mousedown
the mousedown nor mouseup event will acheive this

14805268
division	modulo
the modulo operator returns the rest of the division of the two numbers and can be used to limit your increments

14805339
memset	calloc
you can use calloc to automatically clear the memory or memset to clear it manually

14805385
pop-up	dialog
the only possible solution is to raise the pop-up dialog which confirms from the user if they really want to leave refresh the page

14805387
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
instead at least store salt hash of the passwords and use a slow hash function not md5 or a member of the sha family

14805393
width	height
the index you use to access the elements in the array randomsize is in the variable varcreator which goes from 0 to width s + height s

14805393
width	height
so if width s + height s should not be 12 or more

14805393
width	height
that s where we are stuck because nothing in your code tells us where width and height are declared

14805409
google-chrome	firefox
to view the dynamic end-result one could use firebug plugin on firefox or google-chrome s web developer tools press f12

14805421
equals	compareto
so it means you need to override function compareto which should be consistent with what returns function equals

14805421
equals	compareto
please note this consistency between equals and compareto is optional but strongly recommended

14805425
put	get

on most machines unsigned char is an 8-bit type limiting your octal escape sequence to 377 in that context and the hex sequence to xff

14807074
quicksort	mergesort
mergesort is more natural to implement for linked lists but you can do quicksort very nicely

14807074
quicksort	mergesort
it turns out that if comparisons are cheap mergesort tends to run a little faster because quicksort spends more time fiddling with pointers

my ultimate solution would be to use git hg somehow like we used svn and cvs â keep history on the server and locally only the most up-to-date revision or keep limited history locally both without breaking everything else so i could see the logs or revert a file to a previous revision and the version control system would fetch the required information from remote if not available locally

14814998
try-catch	exception-handling
firstly while working inside the try-catch statement you will lose some performance because some internal mechanism is checking for any exception-handling to be catched however this performance loss is ignorable in current systems and this loss is so little when compared to the idea of starting whole program from the beginning because of a crash that happened due to not catched exception-handling

the udp works fine and sends the timeslot and receiving threads successfully receive it but i noticed that even if i use the popular getter and setter or even if i pass the whole hashset to threads like i did for passing sockets for udp the hashmap is not visible to the threads

14815240

even when i access the hashmap and string using getter and setter functions which are defined outside the thread and will be accessed inside the thread

mouse	keyboard
if you still really want to debug using a qdialog box for errors in a pseudo modal dialog but not modal dialog you could try using eventfilters to prevent mouse and keyboard events from arriving at any other window but it would be tricky to allow the exception to end up only at qdialog but it is do-able

14818970

int	chars
i enter a chars when i should be entering an int and the program just exits with the exception

14823477
for-loop	loops
using a for-loop on the index or writing the indicies individually does plot them together with different colors but the program will not know how many indicies to loops over

14823479

this has been great and i get the concept of topic branches release branches the merging and push pull to a remote server

14823556

i have tried to hard code in urls for the lists using the spweb and spsite just about anything

14823611
children	parent
i am hoping to avoid something like this tag properties parent children

14823611
children	parent
the problem is that javascript can hold onto references of nodes in the tree and it can mutate add children modify properties any node it has a reference to as well as traverse to it s parent

14823667
getter	setter
so i have here a private variable moddmonth whith getter and setter

14823675
margin	height
i want to float child divs inside this parent div or a way to center them without floating...display inline-block won t work for the child divs as they are of different height and one div is an image...so i think the best way is to float them and optimize the margins...in this case i want the parent div to be centered across the screen so i use margin 0 auto instead of float but this leads to the child div not stretching the parent div and it appears as a thin line

14823677
pull	push
they utilize two different software architectures - push vs pull

14823677
pull	push
if you don t understand the subtleties between push vs pull architecture then i recommend that you start with xmlreader because pull is simpler to understand and easier to visualize

14823679
lodash	underscore.js
using plain javascript underscore.js lodash underscore.js compat jquery or lodash in order of preference

14823695
std	ostream
i believe part of the problem is that your vec.h doesn t have so the type std ostream is unidentified in that file and since that part is compiled before the vec.cpp main part it fails to recognise your function

14823732
libstdc++	libc++
and both libc++ in algorithm and libstdc++ in bits stl_algo.h implement it that way

14823781
put	get
now i haven t tried it but i assume this means that if you put the right strings in the right files in the right folders and your device supports those languages or you specify the locale explicitly you should get the right localized strings back

14823806
src	attr
#like + postid attr src img unstar.png

14823859
put	get
that last point is one crucial difference distinguishing dynamic from static in scheme programs like the above you get significant freedom when working with lists pairs and vectors since you can put any kind of value into them

14823859
scheme	racket
some dialects of scheme such as typed racket provide ways for the user to define datatypes statically so that the compiler can again provide such assistance.

14823859
scheme	racket
also several scheme dialects such as racket and chez provide linguistic extensions for defining structured data known as records

14823877
slider	slidesjs
the y function in the slidesjs pauses the slider

14823910

this way all my prebuilt set of files and folder in my_folder directory were copied as is to system folder in android out

14823948
width	height
you can t center it with a width and height being percentages at least not without using js

14823948
width	height
you can however set a static height and width and center it like this

14823948
width	height
and static negative top and left margins which is half of the width and height of your element

14823954
spaces	delimiter
with spaces as delimiter

14824000
interpreted-language	compiled-language
you do get a benefit in an interpreted-language that you don t have in compiled-language that you can have a real-time interpreter

14824010
serializable	deserialization
by default hadoop uses the writableserialization class to handle the deserialization of classes which implement the writable interface but you can register custom serializable that implement the serializable interface by setting the hadoop configuration property io.serializations a csv list of classes that implement the serializable interface

14824013
int	double
i just got confused by the code to convert or parse value from textbox to int float double etc in windows store

14824017
serializable	deserialization
the point of the exercise being to recognize that you can implement custom serializable deserialization of objects by implementing the following methods in your class

14824044
google-chrome	firefox
this is what i have it just works in google-chrome and firefox but not in ie9

14824087
int	double
if you want to be able to easily select what type you want to covert the string to int double float you could make a simple method to convert the string

14824105
strcpy	strncpy
to change the value of you will need to use strcpy or preferably strncpy

14824200
equals	compareto
the set interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a sorted set performs all element comparisons using its compareto or compare method so two elements that are deemed equals by this method are from the standpoint of the sorted set equals .

14824204
octal	binary
basically i want to convert 0x11aegh to binary octal integer and so on.

14824213

i m sure it s very simple but i am not sure how to translate the examples in curl to http post get requests

14824291
mockito	easymock
though i ve not used easymock we have used mockito very similar and we have used qftest separately

14824291
mockito	easymock	junit	mockito	junit	easymock	junit	testng	testng	easymock
there should be no reason why you need junit to use either mockito or easymock as these two will work with testng for example

14824317
int	chars
i am trying to make a constructor for a text-based game that i am making for fun and cannot get the chars constructor to take a string and int

14824346
getter	setter
it s better to encapsulate your variables by making them private and use getter setter to access them

14824346
getter	setter
if they are constant will not change during the object lifetime you may consider making them public final or define only the getter not the setter

14824352
mouseleave	mouseenter
you can use the delegated form of event handling but it doesn t work with the pseudo event hover so you need to watch both the mouseenter and mouseleave events

14824380
children	parent
it is the parent s responsibility to add the children or the responsibility of the flash player if you use the stage

14824393
textview	imageview
my app widget is themeable so i need to be able to update the imageview on it at runtime as well as the textview and intents

14824454
int	double
casting one of your operands to a double will cause java to perform the correct type of division instead of defaulting to int division

14824460
stdout	stderr
i ve experimented with redirecting stderr to stdout with to no avail on windows because i couldn t immediately find a way to make exec-maven-plugin like the redirection bit as an argument

14824460
stdout	stderr
i didn t pursue that route too far because it s just a wild guess that this is a stderr stdout issue -- it could be but i m merely speculating

isotope	masonry
one i ve worked with and could do what you want is masonry or the for-pay bigger brother isotope

14824489
width	text-align
since you re relying on text-align justified the reason the last line doesn t expand to the full width is because there s no line break at the end of it

14824498
squash	branch	squash	merge
you can also squash them into a master branch without making a merge git merge --squash followed by git commit then merge the master branch into the dev branch

14824578
oncreate	onstart
is it in oncreate onstart onresume some other custom method

14824600
tabs	tabpanel
you could certainly write your own panel to do just that but i think tabpanel the default used for laying out tabcontrol tabs does what you re trying to get

14824605
width	height
the solution below merely shows a div with a 100 height and width with a fixed position hiding any content on the page

14824622
folder	directory
the way hadoop typically deals with speculative execution is to create an output folder for each task attempt in a _temporary subfolder of the actual hdfs output directory

14824622
implements	extends
so for your case if you are writing to a folder outside of the job output folder then you ll need to extends implements your own output committer

width	height
i know how to change the width but how do i change the height so that after the element is selected it shows the full thing about 150px

14824708
children	parent
so i have no way to determine which children belong to which parent

14824720

you ll find it easier if you compare against the toupper or tolower version of each character to reduce the number of comparisons by a factor of 2

14824729
min	max
it constrains the max and min values you can use it on the position of the object you would like to animate

and then you can usually use getelementsbytagname or getelementbyid to select the dom-elements

14824872
put	get
put this query in the stored procedure and when you will run this stored procedure you will get tabular result

14824939

14825209
hash	salt
this isn t secure against attacks on your database servers and actually seems to defeat the purpose of using salt hash

14825209
hash	salt
if the client sends back a salt hash in place of their password then that is essentially the same as their password

14825209
hash	salt
if an attacker compromises your database they don t have to brute force anyone s password to log in they just use the salt hash and they can be anyone they want to be

14825209
scrypt	pbkdf2
also use pbkdf2 bcrypt or scrypt as your password hashing algorithm instead of sha-2

14825241
filtering	grouping
in other words i m attempting to undo all the existing grouping sort all filtering elements by like filtertype and relation and then re-group the filtering by common filtertype and relation knowing that the first grouping element must have a relation element that is moved from it s first filtering element into the grouping element

14825911
for-loop	loops
in sql server there is no for-loop i can use while loops

14826286
multiplying	add
0x31 is a number strip off the 0x1 but 0x32 is also a number so multiplying 0x1 times 10 then add the 2 stripped from the 0x32 giving a 0xc in whatever is accumulating that number decimal 12 then the plus sign 0x2b then the other number handled the same way strip the 3 out of 0x33 multiplying by 10 add the 4 stripped out of 0x34 giving decimal 34 0x22 then add those two numbers 0x0c + 0x22 0x2e 46 decimal

as wuliwong said sinatra and padrino are way less complex than ruby-on-rails

14831065
padrino	ruby-on-rails
also while it is true that you cannot learn ruby-on-rails without learning ruby there is no reason whatsoever why you couldn t learn ruby as you lear ruby-on-rails or sinatra padrino it s a fun way to learn the language

14831065
padrino	ruby-on-rails
after about 7 months of work with ruby-on-rails i moved to padrino to build an api and immediately loved its simplicity compared to ruby-on-rails

14831080

14831087
treemap	treeset
if you want o 1 retrieval of the maximum and you are allowed to change the type of collection being used use a sorted set map treeset treemap

yes i would consider behat to be an alternative to phpunit both for general code testing and for functional testing using browser automation

14831333
phpunit	behat
for general testing phpunit is a more well-established product while behat is focussed on tests written using bdd methodology behaviour driven design

14831333
phpunit	behat
phpunit does also have bdd features but behat is much more targetted toward that style

14831333
behat	mink
my preference would go to behat mink on the grounds that it is more flexible

14831333
selenium	sahi
it can support several browser automation engines including selenium and sahi which means that if you hit an issue with one you can switch your tests to the other and carry on

14831333
behat	mink
it s also worth adding that mink can be used on its own without behat if you don t want to write bdd style tests

i was wondering if someone could explain to me why field access seems to be slower than getter setter method access and also why the last 8 iterations execute incredibly fast

14832042
oncreate	ondestroy
also i m a bit worried about a lot of calls ondestroy oncreate while device is locking unlocking

14832042
portrait	landscape
as i understood it happens because activity changes it s orientation from landscape for game to portrait for device lock screen and returns to landscape

14832042
oncreate	ondestroy
upd 2 about multiple calls ondestroy oncreate as wrote in google activity api about configuration changes i have tried to intercept configuration changes for display orientation but it doesn t work well for me

it s a listview containing 2 types of rows and the layout for the rows with lines is quite trivial - linearlayout with textview and imageview i can post the exact code later if needed

14835811
width	height
at least without tables you d need javascript that would read #child s width height and then do the calculation you want to do i don t know and set a new height width to #parent

14835811
width	height
otherwise if you mean that you want #child s height width to change according to its content of course this is native css just set it s height width to auto and then start adding text inside it you ll see it will start growing to fit your content inside

14836014

the transmission of the length uses a 16bit unsigned integer sent in a specific byte order it s not memcpy d into the buffer but qdatastream is used on it to both store it and read it back

14836014
int	chars
by throwing an exception and leaving the data in the device you would not have needed to send the length of the payload since qdatastream already sends the length of the string as a 32 bit unsigned bigendian int followed by the utf-16 chars

and even if you have overriden that i suggest you to have getter and setter for your itemname field and use that to return the itemname

14836922
pull	push
it would be great if the solution related only to my specific environment so i wouldn t have to undo do it each time i pull push a build

14836942
getter	setter
why don t you use some thing like items.get i .name or create getter or setter for name in item object and retrieve name by items.get i .getname

14837054
post	get
on my php page i just get the post data like

14837054
put	get
the problem is that with the long string i either get a 500 error or if i take the string and put it in my browser i just get a page not available

14837078
put	get
unfortunately i get this data from a database and need to put it in a json string format

14837087

14837514
min	max
then everything beyond the projectfeeamount field will either need to be excluded from your list or aggregated somehow sum min max etc.

14837520
hex	binary
furthers urls must adopt an accepted encoding and as such it is not uncommon that in order to put certain characters utf-8 binary etc into a parameter-value the data is converted to base64 variants or hex

14837539
width	height
during each render loop this is split up into segments of a defined width 1px being the best quality and each segment is has its height scaled dependent upon its position on the x axis of the texture

14837620
subtraction	multiplication
multiplication happens before subtraction so it s calculating this

14837628
children	parent
a local element declarations will only match things in context -- in your example keptelement1 and keptelement2 will be retained only when they are children of parent not otherwise

14837671
cout	ofstream
use your ofstream outdata instead of std cout

14837697

i have a fixed with width 50px and height 50px

14837838
width	height
.this size will be used when users are editing icon.the image will be larger and users can drag and set what to show.in coding part i had taken width height top left.top and left is used to determine what to show.hope you understand that

14837908
getter	setter
dependencyproperty getter setter access the getvalue and setvalue methods defined within dependencyobject

14837924
portrait	landscape
here i get the correct orientation but when rotating i get an inverted result i get landscape for portrait and portrait for landscape

14837939
winpcap	wireshark
sounds to me like you want something like winpcap which is what wireshark uses

14837946
google-chrome	safari
unfortunately neither safari nor google-chrome detects it and show the option to open in passbook application

14837959
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
the largest benefit to using observablecollection is it implements inotifycollectionchanged and inotifypropertychanged automatically which makes it simpler to data-bind

14837969
ironruby	ironpython
there are many other languages with various levels of support as well including ironruby and ironpython boo etc

14838000
sidekiq	god
optionally you can just use the god gem to run your sidekiq jobs

14838004
int	double
f conversion specifier is to print double values use d conversion specifier to print int values

14838052
octal	hex
this gives the correct output without dealing with any fancy bashisms per oli charlesworth s answer 0 is treated as octal but i believe that bash ignores octal hex identifiers for floating-point numbers

14838070
pull	push
i would check out ã mq and use their inter-thread communication transport zmq_inproc over push pull sockets

14838075
post	get
below is an example of how you might insert a blog post then get back the id created by sql

14838093

xmlhttprequest	xdomainrequest
making cross domain javascript requests using xmlhttprequest or xdomainrequest

14838244
getter	setter
i ve been reading on reasons why i should and why i shouldn t use getter and setter

14838244
getter	setter
i read this article a design strategy on how why not to use getter and setter but i m just not seeing in what situation i wouldn t use them or better yet an alternative

14838244
getter	setter
yeah i need to see an alternative to getter and setter

14838262
jobs	cron
you should use cron jobs

14838310
getter	setter
also people using your api will expect getter setter and might get confused when there are none

14838330
getter	setter
there s no need for getter and setter because the definition of a point is an x y value

14838332
hex	binary
every hex value converts directly to its 4-bit binary counterpart 0x7 0111 0xa 1010 etc

14838332
hex	binary
you could write a loop to perform this conversion character by character but guffa s answer to c# how convert large hex string to binary provides this handy dandy linq statement to perform the same action

14838332
hex	binary
i don t know how you plan to verify it but if dan s hex translation is right then that binary string will definitely be right

14838334
getter	setter
whether or not you use getter or setter really comes down to a question of need

14838334
getter	setter
for example there are some persistence frameworks that require managed objects to declare getter and setter

14838334
getter	setter
it isn t really a matter of preference in terms of using a getter setter

14838372
getter	setter
in really most cases getter setter are best

14838372
getter	setter
a disadvantage to getter setter is when using in complex mathematical formulas

14838372
getter	setter
they are used with dot syntax but internally the getter or setter is called

14838421
tcplistener	tcpclient
i am trying to learn a little about socket programming and i have stumbled across tcplistener and tcpclient to use as i read they are slightly easier for beginners

14838424
put	get
on gpus without hyperq compute capability 1.0 to 3.0 you can get false dependencies because the work for a dma engine or for computation gets put into a single hardware pipe

14838443
range	max
if you know the max number of potential date range then you can use max and case

14838464
appkit	nsapplication

14838481
children	parent
when associating children to parent via parent.children references to the children correctly update themselves

14838483
post	get
i want to get three post from a different post type shoots

14838486
getter	setter
you shouldn t use accessor methods getter and setter unless absolutely necessary because these methods expose information about how a class is implemented and as a consequence make your code harder to maintain

14838486
getter	setter
getter setter methods often make their way in code because the coder was thinking procedurally

14838486
getter	setter
another interesting point and now that i think of it one of the most important is when to avoid getter and setter

14838487
width	height
adjust the height and width accordingly

14838563
pull	push
i have a directory bar which typically contains items specific to that region what they are is irrelevant but sometimes will contain items that i do want to push pull

14838567
post	get
i mean i want to do a get not a post because it s a query not an insertion modification

14838614
getter	setter
for example i created a class student with atributes and only getter and setter methods so i need to use that class in a model to return an array of students what i can not do with load- library or to receive a student for storing it and i also need that class for my controller to do something with student

14838615
hide	show
the above will hide all feed items not in the desired class and just in case a few of the items you wanted to show were hidden we call show on the desired class as well

14838616
sudo	passwd
the thing that concerns me is a timeout period with the sudo and it will drop to normal privileges then when a.py want to spawn kill a process it will ask for a passwd and stop working as intended

14838628
google-chrome	safari
i m running into a very specific issue with in google-chrome desktop safari

14838628
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
the approach works completely fine in firefox ie9 just not in google-chrome desktop safari

14838645
udp	tcp
use udp instead of tcp and data compression try to minimize bandwidth don t send 50 gb of information at a time

14838666
post	get
i want to make http calls get post etc. from the servlet using org.apache.httpcomponents.httpclient_4.2.3 and org.apache.httpcomponents.httpcore_4.2.3 extracted from the osgi bundles

14838677
sudo	passwd
the timeout simply controls how often a user has to enter their passwd when they do a sudo command

14838677
sudo	nohup
since your now root-privileged script would simply execute nohup python b.py directly rather than sudo nohup python b.py the sudo timeout would not come into play

14838699
hide	show
this will cause all of the popups you ve generated to slidetoggle meaning that once you ve created more than one which you do then on each call the hidden ones will show and the show ones will hide

14838718
getter	setter
but the problem is between the setter and the getter of the private var prop_inscription

14838748
builtin	isinstance
type builtin function also can do the same but isinstance builtin function is recommended for testing the type of an object

14838769
for-loop	loops
also it would involve packaging up loops body as a lambda so you have a function object to pass to std for_each which would complicate the specification of range-based for which is supposed to have the same semantics and be exactly as efficient as a hand-written for-loop

14838781
versioning	upgrade
emacs will then fetch and install all upgrade and ask you to whether to remove the old obsolete versioning afterwards

14838816
simulation	sampling
i am implementing the simulation by row and i have found that my sampling functions are a bottleneck

14838820
libpng	libz
interactively disable re-enable all edged from a particular node for example libpng depends on libz but that s obvious and can be disabled to not clutter view

14838824
filtering	grouping
in my application i also made use of slickgrid filtering and a toggle class applied in a click handler to implement a drill-down feature where you can click on a parent row and collapse expand the rows grouping under that parent row

14838848
firefox	safari
i tested this in safari 6.0.2 and firefox 18.0.2 both times it alerts yep followed by nope so i assume there is an error somewhere

14838857
margin	background-color	width	margin
topheader has a float and width of 100 with background-color and contentarea has a width of 990px and margin 0 auto

14838874
hash	hmac
the canonicalized request gets hash with hmac using the secret key hash and user id are passed in the http authorization header

14838896
hide	show
then you can call a function on some interval that checks the current server time to see if it is within the 3pm-4pm period and show hide the target elements as needed

14838933
trie	tree
take a look at the trie data structure also known as digital tree or prefix tree

14838953
button	checkbox
however i m having some trouble with jquery ui checkbox button

14838953
button	checkbox
the checkbox button are supposed to change their icon when clicked

14838958
hide	show
then in your styles you can have the elements you want to hide or show based on class inheritance from the body tag

14838978
folder	directory
when ever my user apache creates a directory i cannot add new files onto it via php upload i have to change the folder s permissions for it to work

14839026
post	get
from my understanding i would have to use an ajax request to communicate the value to the php script but i don t fully understand ajax post vs get

14839047
filtering	grouping
i m planning on using a collection view to present some items and then allow them to be filtering sorted and grouping

14839057

this is fine when opening the page on a small telephone screens but it does not look good on devices with a bigger screens size tablet desktop-browsers

14839065
vbo	vao
i m drawing using a vbo and ibo wrapped up in a vao

14839117
comparator	comparable
since the comparator method is part of the comparable interface it s actually split out into another test case - the comparabilitytestcase

14839124
rss	feed
other than figuring out where the google sitemap is or an rss feed you won t know where new content is added

14839128
width	height
what i want is for example to have a big image as a hero unit but not with hero-unit 100 width height of the viewport or a 3 column images divided by that 100 but in other occasions inside the same page it will have the max 1200px container along with the grid elements of bootstrap

14839142
int	double
you should define sum as double not as int

14839167
phpstorm	rubymine
the jetbrains family of ides intellij rubymine phpstorm etc

14839179
post	get
regarding the difference between ajax post and get it doesn t matter for you

14839213
maven	pom.xml
if you use maven you can just add this in your pom.xml

14839232
children	parent
this is for a tennis draw and i need to be able to have a bye so most parent have two children ie

14839232
children	parent
see here as an example where some parent matches have no children and some have one

14839244
google-chrome	firefox
also google-chrome and firefox do not exhibit this problem

14839319
post	get
i have been trying to find a way to post changes to one of the threads object fields in my inbox to mark it as read change unread from 1 to 0 as seen below from the json response i get

14839337
google-chrome	firefox
i m started using a combination of knockoutjs 2.2.1 sammyjs 0.7.4 and pagerjs latest from github with jquery hashchange to create a single page app and i ve run into a problem with the routes as they do not work in google-chrome version 24.0.1312.57 m or firefox 16.0 for some reason it actually works in ie7

14839387
bids	ssis
the problem i have is that i have set up all my variables in my ssis package in bids and i have set them to readonly in my package

14839387
bids	ssis
i would like the code to be modified so that if there is no value specified for my attachement variable in my ssis package in bids then my script task will only send the message in the body and not fail

14839406
vsto	add-in
while my add-in is coded in c# vsto i ve verified that in fact these same things cause the same error even when just entered executed directly in the vba immediate window

14839408
subclass	abstract-class
what i ended up doing was making that class an abstract-class and then overriding the value in the subclass

14839426
serializable	deserialization
methods can be invoked before serializable after serializable before deserialization and after deserialization

14839442
width	height
take into account the document body height and width

14839447
post	get
since the methods are in post i can t paste the url in the address bar of safari like with get methods

14839462
int	chars
tolower returns an int that you can assign to a chars

14839475
.htaccess	httpd.conf
enable mod_rewrite and .htaccess through httpd.conf and then put this code in your .htaccess under document_root directory of www.myhost.com domain

14839522
post	get
you will use post method by httpwebrequest for creating and updating get method for getting session parameters

14839525
width	height
make the inner loop pass over the width and the outer loop pass over the height

14839526
versioning	upgrade
if you can t upgrade your jquery versioning you can get the correct checked value using .each and value.checked

14839531
post	get
so i had a php api wrapper for an online shop with a lot of methods i tried to mimic rest but the api only offers post and get and i started building a js script for it that can be used to call of the methods without any knowledge of php or having to touch any php code

14839532
google-chrome	safari
with safari and google-chrome using left right cursor keys causes the div to scroll left right when the left-most right-most position is reached

14839532
hide	show
disable scrolling on the div whilst editing - this gets complex when ie ff hide show scrollbars and contents move around

14839541
filesystems	fat
and depending on the filesystems the files might retain the order in which they were created fat

14839583
g++	gcc
i m using g++ through gcc 4.4.5

14839595
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine on firefox google-chrome and ie8+ i m guessing because those browsers don t allow undefined to be overwritten

14839614
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
that works in safari google-chrome and ie up to version 8 i believe but not in firefox and ie 9

14839622
google-chrome	firefox
for some reason the following code works in internet explorer but not in google-chrome or firefox

14839641
strlen	tolower
if you want to return a completely processed string you should first allocate an array of char of the size strlen word and then setting its elements each character to the proper value with the call to tolower

14839644
children	parent
i m self-joining the table on the id to the parent_id into an object which keeps the referential integrity for you and select an anonymous object to select out the parent then all of the children

14839652
inject	interceptor
this interceptor can dependency inject that action bean that you re testing

14839669
express	node.js
node.js app with express possibly

i want it to parse rss feed and store the data in a database but i get inconsistent behavior when getting the value of the url attribute in the enclosure tag

14839836
rss	feed
i have two rss feed

14839836
rss	feed
i don t see an obvious difference between the layout of the two rss feed to explain why the url can easily be plucked from feed a using the last two methods but not seen at all in feed b

14839838
put	get	post	get	post	put
i have an webdav cors plugin which i can use to post put get remove alldocs files on a webdav server

14839841
cout	cin
i have not been able to figure out how to build a pipe between std cout and std cin that works for this case

14839875
ant	maven
you can build your project with maven ant and gradle

14839882
sorting	grouping
however we ve recently had a wrinkle popup some of these reports use a lot of javascript to conduct dynamic grouping sorting and the user wants to download this finished version of the report into excel

14839899
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
so you can open for editing ms office documents in google-chrome firefox safari and ie

14839914
button	checkbox
similar to the way that radio button would work except i need to use checkbox and events

14839942
min	max
specify the min max and step size and the user will be bound to forced to select one of a few specific values

14839946
int	double
the code works well when the argument is a c++ born type such as int long double etc. but i want to use the function for larger values

14840001
post	get
i have a question......i get that you have to sanitise post and get to stop people doing nasty things to your website db but i m confused.....i saw the following on a website and thought i would ask the question

14840058
intersect	contains
the polygon class has multiple contains methods and intersect methods

14840059
int	chars
since the unsigned chars data type uses the ascii code the processor cannot distinguish it from an unsigned 8 bit int

14840128
screens	tablet
but crashes on tablet which tries to fit three fragments on the screens

14840164
hide	show
i ve exported it added to my eclipse drop-ins and i am able to show or hide this view from eclipse

hide	show
i d like to add this plug-in to a rcp host application and be able to show hide this view like i can when i add it to my eclipse ide

14840200
lxml	beautifulsoup
don t know about lxml but you can definitely use beautifulsoup find all on the page and than create a for-loop where you will check if matches your regex pattern if it match than scrap url

14840219
triples	tdb	triples	virtuoso	virtuoso	tdb
you can get better scalability by dumping the rdf triples and assert them into a native triple store jena tdb 4store virtuoso

14840225
hide	show
i use jquery to show and hide some div s and the js to refresh a div by loading a page inside the div

14840289
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
everything seems to work fine in google-chrome safari and ie9 but for some reason it breaks in firefox

14840290
int	double
if you know your value can never be something like zero or negative just return a struct holding int and double and zero out the one you don t need.

14840292
implements	extends
public class main extends thread implements keylistener

14840293
gruntjs	grunt-contrib-jshint
i use gruntjs and grunt-contrib-jshint to run the validations with the following options

14840332
put	get
that way you shouldn t need to do any conversion work you should just be able to put it into the database as a byte array and get it out as a byte array

14840332
hex	binary
edit okay it looks like you re getting back the hex representation of the binary data but in ascii

14840350
client-side	server-side
so if you have form validation whether server-side or client-side and the visitor fails to fill out the form properly and gets an error message...well you just tracked a failed form submit

14840438
subtract	add
this will avoid any complicated paths or math and make it simple add and subtract amounts on the rectangle itself

14840439
inherited	properties
you can have a superclass that all the window controllers inherited from and they will all have the properties and methods you create in the superclass if that s what you re talking about

14840440
setinterval	settimeout
i have noticed that proper use of setinterval settimeout and even requestanimationframe allocates memory without my request and causes frequent garbage collection calls

14840440
setinterval	settimeout
you might want to try replacing the setinterval call with a less evil self-invoking function based on settimeout

14840440
setinterval	settimeout
what you do is replace your call to setinterval with a function that invokes itself indirectly through settimeout after it completes the work it s supposed to do

14840482
innodb	myisam
here is a good tutorial on recovery options for both myisam and innodb mysql instances and covers a few options

14840492
put	get
if you donâ t want to put .java file there â then just compile your .java file and get the .class file

14840504
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in google-chrome and it works fine in firefox when i load the page directly in a browser tab

14840548
width	height
i also need the keep the width and the height so it displays ok in the browser using getimagesize will probably put to much strain on the server if there is many thumbs to display

14840584
cpu	processors
the first approach the while loop is going to lock up the user s cpu because it runs forever without stopping and will take up 100 of the processors

14840596
setinterval	settimeout
setinterval or indeed settimeout with a delay of 0 milliseconds not seconds only means add this function to the event queue after the given delay there is no guarantee the function will be executed at that exact time

14840693
width	height
i m not sure why you need the _width _height columns since each seems like it has a static width height based on its size status small is always 100px but no matter

14840693
width	height
width height will either go on this table if it needs to differ per each individual file or on imagesizes if it s per-size

14840721
google-chrome	firefox
if i go to the above link it works fine in both google-chrome and firefox

14840721
google-chrome	firefox

14842850
width	column-count
if i wanted to block the middle column i would change column-count to 2 and set the column-gap equal to the width of one column plus the existing column gap

14842859
getter	setter
here s the start of what a pojo would look like all fields public with no getter setter just to make this example small

14842866

integer	unsigned
it defines an unsigned integer literal

14844138
integer	unsigned
you can also see where they defined a hex literal to be an unsigned long integer by using 0x...ul

14844138
hex	binary
if you would like to know the bit pattern they produce simply translate the decimal literals to their equivalent hex or binary literals

14844138

put	get
on the ssrs side you need 12 columns for all 12 months and then put some logic to hide the ones that don t get data

width	height
i believe the problem is that the jquery function width height outerwidth and outerheight don t test to see if the element is visible

getter	setter
you certainly can hard-code getter setter for certain services or all of them but the benefit of reusability is all but lost

for-loop	loops
also thought maybe this could be done using a javascript or jquery loops for-loop maybe im just unsure how

14844277
getter	setter
since declaring the setter and getter i had to provide an argument names in this case it was only 1 for each but im pretty positive its possible to declare getter setter with more than 1

jython	pypy	cpython	pypy
i put together a more complete test including the op s intended optimization and code that works in 3.x and 2.x without change and ran it against apple 2.7.2 python.org 3.3.0 pypy 1.9.0 2.7.2 and jython 2.5.2 all 64-bit builds on a mac and then just using cpython 0.17.1 pyximport under python 3.3.0 to compile the same source as cpython code

14844290
cpython	pypy
additionally hoisting the comparison out of the loop may give you another 3 or soâ but all of this is nothing compared to using pypy instead of cpython cpython instead of python or even 3.x instead of 2.x

14844307
for-loop	arrays

14855542
children	parent
the children will then store the reference to the parent

14855548

what your second activity is doing is accessing the layout of the first activity which is bad practice as they re now tightly coupled but the intent is recreating the main activity - which means the oncreate method gets called again and the button is recreate - with the enabled property set to false

your only option as bbarnhart points out is to manually declare class getter and setter

14856052
inherited	properties
well if you have in every view this key on viewbag you could read on the layout page. you could create your own base controller that inherited from controller class and override the onactionexecuting method to fill this properties on the viewbag

14856670
width	margin
to make sure there is no overlap give it a right margin of 6em or whatever the width of the navigation bar is

14856670
width	margin
if the #content div were set at width 100 its margin would extend past the width of the page and content would be obscured

14856700
getter	setter
an option would be to expose public getter setter to interact with your variable

14856724
gif	png
i m running an image upload script for users where i have allowed png jpg jpeg and gif extensions

so i want to calculate the width and height that the datagridview should be so that it can display all data without scrollbars

since you specified the copy attribute on your properties you ve told the compiler to generate that -setwords accessor method with code that looks something like this

14857007
ienumerable	iqueryable
all repositories return ienumerable s not iqueryable s this enables all database operations to be finished before running any business logic

14857022
for-loop	loops
but a better way is instead of using a for-loop just use a foreach loops as shown below

14857156
width	height
the codecs are supposed to return a display width and height to inform video players how the content should be displayed so it looks correct on the tv

14857156
width	height
it looks though that the android api is only reporting the pixel width and pixel height

14857247
uninstall	upgrade
another way of formulating this question is is an app upgrade the same as an uninstall and install at least in some sense

14857286
int	chars
color a chars array current position an int current velocity an int and current acceleration which comes from the total newton force of the 4 wheels again this is where i start to get very confused

14857401
getter	setter
when i do quick fix on a field in eclipse i can generate a getter and setter for the field

14857401
getter	setter
this also makes the field private und subsequently transforms all access for this field in all source files to use the getter and setter

14857457
pull	push
this will clone your repo and allow you to push and pull from it

14857483

the above is essentially pseudo-code and shouldn t be read as this is exactly how to do it i haven t for instance stated whether the properties are private public protected or indeed provided a constructor

14857566
versioning	upgrade
it requires creating your own versioning of sqliteopenhelper that opens a writable versioning when an upgrade occurs.

coldfusion	railo
in php i think you can make http calls using curl but once again if you re using java coldfusion railo or bluedragon you should be able to use jsoup just fine

mongodb	bson
mongodb is a bson document store not a json one

14857620
children	parent
i have a n-level checkbox tree implemented using knockout where selection of a parent level chechbox should select its children but not the other way around and once data is submitted the ids of elements selected should be converted to json to be sent to the server

14857620
children	parent
if a parent was selected as it means all its children are also selected to not send its child ids in the json

14857620
children	parent
how to not send a parent id when only one or few of children are selected

14857639
disk	ram
the os takes care of pulling data in from the ram and pushing it back out to disk so it is pretty easy to use once it is set up

opera	google-chrome
this works fine on my computer macbook air in google-chrome and opera

14857789
versioning	upgrade
is your problem just during the short periods of mixed mode operation during system upgrade or do you have some sort of long-term storage model which requires supporting multiple historic versioning of events

14857816
jobs	cron
many people suggested to use cron jobs but since i don t want to run this in interval cron is no option only once - for example after 3 hours

14857876
g++	gcc
the gnu cpp as used in gcc and g++ is compatible as is the boost wave preprocessor

14857892
folder	directory
guessing not knowing place it in the view folder in your sources directory

14857897
swt	swing
i see trident api has support for both swt and swing

14857915
dbcontext	objectcontext
dbcontext is conceptually similar to objectcontext

14857976
datalist	repeater
i think you have only paths in your db and images would be in a folder only with the help of datalist or repeater you can easily create the jquery slider you just need to put datalist or repeater in the place of the images in the examples

14857982
google-chrome	firefox
this simple page works in firefox and even internet eplorer 8 but in google-chrome it behaves in a strange manner it displays only the first table

14857990
for-loop	arrays
you can actually do one better than that by replacing the for-loop with a laply which means input is a list and output is a matrix arrays

14858011
hide	show
it s easy enough to do #1 and #2 in separate template blocks and then show hide based on screen size

14858015
for-loop	arrays
so the for-loop will then go through the arrays and println all the values stored at its positions e.g 1 1.56 2 1.72

14858046
dbcontext	objectcontext
dbcontext is a lightweight version of the objectcontext class which is laid almost right on top of objectcontext there is even a way to get to the objectcontext from just the dbcontext

14858079
bids	ssis
here is a sample ssis package created in bids 2008 r2

14858114

so as soon as they have 13 favourites div1 will hide and div 2 will show

14858127
min	max
the numpy.max and numpy.min seem to find the max and min of an entire array which is not what i want

14858128
hide	fadeout	fadein	fadeout	fadein	hide
i don t know how you change this css hover of javascript or something i tried looking but you have minified css but you can solve this by not changing just the opacity but also the display block to display none so it is actually gone or use javascript .sub-menu hide or fadein fadeout or something similar.

14858136
hide	show
when you will hide the drop down using visibility or display none drop down list would not register mouse over and hence the list would not show up till the time hover is on the navigation bar

14858168
button	checkbox
so yes this means the form is now ready and it will automatically do a validation test triggered on all common events such as submit onkeyup onfocusout and select button checkbox click

14858172
folder	directory
to beautify my code i downloaded the following codesniffer rules for wp and put them in my build directory in my project folder

14858182
floating-point	integer
because all numbers in awk are floating-point numbers the result is not rounded to an integer

14858238
children	parent
this way the processing of a parent will be able to consider the latest state of its already-processed children before issuing possibly un-appropriate changes

14858295
fast-forward	merge
i use this schema and usually stable follows master with small delay and merge are mostly fast-forward

width	height
guideline to set height and width

14869356
width	height
set both height and width to wrap_content

14869356
width	height
set both height and width to fixed size

14869356
width	height
height and width as what you have specified

14869356
width	height
as if you are using wrap_content for height and width you don t need to specify scaletype cause your imageview is automatically going to be as big as your image

14869356
width	height
as if you are using fill_parent for height and width you will have option to show the image in center start end or in full view

14869356
width	height
as if you are using fixed_size fpr height and width you should opt for

14869356
width	height
you can see that your image is quite stretched and the text is not readable that s because you have downloaded and set image as it is but in smaller height and width

14869356

if you don t include a specific constructor call in the initialization list for your derived-class constructor the default constructor of the base class will be used to initialise the base-class members

14869447
base-class	derived-class
the example above illustrates how the derived-class constructor can initialise its member _j but the member _i coming from the base class must be initialised using a base-class constructor

14869447
base-class	derived-class
this is only natural because the derived class in a sense is an extension of the base class and it makes sense to regard the base-class part of the derived-class object as being there first

int	boolean
my point class is derived from point_3 and contains several informations boolean and int

14872327
for-loop	arrays

14872375
ant	maven
i was trying to convert a csv file to json format but i have no idea about ant or maven

14872380
for-loop	arrays
you can create your own arrays of host and use for-loop to get inetaddress

maven	pom.xml
to start switch off aj weaver then do maven | reimport on project s pom.xml then make sure settings | compiler | java compiler is set to ajc then make sure project structure | facets have aj facets with correct aspect path for all modules to be weaved then rebuild a project

getter	setter
then you can run php app console doctrine generate entities acmedemobundle for creating getter setter

14872816
try-catch	exception-handling
wrap the methods in try-catch block in order to rethrowing the exception-handling to handler

14872866

14872968
action-filter	onactionexecuting

14872973
pbkdf2	hash
in the real example i use pbkdf2 to create secure hash

14872973
pbkdf2	salt	pbkdf2	hash	hash	salt

i tried to inherited diagram from an observablecollection but even this didn t help as in observablecollection dependency properties does not update when item in collection is deleted explained

14873233
int	chars
but if it was a word list than the struct would look the same except instead of int key it would be chars key

14873243
udp	tcp
i had already gone thorugh that java only deals with internet domain sockets and it will support udp and tcp and raw ip protocols

14873260
width	height
in order to help you we ll really need to see the code that has been generated so far but i can assume that as you re slicing out images for components of the website that they re a fixed width and height

14873260
width	height
if you re going to just shrink a design by 300px to make it a correct width you re either going to have to scale the height to match the reduced content widths or reduce the size of your content like font sizes

14873268
rspec	capybara
i use capybara 2.0.2 and rspec 2.10.0 to test page title

14873281
clutter	cairo	gtk	cairo	gtk	clutter
you can put gtkwidgets into the opengl scenegraph clutter using the clutter-gtk module but gtk still draws using cairo and then uploads it to the gfx card as a texture so there s not a lot of acceleration for just normal windows

14873309
min	max
it works perfectly fine on every other api from api 8 to api 17 my min and max targets

14873327
int	chars
use a union with 2 fields an int and a chars

14873343
accessor	properties
properties are mostly just sugar around accessor methods written in the conventional cocoa style

14873343
getter	setter
this list is different from a list of methods that are named in the style of getter setter

14873348

i was think about pager controls fading and simple show hide effect and maybe making it responsive

14873354
keydown	keyup
don t use keyup since the form is send on keydown

14873376
hide	show
i guess you need to show and hide the validator controls as showing and hiding the input controls

14873384
width	height
text isn t square because you have defined the width 1em but not the height add height 1em to .circle or .horizontal div

14873406

rspec	capybara
see stackoverflow q a rspec capybara 2.0 tripping up my have_selector tests for details and interesting discussion around the matter

14873440
inherited	subclassing
normally we do not reference the subclassing in the suerclass this somehow breaks the inherited relation

14873440
superclass	subclassing
in your code there is something even worse that will cause a stackoverflowexception because the superclass creates an object with the default constructor of the subclassing which in turns calls the default constructor of the superclass and it will go infinitely until your program crashes

14873450
folder	directory
i ve made a gui for an r simulation and bound it to a function in it s own .r file in the r folder of the packages directory

14873464
getter	setter
around the property there is a setter and getter autosynchoronizsed

14873464
getter	setter
in the event that you use an syncronize statement then you have a chance to influence how the setter getter and property are named

14873464
getter	setter
the getter name is start and the setter name is setstart

14873464
getter	setter
that may well be confusing but start actually addresses the instance variable while self.start uses the setter getter

14873464
getter	setter
depending on the property parameters assign copy retain ... the automatically generated getter and setter does some memeory management for you while the memory management is left to you when you work directly with the instance variable

14873511
macports	homebrew
there is a macports port but no recipe for homebrew

14873943
ubuntu	debian
i have worked on ubuntu and debian before with no problems

14873953
g++	gcc
if you don t want to compile sqlite yourself by adding it to your project you can try passing the -static flag to gcc g++ to force it to link libsqlite.a statically

14873969
disk	ram
reloading pages data or program code from disk which is much slower does not usually happen very often as long as the program is actually running and as long as the machine is not desperately low on ram

14874073
getter	setter
well there s a number of important pieces of information missing from your question but assuming that the name field and getter setter methods reside in the employee object and that the name attribute exists on the same node as the id attribute then the following code should work

14874081
hide	show
so that i can hide and show the correct languages are required

14874086
libstdc++	libc++
same goes for libc++ and gcc 4.8 s libstdc++

14874097
minimum	max
simply calculate the max queue size as well as the minimum index

14874126
client-side	server-side
i mean if we would show 5 million chat messages for the past 5 years probably client-side will become slowed down even if we would load the items part by part thus limiting the server-side stress

14874154
freebsd	aix	freebsd	linux
platforms to support linux freebsd aix

14874208
jasmine	mocha
i m trying to figure out on how to test internal not exported functions in nodejs preferably with mocha or jasmine

14874213
oncreate	recreate
the thing is when the activity is recreate mhelper gets instantiated again in oncreate so in the following call to onactivityresult it can t be null

14874220
post	get
i think you should in first load page with form then parse response code and get correct url for post

14874229
maven	pom.xml
if you use maven include this file as a resource in your pom.xml

14874244
free	realloc

14874300
tcpreplay	scapy	packets	pcap
i recompute ip and transport-layer checksums with scapy save the packets to disk on pcap file and call tcpreplay on it

14874322
min	max
you will have to parse your firstdate and lastdate before assigning it to min and max as below

14874330
int	double
if you need support for point values just choose double or single instead of int

14874345
post	get
the question is how from one php script to send post to another php script get return variables and continue working on that first script without html form and no redirects

14874433
width	height
you can use a specific width for your textview instead of wrap_content the same thing for the height if you want to limit it to an x size

14874445
getter	setter
using this pattern everything is locked to its execution scope by default and occasionally a few judiciously chosen getter setter functions will be returned in cases where an api needs to be exposed

14874461
clang	llvm
clang in principle should be capable of doing it since it depends on llvm which supports link time optimizations it seems that your question is gcc spacific though

14874486
width	height
you need to apply the absolute height and width to the map container and change the initialize mode

14874489
post	get
personally i would go for the post on the withdraw connection as this separates the action from the data withdraw transactions could then be got with get and cancelled with delete

14874502
try-catch	exception-handling
no exception-handling in try-catch

14876642
box-sizing	border-box	width	border-box
by setting the box-sizing to content-box you tell the browsers not to include border and padding into width and if you set box-sizing border-box all browsers will include border and padding into width

14876643
children	parent
the issue was that with your solution now if a parent is already checked by data from the server then it s children s checked values do not mutate

14876647
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
access may use a case-insensitive compare while .net s default is case-sensitive

another problem is that in your for-loop you set the same altitude value for all objects in the arrays therefore sorting by that key does not change anything

14877527
for-loop	arrays
note that creates a new arrays but does not copy the elements in the arrays so that the following for-loop modifies the items from the news arrays
