google-chrome	safari
in safari the whole svg graphic disappears beyond a certain zoom level and in google-chrome the arrowheads at the end of the line disappear and re-appear at random zoom levels so it seems

9603353
opera	firefox
in firefox and opera this behavior is not happening and the arrowheads are visible at any zoom level

9603369
min	max
my main problem was the height of different characters so instead of using a font s ascent i used its outline s max and min y-coordinates to calculate its height

9603461
equals	compareto
for this reason it is considered best practice to make all fields in the hashcode equals and compareto both final and immutable

9603519

filtering	grouping
i am trying to create a single ldap filtering that will find users with various attributes status create date etc who are also members of a particular grouping

9603723
filtering	grouping
normally the answer would be to filtering on the memberof attribute -- but unfortunately users in our directory do not have this attribute -- instead of members referring to their grouping only grouping refer to their members using uniquemember

9603723
filtering	grouping
relationally my instinct is to join the uniquemember attribute of the grouping to the dns we get from the other attribute filtering but my investigation has not shown that this is possible in ldap

9603740

9604044
serializable	deserialization
but you can always implement ixmlserializable and handle the serializable and deserialization by yourself

9604047
completionhandler	clgeocoder

it s saying sym.symptomlist is an unknown property because you do not have a public getter and setter for it and sym.symptom doesn t exist at all

9608778
getter	setter
create a public getter and setter for symptomlist and don t set the value of syptomlist in your getallsym method

lisp	scheme
emacs lisp is rather different from regular lisp so it s probably not directly useful for classes or self-study if your target is something like scheme or common lisp

9608895
setinterval	settimeout
setinterval causes the function to be called every 500ms settimeout will just call it once

9608897

9608979
mouseleave	mouseenter
so you will be going between having a one interval animation going slow when you mouseenter and two when you mouseleave fast

9609013
hide	show
if it s not being dynamically generated you re often better off inserting it in with the rest of the html and using css to hide show it when needed

9609015
easymock	powermockito	mockito	easymock
personally i would just use powermockito along with mockito or easymock to mock the static securitycontextholder.getsecuritycontext in your unit integration test

9609032
google-chrome	safari
instead of alert data try console.log data assuming you re using firebug or the inspector google-chrome safari

9609060
superclass	subclassing
the biggest reason to have a unique context is to deal with the situation where a subclassing or superclass is also observing the same keypath

9609060
superclass	subclassing
however in the case of subclassing you need to pass on the observation to the superclass which is where this becomes important

9609076
r5rs	r6rs	lisp	scheme	lisp	racket	scheme	racket
if you were actually asking about scheme or could go for either scheme or common lisp take a look at racket not technically a scheme it actually has a lot of additional features but they do support r5rs and have a fairly short list of unsupported r6rs features

9609098
mouseleave	mouseenter
you could use the opacity property to implement the behavior you seek and furthermore use eventtriggers on mouseenter and mouseleave to be able to put a nice animation there

9609120
cpython	ironpython
ironpython v2.7.2 rc1 s modulefinder doesn t appear to work so the above script needs to be run using cpython

for replaced elements inline-block elements and inline-table elements this is the height of their margin box

9609246
for-loop	arrays
you can also go through the entire arrays with a for-loop

9609436
width	text-align
this will make it shrink-wrap to its contents here the video and if content-unit has text-align center set on it then the inline-block framewrap will be centered at whatever width it turns out to be

9609436
width	text-align
now because its width is contrained to the widest content the iframe here an inline element the h4 can be set to text-align right and the text should be restricted to the right side of framewrap since the block h4 will still expand to 100 of whatever framewrap is

9609472
png	ico
this is the one and only case of ico files in the project so i was suspicious and switched it to png

9609477

9609485
opera	firefox
opera which was initially slugging in the way you describe for firefox

9609485
mouseleave	mouseenter
mouseenter and mouseleave handling is delegated to the container and though this doesn t appear to be particularly important to performance on my hardware it should consume less memory

9609500
packets	multicast
i receive ticker data via udp each udp multicast packets has sequence number

9609505
width	height
use photoshop the parameters tell the position on the screen x and y the width and height of the frame so each image and the number of frames

9609541
width	height
you could try adding css width and height to it

9609571
google-chrome	firefox
android webview is just another render engine that render html contents downloaded from a http server much like google-chrome or firefox

9609591
cpu	affinity
if you really really wanted to do this and esnyder s suggestion of prioritising using nice levels is almost certainly a better solution for whatever you re really trying to achieve and you re happy to do it at the granularity of 1 number-of-cpus e.g on an 8 core system specify utilisation as a multiple of 12.5 of total cpu resource then you could use sched_setaffinity to set the cpu affinity mask for the process you want to control you can do this from another process

9609619
ordereddictionary	sorteddictionary
it might not be the most efficient way to do it but i ve used ordereddictionary though sorteddictionary is probably more appropriate for handling the out of order issue in the past

9609643
width	height
if i have my layout s width and height set to wrap_content it will take up about half the screen

9609647
button	checkbox

use mouseup and keyup

9609890
int	chars
you can read the binary file using fread to an array of chars or of int

9609946

i think i reproduced this problem locally and ran ant with -d and i could see it try all the standard maven repos out there but not all terracotta artifacts are on maven central

9610189
put	get
adding a pass-through converter on a binding can sometimes help by allowing you to put a break point in the converter that will get pulled when ever there is a binding update

9610197
pull	push
this would have provided an attacker with clone pull access to repositories with read permissions and clone pull push access to repositories with write permissions

9610197

the code seems to be crashing on the imagedisplay.animationimages line as if i create the uiimageview create its getter and setter and build it s fine until i uncomment that line

9610389
rtp	sip
stun will help that somewhat but you may need to limit your sip phones so that their rtp ports are unique so that traffic from one phone doesn t suddenly start showing up on another

9610389
rtp	sip
the port ranges for sip and rtp are ridiculously huge - you can limit your phones to say 10 per phone and cover a lot of ground with very little trouble

9610415
hash	md5
you say you have some md5 hash passwords that you want to convert to crypt-style md5

9610415
hash	md5
unfortunately you likely can t do this from plain md5 hash values

9610415
hash	md5
apache s md5-crypt hash algorithm isn t an md5 sum of the password alone

9610415
hash	salt
the two append something to or otherwise modify the input password not including salt to give the resulting hash

9610415
hash	md5
if indeed you have the md5 hash values using the method you describe piping a string to md5sum that resulting hash cannot be reversed to anything you can then hash to an htpasswd compatible hash

google-chrome	safari
you can look at all the details ni the javascript log hit f12 in ie or right click the page and select inspect element in google-chrome safari

9610925
atoi	atof
however you are probably looking for the atoi and atof functions

9610925

atoi is a function that converts a chars pointing to a string containing an int in decimal to an int

9610927
getter	setter
the sublist object is a list which i have defined in my bean class with getter and setter

in general for a convex set of points you can calculate the centroid x value is the average of all x values y value is the average of all y values

9610964
int	double
it just coerces the pointer to be treated as an int or double

9610964
int	double
i presume what you want is to parse rather than cast the text into an int or double

9611000
hex	binary
if it s on the binary data i get 0x197c and if it s on the ascii hex data i get 0xf775

9611020
google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari
however it is implemented in google-chrome opera and safari

9611043
uiview	subviews

9611355
post	get
use pc- post_count to get the number of post returned by wp_query and compare it to iterator

9611360
versioning	upgrade
you need to install a versioning that is appropriate to your old versioning of r or you need to upgrade

9611399
strlen	strcpy	strcpy	malloc
not adding +1 to the strlen before calling malloc and hence getting a 1-byte heap-overflow from the strcpy

9611399
for-loop	loops
and using a while loops where a for-loop would clearly be more appropriate

9611403
naudio	bass
there are good c# audio libraries for wav like bass audio library or naudio

9611408
post	get
instead of getting all the blog post and checking to see whether the one you ve got has the correct id you should only get one blog post row from the db using a where clause like this

using pdo your final code needs to prepare the query bind a parameter to it execute it and then get the result checking if there actually is a result using pdo rowcount something like this

9611429
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	calloc	malloc
don t cast the return values of malloc or calloc or realloc for that matter in a c program

9611483
ant	maven
it does this in addition to optimizing inlining and obfuscating. you might be able to set up proguard in a maven or ant build so you write your library exposing methods as public and then use proguard to eliminate them from the generated jar

9611499
width	height
the code below would change the form s size assuming its named form1.cs aka the default name for the 1st form created in a ado.net project to 300 height and 300 width it does this when the form loads you could also add a button and use that to change the forms size

9611797
move	drag	mouseup	mousedown
left click and drag traces mouse move events but middle click only shows middle mousedown and middle mouseup

9611817
public	protected
remember that packages aren t object instances and as a result encapsulation doesn t matter nearly as much making elements of a package public is usually much less harmful than exposing internal implementation details of a class which i agree should almost always be private protected

9611818
mouse	keyboard
as mentioned using with javascript can reproduce almost all of the features of flash like rendering and managing user input keyboard mouse even game pads

9611837
pull	push
i m trying to allow the windows machine to push and pull from the osx laptop and i hit the no common commits when pulling the osx local branch

9611881
iframe	prettyphoto
i know how to do the ajax call and the backend scripting i just can t figure out how to capture if the value of the form elements change in any given prettyphoto iframe

9611914
google-chrome	firefox
it work s perfectly in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie i m using 9

9611941
put	get
probably because all its children are set to float left which means you need to put something like overflow auto on your ._content to get it to recognize and wrap those floated elements instead of being just 0 height

9611958
mouse	keyboard
most that i have found about hooks seem to focus on user input keyboard press mouse events but i could not confirm if it is possible to know that the double click the user made is to open an application or just to highlight a word

9611981
comparator	comparable
i think the object should implement a comparator method that follows the normal comparable contract--search for sorting on multiple fields

9611992

google-chrome	firefox
my code is actually an extension so on firefox i m running on greasemonkey and on google-chrome as a content script

9612229
google-chrome	firefox
on firefox i could probably use gm_xmlhttprequest and it d work the code works on both browsers when i m in same-origin urls but i still need to solve the problem for google-chrome in which other constraints namely needing to interact with frames on the host page require me to incorporate my script in the page and forfeit my privileges

9612229
google-chrome	firefox
at the end of the day i need a blob file object as far as i understand to put into the indexeddb firefox or to write to filesystem api google-chrome

9612238

i suggest you print out the int value of each chars in the string as an int ideally in hex to find out exactly what you ve got.

9620018
google-chrome	firefox
i figured out the upload is broken in firefox and google-chrome but works in ie8 and ie9

9620027

9620106
box-shadow	border-box
an outer box-shadow casts a shadow as if the border-box of the element

9620120
getter	setter
you have a problem because hibernate is lazy fetching referenced objects when userinfo object is created by hibernate favdb is not pointing to an actual dbschema object but to a hibernate-generated proxy this is actually implemented via getter setter not the field itself

9620126
bash	subshell
however a subshell does not inherit traps so the canonical example for saving and restoring traps fails in bash

9620172
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
similarly objectinputstream when we create it new objectinputstream in tries to read the same header from the corresponding objectoutputstream at the server side

9620172
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
the objectinputstream created blocks when trying to read the stream header which will not come since there is no corresponding objectoutputstream at server which will write the header to the client

9620172
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
the objectoutputstream and the objectinputstream created at the client and server sides must align with each other

9620178
width	height
in a nutshell the pixelspacing attribute 0028 0030 gives you the voxel width and height

9620209
stdout	fflush
i found the solution python s print doesn t fflush stdout and waits for a certain amount of data before actually pushing the data to the stdout

9620223
width	height
i have a div that i want to go full-screen 100 width height of window size onclick of a seperate button image or link

9620240
hide	show
you can hide it in the sense show here so that child func1 will be called instead of parent func1 in code that knows it s looking at a child instance

9620260
maven	cargo
another approach would be turning your plugin in form of a container for cargo maven plugin in similar manner that i did with osgi framework the cargo project is aimed for testing against javaee containers but that wasn t a problem for me

9620262
cos	sqrt
because i don t have cos and sqrt functions

9620278
try-catch	exception-handling
the problem is that i think the exception-handling block is being triggered because when i remove the try-catch i get a server error 500 message

9620284
udp	tcp
network data in tcp udp packets maybe even on the ip level but i m not sure about that

9620306
maven	m2e
first of all you need the m2e eclipse plugin which is needed to have eclipse automatically recognize and update maven dependencies

9620306
maven	pom.xml
however this new eclipse based maven integration is now aware of the fact that there are many maven plugins used within pom.xml files and that only certain goals of certain plug-ins make sense within an ide environment

9620306
maven	m2e
m2e has a long list of special connectors that allow it to do the right thing when invoking various mojos maven plugin goals

9620306
maven	m2e
however this requires the correct version of the m2e maven import wizard which indigo does not have until sr2

pull	push
doing a combination of insertion and atomic updates like push pull

9620346
width	height
you can use this functions to get the width and height

9620347
getter	setter
this other class library would dynamically create getter and setter based on a predefined function name template a member function _ get _xxx would yield a getter for xxx

9620347
getter	setter
this works great and it creates the getter and setter properly

9620347
getter	setter
these dynamic getter setter are not propagated to the child class

9620347
getter	setter
in the log for foo i can see the getter and setter for bar

9620347
getter	setter
in the log for baz i can see the getter and setter for quux but i d also like to see the getter and setter from the parent

9620358
post	get
when the user selects a news the popup should do an ajax post request to get the news id and close itself

9620391
floor	sqrt
obviously only primes floor sqrt candidate need be tested for a particular candidate value

9620393
getter	setter
i ve narrowed it down to the a file that i m including in my site this file is a php class that has a number of different functions like login getter and setter and so on

9620402

next	except
so if you click on a link it will behave like a web browser except you don t have any controls like go to previous go to next or refresh.

9620514
int	boolean
i establish the connection by calling wifimanager.enablenetwork int netid boolean disableothers with setting disableothers to true which seems necessary to reliably establish the connection

9620521
mouse	keyboard
you can then set these to true false depending on what mouse or keyboard event takes place and your game class then read these variables like so

9620524
swt	windowbuilder	swt	swing	swing	windowbuilder
for desktop apps swing or eclipse swt there s windowbuilder

9620544
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
the connection is being used to move objects back and forth using objectoutputstream and objectinputstream

9620584
pull	push
i have a git repo on my server that i can push pull through ssh just fine like

9620585

9621245
getter	setter
protecting and proxying direct access to these properties won t work when you extend the object because the setter getter - accessing the properties on the new object - won t go to the parent prototype object where you are listening

9621245
getter	setter
when you set the new class up look for the functions being present all the way up the prototype chain from the new params object and if a match is found you should apply the setter getter to the new object as well

i d say probably after you should be able to check if the getter setter have become available and attach your listeners

persistent	transient
either a field is persistent or it s transient

9638318
getter	setter
i have been reading about getter and setter and i have a question

9638318
getter	setter
it seems like there is no need for getter and setter here because it doesnt matter that the variable is private the class that declared it will always have access to it....

9638358
getter	setter
while the language doesn t require you to do so it is good practice to use getter and setter when accessing private fields that are exposed through getter and setter

9638358
getter	setter	accessor	properties	mutators	getter	mutators	setter
an example of a change might be a class that exposes through getter accessor setter mutators methods a certain properties that is initially stored as a private field in that class

9638358
accessor	properties
at that point if you ve only used the methods to access and modify the properties you can simply change the code of the accessor and mutator methods to implement the change

9638379
getter	setter	subclass	accessor
if the getter or setter is not final and if it is intended to be overridden in potential subclasses it might make sense to call it even from the class itself in order to avoid bypassing the additional behavior added by the subclass to the accessor

9638413
accessor	properties
there are plenty of examples where you wouldn t want to access the variable using the properties from inside the class but not let an external entity access that variable without going through your properties accessor

9638478
equals	gethashcode
in other words if your itemssource is bound to a collection of object1 object2 object3 you cannot set the selecteditem to if you do this you must override the equals and gethashcode methods

9638485
getter	setter
for exapmle if you are doing java programming in the android environment direct access is encouraged over getter setter

9638485
getter	setter
in other environments the getter setter may be encouraged for maintainability

9638485
getter	setter
avoid internal getter setter

unless you are using udp and the nat is friendly it is not possible to send tcp communication directly to the inside peer

9651363

google-chrome	safari
output is as expected in google-chrome and safari

9651494
stdout	stderr
check chrome s output to stdout stderr

9651494
stdout	stderr
for this reason you need to redirect stdout stderr from chrome by setting the environment variables nacllog nacl_exe_stdout and nacl_exe_stderr

9651530

viewdidload	viewwillappear
so what you want to do is either put your code in viewdidload or call viewwillappear manually

9651759
post	get
i would strongly recommend using post rather than get as get requests are assumed not to change any data

9651783
int	chars
so what happens is reading from the right 1 - -1 - long -1 - int -1 - - chars 1 - byte 1 which then gets cast to an int during the assignment

9651889

9651980
affinity	processors
or setting processors affinity

9652027
cpu	affinity
i can t give you a good use case for this heat map except that it looks super awesome but i can tell you a sad story about how we used cpu affinity to fix something

9652027
cpu	affinity
after a while of troubleshooting and desperation we tried setting word process affinity to just one cpu to reduce concurrency and hence reduce the likelihood of race conditions

9652028
post	get
so the post data would be of the same format as a get request with name value pairs

stateless	stateful
that answer is talking about injecting a stateful in a stateless which is indeed an extremely bad idea

9652030
stateless	stateful
see also this related answer access existing instance stateful inside stateless java ee 6

9652038
min	max	minimum	max
the syntax is where min is a positive integer number indicating the minimum number of matches and max is an integer equal to or greater than min indicating the maximum number of matches

9652038
min	max
omitting both the comma and max tells the engine to repeat the token exactly min times

9652039
min	max	range	min	range	max
you can also specify a min max range instead of forcing a specific legnth

9652039
min	max
so if you wanted a min of 4 and a max of 8 the example would change to

9652048
h.265	hevc	h.264	h.265	h.264	hevc
high efficiency video coding hevc also known as h.265 and mpeg-h part 2 is a draft video compression standard a successor to h.264 mpeg-4 avc advanced video coding currently under joint development by the iso iec moving picture experts group mpeg and itu-t video coding experts group vceg

9652048
h.264	hevc
mpeg and vceg have established a joint collaborative team on video coding jct-vc to develop the hevc standard. 1 hevc is said to improve video quality and double the data compression ratio compared to h.264 and scales up to 7680 ã 4320 pixels resolution

rvm	bundler	rubygems	rvm	rubygems	bundler
gems can be installed outside of bundler by rubygems gem install gem_name but it s best to use rvm which allows you to install separate versions of ruby and manage individual gemsets for each application as explained in the rvm best practices

9652192
inherited	subclassing
i think the rationale for this claim is that in many situations subclassing doesn t often change the behavior of the existing inherited fields but rather one adds fields and adds new methods that manipulate the new fields

9652223
getter	setter
however getter setter are evil

9652223
getter	setter
getter and setter are an important part of oop from my experience

9652411
google-chrome	firefox
and as requested by raynos - persisting closure state - something you can t serialise works in firefox and google-chrome at least ie calls it a security issue but might be something to do with how jsfiddle is using frames

disk	ram
in any scenario you can specify how often to drop dirty blocks back to the hard disk drive making writes like on the ram drive but the mirror scenario also makes reads like from the ram drive

9652984
folder	directory
when dlls in prism modules are referenced the .net assembly resolution mechanism looks for the referenced assemblies in the bin folder of the hosting application the one with the shell and bootstrapper rather than in the module s bin directory assuming you have set up your modules as separate projects in the solution as i have

9652984
folder	directory
the dll is in fact being copied to the bin directory of the module but some quirk of the way assembly resolution works with prism applications means that the app never checks for assemblies in that folder

9653690
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox but it fails in google-chrome

9653694
put	get
all you have to do is replace the method used by a request with put and it will use the put method of orders and use a regular get on orders and it will use the get method

9653694

use to catch window resizing events and set your slide s width and height to 100 again

9653751
cstdio	iostream
i just learned of the existence of the ios_base sync_with_stdio function which basically allows you to turn off or on if you already turned it off the synchronization between iostream streams that are used in c++ and the cstdio streams that are part of standard c

9653751
stdout	stderr
now i always thought that stdout stderr and stdin in c were essentially wrapped in a set of objects in c++ in the iostreams classes

9653767
int	chars
typically in the x86 architecture the value is returned in eax register if it is an integral type chars int or pointer

9653792

when using one pair of #...... ....... in the source code to show hide then everything works just fine

9653822
hide	show
when adding just one more pair show hide it gives me an error

9653826
equals	gethashcode
the results of gethashcode can change between runs - all that s guaranteed is that calling it on two equals objects in the same process possibly appdomain will give the same hash code

9653835
stdout	stderr
once stdin stdout and stderr are redirected standard c functions such as printf and gets can be used without change to communicate with the win32 console

9653835
stdout	stderr	cout	cin
since cin cout cerr and clog are closely tied to câ s stdin stdout and stderr you would expect them to behave similarly

9653903

9654477
post	put	post	get	put	get
the real question is do you use the http verbs delete put post get as part of your api or you are simply exposing methods that are equivalent to your soap methods

9654489
put	get
however you may be better off setting up a second virtualhost so you can put your entire public site into holding using something like to get the 503 http status code but still use the wordpress admin and site yourself through a different hostname

9654726
mouse	keyboard
however i run into problems when attempting to test a user interface - my first instinct is for junit to create a robot that object that crontols the mouse and the keyboard to mimic a human working though a test - but that feels both inelegant and not very resilient to change

mouse	keyboard
you may have some luck with monodroid but i assume you will have lots of trouble getting an application written for desktop screen size with mouse and keyboard running on an android device

9655061
put	get
means that you always create a new threadlocal call get immediately and put the result not the threadlocal into a map

9655073

it it can be altered in a single cycle a boolean or int than you can never know whether the thread you are in is the one that changed it last or another one did which will lead to unpredictable results in most cases

9655160
nunit	mstest
it makes visual studio to see nunit test as mstest

9655190
width	height
you could cache the writebalebitmap and you should be sensitive if your scenario requires changes in the width or height or just create a very big bitmap

9655522
width	height
moreover the way you are hardcoding the width and height with pixels in not a good practice at all

9655522

use bitmapfactory.decoderesource to obtain a bitmap object of the resource and then from the bitmap you can easily retrieve the image width height with getheight and getwidth

9655683
implements	extends
i think it would be better to implements the insert method in the document class and override it with an appropriate methods in the classes that extends it

9655694
width	height
the following snippet will resize an image to the specified width automatically calculating the height in order to keep the proportion

9655704
implements	extends
in case that in future you plan to add more types that extends document and add more operations than just insert i would suggest implements a visitor design pattern

post	put
after reading a lot of post here and also on other website i understand that i shouldn t put password or any other input from the user in the cookie

9656435
implements	extends
how you d implements depends on whether you know what you re transforming in each case or are you trying to build something generic extends the array class

9656450
uitableview	nsindexpath
in order to do so i have created an nsindexpath instance which i am passing to the uitableview s method

9656450

free	malloc
this works nine out of ten times but sometimes it gives a segmentation fault at free tmp it gives a segfault at malloc or it prints

9656604
width	height
edit i sort of overlooked that you don t even need less at all or the height and width in styles.game.css

9656627
free	malloc
since your tmp buffer is temporary i would rather use a stack-based buffer using the maximum space that your convoluted sizeof tries to allocate as a bonus this will be faster than malloc free

9656665
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	calloc	malloc
aligned_alloc calloc malloc and realloc

9656676
installshield	orca
basically you use orca or installshield tuner or similar tools to create a transform with your registry values then save it to an mst file

9656741
post	get
and this is the task i d like to get a list of the most recent versions of all post in each language using the orm

9656790
getter	setter
yes use a getter setter pair of which the setter traps the setting of the variable

9656805
hash	md5
the service that i am sending it to requires that it be an md5 hash of the byte array of the string in utf16le

9656805
hash	md5
basically if i have mystring that needs to be put into a utf16le byte array and then that array needs to be md5 hash

9656827
google-chrome	firefox
if you open the fullscreen mode in firefox and resize it to width less than 546px you will see there is no scrollbar but it is in google-chrome or ie

9656854
post	get
you use post instead of get

9656858
width	height
as long as the grid s height and width make it square the resultant items will be the appropriate proportions

9656858
width	height
you could also set the height of each rowdefinition and the width of each columndefinition to the same arbitrary value and get it proportional

9656926
width	height
the only way i found to be sure that the view is in landscape mode is to test that the view height is less than the view width

9656946
hide	show
you can certainly add multiple subreports and use conditional formulae to show hide each subreport

9656971
folder	directory
-type f -print0 will recursively search all the folder and files from your current directory downwards

9656971
spaces	delimiter
the -0 tells xargs that its input is delimiter by the special 0 character not by spaces

9656991
width	height
i basically have a custom control which wraps up a newly created graphicsdevice using the panels handle and width height to create the viewport and draw loop

9656991
width	height
i have also got a method which will reset the graphicsdevice on resizing the form it also updates the height width if required which looks like this

9656998
csv	tsv
i want to generate rdf data from tabular data in particular csv tsv spreadsheets either excel or openoffice and eventually tables in rdbms

9656998
rdf	r2rml

9656998
csv	tsv
i use apache jena for processing storing and querying rdf data and or reading csv or tsv files

9657042
getter	setter
in your pq class define getter and setter to manipulate fields of your objects safely conforming to the principle of encapsulation

9657053
getter	setter
these are the two classes i have defined each class contains the respective getter and setter

9657060
move	drag
the short version i drag out a view from the palette and drop it onto the view controller it automatically fills the entire view controller and trying to move or resize it in any way has no impact

9657064
int	chars
types bool chars wchar_t and the signed and unsigned int types are collectively called integral types.43 a synonym for integral type is int type

9657067
int	chars
works and feels as any other basic type like byte chars int

9657082
dictionary	map
you will have to read the separately generated token file and then make a map a dictionary data structure to translate the token name into the token character s

9657130
csv	tsv
however having done some data conversion myself from csv tsv and tabular data recently i ll try to provide you with some guidance at least

9657154
viewdidload	dealloc
3 also i am a little confused to which variable i should release in dealloc and which variable should i set to nil in viewdidload

9657166
nstimer	nsrunloop
you need to schedule an nstimer in an nsrunloop alternatively you could use the convenience method

9657194
ceil	floor
its always a good idea to use ceil or floor based on what you want when using float number as int

9657237
accessor	properties
that statement creates the accessor methods for the personname properties

9657237
accessor	properties
the main concern with using the properties accessor in -dealloc is that it can cause problems if your class is subclassed and the accessor are overridden

9657242
integer	unsigned
it s a very big integer which is out of the range of unsigned bigint on mysql

9657258
oncreate	ondestroy
each activity has own lifetime cycle from oncreate to ondestroy

9657363
for-loop	loops
use a for-loop instead as it will allow you to initialize the increment and adjust it each loops on the same line

9657379
implements	extends
you ll have to implements your own adapter you could extends a simplecursoradapter because you have a cursor with data

9657383
dictionary	map
i am creating a json string with a key of object or dictionary map

9657390
express	node.js
instead of comparing backend servers i think the real future of doing amazing things is in front-end javascript frameworks like backbone.js that use express rails node.js on the backend

9657390
express	node.js
node.js and express aren t putting as much effort to coordinate with frontend javascript mvcs as the rails community is

9657399

width	margin
the way i would do it is to set a minimum width on the container and content divs with a left margin on the content div that allows it to slide next to the nav div

9657433
width	margin
the left margin plus the minimum width should equal the minimum width of the container

9657449
versioning	upgrade
i have to stress out that i believe numpy was already pre-installed i just upgrade the versioning using 1.5.1-py2.7

9657456
mousemove	mouseenter
move your logic to the mouseenter as this will happen before the mousemove and you will get the behavior that you desire

9657458
short	base
the b ii creates an temporary object of b which gets destructed as soon as constructor of d returns in short it does not call the constructor for base class of object which is being constructed

9657494

my thought is that i need to create my service that extends accessibilityservice and implements onaccessibilityevent

9657522
versioning	upgrade
i previously had matplotlib 1.0.1 installed and working but i needed some features from versioning 1.1.0 and was becoming quite annoyed that all the documentation was for another versioning than mine so i decided to upgrade

i d start by having wcf run on a separate iis web site that doesn t listen to port 80 or 443 and make sure firewall blocks access to your new wcf port from ips outside your lan or even better outside your white list localhost for now

9657565
width	height
set your repeating background in this second div and ensure than the height and width are 100

9657647
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
after a bit of reading it would seem that sortedlist or sorteddictionary is what you need

9657647
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
sortedlist appears to use less memory and is technically a binary tree where sorteddictionary is faster with unsorted data

9657694
oncreate	setcontentview
or write in oncreate yours activity before setcontentview

9657724

each of these int elements would be broken into sub-fields that contain a length and an offset that points into a separate backing array of type chars

9664407
int	chars
if you have no more than 16777216 chars of underlying string data 120 000 strings times an average length of 10 chars 1.2 million chars you can take the low-order 24 bits of each int and store the starting offset of each string into your backing array of chars data and take the high-order 8 bits of each int and store the size of the corresponding string there

9664407
int	chars
your chars data will have your erstwhile strings crammed together without any delimiters relying entirely upon the int array to know where each string starts and ends

9664407
int	chars
the words in the arrays would be sorted alphabetically and your lookup process could be a simple binary search on the int array retrieving the corresponding words from the chars array for each test which should be very efficient

9669054
mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave
your approach for the mouseout rather use this than mouseleave - same goes for mouseover instead of mouseenter is ok just do the same thing with a different event although you could also use hover which will allow you to bind the functions for mouseover and mouseout in a single call

9669058

9669065
glfw	glew
i am using glfw and glew

9669072

the outter container is required to cover the width and height of the page

9669815
width	height
it still covers 100 of the page s width and height but anything placed inside it will be centred both vertically and horizontally

9669820
grass	proj
my test proj works like this i have n vbo s which are modeling blades of grass

9669869

denis s suggestion to create custom builder is probably best solution if you want to continue using pure maven cargo approach with eclipse

9670100
maven	cargo
fwiw i don t think maven tomcat cargo plugins are ideal for real-time web development especially on the frontend side of things

9670100
maven	m2e
use m2e to integrate maven with eclipse

9670100
folder	directory
use maven to do clean builds and generate exploded war directory in target folder

9670100
folder	directory
i think the same setup could be used without jrebel for non-java files only by configuring the web source folder as source folder in eclipse with custom target output path being the corresponding directory in the exploded war directory

9670126
portrait	landscape
setting this information will make the system look for default.jpg and all its variations portrait landscape 2x etc instead of .png

9670127
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox

due to the radical difference between disk and ram speeds this could result in a huge performance penalty

9670153
children	parent
i am trying to add multiple children to a parent

9670172
min	max
the major reason for this is that one pre-aggregates data in operations which are easy to combine upwards mainly + - mean std max min and some more

9670186
icmp	snmp
it is typical for an snmp ping to be equivalent to an icmp echo

9670187
width	height
your custom panel should have x and y attached dependency properties like canvas does only that methods should use either relative coordinates 0 to 1 instead of 0 to width and 0 to height or divide by original path width and height to normalize to coordinates

9670228
versioning	upgrade
the code will raise when you try to upgrade to a rails versioning that already includes abstractcontroller callbacks so you will be reminded to remove the conditional logic

9670339
symfony	silex
if you don t need a lot of what you see in the symfony tutorials you might be able to get away with silex

9670339
symfony	silex
silex is a mini-framework with alot of the core aspects of symfony but without the extra stuff

9670342
disk	ram
in short unless your private bytes section is pretty well out of control or you have leaks ie undisposed unmanaged resources you and your client should ignore this and let the os manage what is allocated what s in physical ram and what s swapped out to disk

9670392
client-side	server-side
it can be used for gathering usage statistics on utilities plugins eclipse intellij netbeans etc. client-side server-side middleware desktop or any java based applications

9670490

qtcore	qtgui
config need qtcore qtgui and qtxml

9670524
flask	django
after our initial project in django we are currently developing in flask

9670524
flask	django
flask is an even better match for classic asp developers than django

9670524

i need to switching between videos very quickly however loading a new clip to a videoview seems to take about half a second of black screens

9670673
subtract	add
your juldate is still a string when you add subtract the 1 as number will return a value - that you never assign - but not convert the passed variable

9670695
required	placeholder
my best guess is that this can t be done without using dynamic items in a target and the workaround will be rather than using items which required a condition to write out a file with a predefined name and use that as output placeholder

9670717
versioning	upgrade
unless you know that you won t need later upgrade versioning then you may keep what s working

9670780

this tends to be somewhat verbose but there is a very nice library www.projectlombok.org out there that generates the getter setter constructors tostring hashcode equals methods for you

9670826
hide	show
i used the uisearchdisplaydelegate to show and hide the scope bar

9670832
getter	setter
generally i would recommend using getter and setter as it is cleaner more organized and more readable

9670867
getter	setter
it is always a good java programming practice to declare the class variables as private and access them with public getter and setter methods unless its really needed to declare them as public

9670867
getter	setter
if you are using an ide then its just a click away to generate getter and setter for class variables member variables

9670879
put	get
well i don t have any idea that reset default wallpaper when user uninstalling your app i recommend you to put another button or find a way to get a default wallpaper

9670910
getter	setter
the rationale for using getter and setter is so that you abstract out the actual representation as a field in order to give you the freedom to start presenting this as a derived value without changing your interface

i was supposed to write a method which will perform addition on collection of int float or double

9675213
for-loop	loops
of course you can limit how many tiles if you loops through by using a for-loop and specifying the end condition as i tile assuming your count starts at 0

9675352
mouseover	mouseenter
first you probably want the mouseenter event instead of mouseover

9675367
folder	directory
i ve tried deleting every bin and obj folder in my solution directory and the installer project folder as well

9675371

9675552
box-sizing	border-box
yes the solution to your problem is box-sizing border-box

9675590
width	height
i have figured out how to change the value of fields like width and height but the one i want is the stylesheet classes field

9675594
box-sizing	border-box
depending on what browsers you need to support you could change the box-sizing attribute on these divs to be border-box

9675594
width	height
that will allow you to set a height and a width on each box without the padding or borders effecting the dimensions you set

9675598
interpolation	splines
curvevertex uses catmull-rom splines to calculate the interpolation curve between the points

9675603

you can specify the getter only the setter only or both

9675676
post	get
all it does is forwarding a get request to a back-end serivce as a post request

getter	setter
inside of your property definition you can specify getter and setter methods as follows

9675711
getter	setter
you can specify the getter only the setter only or both

9675720
jar	war
one for the jar with just the classes you want in the jar and second maven project for the war

9675720
jar	war
in the war project jar project should be added as a dependency

9675720
jar	war
also if you want to install war project and at the same time to produce that jar file just in one command line you should define the war project as the parent project and the jar one as a module

9675728
express	node.js
i am also fairly new to node.js and express

9675772
serializable	deserialization
you re forgetting the client side serializable time for the request data and deserialization time for the response data

9675818
move	drag
here you would be able to drag and drop to move manually sort nodes of type a but type b would always appear below those nodes

9675876
many-to-many	one-to-many
first of all if authors co-write books you have a many-to-many association and not a one-to-many

post	get
i managed to get the access token and post data but if i try to post the day after the php script returns an error saying that the acces token is expired

9675901
width	height
however because the c1truedbgrid scrolls the width and height properties are likely to be smaller than the actual width and height

9675901
width	height
i looked through the property values mygrid while in debug mode trying to find anything that looked like what i would expact the actual width and height values to be but with no luck

9675919
icmp	snmp
as you correctly suspected snmp ping is definitely not the same as icmp ping

9675919
snmp	mib
there is no special ping command in snmp - it s just a name for a tool used to scan whether snmp is alive at some target device by retrieving some common mib values

9675922
google-chrome	firefox
when viewing the site in ie8 browser mode which is fine in firefox google-chrome and ie9+ i noticed my anchors were no longer sending ajax calls

9675929
int	boolean
also you don t really need int of int - you could just use an simple int ie an int for int - and i suspect ml has a boolean type that could use instead of defining a datatype for bool in other words you probably don t need to define a datatype at all for either of those - just use what is already present in the language

9675933
move	drag
with event.getx and event.gety in my own similar drag implementation i saw move events that seemed to show my touch oscillating around my finger as it move

9675966
versioning	upgrade
i had this happen on a prior versioning of xcode when i upgrade

9675974

anyway it seems that vs2010 had by default placed my project dir within the library folder which was classified as network subsequently all files within were unavailable offline

9676027
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i am using a specific doctype in my html document to ensure that ie renders arial the same way as firefox google-chrome and safari do

9676136
google-chrome	firefox
finally use a javascript debugging tool such as firebug in firefox or google-chrome developer toolbar in google-chrome to debug your ajax requests and see the requests and responses being sent to and from the server and any possible errors that might occur in between

9676161
hash	md5
the issue was that i added md5 hash as a parameter for each file

9676161
hash	md5
when it requested the content while offline it was not able to find an appropriate file as the cached file name contained the md5 hash as a parameter

9676161
hash	md5
so i resolved it by including the md5 hash as the comment

9676165
google-chrome	firefox
my aplication works fine on firefox and google-chrome but not on ie

9676180
pdfsharp	itext
first i was thinking to achieve that using some pdf libraries like pdfsharp or itext but then i found out that there are other technologies like xps or xsl-fo maybe suitable for my needs

9676215
getter	setter
the interface that combines those two interfaces can declare a read-write property whose implementation would be expected to use the read-only property s getter and the write-only property s setter

9676227
nsview	nsoutlineview
nsoutlineview is a subclass of nstableview which in turn is a subclass of nscontrol which in turn is a subclass of nsview

9676240

is going to always draw it at 0 0 because width - width will be 0 and height - height will be 0

9676310

9676342
rss	feed
i ve try to read rss feed from multiple website but some of this exposes your service rss in a strange way like this samples

9676401
folder	directory
it depends is the user that is trying to upload the file s into that directory on the server have permissions to that folder on the server eg read write ect.

9676403
portrait	landscape
api 11 added the method activity#recreate which sends your current activity through the same teardown recreate process that normally happens for config changes such as rotating the screen between landscape and portrait orientation

google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari
on google-chrome safari opera i use localstorage

9676421
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
renders arial the same way as firefox google-chrome and safari do

9676429
getter	setter
yes they are ok however i would also say that you should keep your classes small than you would with say java and what not so you don t end up with types that are mostly getter and setter

9676486
equals	gethashcode
i have tried overloading equals and gethashcode no luck

9676505

touchesbegan	touchesmoved
to track their movement i get the current position with touchesbegan and update the position with touchesmoved

9676545
touchesmoved	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchesmoved
occasionally particularly if i ve moved a view very recently and it may still be animating back to its original position if i begin dragging another view the touchesbegan selector will not be called but touchesmoved and touchesended will be

9676561
mouseup	mousedown
similarly there are mousedown and mousedownat commands which do the very same thing to the left mouse button until mouseup

9676572
post	put
this will put the api_token in the params hash just the same as post data would be

9676572
post	get
the restful way would be to use get for retrieving data from the api and using post to send data changing data on your backend but if you are going to be returning a user with the request then get is the correct method to be using anyway

9676573
mouse	keyboard
keyboard movement is ok but mouse movement is strange

9676586
typedef	struct
i m defining some struct which reference eachother and typedef ing the struct before using them so each struct is aware of the others was getting compilation errors without this

9676616
post	get
i have tried a get post ajax getjson request from the stand jquery package not jquery mobile

9676653
width	height
this would simply hide the text in your span element if it was longer than the 250px width and or 90px height

9676656
post	get
the viewstate is stored in an html hidden field on the page so to keep the values you would need to ensure an http post rather than a get which will be a problem if you need to say response.redirect

9676664
for-loop	arrays
you could read the data in as float precision then allocate an arrays of doubles and then manually fill the arrays of doubles using a for-loop

9676667
maven	pom.xml
i d consider changing maven pom.xml to declare servlet 3.0 jsp 2.2 so that you can benefit all the new servlet 3.0 features

9676669
setinterval	settimeout
i stumbled upon a show-stopper glitch in firebug wherein if a breakpoint is hit in a javascript callback method and execution is subsequently continued f8 any callback functions previously passed to settimeout or setinterval will no longer be called

9676669
setinterval	settimeout
to clarify in order to trigger the glitch the breakpoint must be located on any line on any event callback anywhere in the program except for in the setinterval settimeout callback itself

hide	show
i have a simple css jquery menu set up which uses jquery ui toggleclass to show and hide sub-menus

9676921
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome offer the property -webkit-mask-image which accomplishes exactly what you want but is not supported by any web browser other than safari and chrome.

9676948
inherited	properties
most if not all modern mobile devices in wurfl have the device_os properties set but they inherited it from their parent devices so you would either need to use the wurfl api to lookup all devices and check their device_os or you will need to parse to xml file directly combining the capabilities of each device with the capabilities of their parents specified in the fall_back xml attribute

9676970
oncreate	onstart
i see from android developers that there is a nice flowchart showing oncreate leading to onstart then to onresume and so forth

9677376
for-loop	loops
it will basically be a nested for-loop one to loops through the data the other to loops through the sub-array

9677380

google-chrome	firefox
i want it to be further down the page but no matter where i put the document.write that creates it the div remains at the top in firefox google-chrome

9677450
hide	show
and both functions work independently of each other very well i just can not figure out how to tie the second show hide in that it only runs once validated and submitted

9677482
disk	ram
static variables can and will be a lot of the times reset when the user sends your app into the background because the system will serialize everything that it can keep track of to the disk to keep for later use and save ram

9677537
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and safari will detect when you go offline automatically - meaning that online events and properties will fire automatically when you unplug your network cable

opera	firefox
firefox mozilla opera and ie take a different approach and consider you online unless you explicitly pick offline mode in the browser - even if you don t have a working network connection

9677592

my next effort was to get an intellij idea maven project up and running with the minimum amount of information in my pom.xml to enable the auto-generation of the proxy classes

9677828
maven	pom.xml
taking the aforementioned clue i was finally able to get the proxy classes blowing out by including a dependency for aws-java-sdk-flow-build-tools-1.3.3.jar in my pom.xml after installing this jar into my local maven repository

maven	pom.xml
follow the maven instructions below for setting up the pom.xml

9677837
pull	push
from reading some of these forums i m supposed to have access to git commands now which i have a commit command but no push or pull

9677837

irc	telnet
here is a hacky irc client we ll call it stackirc as an example using telnet but you could just as easily choose to use netcat or bash s inbuilt dev tcp handling you will need telnet and xdialog to use it but it basically just spawns a child shell to watch a file using xdialog --tailbox... that is later updated by telnet

9678406
free	malloc
i have succeeded in hooking malloc free which are dynamically linked from the .exe

9678406
free	malloc
i m wondering whether detours can be used to hook statically linked malloc free

9678406
free	malloc
i understand that might be more difficult since the malloc free code is already inside .exe and it is even difficult to locate them

9678406
free	malloc
but i guess there may exist some other technique that can locate malloc free function inside the .exe

compare it to the current versioning number and you need to execute serval sql files named like appname _sql_v1.sql appname _sql_v2.sql appname _sql_v3.sql keep in mind that each edition will own a appname _sql_v .sql file that contains all the table schema changes and records changes.if your app have been upgrade to versioning 7 you will find 7 sql files in you app package

9679853
versioning	upgrade
let s assume that some guy have installed a app versioned 2 but did not update until one day he she find the current versioning is 7 and then he she upgrade it to 7

9679853
versioning	upgrade
two code versioning number will be loaded when he she started the app for the first time after the upgrade finished 2 and 7 so these sql files appname _sql_v3.sql appname _sql_v4.sql appname _sql_v5.sql appname _sql_v6.sql appname _sql_v7.sql will be execute one by one

9679877

9680288
free	malloc
in your calculation function you don t need all that malloc stuff and consequently you don t need the free bit

put the following code in your servlet and you ll get the desired behavior

9680345
free	malloc
you can not call free on anything that has not been returned by malloc

9680368
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
i ve found that if i write and test my code using firefox most everything will work flawlessly on google-chrome opera safari and the only thing you ll end up having to debug would be msie

9680378
des	aes
considering that according to the mifare ultralight c documentation the des implementation is a 2-key des only and not a 3-key des i would prefer the aes capable card

9680395
liferay	web-inf

- uitableviewcell tableview uitableview tableview cellforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

9680493

google-chrome	safari
i wrote a javascript client and tested it under google-chrome and safari

9680820
google-chrome	safari
i discovered that google-chrome and safari use different websocket versions

9680820
google-chrome	safari
for example google-chrome uses sec-websocket-key and expects sec-websocket-accept while safari sends instead sec-websocket-key1 sec-websocket-key2 and a bunch of 8 bytes after the header

9680820
google-chrome	safari
the websocket is correctly open from google-chrome or safari both osx windows and ios5 versions

9680820
google-chrome	safari
apparently safari sends and expects messages delimited by 0x00 and 0xff while google-chrome sends and expects framed and masked data using a more recent version of the websocket specification

9680820
google-chrome	safari
i guess i could assume that if the handshake protocol is based in key1 and key2 the client is safari and then use 0x00 0xff to delimit data while if it uses sec-websocket-key the client is google-chrome and then use framed data

i think the request gets timed-out as there is not httpresponse until the request is processed

9680836
httpresponse	request
if i can generate some httpresponse from view while the request is processed the script might be able to run longer

9680836
httpresponse	request
doing so might send response even while the request completes. i was told on django irc that even i was able to get print to send message as response it will only throw out when httpresponse is returned. thus it was suggested to use httpresponse with an iterable

9681964

i m not sure how this will interact with your use of annotations on fields but if you annotate your getters you could use the transient annotation to tell hibernate this is not to be persistent

9682121
karatsuba	strassen
i think karatsuba algorithm is best to perform arithmetic operations on large numbers.for sufficiently large n another generalization the schã nhageâ strassen algorithm is even faster

9682402
realloc	strdup
please also read the documentation for realloc and strdup

9682402
free	strdup	free	realloc	realloc	strdup
you should still be checking for null returns from realloc and strdup since they both attempt to allocate memory and thus may fail in that way in c and you still need code to free the allocated memory

i think overriding getter and setter is a good option for you

9682618
google-chrome	firefox
whenever i open my php page on google-chrome firefox it works great

9682637
integer	unsigned
dword is an unsigned 32 bit integer so uint is technically correct

you can later reference this variable in your http sampler in the get post parameters of the request by specifying the value of the parameter to be for username for password

9682669
google-chrome	firefox

pop-up	dialog
the invitation dialog pop-up fine and invitation is also sent

9682875
opera	google-chrome
this only works on google-chrome and perhaps opera though i have to verify if the latter is true as it s printing the background color by default while google-chrome prints with a white background and the colored background in my page might be just obscuring the header footer text

9682875
firefox	safari
firefox and safari ignore the margins apparently and print the headers footers anyway

9682927
width	height
if i understand it correctly the best way would be to make a wrapper div with at width and height elements in this div will not be affected by changing page width you will just get a scroll

9702358
getter	setter
this is particularly important in objective-c because it is often by way of getter and setter that memory is managed when a value is assigned to an ivar it is by way of the setter that the object assigned is retained and ultimately released

9702370
getter	setter
when you define a property a getter and setter is created for you

when you access them using object.member setter and getter are called automatically

9702370

when you declare variable in interface setter and getter are not written for you

9702378
getter	setter
they can t be accessed outside the class. important point unless you provide custom getter and setter

other than wrapping the text in tags you also have to put the label into a container that respects the preferred height and sets the width to maximum

9705097
width	height
the label will occupy the whole width and the height will adjust accordingly to wrap the text

9705147

9705307
uiview	subviews
the topmost element is a custom uiview subclass whose subviews in turn are comprised of the appropriate controls

9705307

google-chrome	firefox
it runs ridiculously slow in ie7 but later versions of ie are fine along with firefox and google-chrome

9706158
post	put
for some resources the client needs to be able to assign a relationship to another resource however it seems to me that requiring the client to generate a hyperlink and post put patch whatever this hyperlink into a resource has some drawbacks more complexity for the client security and load balancing concerns etc.

9706257
client-side	server-side
preferably all of this could be specified on the server-side rather than by duplicating code in client-side javascript html

9706293
folder	directory
ajeet i believe you can create a directory for android and iphone inside the resources folder that you can keep your platform-specific code assets in

create an user libs with all the jars placed under the lib folder located in the opencms deployed war and add it to the buildpath

9706551
filesystems	ntfs
the cifs filesystems driver exposes the ntfs filesystems in such a way that you in the worst case can only read files

9706551
filesystems	ntfs
and of course you need to check the acls of the exported ntfs filesystems

9706551
filesystems	ntfs
if this operation is supported by the cifs driver and should work it will still fail if the ntfs filesystems has the wrong owner or a read only bit set

9706553
cos	sin
be sure when specifying the angle that you use radians or degrees as appropriate to the trig library you use to calculate the sin and cos

9706553
cos	sin
if you calculate the sin and cos server-side in c# use radians

9706582

typo3	templavoila
i have installed typo3 templavoila and mapped a template

9706735

9706858
int	chars
with a newtype instance id and id chars are both int but they have different types

9706862

i want to take a back of a directory subdirectories in it say backup from g drive to a drive using perl and archiving and then unarchiving and without disturbing the folder structure in the backup folder

9706886
strlen	realloc
as this is c take a look at realloc - but you will need to also have a parameter for the old size or perhaps use strlen

9706894
int	chars
my problem is that when i am using int 21h to take in values its taking only single digit chars as input for each variable

9706900
post	put	post	get	put	get
a normal web browser makes only get and post requests to a website so it is very difficult to render template by a put request for the user because the user is normally not able to start a put request

9706904
width	height
the choice what dimensions becomes length width and height is essentially arbitrary

9706904
width	height
for example we would like to be able to tell that the box with length 1 width 2 and height 3 is the same box as the one with length 3 width 1 and height 2

9706904
width	height
the values of the length width and height columns can be interchanged to form another legitimate record

9706904
width	height
it could be implemented as a function based unique index as long as we can express a b c analytically in terms of length width height

9706904
width	height
piece of cake a is the greatest of length width height

9706904
width	height
symmetric functions rewritten in terms of length width height are

9706904
addition	multiplication
our last solution is strikingly similar to the earlier one where the greatest operator plays the role of multiplication while the least operator goes as addition

9706904
width	height
in the box inventory database example we donâ t even need schema redesign we can just require to change the practice of inserting unconstrained records length width height and demand that

9706929
addclass	removeclass
instead of setting fixed styles using style i recommend to use the functions addclass removeclass and toggleclass

9706944

9706960
free	malloc
and preferably without using malloc free and with the spirit of raii

9706972
min	max

9706976
maven	pom.xml
check this maven pom.xml reference it might give you some clues

9707056
width	height
i m using divs with hidden overflows and am animating the width and height properties to reveal each segment

9707056
width	height
my idea is to separate all the leaves into pngs and position them in the correct place then i want to reveal each of them individually from specific points of origin the root of each leaf which appears in different places and reveal each leaf by animating the height width in the opposite direction

9707070
ssl	ntlm
if you really want to know whether something is secure or not you need to specify the types of threat that you need to protect against what your tolerance is for breaks in that security and what additional mechanisms that you have taken to secure your site for example password authentication ntlm ssl etc

9707074
spaces	delimiter
if you want your input to be split not only using white spaces delimiter but also

9707099
width	height
to fix this you can either resize your uiimageview to be the same size as the image or have the same width height ratio as the image if you re scaling down or actually add a border to the image itself

9707185
subtract	add
for the next part of the program i will need to add these new multiplied numbers in the list together then i will use the mod function to get the remainder then subtract the number from 11 any assistance with any of my coding or incorrect statements on how to calculate the isbn would be greatly appreciated

9707202
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i m trying to apply some css3 transitions on some headers in a website i m working on but there s something about transitions on elements that contain text that really bugs me in browsers that apply hinting or grid-fit a font s glyphs which i guess is most of them bar perhaps safari there is a noticable jump at the beginning and end of a transition where you can see that text is snapped back to the pixel grid as demonstrated in this jsfiddle part of this is probably a momentary blur due to filtering but there s definitely some shape modification going on here at least in firefox and google-chrome

9707220
hide	show
you can put all the three registration pages in a single ctp file and just show hide the respective portion of the page once the user is done with filling all the three pages submit the form and save the data in their respective tables but you need to be careful about model field validations

9707273
maven-failsafe-plugin	maven-surefire-plugin
this sounds like a misuse of the maven-surefire-plugin cause you seemed to have some kind of integration-tests which should be done by the maven-failsafe-plugin instead

9707273
maven-failsafe-plugin	maven-surefire-plugin
the maven-surefire-plugin is intended to run unit tests where as the maven-failsafe-plugin is intended to run integration tests

rdf	owl
there is an rdf mapping to owl so you can serialize owl in any of the rdf formats and any standard rdf parser will be able to handle that

9707539
fdt	swc
instead i created a blank project in flash builder 4.6 and then loaded the font swc you created via fdt

9707539
fdt	swc
it seems to me that the issue is not the font swc or fdt but rather related to the air or flex sdk you re using or the instantiation of the font library

9707551
post	get
in order to get this to work in my lisp application i really need to see the content body of my http post i have been able to see the headers using a call like this

9708016
width	height
once it s floated it s not calculated in the width or height of the parent container by default

9708027
getter	setter
most important that if you decide to override default behaviour of such setter or getter you can easly do this without need to change client code because setter-getter calling syntax is same to calling methods

9708544
google-chrome	safari
-webkit-calc currently works in the google-chrome dev build and should be included in the next release of google-chrome and safari

9708558
fadein	fadeout
when you call stop mid-animation on fadein and fadeout there will be a fraction of the opacity still visible

nsnull	nsstring
if you send isnullorempty to an object that s an instance of nsnull your method here which is a method on nsstring will not be called

9709557
nsstring	nsdata
nsstring instances do respond to length but casting the object to nsdata doesn t use the nsdata version of the method -- it still ends up as the nsstring version of length because the object actually is an nsstring casting only happens at compile-time

9709557
nsstring	nsobject
several of the things you are doing would require this to be in a category on nsobject so that the method would in fact be called even if the object was not an nsstring

you would have to detect the mouseover yourself using jquery methods offset width and height for the static element and either cursor position from the event object for drag event or jquery ui s own ui.offset whichever fits your purpose better

9710617
draggable	droppable
another option less elegant but probably easier to implement would be to make your static element a droppable in which case jquery ui lets you handle an event when a draggable hovers over it

after the edit is saved right click on the git repo in your egit git repositories perspective and choose properties you will now see this section of keys has been created or more likely just read from the config file and a remote master to local master git pull will operate as expected going forward

9711056

i didn t actually try adding the keys manually through the property editor nor am i likely to as i know this method works and makes sense since egit is simply calling through to the local git repo

keydown	keyup
just an extra note for everyone using keydown and keyup events to suppress key repeat

9726634

if you do this you need to exclude catching meta keys like alt shift etc otherwise when those keys are held down the actual key you want will not be sent since this is a two key combination and keydown and keyup events catch all keys

getparam will return both get and post values alike

9727394
post	put	post	get	put	get
put or post the template to the server then do a get request passing along the uri of the template i just posted plus the input values - the get response body would have the .odt

if your object will receive subscriptions and unsubscriptions from its children in a threading context which is not compatible with the parent s subscription and unsubscription methods imho iobservable should have required that all legitimate implementations allow subscription and unsubscription from arbitrary threading context but alas it does not you may have no choice but to have the intermediate iobservable immediately upon creation create a proxy object to handle subscriptions on your behalf and have that object subscribe to the parent s event

i am facing the problem that i can not access the folder in the workspace directory since the links to this directory are missing an ending

9740920
src	attr
of course it shouldn t change anything if the href or src attr is on another domain or already absolutely pathed

9740923
capitalization	uppercase
capitalization etc is critical recommend specifying both lower case and uppercase file extensions

9740986
hide	show
you should use the hide and show methods instead of changing the display css attribute

9741024
rmdir	mkdir
as far as file system commands are concerned you can make a directory with mkdir copy is cp move is mv remove file is rm and remove directory is rmdir

9741029
put	get
i am trying to put this css menu together but i couldn t get it working right

9741044
width	height
what i still unable to accomplish is to get width and height of the embed clutterstage

9741054
range	minimum
a progressbar has maximum and minimum properties that are used to define the range of values that it will accept defaulting from 0 to 100

9741064
post	get
api functions are called by get post requests with xml which you can call using the xmlhttp object

9741064
vbscript	vba
again since both the asp and the vba are using the vbscript syntax it could probably be adapted

9741091
min	max
the trick is to use length specifiers min and max for s plus a string filled with your padding character to the maximum potential length

9741139
ubuntu	debian
if that s the case then you just need to install the python-dev package at least that is what it s called on debian and ubuntu

9741159
lsp	principles
i think you have mixed up the direction of lsp liskov substitution principles lsp is strong behavioral subtyping not strong behavioral supertyping

9741223
unsigned	short
wchar_t and gu vs unsigned short _wu

9741249
installation	upgrade
this installation was just upgrade to typo3 4.5

9741305
onresume	onpause
so if you have a progessbar on the ui and you want it to continue updating it you should start your service and bind and undbind it in onresume onpause

9741310
width	height
i notice that your framelayout weight is 0 along with the height and width

9741338
post	get
at this point i am just trying to get the username to post on the next page

9741364
inherited	subclassing
here s an example that inherited from normalize to make a subclassing textnorm which is used to convert a string to a value from 0 to 1

9741375
submit	submission
but if before saving each command i will need to first iterate through the array to check weather the same command already exists and overwrite if it does and that will happen on form submission that means until this matter is sorted out the form will not submit

9741376
post	get
a user clicks on a post that was published on 12th march 2012 for example they get taken to single.php where the content of that post is displayed as normal

9741393
submit	submission
both use the same database where the info is stored which means the forms are always the same so i need a conditional something along the lines of if this page is in an iframe pass form to script on parent for submission else submit form as-is

9741446
google-chrome	firefox
check out tampermonkey it s a google-chrome extension for running user scripts equivalent to greasemonkey for firefox

9741465
nsoperation	nsmanagedobject
otherwise if you mean you have large amount of data that are retrieved as nsmanagedobject probably loaded into a uitableview consider using some kind of nsoperation for asynchronous loading

9741467
width	height
so it makes multiline since curses has fixed width and height and automatically move the buffer to the next line

9741506
submit	submission
you don t need a conditional just use javascript unobtrusively ie if javascript is enabled javascript stops hijacks the form submission sends the form data to parent and closes the iframe - if javascript is not enabled the form submit normally with jquery

9741544
children	parent
if all these elements are children of a container element you can add a single event listener to the parent element to capture all these events

9741549
qmainwindow	qdialog
in my qmainwindow class i have another class named mydialog that inherits from qdialog

9741553
width	height
as a rule of thumb you never want to change the css width height of a canvas

9741553
width	height
you need to set the canvas height and width as attributes and not as css properties

9741571
pascal	delphi
unfortunately it haven t current pascal delphi binding

9741624
int	double	int	chars
it s not an int it s not a float it s not a double it s not a chars it s not a long

9741628
post	get
however when you send a post request instead of a get if you throw an exception on the backend code of course the browser won t render the response text

9741723
nsurlconnection	nsoperationqueue
for my ios app i am writing my own httpclient using nsoperationqueue and executing each operation wrapping nsurlrequest and nsurlconnection on main run loop with nsrunloopcommonmodes so it won t block the ui

9741727
onclick	onchange
and javascript is not needed inside onclick and onchange simply use

9741747
inherited	subclassing
first of all i can t see in your subclassing definition where you specify the inherited

9741766
post	get
recall from my post on cassandra query plans that once rows get to a certain size they include an index of the columns

9741768
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the problem is that it works only on firefox but doesn t on safari nor google-chrome don t ve ie to test on it

9741771
qstring	qfile
i need to convert the path to qstring to pass it to the constructor of qfile however straightforward conversion qstring fromlocal8bit and qfile decodename don t seem to help

9741788
int	double
there is a predefined implicit conversion from short to int long float double or decimal.

9741804
width	height
you load the image resize it first so that it has the minimum side being 150 then you crop to the 150 width height relative to the center

9741808
width	height
array 0 354 1 332 2 2 3 width 354 height 332 bits 8 channels 3 mime image jpeg

9741855
setinterval	settimeout
you don t need setinterval you need settimeout

9741855
setinterval	settimeout
as the name says setinterval fires regularly while settimeout fires only once

9741856
setinterval	settimeout
you have cleartimeout and settimeout so its very similar to setinterval

9741886
ironruby	ironpython
after microsoft takes the thing they want they unpurposely cut down the support for ironruby and ironpython and jim s boss asked him if he want to do anything else other than ruby

9741917
daemon	cron
-the first 5 arguments in the line tell how often or when the cron daemon will execute the 6th argument

9741948
hide	show
you might want to ask yourself why certain rows are hidden visible and if there s a good reason make sure you re tracking facts related to that and using that to hide show elements instead of depending upon some state of elements themselves

9741966
udp	tcp
tcp connections can be hijacked and naked udp literally has ip spoofing written all over its head

9742025
button	checkbox
i did take care to not have double post so that the browser does not warn the user that he s going to post again but then apparently this leads to another issue if i use the back button from chrome then the value of the checkbox aren t correct

9742025
button	checkbox
user goes back to page1 as it was before the checkbox was checked which is exactly the expected behavior for the back button but the checkbox is still checked

9742029
put	get
then i opened one session per host with jsch and simply created a channel for each action a single send would create a channel put the file closed the channel but i encountered the same thing when trying to do it 10 or more at a time i would get connections refused as some channels were still closing when another request came through

9742053
put	get
if you can put the image file into assets folder the code below can be used to get the uri -

9742077
folder	directory
that s because whenever any changes are made in folder being monitored by asp.net there are good blogs on what directory are monitored the application pool is unloaded and reloaded

9742099
post	get
this is an older post but should get you pointed in the right direction

9742123
superclass	subclassing
another possibility is you have created another subclassing of superclass with no constructors and thus c++ is generating an implicit default constructor

9742169
oncreate	onstart
your ui will only be rendered after oncreate and onstart take place

9742200
width	height
so basically you set its size for drawing objects etc via the width and height properties like so

9742218
int	double
i ve tried storing the variable in int double and floats then printing it out and i still get 300

9742238
int	chars
ip will contain the address of the next int either 0x00004002 for a 16-bit int or 0x00004004 for a 32-bit int but cp will contain the address of the next chars 0x00004001

9742239
subtraction	multiplication
one issue is that the order of operations is messing you up multiplication is done before subtraction

9742307
width	height
if you can put exact width and height of the div it s easy to center with out using jquery

9742362
codeigniter	yii
i have worked on codeigniter but yii is far more ahead of that

9742392
rss	feed	rss	icalendar
put together a script that monitors the rss icalendar feed for his calendar and looks for events that are missing the desired tags

9742392

9742478
inject	interceptor
unity allows developers to wire up interceptor to be inject at the class or method level

9742498

cifs	smb
the filesystem i will be using with vfs is either a local file file or cifs smb

9742560
mouse	keyboard
mouse and keyboard events are high on my todo list though i will update this question when they have been added

9742562
g++	gcc
whether g++ should accept the code or not with a few changes it would be valid c valid c++ acceptable to both gcc and g++ and better style

9742599
hash	salt
therefore you should not hash the password on the client side but concatenate it with a some arbitrary string selected on the server side usually called a salt and hash the result

9742608
g++	gcc
mingw gcc g++

9742654
express	node.js
so there are two heroku apps the rails web app and the node.js express web app

9742721
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
this is working in google-chrome firefox safari opera although a little more clunky safari ipad android phone

9742765
int	chars
consider the test cases - there are 2 chars 8 and 7 and they both form the int 87 that you should be returning

9742765
int	chars
this is somewhat pedantic but the int value of the chars 0 isn t necessarily less than the value of 1 2 etc

9742777
post	get
what i ve understood by reading some other post that you can somehow get the result by dividing by 10 but i didn t really understand it so if anyone could point me in the right direction i d be glad

9742801
notepad++	jedit
to clarify i m not doing any transformations with this expression i m just plugging it into an xpath expression evaluator such as in notepad++ or jedit - via plugins to help debug subtle data errors in very large xml files

works very well in our case with any scanner working as an hid emulation keyboard and where we can configure the preamble

9742892
setinterval	settimeout
if dowork is already running it s either a blocking all other js code and you have no choice but to let it finish since you have no way to execute any interruption code until it finishes on its own or b dowork is scheduled to fire off on an interval via settimeout or setinterval

9742892
setinterval	settimeout
if it s the latter case settimeout and setinterval return an id

9742909
hash	salt
i ve created a basic user provider and have it working perfectly when using a sha1 hash however i m completely stuck don t understand how to get it working with salt

9742930
children	parent
if the automatic deserialization doesn t work you could have your parent class implement the ideserializationcallback interface and update the children in the ondeserialization method

9742940
punctuation	words
frequently if you start with a string of tokens you need to preprocess them for example remove punctuation or special symbols remove words that are not relevant stemming etc

9742940
punctuation	words
but maybe you can use some symbols say punctuation between cities and countries - melbourne australia so you assign that set of useful punctuation symbols to other symbol # and use that as a context so the next time you find an unknown words next to a comma next to a known country you can use that knowledge to assume that the unknown words is a city

9742962
jboss	glassfish
if i compile my app against jetty can i still deploy the app under tomcat or any of the ee servers glassfish jboss etc...

9742965
post	get
after the first comment i d like to point out that every submit leads to a post redirect get and take the user to a new page

9742965
button	checkbox
and then if he clicks on the back button he sees his previous page as it was before its checkbox was checked

9742965
button	checkbox
this way if the user clicks on the back button he s taken not to the final state the checkbox was in but to the original state

9742965
post	get
it s really just simply post get and submit when the user clicks a checkbox

9742967

9742967
put	get
it does what i want it to do haven t put it in a function yet but i ll get there

9742968
mbunit	nunit
what i ended up discovering is that out of the box nunit offered more options and plug-ins such as pnunit for parallel testing and another plug-in for performance testing where xunit mbunit lacked all or some of these features

9742968
versioning	upgrade
where as with xunit i would have to modify the source and thus it would make it a major pain point to upgrade my versioning if xunit released something cool later on

9742992
put	get
if you have threads that routinely take 20 minutes to do something but want to be notified if it takes longer than 25 minutes then have to increase the stuck thread limit to 25 minutes and get the notification at that point then you must put this limit from 600 seconds to 1500 seconds 25 60

9743018
min	max
and your graph will be rendered correctly with or without the min and max definitions

9743020

int	double
edit i will also add that the real bean for our project contains about 100 int double and those can change over time as business requirements change

9743125

9743238
profiler	gprof
here are 2 options either use profiler again to compare results of incremental and unity builds but this time you need a sampling profiler like oprofile while an instrumenting profiler like gprof most likely is too heavy for this task

9743249
inline	inlining
one such optimization is inlining the compiler can only inline a function if it knows its implementation at compile time

9743270
post	get
i added setusername and setpassword to the request and i was able to get the nsstring information to post and save to my database successfully but the image didn t share the same fate

9743315
children	parent
i m having a devil of a time with unwrap and parent and children

9743331
java.util.date	simpledateformat
my guess is that you ve got an import for java.util.date or some other date type whereas simpledateformat parses to a java.util.date

9743335
stdout	stderr
you should also replace with which is the correct way to send stderr to the same place as stdout

9743367

9743435
post	get
what i need is the genus and species for each species profile i have in the post table so that i get a list like

9743472
width	height
this though gets ugly when you want to write anything or read anything as to write width or height you d have to

9743483
serializable	deserialization
this is done by implementing the ixmlserializable interface and handling serializable and deserialization

9743497
stdout	stderr
to get stderr you should specify or to redirect it to stdout

9743498

9743603
equals	compareto
the problem is about inconsistency of your equals and compareto methods

9743603
treemap	treeset	equals	compareto
the compareto must return 0 if and only if equals returns true as far as i remember treemap or treeset does not invoke the equals method it just uses compareto and its result to indicate duplicate keys

9743625
dwoo	smarty
and the view file is responsible for displaying the data - you can use template engine such as smarty or dwoo to help with that

hash	md5
if you want a method that is less prone to having a possible non-unique id name then you can wrap your path in md5 php to create a md5 hash

9743743
width	height
best practice for ios i ve found is to change the height of the div based on the width of the viewport or to use percentage based layouts so that when the viewport changes the layout can adjust

9743807
int	chars
therefore i m wondering if there is a hashing function that i can use to return a 32bit or 64bit number of a short string about 5 - 40 chars so that i can compare by int instead of by string

hash	md5
or just truncate a crypto hash such as md5 or sha1 to the desired length

9743990
hash	hmac
if a malicious person can choose the strings breaking your program by deliberately creating collisions you should at least switch to a keyed hash such as hmac

9744008
cpu	processors
you would need to first identify a specific processors it would run on and also an environment raw cpu some operating system something else

9744012
inherited	properties
prototype methods properties are only inherited when an instance of the constructor is created via the new keyword

9744034
width	height
first set the height and and width 810px of your page in the css added overflow hidden then set them again in the first line of code here and replace the opening body tag with this

9744131
width	height
also they must both have an explicit width and height

9744148

9744170
innodb	myisam
innodb is a transactional database engine while myisam is not

9744227
prng	random
in general in haskell you approach random number generation by either pulling some randomness from the io monad or by maintaining a prng that is initialized with some integer seed hard-coded or pulled from io gspr s comment is excellent

9744252
width	height
you need some code to tell your code where to start drawing the rectangle the start x y coordinate and then you can have parameters denoting the height and width of the rectangle which will be used to calculate the coordinates of the rectangle s corners and passed to the shape object to be drawn in the same way the series of connected lines were drawn

9744253
folder	dir
basically do a dir call on the folder then wrap everything you ve done in a function with a single file argument

9744278
width	height
add a height and width to the css for your buttons

9744357
innodb	myisam
the difference is most likely due to configuration of innodb which takes a bit more tweaking than myisam

9744357
innodb	myisam
myisam might be quicker in this instance but when you have 100 concurrent connections all reading and modifying this table at the same time you ll find a well-tuned innodb will win and myisam will choke on table locks

9744382
pop-up	dialog
i m in the middle of modifying a test message application and one of the features that i d like to add to it would be that when a text message is received a dialog box of some sort would pop-up with the text message stuff and the ability to quickly reply to it all without having to go into the actual application

9744835
jxtable	jtable
jxtable extends jtable so it s done the same way

9744858

put	get
for the table i could use fixed cells where the notes get put in addchild innerhtml when they have to be showed but there won t be any smooth scrolling because it could only scroll by grid size not a really big issue if it s fast enough and would also require more re-rendering than a static table

9746615
elf	coff
you not only have to know the opcodes machine code for the instruction set but need to know the binary file formats for the operating system coff elf exe etc and would need to hand code all of that information much better suited to have your machine code assembler create that header for you if needed

9746615
hex	binary
the binary file format is an ascii file with the machine code in readable hex

9746632

9746923
int	double
java float and double use sign bit to represent negative positive values as opposed to two s complement representation for int

9746923
minimum	max
therefore you don t need to define an actual mathematical minimum constant for floats because you can just use the positive max constant to figure out the what the negative bound is

9746923
min	max
for integers you need 2 different constants defining max min because of the way they represented in binary -max

9746945

9747678
hide	show
on focus it hide and on blur is show again if there s no text

9747697
put	get
it s probably handy to put any repeated logic in a function and call those when handling the get in php with any extra search variables

9747767
mouse	joystick
there are programs such as joytokey that allowed the user to map button inputs on any joystick to any key event and mouse event

9747767
mouse	keyboard	mouse	joystick	joystick	keyboard
so the thing is this in java application if we want to listen to any keyboard or mouse input we can easily to do that with the keylistener and mouselistener classes but what i am talking here is if i want to create a java application that listens to all of the user s specified inputs be it from joystick touch screen or whatever regardless of which application has focus at the time and map these inputs to other inputs and macro

9747767
joystick	keyboard
for instance if i want to perform hadoken in street fighter i tell the program hey if i press p or joystick 1 button 10 invoke the following keyboard events respectively down arrow in the first 1 60 millisecond down+right arrow in the next 1 60 millisecond right arrow in the next 1 60 millisecond and finally z in the next 1 60 millisecond

9748534
google-chrome	firefox
now google-chrome firefox supports changing url without page refresh

9748535

so being the experimental type i thought i would create a simple project that would scan a file directory every couple of seconds to see if i have a new file pick that file up and then copy it to another folder

9748594
for-loop	arrays
it s because you re nesting a for-loop inside each so the results of the for-loop run as many times as the each loop...you don t need the for-loop though a simple arrays and and each will work

9748597
debian	linux
i have googled using multiple keywords however all results that i got seemed to be tilted towards the linux debian world

kohana	yii	codeigniter	kohana	codeigniter	yii
there are a whole host of frameworks out there codeigniter yii kohana zend symfony2 kohana etc

9748720
int	double
alternatively you could track the nesting level with an int increase each time you start reading a new tlv decrease it when it finds a double zero

9748725
qsharedpointer	qpointer
for that reason i would recommend to use qsharedpointer instead of qpointer or even raw pointer

9748778
for-loop	arrays
or use for-loop to copy all elements from both variables into a new arrays

9748880
versioning	upgrade
if it doesn t work upgrade to bitbucket versioning

9748896
oncreate	getwritabledatabase
edit extending my answer to be more complete using slukian observation you should not call getwritabledatabase or getreadabledatabase from within the oncreate or onupgrade methods

9748905
int	chars
int chars float etc. are simple primitives

9748922

maven	buildr
i would look into using a build tool like maven gradle or buildr

9749102
jar	war
using sub-modules you can for example create two war modules and put the shared resources in a shared jar

9749102
maven	buildr
intellij has first class support for maven not sure about buildr and gradle so you just point the ide to the root-pom.xml and it automatically creates the correct configuration for you

9749119
int	double
whenever you downcast a long to an int or a double to a float the possibility for data loss exists

9749133

interpreted-language	compiled-language
it s not that rails doesn t scale but rather requests for live data in ruby or any interpreted-language do not scale as they are comparatively far more expensive both in terms of cpu memory utilization than their compiled-language counterparts

9749305
interpreted-language	compiled-language
of course rails tends to be on the innovation forefront so the 99 non-twitter level trafficked applications of the world can get by just fine with an interpreted-language although i m now solidly on the compiled-language side of the fence scala is just too good

9750208
post	get
since you have no control over over the form that sends the data to your php script and thus can t change it to ensure that the later checkboxes with the same name do not overwrite the earlier ones you ll have to get access to and process the raw post data itself

9750208

html forms only submit checkbox or radio button that have been checked

9752899
requestfactory	gwt
it can be a little messy to get the server to read from itself and print out data using requestfactory - here is a demo example of how this can work using gwt 2.4 the main branch has the same thing for 2.3 or so - not quite the same thing that you are after but it may be possible to use this same idea to populate a string in a proxy store that can be read in the client seen here

9752907
google-chrome	firefox
for now though the bug is still open and it seems like your hackish solution is the only solution for google-chrome however a the solution for google-chrome doesn t need settimeout and b it seems like firefox might respect the

client-side	server-side
you want to do client-side validation which is nice-to-have but not as required as server-side validation which you can only do on the server

9752937
google-chrome	firefox
web page developer tools like those in google-chrome firefox and ie make it a cinch to change attributes of a form

9752937
post	get
a user can send post or get data directly to the action url without going through your page

9752937
client-side	server-side
users can turn off client-side javascript but they can t turn off php server-side validation

9752937
post	get
for instance i personally have contributed to one such library that does a good job of evaluating fields in either a post or get type form

9752937
client-side	server-side
you should view client-side validation as a way to inform the user that there is a problem with their form input without reloading but always use server-side validation to actually look at the input for problems

9752948
client-side	server-side
i read about commonjs but this is on the server-side and here we are talking client-side

hash	md5
md5 was designed to be hash which is one way only otherwise it would not be a hash

9753089
salt	md5	hash	salt	hash	md5
by the way in order to increase the security of your database you should salt the password hash as just md5 hashing the password text makes it easy for somebody with the hash to get the passwords using a rainbow table

9753096
sudoers	visudo
once logged in on the remote server you can use sudo you have to configure etc sudoers file first with the visudo command to execute commands by another user

9753096

seriously in your requirements context i would compare alfresco share with liferay

9753372
punctuation	words
i.e. move every words and punctuation mark into a seperate token element

9753390
min	max	tax	shipping
you could substitute max or avg for min and still get the same result since the tax shipping and discount are a constant for a given order

9753399
for-loop	arrays
in your code you don t assign any value to arrays in the for-loop

postorder	inorder	preorder	postorder	preorder	inorder
assume the binary expression tree and how the inorder preorder and postorder traversals act on it

9753447
preorder	inorder
as we know the first element of preorder array is our root and we could find our corresponding root in inorder array

9753503
noexcept	throw
after the edit your implementation of operator- is guaranteed not to throw any exception well at least if you mark as noexcept that is and it is thus safe to mark it as noexcept

9753503
noexcept	throw
now depending on the implementation of and the copy-constructor it might actually never throw but that does not make it noexcept

9753503
noexcept	throw
as of the copy-constructor if you don t define it the implicitly declared copy constructor will be noexcept or not depending on whether all the members of your type are noexcept again not only that they don t throw but that they have that qualification

9753538
portrait	landscape
apple s view controller programming guide has a section on using separate view controllers for portrait and landscape

9753547
children	parent
you essentially have a hierarchy of people parent that contain other people children and grand children so you could use a recursive function to traverse the children of a person object

9753684
folder	directory
name it and save it anywhere you like though putting it in a parent folder to both project directory might be a good idea

9753695
setcontentview	findviewbyid
you need to call setcontentview before findviewbyid

9753737
vbo	vao
the only thing i m not sure about is how to make sure that vbo is associated as vertex location data with the vao and that the vao is actually correctly bound when i call the draw function

9753738
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade to highchart versioning 2.2.1 form the previous 2.1.7 that i was using before and the graphs are rendering ok

9753774
division	multiplication
remember that if there are any matrixs at all and you don t want to do matrix multiplication division use the . and .

9753785
maven	m2e
the most important thing in that case is don t use eclipse eclipse anymore use the m2e plugin instead in relationship with maven

9753806
int	chars
i ll do that by switching to a dictionary containing each string s hashcode value int instead of the actual chars

9753808
pop-up	dialog
it seems like a lot of work though and i think you would be better off just using a dialog box once and then making sure it does not pop-up again after someone has clicked on it through a stored preference

9753836
ssl	https
probably your configuration is ssl enabled but you have not generated the private certificate for https

9753843

it should suffice to turn the chars into the int it represents by using int

9754000
hide	show
i have this sample notification script that show hide notifications and delete the field whenever the notification is clicked

9754017
folder	directory
you need to check your project settings under c++ check include directory and make sure it points to where gameengine.h resides the other issue could be that gameengine.h is not in your source file folder or in any include directory and resides in a different folder relative to your project folder

9754021
int	chars
1 convert the first chars to int so that you can compare them properly

9754024

httprequest	httpresponse
furthermore i d like to have acces to the httprequest and optionally the httpresponse

9754071
put	get
i ve never done it myself but at least in theory you should be able to put in the tz code there and it should get translated into a tzinfo embedded in the datetime time object

9754127
post	get
after a little wrestling and a stupid mistake i was able to get the post routine below working to post and image along with a username

9754133

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox

i have a spring mvc application which has a public front-end war an admin front-end war and a shared services jar

9754180

afaik you can show hide stuff using css properties through js

9754204

what i want to do is to get the total number of comments from dynamic pages post and insert that number to a mysql table so i can filter the post of those pages according to the total comments number and display each post s comment number in the forontapage sidebars etc

9754254
backbone.js	zepto
backbone.js isn t a replacement for jquery it still uses jquery or zepto out of the box to do ajax dom stuff anyway

9754274
bluetooth	usb
on the other hand a usb connection is far more reliable better supported and of course has the inherent advantage of speed and since it is well supported does not suffer from all the pitfalls bluetooth connectivity does

9754274
bluetooth	usb
if you are on a budget and can do with a hardwired connection i highly recommend usb over bluetooth

9754292
gif	png
suppose i have external url not from my website and i want to verify it to make sure this url is one from these files - jpg jpeg gif png and also is a correct image file not any script file or php

9754322
express	node.js
i m messing around with node.js for the first time and decided to create a simple application using express

9754322

super	extends
i know what extends and super mean in generics

9754443
super	extends
pecs - producer extends consumer super

9754443
super	extends
the lack of extends and super means you can do both for the exact type specified

9754446
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this whole feature is working great in google-chrome firefox and safari

9754469
nsorderedset	nsset
you need to create a one-to-many relationship which makes a nsset of destination objects or if you want to keep them in the specified order click ordered and it will be a nsorderedset

9754470
int	double
at least right off my immediate guess is that you d be doing a fair amount of extra work for fairly minimal savings just storing the final bytes of the million int obviously occupies 1 megabyte and three levels of table leading to that would clearly occupy a fair amount more so you d double the number of levels to save something like half a megabyte

9754495
cgpoint	cgrect
for changing the values you might try to create a cgpoint or cgrect from the string then changing it and finally converting it back to a string

9754592
hide	show
you can use this block to add remove show or hide subviews of the specified view

9754620
width	height
for instance a box that has a length a width and a height

9754713
google-chrome	firefox
everyone who has firebug installed in firefox or just has the google-chrome dev tools open already has what you re asking for though perhaps in not as noob-friendly a fashion

9754733
gson	jackson
i already have a gson custom provider and reader and will now create a modified version for jackson

9754733
gson	jackson
i know if i created a json wrapper object i could code to an interface and using spring to swap implementations easily jackson imp vs gson imp but this would mean i wouldnt be doing it the jax rs way

9754734
folder	directory
create a folder called system-images in the top level of your sdk directory next to platforms and tools

9754734
folder	directory
extract the complete armeabi-v7a folder to these directory

9754744
hide	show
so instead of using .show hide i now hide and show the content by setting the height of the sections to 100 0

9754765
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
it is supported in firefox google-chrome v8 and partially supported in opera 9+ and safari

9754767
post	get
so now i can be sure that my server accepts post get options if response headers work like i expect

9754773
pop-up	dialog
my problem is that a button which opens up a jqueryui dialog works before i search for anything but won t pop-up after i search

9754781
post	get
same code with post method works ok however this particular script requires get parameters

9754785
qapplication	qcoreapplication
however since there were some qt uis that used the same dlls we couldn t always call qcoreapplication in case the ui had already called qapplication

9754809
centos	linux
i m using linux centos 5.4 i installed mongodb now it s availabled as a daemon and service

9754838

9754907

9754944
int	double
this rule ensures that making a method that extends double does not also extend int

9754959
int	chars
i also tried using an array and converting the array to an int or chars but i have no way of knowing how many digits each value is

9754988
integer	unsigned
incompatible pointer to integer conversion sending nsnumber __strong to parameter of type unsigned long long

9755003
put	get
i was going to use any answers given and put it in a while loop so i can get all the possible combinations of a string while swapping two characters at a time

9755030
google-chrome	firefox
works fine for me with that image and the following code in the latest firefox and google-chrome beta on mac

9755039
width	height
if the program has read the header it has the values of width and height for the image data

9755051
leiningen	counterclockwise
the easiest way to get it done in a structural way is using leiningen in combination with the leiningen counterclockwise plugin

9755051
leiningen	counterclockwise
then call lein plugin install lein-ccw 1.2.0 to install the leiningen counterclockwise plugin

9755058
stdout	fflush
if you call fflush stdout before you call _exit you should get your output

9755058
stdout	fflush
the reason exit works is because that function is guaranteed to close and fflush any open streams such as stdout before calling _exit itself to actually terminate the program

9755062
stdout	fflush
the runtime will register such handlers to be run on exit that fflush open file such as stdout

9755062
stdout	fflush
you should see output if you call fflush stdout after the printf call or if you just run the program in a consol without piping the output to another program - in which case stdout will normally be line buffered so stdout is fflush whenever you write a n

9755070
stdout	fflush
so unless you ve fflush stdout it may get discarded

9755120
uilabel	uibutton
because uilabel is not intended to be added to uitoolbar i ve gone down the path of creating a plain uibutton and doing setenabled no to prevent the glow effect from appearing when tapping it

9755178
put	get
you have complexity of o countids countmaps if you put all maps into 2 dictionaries indexed by source and destination you ll get o countids + countmaps

9755185
rspec	minitest
i recently switched a very simple rails app from rspec to minitest

9755245
ember.js	backbone.js
ember.js would make things even simpler than backbone.js

9755276
width	height
adding width and height dimensions to that are half of image s real pixel size is a good way to serve high dpi images although it is going to waste some bandwidth on regular-dpi screens

9755302
folder	directory
in my home directory creating folder like bin local lib and python was looking for its packages there where there were none

9755314
post	put
basically put the contents of your search in a dictionary make a post call to the server and read your response

9755341
hide	show
the user ggg has kindly gave me an example of how to show and hide stuff using css itâ s here

9755341
hide	show
the stuff that show hide has a css class and itâ s not adjacent to the checkbox example

9755358
redhat	fedora
for rpm support is listed for redhat centos which seems to imply it would also work on newer fedora releases

9755374
google-chrome	firefox
on google-chrome all the top links work where as on firefox they don t do anything

9755384
onresume	onpause
at second onresume after onpause hit the home button then reaccess the app the black screen occurs

9755397
scikit-learn	libsvm
i recommend libsvm for this and the scikit-learn implementation is easy to use for this in python

9755485
google-chrome	safari
ie google-chrome and safari do not append the loading image

9755488
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
html and html5 is supported on all major browsers internet explorer firefox opera google-chrome and safari

9755501
portrait	landscape
as has been mentioned it is possible to specify that you want to handle configuration changes such as orientation yourself or even force only one landscape or portrait

9755501
portrait	landscape
some layouts may work fine in portrait but not in landscape or vice versa and the aim of the designed approach to destroy recreate the current visible activity is meant to accommodate that

9755623
gentoo	linux
i m using gentoo linux and issuing the following command to compile

9755641
post	get
i ve been unable to get a model to post to the next view no matter what i try

9755753
int	double
under the hood it only has storage types 64-bit int sqlite_integer 64-bit float double sqlite_float blob binary sqlite_blob and string sqlite_text

9755756
ubuntu	linux
i am using eclipse on an ubuntu linux server

9755761
setinterval	settimeout
i would recommend using setinterval instead of settimeout

9755768
put	get
if you have n items to put into the heap then yes each insert is lg n and there are n items so you get n lg n as u stated

9755785
for-loop	loops
instead of a for-loop i m using a construct called a named let which permits the initialization of some iteration variables i in this case initialized to 0 and the repeated execution of a recursive procedure loops in this case producing an effect similar to a for even in performance

9755786
children	parent
in this case it is #select1 i dont want to manually travel through the dom with prev parent children etc. because my form structure can change in the future like add fieldset td tr etc.

9755788
jar	war
either in the war jar ear lib or in some server lib

9755815
stdout	fflush
and then you need to force it to refresh and force the output to stdout with fflush stdout before sleeping

9755827
hide	show
build the form2 ahead of time and use setvisible true to show it and and setvisible false to hide it

9755871
lxml	beautifulsoup
but really you should avoid using regex for parsing html use beautifulsoup or lxml instead

9755874
calloc	malloc
but after some reading i see a lot of people allocating the memory directly without calloc or malloc like this

9755894
width	text-align
the has text-align center so the will be centred if the size of the is less than the width of the

9755905
expression-blend	silverlight
now i know all of that can be done in silverlight w xaml and expression-blend

9755906
intersect	contains
the rectangle class has the methods intersect and contains

9755929
calloc	malloc
a good rule of thumb about when to allocate memory on the heap via malloc calloc is if you need to use it outside of the function

9755965
post	get
when attempting to post a new gist i get the following error

9755972
folder	directory
changed directory to the src folder in the source code

9756011
hide	show
i have this code that should show and hide element outputs according to specific checkboxes

9756016
google-chrome	firefox
the photo slideshow can t display on google-chrome but it looks perfect on firefox

9756016
google-chrome	firefox
and by the way the favicon can t show in google-chrome either but successfully in firefox

9756077
put	get
given the basicness of these coding errors i suggest you improve your coding skills before attempting to put something onto a public-facing webserver or you re likely to get your site pwn3d in short order

9756094
vim	emacs	macvim	emacs
i just made the switch to vim from emacs using macvim with janus

9756143
client-side	server-side
if you need precise values for these dates for instance to properly order when this or that action was done relative to another user s action you can t rely on the client-side date library anyways and you need to calculate the dates server-side based on when the client contacted you

9756143
client-side	server-side
remember as well that basically all of your client-side code can be modified by the client and malicious values returned instead you can only guarantee the code on the server-side -- treat the client-side like a possible attacker

9756200
getter	setter
every example i have seen regarding object serialization includes an all field constructor and a getter and setter method for every field

9756222
getter	setter
there are no requirements for the existence of getter setter or constructors of a certain form though there may be other legitimate reasons to want those

9756225
google-chrome	firefox
tested in both google-chrome and firefox with identical behavior

9756232
getter	setter
the constructor getter setter are not mandatory

9756340
viewdidload	viewwillappear
in my project sometimes i set in - void viewdidload sometimes i set in - void viewwillappear bool animated

9756343
mouse	keyboard
and i would like to not have to touch the mouse at all nor the keyboard so i would like to have the playback started as soon as the page appears

9756361
spine.js	sproutcore
good like - spine.js knockout.js sproutcore etc etc.

9756366
post	get
what need to be pass in post_type to get data from books regular post

9756398
tcpdf	fpdi
afaik this is not possible with pure tcpdf - you can combine it with fpdi v 1.2.1 and up

9756398
fpdf	fpdi
fpdf together with fpdi

9756411
google-chrome	firefox
it is okay if the solution only works on google-chrome and firefox

9756488
range	median
mean median mode range - java

9756511
realloc	malloc
an alternative version would use malloc for the initial allocation and realloc thereafter

9756547
put	get
i ll create a webservice to handle with database on host and use some cross-platform framework to building an app then connect to webservice in order to get and put data to server

9756590
hash	salt
they can t be sequential ids and make sure that they re not trivially forgeable even if someone has a bunch of different ids for example you might want to salt the username and then hash it

9756613
google-chrome	firefox
while the html file displays correctly in dev mode when i actually try to run it directly from the war directory a blank screen is shown in ie firefox and google-chrome

9756622
coalesce	isnull
use full join clause and check on null using any available function in your dbms like isnull or coalesce

9756624
union	distinct
actually i need the distinct values from multiple union statements but i do not getting this

9756632
int	chars
also you are writing sizeof a or 100 int into fp2 for every chars

9756664
width	height
so if you wanted km pixel near the middle of the view for instance you could take the width and height of the plugin divide them by two then offset in each direction by 10 pixels do the hittest query find the distance between the returned coordinates then finally divide by 10

9756693
comparator	comparable
further more if you want to sort your own objects collection provide the facility to sort them using comparable and comparator

9756755
for-loop	arrays
second thing is if you widen your i scope by declaring this outside the for-loop you still not get all the arrays element because you are not looping each of element

9756758
stdout	fflush
print something in . foo doesn t fflush its stdout buffer if it is redirected to the pipe in this case when stdout is not connected a tty-like device to an interactive console

spaces	linefeed
however if you re generating the value of an attribute this assigned value will be normalized by the dom as soon as it will be set so all whitespaces spaces tab cr linefeed will be compressed stripping leading and trailing whitespaces and reducing all middle sequences of whitespaces into a single spaces

9756789
spaces	linefeed
note that this trick will not work to preserve other whitespaces spaces tab linefeed even if they are represented by ncr because the normalization of all whitespaces with the exception of the ncr to cr is mandatory in all attributes

9756789
gif	png
such non-plain text strings would also be the result of reading from a binary file such as an png gif or jpeg image file or from your javascript reading from a binary-safe network socket such that the io stream passes 16-bit code units rather than just 8-bit units most binary i o streams are byte-based anyway and text i o streams need that you specify a charset to decode files into plain-text so that invalid encodings found in the text stream will throw an i o exception in your script

9756793
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
make sure your for-loop is actually a fast enumeration loops rather than using the count of the arrays as a loops integer

9756891
saga	cqrs
just google cqrs saga and go from there

9756900
min	max
but i m not fully satisfied because on different devices there are different constants like types of events min and max values etc. and i ll have to either parse them from getevent -p or specify a configuration file

9757077
equals	compareto
note that it is not required if two classes are equals according to the compareto they don t have to hold equals

9757077
equals	compareto
however in this particular case you might want to add secondary attributes to comparator if ages are equals so sorting is always stable and predictable across same-aged people so after all including the same attributes in compareto might be a good idea in some cases

9757085
put	get
to test and validate this you could create a bean and mark it as lazy initialization and another bean with no lazy initialization default eager put the log statement in both of them s constructor the beaneager s constructor would get invoked as soon as contextt gets loaded but beanlazy s constructor would get invoked only when you try to actually fetch that bean from context

9757088
client-side	server-side
we use mustache and use the same templates for rendering in php server-side and javascript client-side

9757091
firefox	safari
so even firefox or safari web browsers can consume these applications

9757103
apache	nginx
i noticed that the problem seems to stem from the fact that the php script gets only one parameter src into the array with nginx but with apache rewrite it s broken down to different parameters.

9757109

post	get
redirects are get not post

9757296

you can get all post of a group using fql for example here are all of the messages posted in a group feed

9757384
portrait	landscape
i have taken gccalendar which only works in portrait orientation and extended it to work in landscape similar to how the iphone s calendar app works

9757384
portrait	landscape
so when the phone is in portrait orientation the cgcalendar is instantiated from the apps main view controller using the original portrait view class and when in landscape orientation using the new modified landscape view class

9757390
portrait	landscape
so far i m able to apply the effect when from portrait go to landscape but not viceversa

9757390
portrait	landscape
in this way i have the desired effect when passing from portrait to landscape but when i put the device back to portrait it doesn t load the portraitview the landscapeview remains on

9757672
button	checkbox
this is a really tough problem as far as i know and i don t know that much changing the checkbox from the button will not fire its change event but since you re using a function you can just change the attribute then fire the redraw function

9757672
button	checkbox
you could modify this a little and have a button for each checkbox if you wanted

9757708
jar	manifest.mf
an option may be to declare jar file dependencies in meta-inf manifest.mf file thanks to the class-path attribute

9757716
apache	nginx
you can hook it up behind nginx or apache so they would do the static file exchange but since you want to use websockets then it shouldnt be good idea

9757733
hide	show
to have better performance with many hidden columns i would recommend you to call showcol or hidecol inside of beforeprocessing and hide show the columns on the empty grid

int	chars
i am writing a code which uses templates to support int datatype and chars datatype

9758123
onchange	onkeyup
you need to use a key event either onkeypress or onkeyup in combination with the onchange event

9758131
keydown	keyup
i believe the correct event you need to bind to is the keydown event as shown at or perhaps keyup depending on the behaviour you need

9758151
bmp	png
i want to get as string the image extension for example jpg png bmp ecc. of the images loaded from the gallery or picked from the camera

9758239
onchange	onkeyup
you should try the onkeyup method because onchange only fires when your textbox loses focus and in the case that someone pastes something into you textbox your should try the onpaste method this combination should work fine

9758277
src	attr
var the_image_src this attr src

9758333

in python floor and ceil round to the next higher or lower integer

9758596
versioning	upgrade
if you re absolutely reliant on the .net 1.1 versioning of random then the only thing i can think of is to create a new assembly that targets 1.1 and call that from your upgrade .net 4 application

9758638
keydown	keyup
if you want the background to change only while the key is down you need to set it on keydown and set it back on keyup

9758638
keydown	keyup
note that keydown and keyup return key codes not character codes but as far as the alphabet keys go it is safe to treat them as if they were character codes for the uppercase letters

9758688
wtl	atl
if you re interested in more modern c++ frameworks for windows consider using wtl and atl instead of mfc

9758691
button	checkbox
i have had this problem before with other things that checkbox also different types of jquery mobile button won t appear as they should when added by javascript

9758712
int	chars
the chars value passed to printf is extended to an int before the call to printf

9758712
int	chars	unsigned	short
int so chars short unsigned chars unsigned short are converted to int

9758712
int	chars
it never passes a chars unsigned chars signed chars as a single byte it always passes an int

9758712
int	chars
the chars value is interpreted by my mac s gcc compiler as signed chars so the compiler generates code to sign extended the chars to the int before the printf call

9758712
int	chars
where the signed chars value has its top sign bit set x80 the conversion to int sign extends the chars value

9758712
int	chars
where the signed chars value has its top sign bit clear x70 the conversion to int still sign extends the chars value

9758712
int	chars
but it is printing the entire int it happens that the value is 0x00000070 and 0x00000080 because the unsigned chars values were converted to

9758712
int	chars
you can force printf to only print the low byte of the int by using suitable formatting hhx so this correctly prints only the value in the original chars

9758712
int	chars
because printf interprets the hhx to treat the int as an unsigned chars

9758712
int	chars
this does not change the fact that the chars was sign extended to an int before printf was called

9758751
hide	show
if user already logined in facebook then i have to hide name section in my add comment form if not it need to show name and comment fields

9758819
spaces	delimiter
since the original string already contains those spaces delimiter try

9759381
getter	setter
but spring batch classes are programmed in a way they can be easily integrated into spring and thus they have setter getter for parts that can be tuned

9759385
stdio	fflush
on the other hand stdio is usually buffered meaning that if you use stdio the functions from stdio to access a file data may be read from the underlying file descriptor and buffered in your process s memory space where other processes cannot see it before you actually intend to read and use it or data you have written might remain buffered in your process s memory space where other processes cannot see it long after you wrote it unless you call fflush

pull	push
if you want to avoid this in the future then you should commit and push your changes when you know that you re going to switch computers and then pull and update on the other computer before you start work on it although there s no problem not doing it other than the fact that you won t have changes that you might need when you switch computers

9759518
post	get
as you probably know doget and dopost are called in different situations when the browser or http client executes a get or post http request respectively

9759625

9759749
touchesbegan	touchesended
use touchesbegan withevent and touchesended withevent

9759749
touchesbegan	touchesended
in touchesbegan method store your starting point and in touchesended store your end point and there you have it -- draw a line between these points

9759771
width	height
the wrapped div should have its height adjusted to that of the window and the width about 50px more that way it s scrollbar would be hidden from view but you would still be able to scroll up and down

9759888

9759985
put	get
if i put the entire cms into a folder i get a 404

9760053

now you could iterate through the objects to find current limits 9min and max or you could even do it while you calculate the measures each time sth smaller than min happens store new min etc

9760131
int	chars
when declared as chars airport is passed as an int to scanf that is why the first message mentions int

9760143

9760316
listview	gridview
thanks for the help turns out the issue is not in the listview loading the data but rather the gridview taking too long to register the click see topic 5197438 now i gotta figure out a way around it.

int	boolean
note if you call setstreammute int boolean to mute the stream n times you must call it n times again to unmute use false

9760567
memcpy	strcpy
but sometimes memcpy performs faster than strcpy because it moves blocks of memory at a time which allows it to perform some optimization i will not go into details here

9760612
jar	war
this will give you a direct inputstream reference rather than a url and will work for resources packed inside a jar war

9760619

also you need to setcontentview before you can use findviewbyid

9761055
width	margin
the order of the divs doesn t matter as colwr has a width of 100 which means anything floated after it will appear on a new line anyway if the left column came first it would force the colwr column on to a new line and it would have to be given a negative margin

9761093
hide	show
i needed to show hide one of two buttons exclusively

9764148
capistrano	rvm
this all sound very hard but in practice for us at least creating a user account that was the one that apps ran as and installing rvm as that user with a little other setup made it all just work especially for cases where you re running rake bundle capistrano and other stuff

9764179
hide	show
the user may toggle the sidebar via an item at the main menu show sidebar hide sidebar

9764179

9764265
google-chrome	firefox
this made ie7 and ie8 look like ie9 google-chrome and firefox for me

9764284

getter	setter	mutators	getter	mutators	setter
using getter setter aka accessors and mutators enough to care about chaining them hints that your code has design problems though

9764534
width	height
you can set the li width and height

9764559
mutators	setter
one solution might be abandoning all setter mutators methods those could change the particular fields of the object and encapsulating them in a way that you can only access them not change them

9764585
children	parent
if a parent has no children then the cte should return an empty table

9764874
stdout	stderr
stderr output from some called program is not redirected into the caller s stdout

9764884
put	get
it s over 6 i m assuming a 3 segment implementation because you have to get the center of the segment and 3 would put it on the lines

prepare statements with bound parameters are not only more portable more convenient immune to sql injection but are often much faster to execute than interpolated queries as both the server and client side can cache a compiled form of the query

9765233
tabs	tabpanel
closest i can suggest to a workaround except for putting a scrollpanel inside the tablayoutpanel instead would be to know the height of the current tab s contents add to that the height of just the tabs themselves and assign that as the height of the tabpanel

pthreads	fork
similarly a write to a read only page can occur as part of a copy-on-write mechanism a number of systems do this most notably pthreads style systems when performing fork so you detect the write to a read only page check the memory manager tables and see the page should be copied copy the page update the page tables and continue

however when i do import vtk a dialog pop-up saying python.exe has stopped working

9770816
width	height
sometimes using percentages for the width and height may be tricky

9770816
width	height
in your case you could try to set the width and height to the number in pixels corresponding to the 100 of height and width via javascript jquery to avoid using percentages

9770816
width	height
having this information you can set via javascript the height and width of your background popup just fine

my problem is that i cannot get their width height to proceed

9770843
width	height
i also tried getting the width and also the height with and and but when the result is not 0 it s undefined

9770844

9771043
kdevelop	codelite
i do know codelite kdevelop and of course visual studio

9771089
inherited	properties	inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
subclassing inherited its superclass properties and probably adds its own

9771089
superclass	subclassing
therefore not any instance of superclass can be cast to subclassing

9771131
cpython	ironpython
it s designed primarily i think for use with ironpython i m not sure it will install without it but it should work with a cpython installation as well

9771135

you can set separately width and height using the style attribute

9771150
uitableview	uipickerview
i have used sbtablealert several times and it seems to provide what you require but with a uitableview instead of a uipickerview

9771154

to implements this kind of slider i would create a class that extends seekbar

9771170
ubuntu	debian
on debian ubuntu you have ocamlobjinfo

9771172
rvm	bundler
the bundler approach i ve been playing with using rbenv instead of rvm but i don t understand the workflow as clearly

9771172
rvm	bundler
bundler is a better way to manage application dependencies. there is a plugin rbenv-gemset for getting the same results as rvm s gemsets but sam clearly favors using bundler instead

9771181
width	height
i looked at gridview and tablelayout and both allowed me to set a background color specify cell width height but i did not see a way to specify the grid line color

9771191
jar	manifest.mf
anyone with a similar problem should note that you need to add this to the manifest.mf in the jar that eclipse creates

9771192

i d suggest to put the servlet code aside and get it to work in a normal java class first

9771203
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
from top to bottom - firefox safari google-chrome

9771227
width	height
height 60 then 5 vertical columns which are all divs with width 18

9771227
width	margin
margin 1 and then each cell is a div width 90

9771227
width	margin
margin 5 and finally the image within the cell div is styled at width 100

9771241
width	height
if you need to keep the width change the width and the height to the height it was with the desired width

9771265
width	height
you just specify the width and height attributes and the image will be displayed in that size

9771277
gedit	sublimetext
gedit or sublimetext â to start basics

9771335
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox

9771412
move	drag
but since i am implementing a vertical drag it is annoying to have to start dragging horizontally to go to move vertically

also if i remove the swipe event then there is no way that the drag event gets fired while i move my fingers

9771436

9771500
vim	sublimetext	vim	emacs	emacs	sublimetext
text editors as ide sublimetext 2 vim with some tweakings emacs also with some tweakings

9771505
django	web2py
and for last cgi scripts are rather 20th century internet - if you want to develop a python web application or site i seriously recommend you to move to a provider where you have shell acess preferably a vps and do your project in a modern framework such as django or web2py - you willb e reinventing the wheel several times over developing using cgi and its performance is as bad as it can be since it will runa separate instance of the python interpreter for each incoming http request

9771572
post	get
anyway if you head over there and maybe post on their forums or look at some of the examples you should get the idea

9771612
post	get
the conventional approach is to have your iphone app post or get pages on a web interface that you separately program to access your data but if you have your own reasons to bypass that this approach should work

9771629
google-chrome	firefox
but google-chrome firefox ie render them all perfectly - not even using another font

9771661
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
to solve all of these you ll need loops a for-loop is best i m sure your lecturer provided examples on how to loops over the elements of an arrays

9771675
getter	setter
when they do it the first instruction doesn t compile anymore which makes it very easy to prevent nasty bugs like the ones when you bypass the getter or setter by mistake

9771696
getter	setter
in turn retain generates similar setter method getter method will be the same

9771696
getter	setter
at last you can also define your own getter and setter

9771699
stdout	stderr
it sets the stdout fd of the echo process to be the same as it s fd for stderr

9771699
stdout	stderr
here the stderr fd for the echo process is set to the stdout fd

9771699
stdout	stderr
then the stdout fd is set to the stderr fd accomplishing nothing since the new assignment is the same as the current value

9771699
stdout	stderr
here the stdout fd of the echo process is set to the stderr fd

9771699
stdout	stderr
the function s stdout fd is set to dev null and the function s stderr fd is set to the value of the stdout fd which is of course dev null

9771703
spaces	delimiter
my issue comes from existing whitespaces a single spaces character after the delimiter in the input file

9771703
spaces	delimiter
however i cannot get the writer to print the spaces char after the delimiter and therefore disturbing any subsequent diff ing of the two files

9771717
versioning	upgrade
if they ever change over to restful web services or just simply change up their wsdl on a versioning upgrade you may be out of luck if you are using the stub classes throughout your application

9771797
ubuntu	freebsd
i know freebsd mac and ubuntu are different

9771869
free	malloc
this is a brief performance comparison with pointers to eight different malloc free implementations

9771888
google-chrome	firefox
note that the developer tools of some popular web browsers google-chrome firefox possibly others provide a memory profiling graphical interface so perhaps there are programmatic hooks you can find

9771894
hide	show
i want to show the used section of fields and hide other

9771897
execvp	fork
since system 3 is rather like calling a subroutine you should use fork to create a child process followed by a call to execvp

9771948
websphere	ibm
i m working on a site implemented with ibm websphere commerce developer 6.0

9771956
put	get

9771987
children	parent
for the children to be registered under a parent node just assign their parent key

9772015
children	parent
possible recursion detected occurs when a parent containing a property which is a list of children is initialised after the child and the child contains a parent property

9772047
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
from my testing google-chrome safari and firefox now support it

9772123
public	protected
first i needed to make the ilogger property public because it remained null if it was private or protected

9772123
versioning	upgrade
additional question i ve upgrade log4net to 1.2.11.0 which is the current versioning in nuget and now ninject.logging.log4net is broken because it expects versioning 1.2.10.0 .

9772144
gridbaglayout	miglayout
please no for swing guru like as stanislavl isn t somehow complicated to wrote own layoutmanager for rest of us is better to use miglayout or gridbaglayout

9772171
post	get
my solution basically involved growing two additional controller actions get and post

9772171
post	get
the additional createbytype controller actions get and post only needs to deal with the abstract base because it requests the instance from the service layer passing the enum value

9772199
folder	directory
virtual directory has web.config and folder bin with dll inside

9772218
int	double
the rating value will be the partial view s model object as an int or double use it like you would in a normal view

9772227
packets	multicast
one is for receiving multicast packets and another for receiving udp packets

9772228
ant	maven
edit please note that i want to customize template from command line or using conventional .properties file can be used by ant maven build management tool

9772244

does os use parent child relation to store files in directory and folder

9772250

im trying to toggle an animation on height when a button show details hide details is clicked and then back to its initial value when the button is clicked again

9772251
post	get
you said you get the error even if you change post to but if you look at your form the id input has and php is case sensitive

9772268
width	height
all the rectangles have the same width and height

9772279
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
the reason my implementation didn t work is because i included the inotifycollectionchanged and inotifypropertychanged interfaces but i was not explicitly telling it when to notify

9772295
folder	directory
btw you can try installing xampp in another directory then open php.ini and set the virtualdirectory parameters to point your previous xampp htdocs folder

9772315
put	get
i have a questionnaire i was planning to use a pdf to get the answers and put the data into database

9772335
hide	show
looks like a good place for jquery show hide and some logic

9772377
hash	salt
without salt an attacker can use an offline attack to precalculate the hash of common passwords secret qwerty etc

9772377
hash	salt
no salt allows an attacker to tell when different users are using the same password as they will have the same hash

9772377
hash	salt
salt prevents precalculation and avoids the matching hash problem

9772377
hash	salt
rather than storing hash password + salt you store hash n password + salt where n is large enough for the overall calculation to take at least 0.1 second

9772396
getter	setter
i also tried instantiating the coredata itemdata object using a standard init but now understand this won t work because coredata doesn t understand the context and also doesn t have getter setter for the properties

9772508
clang	llvm
the llvm ir code generated by same as clang -c -emit-llvm main.c is following

9772514
width	height
this new answer is a probable reason for the memory leak is because of the height and width of the image

9772561
rational-numbers	integer
will it only do integer maths 5 3 1 or use floating point 5 3 1.6666667 or perhaps use arbitrary size rational-numbers to get extreme accuracy

9772561
multiplying	add
and operator handling might be split into multiplying divide add etc

9772561
subtraction	addition
i tend to like working from the top down start with the user interface but working from the bottom up is equally good start with routines to do addition subtraction etc

9772576
range	max
basically the inner two mean take the mean of the input array and the outer max will find the maximum value over the range

9772586
hide	show
in a rails 3 app using jquery i m trying to dynamically show hide form elements based on whether a boolean field is true or false

9772621
notepad	scite
sometimes scite and also programmers notepad stop handling error messages that dmd.exe outputs

9772623
action-filter	onactionexecuting
however if you implement your own action-filter you can override onactionexecuting and inspect the action parameters in filtercontext.actionparamters

9772641

i am trying to read and store the items numbers and descriptions into respective arrays which is delimiter by spaces

9772677
submit	submission
employer2 forms to submit info upon submission this entry looks just like the one above

9772732
hide	show
if you want to immediately hide or show elements because say a value in the db is set to false then you should do that when you re rendering your page in your erb or haml or whatever view

9772746
stagefright	opencore
both devices seem to use stagefright for the media framework as opposed to opencore

9772757
apache	nginx
this is not exactly an answer but if by any chance you re using apache and mod_jk only as a proxy to gf as we did for years - install nginx and forget about apache

9772812
realloc	malloc
generally speaking since you don t know how many tokens will be in the result you ll need to allocate the array dynamically using malloc realloc and or some equivalent

9772831
onclick	onsubmit
call your validatemail function at the forms onsubmit event instead of one of the buttons onclick event

9772837
sorting	grouping
a way to tie the two fields sorting of grouping should also sort dt

9772923
mockito	jmockit
mockito and jmockit as i took the original question are mock apis they allow developers to write tests which are isolated from the rest of the application or other external resources such as a database

9772935
width	height
i can t post you the correct code but i think you must use fill_parent for width and height

9772970
folder	directory
this does not seem to be a general issue in the kernel since the temp folder live from the fact that concurrent access to a directory must be possible

9772970
put	get
you can put only one read only file into the source directories to get a fast copy and many concurrent directory accesses

9772972
mapquest	directions
the android maps api uses the mapquest directions web service for routing functions

9772976
mvp	presenter
i am trying to develop a project management system in my application following the model view presenter mvp pattern

9772976
mvp	presenter
my question is this i have seen numerous examples of mvp but i haven t seen one with one presenter and multiple views

9772983
versioning	upgrade
if this is indeed fixed in the newest versioning of rails 3.2 confirmed with a github commit then i ll upgrade instead

9773002
for-loop	arrays
because by the time your callback method is called the for-loop has finished executing and i is set to the highest index in your arrays + 1

9773030
getter	setter
you can use properties and synthesize property to auto-implement instance variables along with getter and setter methods

9773070
ria	smartclient
i am investigating the possibility of implementing a ria involving lots of grid-based views think excel using a combination of django or rails and smartclient smartclient.com or extjs

9773109
post	put	post	get	put	get
all the standard verbs get put delete post head options do not have this problem

9773112
post	put	post	get	put	get
post put get are all http verbs and do not in and of themselves indicate a format for transferring the data so there is no post format

9773135
put	get
that works great and gives me a table that has the needed columns but i am stuck as to how and get each users answer and put it under the appropriate column

9773154
google-chrome	firefox
i am also using firefox 10 for this when using google-chrome the image sizes are still larger but not by as much

9773155

i want that details in a pop-up dialog on the current page

9773162
children	parent
i need to be able to display parent child rows in a wpf datagrid the parent are displayed with a plus minus control which when clicked shows the related children records

9773178
submit	submission
once on the first submission then if i enter new text and submit it again it loads the previous partial as well as the current one resulting in what appears to be 3 submit

9773182
pascal	delphi
compiler optimizations are going to give you some trouble mapping the assembly directly to the pascal source in delphi as it s unlikely there s a truly simple correlation

9773215
daemons	systemd
this non-paged memory is required to service the page-fault daemons itself core systemd services and services that are either required for the paging daemons to work such as filesystem drivers the memory manager and so on

versioning	upgrade
but we want upgrade those files to versioning 1.7.1 and 1.8.18 respectively

9773250
ienumerable	iqueryable
entity framework s iqueryable implementation is more picky about creating new objects in objects than regular linq to objects ienumerable

9773260
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
i had declared objectinputstream and objectoutputstream as private and had made it global

9773281
union	distinct
you need to create an equality comparer and use it in the union or distinct see here

9773287
post	put	post	get	put	get
for example commonly it is used in conjunction with http verbs like get put delete and post to represent the common functions of lookup inserting deleting and updating a record

9773304
children	parent
got parent id then applied changes to it s children only

9773307
versioning	upgrade
if you need help with an upgrade path that you re having issues with have a look at the release notes between the versioning

if i set the div and the image s width and height to 100 it takes the window s height not the wrapper s

9773324
stdout	stderr
at this point the stdout and stderr results from the command will be stored in those two lexicals

9773325
put	get
yet when i put an alert in that loop both get saved

9773327
fadein	fadeout
if you just want them to slide up and down rather than fadein and fadeout you can use the built-in animations .slideup and .slidedown

9773347
installation	upgrade
besides the issue of the cost of add-ons which imo is worthwhile you also add complexity to your installation the more software you add to it making it more time consuming to troubleshoot bugs and to upgrade ee

9773366
width	height
you can set the width and height manually

9773387

make sure the files are uploaded only to directory that are not directly accessible from the web use the .net app_data folder or a folder outside of the iis root

9773524
gif	png
magento only accept jpg jpeg gif png image types

9773535
post	get
so i see there has already been a post very similar to this issue however i am in a situation where i have no power to specify the location of this file within my jar and so am hoping someone is aware of a solution to get around this

9773553

9773596
pbkdf2	salt	pbkdf2	md5	salt	md5	scrypt	pbkdf2	scrypt	salt	scrypt	md5
however please use a cryptographically secure slow hashing algorithm such as bcrypt scrypt or pbkdf2 - not salt md5

9773596
hash	salt
these would be hash but not salt and would not have any account association stored

9773596
hash	salt
when this user next attempts to log in and their hash salt password matches the hash salt value stored in their account record the unsalted hash password taken from their user input is stored in the fraudulent password list

9773603
min	max
but in the instance of course if min 35 or 40 and max 40 or 45 there would be no need to round off

9773603
range	infinity
it needs to work for a range of numbers ranging from 0 to infinity

9773624
width	height
width and height both 50

9773624
width	height
width and height both 75 etc.

9773624

so when they select an image with the jfilechooser and click open i need to validate the image size and if it doesn t have square dimensions i need to present the user with a dialog informing them the image must have the same width and height

9773717
width	height
when an element isn t displayed it has no height or width

9773721
width	height
that is just to get the css attribute a hidden object has no height or width so you ll need to display it get the measurments and hide it

9773782
width	height
their width and height are explicitly set to 0

9773783
vmware	virtualbox
the bad news is this means ultimately that the linux host hypervisor vmware virtualbox on the host must know to process that information and pass it out to the appropriate location

9773785
post	get
get the email and password from a post request

9773785

9773795
width	height
i was wondering if its possible to get the dimensions of the images with javascript or html5 before the image loads and then go in with jscript html5 and set width and height attributes to the tags on the initial page load-- before the images fully have loaded

9773795
width	height
edit i cannot use the width and height html attributes off the bat since the images are from all different sources with no pre-known width and height its mostly random user posted images

9773803
hide	show
the fragment hide show example provided by google should give you some good ideas

9773830
hide	show
basically looking to hide show table rows when a tickbox is clicked with jquery

9773869
width	height
this is what the height and width attributes are for on the element

9773869
width	height
set those to the height width of the image and that space will be reserved by the renderer

google-chrome	firefox
it is entirely possible this is a firefox issue as i am using firefox 11.0 and it seems to work in google-chrome

9773890
profiling	debugging
what i find strange is that while in debugging profiling xcode this error goes undetected and the for-loop executes without issue

9773936
folder	dir
i m storing my content in library caches dir seems to work fairly ok except for localized html content when i was storing it in app s bundle i had lang_code.lproj folder and had no issues

9773936
folder	dir
know that i migrated all those lproj folder in caches dir localized content won t load

9773945
versioning	upgrade
2 upgrade your versioning of ssrs if it s not the latest but check it is worthwhile doing the upgrade first

9773960
strcat	gets	printf	strcpy
finally many functions such as strcpy strcat and printf do no bounds checking but since they don t deal with external input like gets does they can be used in a safe manner

9773980
put	get
simply put you use math.round to get a random index for your display object array in this example that happens here

9773990
folder	directory
as long as you have .lproj folder in that directory you should be able to access localized resources in the same way

9774064
hide	show
there is the ajax version cooler but more complicated and the simple show hide

9774065
jboss	weblogic
i am not sure what you are using jboss websphere weblogic etc and i am no expert on any of them we stopped using ejbs a long time ago but any time you get a noclassdeffound error it means the current classloader the one that loaded the .class your code id in cannot find a referenced class

9774086
profiling	debugging
when compiled for the debugging profiling the storage for variables can shift around compared to release

9774096
put	get
my main goal is to unzip cbr cbz files archives containing only images jpg png i am trying to put each of these images on a arraylist so the zipinputstream to arraylist was my plan to eventually get them to bitmaps but if you can get them to bitmaps straight from the zipinputstream would be great

9774126
for-loop	arrays
it only gives me the first entry in the php arrays so it seems like everytime the for-loop is repeated its initialising the php file from scratch and so setting the counter to 0

9774159
ant	maven
eclipse netbeans and intellij are all pretty good at building projects from maven or ant build files

9774159
hudson	bamboo
with this solution you have a simple build that is easy to setup in ci hudson bamboo whatever and you don t have any ide specific files checked in

9774169
ienumerable	iqueryable
i notice that it s expecting an ienumerable generic rather than an iqueryable which is strange

9774169
ienumerable	iqueryable
you can t cast ienumerable to an iqueryable without doing an asqueryable

9774195
for-loop	loops
if it is false the body of loops does not execute and flow of control jumps to the next statement past the for-loop

9774208
post	get
what you need is to authenticate the user requesting user_groups permission to access groups information and than retrieve feed to get images associated with post

9774208
post	get
than iterate over post to get images

9774216
width	height
i ve even got a video css rule that sets the width and height but the video isn t sized to fit the box like the top row examples

9774216
width	height
yes i ve put the height and width into the video tag itself too

9774228
portrait	landscape
in my case for example i needed to show one bitmap for landscape and one for portrait

9774228
portrait	landscape
solved it by having two imageviews one that it is enable by style resource in portrait and the other in landscape

9774248
post	get
i get the same error as on this post unable to connect to the report server 2008 r2

9774260

what i have tried is to read proc bus input devices and search for keyboard or mouse in the device name but this doesn t work always as the device names vary a lot

9774307
post	get
you need to get access_token for the page - read this on how to get the right access_token just change the permissions to what you need - facebook post image and description to wall and in page album via php

9774329
google-chrome	safari
when done this way where the css change happens while the transitions class is not applied to the element but is applied immediately after some browsers google-chrome and safari in my testing still apply the css transition when by my logic it should just snap to the new location

9774329
google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome or safari click the no delay button and see that it does still animate the position of the box while the delay button which uses a timeout set for one millisecond later doesn t animate the css change

9774329
google-chrome	safari
as indicated in the jsfiddle i m having to use a settimeout call to get the proper behavior in google-chrome and safari

9774375
chown	chmod
i am sure we could do a chown or chmod in terminal but this isn t really a great solution

9774383
width	height
let point p half the width and height of the element using getcomputedstyle if necessary

9774396
versioning	upgrade
yev using mysql 5.1.22 says that when he upgrade from driver versioning 5.0.4 to 5.1.5 his column aliases stopped working

9774405
capistrano	bundler
not sure but you might have to require bundler capistrano at the top

9774427
hide	show
it wraps the show operation in a try finally block that that hide the modal form on the way out

9774495
lisp	scheme
among other modes that help me write lisp are hideshow mode for folding of sexps slime which is primarily for common lisp but i use it s indentation capabilities in scheme too low-contrast color theme called solarized with which my eyes don t fatigue any more and heavily mutated vim mode which permits me to keep my keybindings manageable through editing modes

9774520
for-loop	arrays
then length of the arrays is 2 arr1.length so this for-loop should work properly

9774540
post	get
namely you have to get a bunch of proxies so you can get past the rate limiting and the 302s + captcha pages that they post up any time they get suspicious about your activity.

9774550
put	get
for instance if you create an object and put in in a instance1 reference you get the instance1 method

9774550
put	get
if you take the same object put it in an instance2 reference you will get the instance2 method

9774560
submit	submission
you can create a function in ajax that submit the form to save the data entered by the user without submission before idling

9774568
fgets	getline
just use fgets to load lines or getline if you have it

9774655
put	get
i simply added the functions and get the result i haven t put much effort on algorithm and coding

9774664
hide	show
when i click the show more image unbind txtsynopsis bottom so that it spans how many rows it wants to hide the image and fade mask and show the show less image

9774673
jar	manifest.mf
i believe you have to add a -m to the jar command to use the manifest.mf file you are specifying

9774675
int	double
the crash problem still rears its ugly head when i use the istringstream to convert an int long short and then use that same stream to convert a float or double

9774677
margin	height
your navigation div doesn t have a height to give a margin to push down the next box- nor does your view box

9774729
put	get
i m developing a website and when i put a forward slash at the end of an url the css file doesn t get read

9774824
int	double
value types are typically your simple basic types like int double etc

9774824
int	double
when you pass value types like int and double then you are passing a copy of the value so if you pass int x 10 into a method a change to x in the method won t be reflected once you leave the method

9774865
client-side	server-side
it can be done in both client-side and server-side

9774886
for-loop	arrays
in the one argument constructor i use a for-loop to go through the file and put each character into the appropriate arrays index

9774936
backbone.js	javascriptmvc
also you could consider using backbone.js or some similar javascriptmvc framework

9774948
hide	show
my suggestion would be to change these to classes and use jquery to hide show

9774958
cos	sin
since then cos beta 1 and so sin beta 0

9774975
superclass	subclassing
the super keyword allows you to tell the compiler that you want to call a method from the superclass without checking if the method is overridden in subclassing

9774987
margin	height
the next element that clears the 0 height parent container will automatically add a top margin to properly accomodate for the collapsed height of the previous parent containers

9775001
g++	gcc
ps as compiler i use g++ part of gcc 4.6.1 under ubuntu 11.10

9775022
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
i ve successfully used objectoutputstream and objectinputstream to serialize and deserialize objects for a server and client i am writing

9775024
children	parent
floated children do not contribute to the height of their parent unless they are contained

9775024
padding	overlapping
as to why adding 1px of padding to .view results in much more spacing than that right now the p tag margins are overlapping the .view box and the li bottom margins

9775027
jobs	cron
cron jobs

9775027
jobs	cron
yes just use cron jobs for calling php script in 30-minute intervals

9775043
xcodebuild	xcrun
xcodebuild or xcrun doesn t work here because of a private key mismatch

9775055

9775086
disk	ram
there is a way to configure ndb to use disk to store data so that ram is only used to store indexes they still have to be stored in ram here is how

9775097
width	height
change the font size to a small amount and increase the height width of the column header

9775111
min	max
here s a sample that does not project to int to illustrate how the min and max extensions behave with empty and different lists of nullable int s

9775147
tinyint	boolean
bool and boolean are just shorthand for tinyint 1

9775150
hide	show
so i show and hide these to items according to certain criteria on a right click in a mouseup event

9775150
hide	show
problem is when i hide the contextmenustrip it seems the next time i want to show one of the menu items i have to click twice on the node

opencv	emgucv
with a bit of googling you can to find real-time examples of finding stereo correspondences using emgucv or plain opencv using the gpu on youtube

9775239
getter	setter
if you wanted to keep it make the variables class variables and provide getter and setter for them

9775253
ant	maven
i would recommend to use the maven plugin instead of ant calls

9775279
inotifycollectionchanged	ilist
however if you want a more complex check you might just implement an ilist inotifycollectionchanged and throw some custom exceptions if the criteria are not met when adding new items

9775284
g++	gcc
we re using gcc g++ 4.4.3 in linux

9775313

9775329
ready	each
contents of each page into the dom as you navigate and the dom ready

9775333
google-chrome	safari
not knowing how any of the browsers apply styles i could guess that safari and google-chrome do some optimizations to not have to re-flow the page after every style update

9775333
put	get
this works because you are forcing the browser to stop and evaluate the css so that you can get the value of left although you could put any valid css attribute in the second .css call

9775376
innodb	myisam
so you need to recover the data from somewhere - either a backup of your db made using mysqldump or of your file system the data files of myisam tables are all simply structured and on the disk - recovering innodb tables are complicated by the shared use of ibdata files

9775447
sorting	filtering
access update the viewstate as well on filtering and sorting

9775473
nsmutablestring	nsstring
since mutablecopy returns id referencing a nsmutablestring the assignment to an nsstring is ok by the compiler id can be assigned to anything so compile time it s ok

9775476
nsmutablestring	nsstring
the mutablecopy message returns a copy of your string as a nsmutablestring object which can be assigned to a nsstring as nsmutablestring derives from it

9775489

then later in my jsp i iterate though the list of category parent objects to get a list of subcategories children

9775516
post	get
what s the best way to get the author of a post

9775538
sse	avx
unfortunately even though avx features a _mm256_hadd_pd instruction it differs in the result from the sse version

9775538
sse	avx
i believe this is due to the fact that most avx instructions work as sse instructions for each low and high 128-bits separately without ever crossing the 128-bit boundary

9775547
spaces	delimiter
moreover if you transmit that as text you need to consider more bytes used as delimiter for example using a spaces you ll need n - 1 extra bytes

essentially i m moving image.margin.top up 5 pixels on mouseenter and down 5 pixels on mouseleave events

9775737
button	checkbox
while your control may look like a button it behaves like a checkbox in the sense that it has two states

9775738
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in firefox 11 google-chrome on windows even if the user navigates somewhere else and then uses the back button they get the page with their latest edits

you can t use findviewbyid from the oncreate method to search for a view that is in a listview row layout

9775826
getter	setter
since the only connection to the models was from tableview s model property - which is just a wrapper for c++ getter and setter - ruby thought it lost the reference to my models and gc d them

9775916
int	chars
it contains the function chrw that gives the chars from a unicode value passed as int

9775921
stdout	stderr
node doesn t seem to have anything like system or sh -- it looks like the nearest equivalents are child_process.spawn and child_process.exec but neither of them wires up stdout or stderr so you can t see any output from the child process unless you do some extra work

9775952
min	max
i figure i need to wait until the query is applied and then iterate through the markers to find the min max x y locations and pan to that rectangle but i don t see a way in the maps api to access the markers of a layer

9776011
stdout	stderr
displays output both stdout and stderr as the child process generates it so you see incremental output as the command runs

9776012

if x and y are int which is correct and avoids double incrementation

9776123
textview	listadapter
right now i have a custom listadapter and in the getview method i m programmatically changing the font color for each textview but that is very tedious

9776307
implements	extends
there is libopkele basic_op which i need to extends and implements pure virtuals

9776308
children	parent
this works ok but has the problem that each parent row effectively has a seperate datagrid for the children so things like navigating with the keyboard don t work too well as the child rowdetails area is skipped over the only thing we navigate is the parent

9776326
innodb	myisam
instead of referring to wiki or other pages for comparisions check their myisam and innodb limitations on dev.mysql.com

9776353

9776362
websphere	ibm
i m using ibm websphere 7.0

9776443
innodb	myisam
i found a good article about innodb vs myisam that says this about performance

9776443
innodb	myisam
large margin in the benchmarks between myisam and innodb when the

9776443
innodb	myisam
your table sounds fairly large so i doubt it s being held entirely in memory but it sounds like innodb handles indexes better than myisam anyway plus since you re being so specific it may be caching the result of the query

9776495
portrait	landscape
what you can do is to create a dummy group with minheighttostartnewpage property set to something like 700 800 depends on your report design for portrait and 500 550 depends on your report design for landscape setup

9776505

9776611
put	get
i can get the pictures to float around my worksheet but i need to put them into a cell

9776618
children	parent
the trick being that the click handler is on the parent container not the individual children so when they are moved you don t need to keep managing their handlers

9776642
chunked	transfer-encoding
transfer-encoding chunked

9776655
put	get
the best way that i have found to get such an architecture in place with grails is to use a message queue like rabbitmq for example with a series of queues one for each step in the pipeline and then have the controller s put messages into the first step of the pipeline

9776714
firefox	safari
what happens is that firefox croaks with a attempt to run compile-and-go script on a cleared scope error and safari doesn t get that error but doesn t load anything

9776716
subtract	add
in summary i need to produce a new list with the same number of elements as the input list and it must take the first or next numerical element to produce the resulting list using a specified number to add subtract values to

9776733
width	height
each div has a fixed width but an unknown arbitrary height

9776737
width	height
instead of setting the height and width properties of dridpanel use css to set the height and width - 500 and 980 when the media is screen and just set the width to 100 when the media is print

9776749
width	height
new code new image is the correct height width of rotated image still getting black bars

9776769
width	height
it seems to be using some kind of fixed aspect with only width being taken into consideration and the height being calculated from that

9776769
width	height
therefore the simplest solution in your case given that you have a fixed height is to reduce the width of the container therefore making contentflow calculate an smaller height

9776811
getter	setter
i tired writing my own getter and setter but it didn t work

9776829

in my maven pom.xml file i added a dependecy for my api bundle in the correct version like this

9776896
sudo	passwd
open terminal - type sudo su - enter passwd

9776966

9776976
post	get
ä f i pass the query with get or post method it cause big security problems

9776994
portrait	landscape
so if the device rotates from landscape to portrait while the dialog is visible then the edittext will be too wide for the screen

9777028
stdout	fflush
this is probably because you re piping the process s own stdout into a file and stdout normally doesn t close and fflush until after node.js starts to clean up the process

you can just show hide the required option conditionally on change event of select element

9777206
spaces	delimiter
all the fields are delimiter by the spaces

9777215
stdout	stderr
i can write code to accept data from those pipes and write it to my process s stdout and stderr but if i do that the apis force me to sacrifice some flexibility

9777215
stdout	stderr
but exec insists on buffering the child process s stdout and stderr for me and giving them to me all at the end and it limits the size of those buffers configurable 200k by default

9777276
post	get
the post returns a subscription_task resource which can be monitored via get polling until the task is complete

9777278
background-color	transparency
i cannot simply remove the a hover class and replace it with another one of background-color transparency because my js still picks up the onhover function i could target onhover only for that changed class maybe..

9777286
hid	keyboard
i m currently developing a very smal and specific hid keyboard with a atmega microcontroller

9777286
hid	keyboard
i think the hid keycodes are really bad designed to support multiple keyboard layouts

9777303
firefox	safari
you want to specify the content-type and content-dispisition headers like so - response.contenttype application vnd.ms-excel works in ie and firefox but not in safari then stream your file

9777309
int	chars
a chars is an array of chars and chars are one byte unsigned int

9777309
strtol	atoi
the function you re looking for is either atoi as mentioned by scott hunter or strtol which i prefer because of its error detecting behaviour

9777356
jobs	cron
the only reason we put the target app read-only is to prevent things like your taskqueues or cron jobs from running on partially copied data which could yield bad data in your target app

9777391
printf	strtol
i d use printf to convert it to a char reverse it with some simple arithmetic then use strtol to convert it back again

9777392
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
you can then use a for-loop to loops through the lines and the string type s split method to separate each line into another arrays and store the values in your formatted arrays

9777396
width	height
so what you want to do is do some trigonometric calculations beforehand to decide the maximum width height of the rotated image and combine that with the original width height

9777396
width	height
resize your image centering it using those dimensions rotate it and then crop it back to the width height of the rotated image

9777486
put	get
either way i would love to be able to get to the bottom of this and put it behind me

9777526
for-loop	loops
i was told to use a for-loop then switch to a do while loops

9777557
pop-up	dialog
if they have a view pop-up with a feed dialog with the wall post information

9777557
pop-up	dialog
after logging in they will be taken back to the app and the feed dialog view will pop-up

9777557
pop-up	dialog
the feed dialog pop-up but it is completely blank and dismisses automatically

9777564
squash	merge
now there have been substantive changes to foo and we d like to merge in those changes ideally squash them in

9777598
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
more and more browsers are supporting css3 and major browsers such as the latest versions of google-chrome ie safari opera and firefox covering over 90 of users certainly support it

9777611
put	get
i think you should get rid of the inner do-while and put outside the for-loop

9777622
for-loop	loops
regarding the use of a for-loop versus a do-while i m guessing that it s not a matter of using both loops at the same time it s a matter of using a for-loop to illustrate the concept and then switching to use a do-while loops to illustrate the concept

9777655
free	malloc
what you have malloc -ed needs to be free by yourself

9777680
post	get
if code along these lines doesn t get you on track then maybe you can post all the relevant code from your troubled project here

9777690
width	height
ideally i would like the view to wrap both it s height and width to fit the content within it

9777696
width	height
move image back into the center remembering that now width old height and height old width

9777703
ilist	icollection
well hashset conceptually is a list of unique values but in difference from it doesn t actually implements ilist interface but implements icollection

9777741
portrait	landscape
i am now adding support for both portrait landscape interface orientation

9777741
portrait	landscape
for now i prefer not to allow the interface to rotate to from portrait landscape while my gcd async task is running

9777812
hide	show
i also found it helpful to create a .js class hide it in the css file and show with javascript after any necessary scripting is complete

9777825
addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	division	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction
my first calculator program didn t have any problems registering the boolean flags signifying the operator as true or false it dealt only with addition and subtraction but when i implemented multiplication and division into the boolean everything gets registered as true so that all the results for every operation is listed

9777827
getter	setter
note you have to implement default constructor and all getter and setter for the person class

9777849
serializable	deserialization
i figured that this would simply use the base class s data for serializable deserialization but i got the following error

9777872
google-chrome	firefox
i wrote the code and saw a bug in firefox and little bug in google-chrome

9777915
rss	feed
the feed has the ability to create nodes from an rss feed

9777948
mockito	easymock
one of my preferrable is mockito there is also easymock and others.

9777989
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
i managed to eleviate the errors that you were getting by implementing the inotifycollectionchanged and inotifypropertychanged interfaces in the assetholder class

9777994
min	max
min and max value 0 - 4 000

9777994
min	max
min and max percent 10 - 90 i believe you can use max_value - min_value to get the actual value

9777994
min	max	percentile	max
min and max percentile 0th percentile - 100th percentile

9778115
width	height
the fft returns data in an array where each array element is somewhat related to cycles per total data width or height etc.

9778125
zoo	xts
xts example based on gavin zoo answer

9778139
opencv	shogun
if you re not married to opencv for the svm stuff have a look at the shogun toolbox .

9778191
post	get
the error message we get from fb when trying to post to the 2 fan page albums that do not allow it is application does not have the capability to make this api call

9778195
post	get
what i noticed while browsing through my access logs is that i do get a post request from paypal which is turned down

9778195
post	get
i tried to modify paypal standard pdt views.py to accept post requests but i still get the 401 error

9778199
qtcore	qtgui
usually its qtcore qtgui and whatever you configured explicitly in the .pro file like or etc

9778227
hide	show
so now i hide show features in the ui to address this issue

9778239
pull	push
i m not as worried about figuring out git-svn first thing i want is just to be able so pull push from multiple dev machines

9778287
affinity	processors
by setting the processors affinity of matlab to a subset of available processors this problem is resolved

9778287
affinity	processors
the trick of setting processors affinity via the command-line of a shortcut doesn t work since the engine is launched from within my application not via a shortcut

9778287
affinity	processors
specify processors affinity for the matlab engine from within the application when the engine is launched

9778287
affinity	processors
specify a default processors affinity for the matlab engine separately from the full matlab application itself

9778291
try-catch	exception-handling
they also recomended to put the try-catch block around main which will handle any exception-handling regarding for example memory and then let the app exit

9778303
vmware	virtualbox
as for virtual machine creation i prefer vmware workstation however there are free alternatives such as virtualbox and vmware server

9778313
inherited	subclassing
the headerfactory s getheader method returns one of the subclassing that inherited from csvheader

9778315
int	chars
your example allocs memory for max int chars 2

9778346
arrayiterator	each
it seems you may have mixed up iterator and arrayiterator as each has their own valid api call

9778353
fadein	fadeout	slideup	slidedown
replace fadein fadeout with slideup slidedown respectively as it makes a more natural switching between content

9778368
yslow	pagespeed
i have also tried this solution with 3.1 - no change i check the results with firebug s pagespeed and yslow

9778386
innodb	myisam
currently myisam but innodb is possible as well

9778427
free	malloc	free	realloc	realloc	malloc
aside from the suggestion i made in a comment of using a linked list nsmutablearray my other suggestion would be that you use realloc instead of constantly using malloc copying by hand and then free ing the old allocation

9778433
int	double
you are causing undefined behaviour since the type of a b is promoted to double which does not match the format specifier d which expects an int

9778435
hide	show
why not just mark certain users as admins and then hide show and allow disallow those actions that way

9778448
post	put	post	get	put	get
select network tab then click the get or put or post request that is executed and check things out

9778454
put	get
check the existing classes there to get an idea what to put in there

9778469
google-chrome	firefox
anyway i have some code that works just fine in ie9 firefox and google-chrome but not in ie8

9778479
filtering	grouping
i do plan on throwing the stringgroupedkwhlist list into a highchart for the user to view and throwing the firstq query results into a telerik grid for the user to filtering sort grouping on so they can work with the details

9778487
width	height
the useful screen properties are availwidth and availheight or width and height

9778487
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
is the least standard firefox safari and google-chrome

9778501
stdout	stderr
now communicate will return the output of both stdout and stderr

9778501
sudo	passwd
also its possible that the sudo might cause you problems if it requires a passwd input

9778510
subtract	add
you need to take into account the location of the chart so if you use the left and top attributes you can add on half the width of the plot and subtract half the width of your text bounding box

9778510
subtract	add
thus instead of subtract half the height we actually need to add it

9778510
google-chrome	firefox
this works in all browers that i have tested including ie7 8 9 firefox and google-chrome

9778513
int	double
however i also want to make this code work with any data type like strings int double etc and different kinds of containers like arrays hashsets lists and collections so i won t have to waste so a lot of extra lines to overload the method

9778563
ant	maven
note however that this is only implemented in the wsdl2java maven plugin but not in the ant task or the command line tool

9778565
width	height
remember to set the width and height for each div or they will collapse as they are technically empty

9778573
affinity	processors
now when your application launches just call this mex function as you would a regular matlab function the mex function must be visible on the matlab path and it should set processors affinity as you desire

9778590
jlist	jtextpane
alternatively consider a jlist and custom renderer using jtextpane

9778601
min	max
you can get the max min values for latitude and longitude from your mkmapview by accessing the region attribute

9778603
implements	extends
looked again and noticed these were all functions of an implements class not an extends class

9778616
post	get
another possible cause of this is that after you received the get request from paypal your app sends the post data to your app instead of to paypal postback endpoint

9778616
post	get
i would look at the access logs to see if the post request comes after a get request for the same url if yes i would check the value of the sandbox_postback_endpoint and postback_endpoint settings

9778673
implements	extends
most people extends abstractaction and implements actionperformed which is invoked when the button is pressed

9778674
pop-up	dialog
it works ok but the ime keyboard does not pop-up as soon as the dialog is shown

9778676
gif	png	flac	ogg	mp3	flac	mp3	ogg
in practice this means you should avoid compressing most web image formats jpg png gif almost all a v multimedia audio mp3 ogg flac

9778676
rar	zip	rar	gzip
video mpg mp4 avi etc. and of course common archive formats zip gzip bz2 rar 7zip arj etc.

9778795
zoo	xts
this works with package zoo so i suspect it works also with xts as the latter builds upon the former

9778806
int	chars
i know how to do it for primitives like int chars bool and even c-strings like

9778835
put	get
they didn t put in a function to get the image s size so you ll have to pass it in via a uniform

9778871
sorting	filtering
sorting filtering display etc

9778887
bindparam	pdostatement
when passing named parameters of the form name to pdostatement bindparam it seems to work whether or not the leading colon is used

9778887
bindparam	pdostatement
here s the documentation for pdostatement bindparam

9778918
fink	macports
you can build a cross-compiler or just install one with fink or macports

9778928
google-chrome	firefox
try console.log document.getelementbyid blue in google-chrome or firefox with firebug

9778967
ssid	captivenetwork
update i updated the answer to monotouch wifi ssid to show how to use captivenetwork a single call from monotouch but it s a bit different subset from what you re looking to do with the api

9778968
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
the following simple rule works perfectly in firefox google-chrome safari opera ie8+.

9778971
prepare	execute
the other reason is to create correctly prepare statements that can execute efficiently - and ideally pop the execution plan cache on the db server

9778986
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
using logos what should i hook to be able to use touchesbegan touchesmoved etc.

9778990
onresume	onpause
instrument the base activity class onpause and onresume to hack in a timestamp and log the info some place probably a sqlite database.

9779009
implements	sealed
only implements for structs or sealed classes

9779009
implements	sealed
if a type is not sealed the only way to ensure that derived types implementation of will be compatible with their override of object.equals object will be to have the former method chain to the latter effectively nullifying any advantage one might have obtained from implements in the first place

9779009
implements	sealed
implements is often a big win for struct types saves a boxing operation on every comparison and a somewhat smaller win for other sealed types saves a typecast on every comparison

9779023
versioning	upgrade
more importantly the 1.7.x series is no longer supported you should upgrade to 2.5.3 as it fixes a very nasty pair of exploits that leave all prior versioning vulnerable to hackers

9779085
addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition
i m building a matrix class for all the operations such as addition subtraction multiplication inverse etc

9779101
google-chrome	firefox
assuming you re running a browser like firefox or google-chrome you could listen for the domnodeinserted event

9779163
apache	nginx
i m doing an nginx rewrite that will detect the facebook crawler to server a custom version of the app with the proper og tag for that section but apache is ignore everything after the # sign as server-side should do since that s a browser feature. i would like to escape the # in my rewrite but am not sure how to do it in nginx

9779172
google-chrome	firefox
looks fine in google-chrome and internet explorer however on firefox it disappears completely

9779203
jspinner	documentfilter
you are right jformattedtextfield isn t correctly implemented to jspinner you have implements documentfilter for filtering of un_wanted chars typed from keyboad or pasted from clipboard thanks to stanislavl

9779215
folder	directory
by default wamp s data directory is c wamp bin mysql mysql5.x.x data check there and see if you have some folder with the names of your old databases

9779272
getter	setter
edit i know its wrong that way i should add getter and setter but this is how the teacher started and told us to start this way

9779313
getter	setter
you could use a global variable defining a constant would be better but using a setter getter method is best

9779313
getter	setter
in this example i ve combined the setter and getter into a single method and included the ability to set the value when you first create the instance using a constructor

9779323
activiti	alfresco
i have written a tutorial on using the activiti workflow engine that is embedded in alfresco 4 that shows how to create custom workflows

9779331
getter	setter
variables should be private with appropriate getter setter

9779348
backtracking	greedy
and w+ is greedy it will first match the whole word and leaves nothing for d+ so it has to backtracking 1 character and the last character is good enought for d+

9779374
int	boolean
i found a simple solution to that problem use the form spinner.setselection int position boolean navigateto to have the spinner show the correct selected item

9779386
qtreeview	qabstractitemmodel
i m working on a subclass of qabstractitemmodel that plugs into a qtreeview

9779389
post	get
have a look at the blog post test your asp.net mvc or webforms application on iis 7 in 30 seconds which provides all the steps to get a vs 2010 web app running on iis on windows 7

9779464
subtract	add
you have to get the size of the texture since you re not using glsl 1.30 or above you have to manually pass this in invert the size and either add or subtract these sizes from the s and t component of the texture coordinate

9779471
put	get
put the call to ko.applybindings inside your ready function just before you get your hub reference

9779617
g++	gcc
what i want is to compile opencv programs on my windows os using mingw s gcc g++ compilers

9779617
g++	gcc
i ve tried various gcc g++ parameters that i ve found on the internet and days playing with the -i and -l options the compiler can never find the opencv functions or structures

9779622
maple	mupad
i wrote a compiler for cas-language like maple or mupad with sablecc to convert this

9779626
screens	mdpi	screens	hdpi	mdpi	hdpi
the system scales default density resources up for high-density screens and down for low-density screens so it s better if you make a directory for hdpi and another one for mdpi with the given size of icons

9779671
google-chrome	safari
my code works perfectly on desktop google-chrome safari

9779700
mocha	node.js
mocha test framework for node.js uses make

9779728
ostringstream	std
if you want to test the hexdump function you can pass in a std ostringstream instead

9779741
oncreate	onstart
no matter where i put the call to my code oncreate onstart onrestart onresume etc i always have undesired affects

9779745
google-chrome	firefox
this is a problem where firefox works just fine while google-chrome has the problem

9779769
put	get
i have carefully read google contacts api documentation but i can t get put requests updates right

9779775
qmodelindex	qabstractitemmodel
it may be that the parent method is not correct but then how to fetch the parent index - the qabstractitemmodel documentation discourages the usage of qmodelindex parent in that method for it will create an infinite recursion

9779778
int	double	int	chars
the old style array are usually discouraged in java unless you want an array of primitives types int double chars etc.

9779779
versioning	upgrade
since upgrading the device to ios 5.1 i was forced to upgrade the xcode to the versioning 4.3.1 too

9779799
actualheight	actualwidth
you could achieve this by binding the margin of the label to the actualwidth and actualheight of the label and multiplying these values with -0.5

9779799
margin	height	width	height	width	margin
setting mover.movetomiddle to true means that the margin of that framework element is automatically bound to its actual width and height such that the framework element is moved to its center point

9779824
getter	setter
say i have field1 field2 and field3 available in bean1 and bean2 with getter and setter

9779913
viewdidload	viewdidappear
nslog reports that viewdidload and viewdidappear

9779934
superclass	subclassing
in the constructor of a subclassing there is an implicit call to the superclass s default constructor

i am trying to detect each 4th post to insert extra code in my layout in wordpress using modulus method but i just cant get it

9780022
touchesbegan	touchesended
but at the same time i want my uiview to listen to touchesbegan touchesended methods

9780022
touchesbegan	touchesended
i have implemented gesturerecognizer shouldreceivetouch method also but touchesbegan touchesended methods does not get called

9780032
nstextview	nsscrollview
current implementation uses nsscrollview - nstextview

9780047
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
as of now i am not noticing any errors in the console or resources section of the developer tools for safari firefox and opera but only in google-chrome i am getting the error

9780052
int	chars
i ve set an error message in the catch method in case the input is a chars or anything aside from an int

9780064
g++	gcc
you have the directory c opencv install bin to locate libraries on the gcc g++ command line but i think you ll also need to specify the libraries to use as linker inputs as well

9780131
nstextview	appkit
all you ve demonstrated is that you re using appkit incorrectly not that nstextview is fatally flawed for your purposes

9780133
put	get
one way to solve this would be to pass what you put in the hidden elements in the get instead

9780184
portrait	landscape
i got it working but now the problem is when user rotate the device to landscape its status bar also rotate but while rotating it back to portrait the status bar is not going portrait but staying in landscape mode with the view displayed in portrait

9780189
portrait	landscape
when ipad is in portrait mode it will get the mobile version but when it s in landscape mode it will get the regular version of the site

profiling	debugging
not just money-wise either but debugging getting it started etc far outweigh the benefit for any profiling that you wish to do

9780292
gprof	perf
consider gprof if you re on linux or even perf if you re feeling classy

9780318
qsharedpointer	qscopedpointer
you should probably also wrap any raw pointer inside a smart pointer qscopedpointer qsharedpointer or their array variants to allow them to be deallocated automatically if you don t reach the end of the scope because an exception occured

9780336
stdout	fflush
it looks a lot like two threads doing a fflush stdout on the same buffer contents

9780336
stdout	fflush
but what if there is some cancellation scenario like the thread has the mutex on stdout and has just done a fflush but has not updated the buffer yet to clear the output

9780348
mkmapview	mkannotationview
mkannotationview mapview mkmapview mapview viewforannotation id annotation

9780348
mkoverlay	mkannotationview
note mkoverlay is not an option as i am using another class that inherits from mkannotationview

9780349
children	parent
i have very odd situation where i m appending children thumbnails to a div and then i append a large blocking div to the parent div all using appendchild and for no reason that i can see the thumb divs wind up displaying above the blocker div even though in the element inspector they are in the right node hierarchy

9780397
post	get
once i get this json object i am trying to post to server using .post or .ajax on click of save button

9780407
implements	extends
using the drag-n-drop framework instead that cycling the childs and setting the draglistener i use as a grid item layout container a dragablelinearlayout that extends the linearlayout and implements the ondragevent dragevent method

9780464
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

i m trying to implement onsaveinstancestate onrestoreinstancestate onpause and onresume but it continues to crash

9780557
ssl	https
my goal is to serve over https and keep my customdomain in the url bar and be more secure with user data as serving over no ssl using my custom domain

9780557
ssl	https
since the entire transaction is over https i don t think this exposes the session cookie any more than using mydomain.com without ssl

9780564
int	chars
error operator does not exist chars varying int hint

9780564
int	chars
error operator does not exist chars varying int sql

9780580
setcontentview	findviewbyid
if you don t want to change the properties or content of the textviews you don t even have to get them with findviewbyid they will just be rendered with the setcontentview r.layout.your_layout

9780587
for-loop	arrays
i m trying to create a basic for-loop which creates an arrays but am a little confused in how to structure it.

9780587
for-loop	arrays
i know how to make a 1 dimensional arrays with a for-loop but not anything this complex

9780594
kentico	umbraco
there are two others that spring to mind umbraco and kentico

9780615
stdout	stderr
i don t know of a way to change stdin but this will make stdout green and stderr red

9780615
stdout	stderr
1 above refers to stdout ... and 2 refers to stderr

9780615
stdout	stderr
i guess if you want to change stdin you can change your terminal color to whatever you want to use for stdin and then use something like the above commands to change stderr and stdout to something else.

9780648
bash	subshell
the reason that bash | cd doesn t work is that each command in a pipeline is run in a separate subshell so bash | cd is essentially equivalent to bash | cd except that the latter launches even more subshell of course

9780648
bash	subshell
which runs cd before running bash since bash will inherit a copy of the execution environment of the subshell it was launched from

9780773
pull	push
i m now wanna add a push and pull function in my phonegap app android .and i wanna add a number in the lauch icon to notify user there are some unread messages

9780788
integer	unsigned
the arc4random function returns an unsigned integer value

9780793
bionic	libc
no the pthread_mutex_lock in android s bionic libc does not impose a context switch for locking a normal mutex in the uncontended state - a simple atomic compare-and-exchange is used followed by a memory barrier

9780793
bionic	libc
you can find the bionic implementation of pthread_mutex_lock and pthread_mutex_unlock in libc bionic pthread.c in the bionic libc sources and see this yourself

9780841
next	except
for a chain of railway carriages every carriage has a member to next carriage except the last carriage

hash	salt
edited to add in a comment above you mention that your hash are random salt

9780942
sorting	filtering
the need a list of msocontrolbutton ids thread on msdn shows how to similarly add sorting and filtering options

9780986
int	double
without having seen a declaration prototype for the function the c compiler will assume that it s returning an int not double so things go terribly wrong

9780997
width	height
for example if a html div has the left top width height attributes 0 0 100 100

9781052
getter	setter
the pojo asset has the setter and getter methods for id time and name

9781154
google-chrome	safari
we use leaflet out front which is buttery smooth on ios s mobile safari but you lose pinch-zoom capabilities in the stock android browser looks like this issue is being resolved with mobile google-chrome android ics

9781160
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
everything is working in google-chrome safari firefox ie9 it just went wrong in ie7 ie8

9781176
hide	show
in the jsfiddle demo after clicking the button you can see the color has changed when you either mouseover the data point or toggle the display by clicking on the legend to hide and then show again

9781224
int	double
so that instead of int i can make my method such that i am able to pass in float double string and other primitive data types + string

9781237

9795496
versioning	upgrade
you might not want to continue support for the older versioning forever but your users would probably appreciate having some time to upgrade when they choose to rather than when your app forces them to

irc	xmpp
i know this is a very old post and the op will likely not see the reply or maybe even care any longer but i would deploy irc over xmpp personally

9795702
irc	xmpp
the irc server does not need to parse the messages passed from the client file transfers are client-to-client via dcc and the design is much much simpler than the xml-based xmpp

9795702
irc	xmpp
regardless the irc protocol is more simplistic in nature can handle orders of magnitude more client connections than xmpp for the same memory utilization uses less bandwidth on the wire doesn t require authentication although you can add this feature etc

9795719

however you can use the following work around this properties would be in a usercontrolbase class from which you would inherited

9796174
user-controls	tabcontrol
i have a user-controls tabusercontrol which contains a tabcontrol

9796174

9796387
width	height
i have a grid of some width and height where each cell can be of three possible values presented as white green and red in this illustration

9796427

one workaround that worked for me was to set the height and width of the container in the cycle options and then specify that the slides must fit the container like so

9796457
loops	while-loop
i tried an nested while-loop but my problem is that my while condition is the identifier value itself 12 so when i read in a new line with a different id 34 this changes the condition for the while loops to the new id value

substance look and feel required in some special cases usage of invokeandwait for jtable jtree swingx s treetable really not important in this case

9796520
for-loop	arrays
so first i make a string arrays with the string dates dailydatasonce maybe that first for-loop is useless but i can skip it

9796555
hash	salt
however for best security practices generally people use a different salt for each password and store the salt alongside the hash in the database

9796555
hash	salt
with a scheme such as this your passwords are made more complex because if an attacker happened to get the hash he d have to also guess the salt during a brute-force attack

9796555
hash	salt
it s the same philosophy as your encodingkey in your configuration file but more secure since each hash has its own salt

as a newcomer to python it s a bit confusing that there is a daemons and python-daemon package and also there s two ways of installing python packages sudo apt-get install and sudo pip install

9796759
getter	setter
first you need to know that for any non-private class var such as the ones used in the original question scala automatically generates getter and setter

9796759
getter	setter
so if we have a var called color scala automatically creates a getter eponymously called color and a setter called color_

9796759
getter	setter
finally putting these facts together you can easily get a type-safe reference to any var s getter setter and use that reference to dynamically set get that var s value

9796786

9797212
implements	extends
start from root nodes n with no incoming edges in this scenario presumably object and all interfaces without superinterfaces -- which one would have to examine the whole set plus all superclasses superinterfaces to collect and process all edges n m all m extends implements n information which again one would have to examine the whole set to collect or

9797212
implements	extends
start from leaf nodes m with no outgoing edges in this scenario all classes interfaces m for which no class k extends implements m exists which again one would have to examine the whole set to collect and process all edges n m all class interfaces m extends implements -- which information we do have

9797254
pop-up	dialog
i believe this dialog box pop-up because the browser doesn t know how to handle the content-type produced by a jsonresult application json and so prompts the user to save the return value instead

indeed with a test array of 100 sizeof int your test data area is only 400 bytes long on most general-purpose platforms today perhaps 800 bytes if youâ re on a 64bit platform or 200 bytes if youâ re using a 16-bit platform

9797444
multiplying	multiplication
if you view the numbers as binary than multiplication by a power of 2 shifts the bits to the left 101 2 3 becomes 101000 in the same way as in decimal multiplying by powers of 10 shift the number to the left 12340 10 3 becomes 12340000

from what i found this is a font engine rendering difference between firefox and google-chrome

9797809
getter	setter
to me this is crazy town as this is the whole point of having a setter...it also means that the property being set in the setter will just be overridden in the getter and therefor pointless

9797809
getter	setter
the concept being...is there any example when you d want to override the getter not setter getter only

9797836
getter	setter
there are plenty of reasons for override both getter and setter methods for example i override setter methods when i make custom uitableviewcell objects so that i can set a property and then within that setter method it will automatically update a label or something within the cell instead of me having to call an update function after setting the property

9797836
getter	setter
i rarely override getter methods myself but i override setter methods quite frequently

hide	show
you could use jquery ajaxstart and ajaxstop to show the progress on start and hide it on end

9798312

width	height
essentially you just need to set the height width equal to the other dimension depending on which way you want to scale it

9798534
for-loop	arrays
but if it is not i would solve this by converting the strings to character arrays and writing a nested for-loop that compares each character and increments a counter when a match is found

9800882
public	protected
if the public property doesn t have a public setter give it a protected setter

9800882
public	protected
this removes the need for a protected variable because derived classes can set the value using the protected setter of the public property

in this expression a-b integer promotions will apply which mean that a and b are likely to be promoted to int and the result of the expression will also be int which is why you get the warning when comparing against 8u which has type unsigned int

9801259
unsigned	short
the promotion would only be to unsinged int rather than int if int couldn t hold all the values of unsigned short which would only happen on platforms where int was the same size as short

9801259
int	chars
when comparing against unsigned chars 8u the unsigned chars will also be promoted to int which is why the warning doesn t happen in this case

9808348
post	get
the request no longer has the method params only querystring and querystring only works with get and not post

9808348
post	get
this is the crude map that combines post parameters and get parameters with get parameters taking precedence

9808352
ubuntu	linux
the usual setup i have seen in this case is to develop on ubuntu in a linux filesystem shared and accessible from windows through a samba share for instance

9808357

so i made a program to do modulo division in ruby using a module

9808412

coldfusion	mura
unfortunately i need to use mura because this site must be made with coldfusion and so far it is the only cms that makes the most sense to me

maven	pom.xml
there are some tools that try to address this problem like a maven plugin that will attempt to generate eclipse project metadata from pom.xml but all have their limitations

9808651
width	height
i want to get the page height and width of a pdf in my app

9808691
post	put
however you need to prevent against mysql injection don t just put data from post into the database

9808727
hash	salt
this will result in an even more secure hash that can easily be reproduced and to my mind makes brute force attacks even more difficult given the fact the salt is mixed in with the password

9808729
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
you will need to of course still perform the steps to actually write read the class object out to a file using objectoutputstream objectinputstream

9808750
slider	jcarousel
jcarousel needs to change the width to enable the slider but the wrapper element should be using overflow hidden

9808772
rowdatabound	onclientclick
you could use the grid s rowdatabound event and attach the javascript onclientclick event

9808789
disk	ram
i installed the berkeleydb module for perl so i can use disk space instead of ram to store this hash

9808800
hide	show
i know how to do this but not how to hide the tooltiptext for the slider that show only integer values

9808808
google-chrome	firefox
it doesn t appear in google-chrome but is there in firefox and ie

9808812
getter	setter
without seeing the code i can t be sure but i d guess that even though search_result is a view your corresponding java object is annotated on the getter and the object has matching setter

9808841
hide	show
i have some divs that i show hide

9808863
superclass	subclassing
in your uidocument subclassing if you override a nsfilepresenter method you can always invoke the superclass implementation super

9808879
portrait	landscape
the issue is that this error is only thrown when the app is started in landscape orientation not portrait

9808879
portrait	landscape
there s nothing that differs between the landscape and portrait launches apart from the orientation of a splash uiview which seems to be working fine

9808890
udp	tcp
the way tcp and udp work i guess you want to use these protocols and create your own on top of them is that a host have to contacts another to exchange information

9808935
typedef	struct
typedef and struct kept together

9808940
x86	mips
there are many different kinds of processors out there arm mips x86 â

9808940
x86	64bit
i can just talk about x86 32bit x86-64 64bit

9808940
x86	64bit
since both x86 and x86-64 use the same opcodes with slightly different meanings a 32-bit application can not just run on a 64bit cpu in 64bit mode long mode

9808990
children	parent
you should set level property for the children in the data which will be used to fill the grid to the level of the parent +1

9808998
puts	gets
if i have the attribute on the root element no matter how it gets there it puts it in its child-nodes

the xamarin.mac xamarin.ios licencing does some kind of hash of the mac hardware to give your machine a unique id

9809236
iprincipal	iidentity
but if you impliment iprincipal and iidentity in your facebookuser object you will be able to set httpcontext.current.user to that facebookuser which will allow you to pull that facebookuser instance from the user property in the controller

9809270
int	chars
i have cin chars int int but i can t find a way to make that optional

9809289

it works for ie8 9 and firefox but fails for google-chrome and safari

9809438
google-chrome	safari
i have searched and tried several modifications like adding the javascriptid parameter nothing seems to work for google-chrome or safari

9809449
post	get
i m taking a wild guess change the get request to post and that should probably fix the problem

9809485
put	get
and when we don t get something out of the box we need to put it in the box

9809493
children	parent
i have a list of parent objects that has a list of children objects

9809493
children	parent
i need to write a query that would give me the parent that has the most children

9809526
children	parent
your query is not correct because c.children.max will try to iterate over children of one parent and if they support comparison children are ints will simply return biggest of them

9809542
int	chars
another common approach for non-web based applications is to restrict the input of the text box to only accept chars which would be parseable into an int

9809596
multiplying	add
i implemented add and multiplying and used that for an exponent example

9809604
min	max
advanced grid excel-style filtering capabilities and the ability to do averages counts max min and sum equations on the fly

9809604
sorting	grouping
column sorting rows grouping showing different views of the data without re-running the query a big time saver when working with gigabytes of logs

9809831
put	get
in some languages you can use the g operator to get all matches in the same place you put the case-insensitivity operator i but in php this is the way you do it

9809832
int	chars
it s just a reader so it has the same methods as any other reader including int read which will return you the unicode code point for each chars one by one

9809842
range	max
at the moment my formula is similar to max row 1 7 -- sum large indirect range row 1 7

9809843
getter	setter
now say i want to create a attribute that is a hash with a getter setter i m confused as to the options i have doing this

9809843
getter	setter
if i don t use the attr_accessor i have to create both the reader and writer or getter setter

9809879
sorting	filtering
also how do i get filtering sorting paging etc

9809896
post	get
once you have the urls with post get params you can reproduce it with a shell script and multiple wget calls

i am using redirecttoaction to prevent resubmission post redirect get pattern and tempdata to pass on view model to thank you page

9809975

9809981
google-chrome	firefox
the kicker being that ie and google-chrome handled it one way and firefox a different way making it seem like a different bug

9810022

i m thinking at an object that can contain int floats and double

9810111
apache	nginx
and question what i should be use server nginx or apache but i am choose nginx

in this case close the second emulator and restart adb via the ddms app or on the command line by using adb kill-server followed by adb start-server

9810150
mechanize	typhoeus
recently i was using mechanize for this kind of thing but i want to use typhoeus which i m already using everywhere else

9810190
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
however as far as i can tell this doesnâ t seem to work for elements in google-chrome and safari or firefox until 3.6 and there it stops the user from tabbing any further through the page once they reach the

9810200
hash	md5
you can create a md5 hash value without problems

9810228
int	chars
it uses the fact that you can subtract 0 from any digit chars to get the value of that digit and that you can explicitly convert from int to cellalignment

9810236
maven	pom.xml
and there is difference when i run mvn install from command line on the parent pom.xml to eclipse m2 plugin run-- maven install

9810236
maven	pom.xml
but if i go to my parent pom.xml run-- maven install it s run just fine with no error when i try to clean

9810246
rss	feed
installing canto the command line rss feed reader i get this error

9810260
width	height
i think you need to style that iframe to have a width and height

9810280
hide	show
i don t remember the details but i read something somewhere that used javascript and css somehow to show hide things on the page

9810291
folder	directory
in this case try to browse folder using terminal because some directory are hidden

9810383
versioning	upgrade
now this module is one versioning behind current so maybe you can learn drupal by learning to upgrade the module

9810389
x86	64bit
with 64bit x86 code you need

9810450
free	calloc
i m writing a shell in c++ and i need a constructor for my commandline class that parses a command from the istream and then uses the calloc and free system calls to dynamically create argc and argv variables

9810466
children	parent
if a region is a parent â i need the count for all its children down as many levels and branches as it goes

9810466
children	parent
in other words if region 255 has parent 130 and 130 has parent 67 and 67 has parent 2 i need a count for 2 including all children and branches and a count for 67 including all its children and branches and so on

9810473
hash	md5
the pg_crypto module provides a number of standard hash functions md5 sha1 etc

9810504
nsstring	nsdata
similarly watch any use of anything that takes a length argument such as in nsstring and nsdata

9810563
post	put	post	get	put	get
for example using a post on a read-only get resource or put on a write resource that only accepts post s

9810604
mvvm	delegatecommand
i ve now moved the code behind for mvvm in a view model and use a delegatecommand on the hyperlink button

9810607
slug	permalinks
so if your theme allows for media files and permalinks to have their own page and the slug is the same as another one it will usually append a number to it because the database does not like it

9810615
cvs	svn
i ve seen this happen in cvs and svn as well so i m assuming it s a fairly common problem across any of the version control systems eclipse supports

9810625
weblogic	oc4j
we have recently moved to weblogic from oc4j where we used to configure this in system-jazn-data.xml

9810641
mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave
i mean i have a div with a mouseover mouseenter event and i want to trigger the action only if the mouseleave to the left side of the div and to the right but if it leaves from bottom or top it shouldn t trigger any action

9810702
folder	directory
from there the ajax script calls a php script which looks in that folder and gets a list of all of the directory and images in that folder

9810720
post	put
but if i put it inside a click event it no longer post

9810759
mousemove	mouseenter	mousemove	mouseleave	mouseleave	mouseenter
it uses mousemove in the tutorial but it also works for mouseenter mouseleave

9810770
width	height
and add a custom handler with javascript to get the co-ordinates of the element the height and width and track if the mouse co-ordinates are past your boundary

9810770
width	height
your mouse-out event fires the handler locates the element at x y - 10 10 the height is 20 and the width is 20

9810847
apache	nginx
the traditional way to do this is to use rewriterules in apache and i think nginx but if you re not familiar with them they will want to make you decide software was a bad career path and that one of those dirty jobs would be preferable

9810847
sorting	filtering
the case where this tends to matter is when you re adding query-string parameters sorting filtering searching paginating or even just for tracking that look different to google but are pretty much the same page

9810850
kombu	celery
i am using celery + kombu with amazon sql

9810889
gif	png
yours is written as if all image attempts fail which is not possible if a gif jpg png actually was uploaded

9810942
scrypt	md5
md5 and sha1 are well known examples but if you re building new code without strict performance constraints sha256 would be the one to chose and if you re looking to make it very difficult to recover the original words you might want to consider scrypt or bcrypt although they aren t as popular and unlikely that your language will include them in the standard library

9810944
put	get
to get a performance boost you need minimum to put the data on different disks preferably use sharding to place the data on different servers

9810947
getter	setter
attr_reader defines the getter attr_writer defines the setter and attr_accessor defines both

9810947
getter	setter
the error is because only getter method is defined but no setter

9810978
nsstring	nsdata
you declare htmldata to be an nsdata but the actual object you re assigning to it is an nsstring

9810987
pull	push
after reviews are complete we pull from the project s central repository rebase and push

9811038
pull	push
i think that this is possible because git remote show origin has told me at times that i have had branches configured for git pull but not for git push

9811043
rss	feed
on march 13 www.cliws.com hosted on google app engine stopped to fetch hn s rss feed located at

9811085
nginx	lighttpd	apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd
if you re serving large files however you might want to leave that task to your webserver you can use the x-accel-redirect header on nginx and x-sendfile for apache lighttpd to have your webserver serve the file for you

9811091
int	double
the details will vary based on the machine and compiler but assume that a float is 4 bytes a double is 8 bytes and an int is 4 bytes

9811223
apache	nginx
some people use apache or nginx in front of thin for production servers

9811232
pop-up	dialog
in the case you are using your service by setting up a service reference in the consuming application then an even easier method would be to right-click the service name select configure service reference... and about 1 3rd the way down of the dialog that pop-up there will be a dropdown with collection type label

9811263
post	get
i am trying to get a piece of data back using jquery ajax via a post response but i cannot seem to display the data

9811269
post	get
happens seemingly random regardless of request type ajax get and post requests have all led to this behavior

9811295
google-chrome	safari
linux x86_64 applewebkit 535.21 khtml like gecko google-chrome 19.0.1042.0 safari 535.21 to test if that changes anything

9811310
width	height
how can i get the position width height when a div is wrapped around a polygon in the svg

9811357
put	get
that is no further changes and you really need to convert it to your own format than doing it manually which is tiresome so what you can do is get the fields name and its value and according to your rules put it in your own object

9811397
versioning	upgrade
i just upgrade symfony to the 2.0.12 versioning

9811429
mp3	ogg
i m trying to accomplish a simple doodle-like behaviour where a mp3 ogg sound rings on click using the html tag

9811429
firefox	safari
it is supposed to work under firefox safari and safari ipad is veri desireable

9811429
firefox	safari
this seems to work great under firefox but safari seems to have a delay whenever you click even when you click several times and the audio file has loaded

9811485
box-sizing	border-box	height	border-box
the secret there is to use box-sizing border-box and some padding to make the second div height 100 but move it s content down 50px

9811488
hide	show
i can hide the toolbar with an animation but i can t let it show up again

9811512
avaudioplayer	audiotoolbox
this looks to be the same general backtrace as avaudioplayer throws breakpoint in debug mode though mine is the result of a more direct invocation of audiotoolbox

9811515
bash	zsh
in bash and zsh you can use handy readline shortcuts like these to navigate between words delete from the middle of the line etc

9811531
apache	nginx
based on the interchanged apache and nginx in your title question i m guessing you may have two web servers running

9811531
apache	nginx
apache or nginx on the other hand are specially designed and hardened to be able to be exposed to public networks such as the internet without jeopardizing the security of your system

9811531
apache	nginx
keep in mind as well that the primary purpose of having a reverse proxy in place is so that the only publicly exposed service on your machine is apache nginx -- so be sure to configure your firewall to block port 8787

9811567
google-chrome	firefox
we can not reproduce this error with our ie8 installs on our machines or on their machines running firefox or google-chrome

9811594
actionscript	mxml
but now i m wondering if i can make this image as the image below in flex 4 4.5 4.6 in mxml and or actionscript 3

9811639
put	get
that approach seems roundabout to me as you get strings from a stream only to put it into another stream

9811652
servicebus	was
so somehow on my test environment machine the servicebus scan of the directory for a class that calls ihandlemessages was failing to find my class even though the assembly was absolutely there

9811673
put	get
use the order you put the columns in to understand the lists that you get when you read the csv one line at a time- the order of the columns and the order of the items in each row is the same so use that information to index correctly into the list to find each field

9811696
google-chrome	safari
the issue we are seeing is most prevalent in safari but also shows itself occasionally in ie and google-chrome

9811742
vmware	bootcamp
it s like what vmware fusion did on a mac which boots windows in bootcamp as a virtual machine

9811780
mouseover	mouseout
jquery s .hover can use a function for the mouseover and mouseout states so it s trivial to do something like

9811801
free	realloc
if the call to realloc fails then you can no longer free the original buffer

9811824
post	get
i found this blog post really useful to get started

9811828
post	get
more specific i need to use proxy list for multithreaded post requests right now i am testing with single threaded get requests

9811848
ssl	https
naturally i have removed the force ssl and allowed both http and https for the time being

9811848
post	get
to show the difference clearly i made an anonymous post request to the end point it could have been a get request the end point has no real methods but thus returns a message to let us know it is still there

9811851
aggregate-functions	sum
for more information about the return type of the sqlstatement and how to access properties of the result object when using aggregate-functions such as sum where u should use aliases such as sum amount as sumamount to later access the property like resultobject sumamount or resultobject.sumamount

9811917
put	get
where you can put a class that will get executed

9811918
youtube	vimeo
if on my ipad i load a youtube or vimeo video to a uiwebview with this set to it s default value of yes and play the video while mirroring to an airplay device the video signal is sent to the airplay device and takes over the airplay device screen and tv connected this video is playing on the tv is displayed in the uiwebview on the airplay

9811940
pop-up	dialog
i have a delphi 2006 app which can pop-up a modal dialog in response to an error condition

9811974
post	get
when you get the post with the signed request decode it and check if the user is authenticated if he is persist the data token and such somewhere session db cache

9811974
post	get
there should be only two times where facebook sends you the request once it is post when your canvas is loaded the 2nd is when the user returns from the authentication dialog in which you either get the code parameter or error in case the user declined the authentication

9811993
put	get
sometimes if you put the url later in the dynamic url it will get stuck loading

9812008
yacc	bison
bison yacc are very powerful tools and with great power comes great responsibility -

9812008
yacc	bison
imho lots are put off because they are also told to use yacc bison which are much more powerful subtle and complex tools

cpu	processors
the place you get into trouble with cache coherency on general purpose platforms whether or not they re multiprocessor is when your processors has separate instruction data caches and you write self-modifying code the instructions written to memory are indistinguishable from data so the cpu doesn t invalidate those locations in the instruction cache so there may be stale instructions in the instruction cache unless you subsequently invalidate those locations in the instruction cache either issuing your own processor-specific assembly instructions which you might not be allowed to do depending on your os and your thread s privilege level or else issuing the appropriate cache-invalidate system call for your os

if you do that judging from your professor s comments that should boil down to a single multiplying instruction that does 32bit 32bit 64bit multiplication

9815530
128bit	64bit
if you use 64bit integers as your inputs there may not be a 64bit 64bit 128bit instruction on your cpu but even if there is it s overkill for your assignment

9815530
128bit	64bit
if there isn t then the compiler will emit a sequence of instructions to perform the 64bit 64bit 128bit multiplication making it oh-so-much-harder for you to understand what s going on

9828186
equals	gethashcode
firstly as i think you understand wherever you implement equals you must also implement gethashcode

9828186
equals	gethashcode
the implementation of gethashcode must reflect the behaviour of the equals implementation but it doesn t usually use it

9828186
equals	gethashcode
as for whether you need to re-implement gethashcode in subclasses - yes if you also override equals - as per the first and main point - the implementation of the two must be consistent - if two items are considered equals by equals then they must return the same value from gethashcode

9830286
google-chrome	firefox
as i said in my comment you can use the net tab in firebug for firefox called timeline in google-chrome to see the actual load order on your page - you can even filter it on firefox for css only or images only - this will enable you to test

disk	ram
then later on when you use that memory again the os loads that whole page from disk back into physical ram

9833086
distance	polygons
only polygons whose distance from the base are similar may be similar to each other

9833086
distance	polygons
now you only need to consider groups of polygons with similar distance when deciding which to delete

if ever you change things so that something else has to be set along with bfield or if bfield doesn t need a backing field at all -- for instances if setting it should set something on a subobject you ll be glad you called setbfield -- cause you won t have a dozen places to change code that sets bfield

9834207
versioning	upgrade
it obviously depends on the layout of your application and where this data is stored and how the clients are going to be upgrade but there could be a new versioning flag of some sort associated with the stored ciphertext

9834207
versioning	upgrade
when reading the ciphertext and this new field doesn t match the unicdoe flag you could upgrade the ciphertext by decrypting and encrypting using unicode plaintext and then re-save the ciphertext and set the new flag or simply put-off the ciphertext versioning upgrade until the plaintext has changed and needs to be updated.

9834235
getter	setter
right click - select source - generate getter setter

google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i just tested this on a galaxy nexus running android 4.0.2 in the default browser the latest opera mobile and firefox and google-chrome beta

9834308

i then entered the command sudo chmod a+rx etc udev rules.d 99-android.rules then i typed in sudo restart udev and then i typed in adb kill-server and then i typed in nohup adb start-server

9834331
getter	setter
create getter and setter for it then move on to the next step - changing its values in your other methods

9834331
superclass	subclassing
you define most of the default behavior in your superclass then selectively override or change just the pieces that are appropriate in your subclassing

9834359
cfstring	nsstring
because nsstring and cfstring are toll-free bridged you can simply cast from one to the other

9834395
int	double	int	chars
i have a union type of array of three int 4 bytes each a float 4 bytes a double 8 bytes and a chars 1 byte

9834395
int	chars
if i assign 0x31313131 to each of the three int elements and then printed the union s chars i will get the number 1

9834414
int	chars
you are printing it as chars not int

9834414
int	double	int	chars
since it is a union all the int and chars share the same memory location the float and double does not matter in this context

9834414
int	chars
so assigning 0x31313131 to the int does affect the chars value -- nothing much confusing there

9834448
getter	setter
then the task would just need the project id and a getter and setter method

9834481
children	parent
i will double check this but i believe that if you spin up tasks within tasks then the parent will not be considered complete until all of the children are complete

9834500
hash	md5
finally for the op i m hoping by add you meant streaming data through the md5 hash algorithm and aren t intending to invent your own security algorithm

pop-up	dialog	google-chrome	firefox
but this creates a pop-up dialog that is blocked by default by both google-chrome and firefox

9834683
public	protected
object.clone is protected so we must override it with a public method in order for it to be accessible

9834683
getter	setter
clonebean will clone a bean based on the available property getter and setter even if the bean class itself does not implement cloneable

9834694
children	parent
for instance if you used container approach in step 1 and children approach in step 2 you might desire to improve the speed of certain algorithms and add references between each each node and its parent

9834723
put	get
i had tried to to put checkbox in listview through layout inflator and i got success but the problem is when i select the multiple contacts there is no problem but when i deselect it when i scroll down then go back to that deselected checkbox its get automatically selected.

9834732
visualvm	jstat
application hang i would start with visualvm or jstat both are part of jdk

9834747
int	chars
theses two links are great specially about to know more about the main reason of this header that is portability but for me what i like most about it that i think uint8_t is cleaner than unsigned chars for storing an rbg channel value for example int32_t looks more meaningfull than simply int etc

9834747
atoi	strtok
if everywhere how can i user functions like atoi strtok etc with it

9834794
google-chrome	firefox

9834803
compass	neat
obviously this is not a very neat solution but given that compass does not allow us to set the position of images within a sprite sheet this is not possible anyway

9834832
int	double
so for example if you cast from an int to a double it will always be exact but for casting into into a float it will no longer be exact for very large int

9834832
floating-point	integer
there is one major example of extensive usage of floating point numbers as a substitute for integers it s the lua scripting language which has no integer built-in type and floating-point numbers are used extensively for logic and flow control etc

9834832
multiplication	exponent	exponent	addition	addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition
denormalized numbers very very small numbers where the exponent has reached smallest possible value are often treated as zero and approximations in implementation of power logarithm sqrt and 1 x 2 can be made but addition subtraction comparison and multiplication should retain their properties for numbers which can be exactly represented

9834842

folder	directory
delete the public folder and put the zend framework files from it index.php .htaccess etc in your root directory htdocs

9834927
folder	directory
this way your zend application will run from your root directory and you won t need to use mod_rewrite to hide the public folder

9834929

9835687
hash	salt
you usually only save a salt hash of that password

9835687
hash	salt
as for storing login information in a cookie i d then store a salt hash of that password hash in the cookie

9835687
hash	salt
upon get you just create a salt hash of the stored password hash and compare it with the one from the cookie

9835692
int	double
int float double .

9835695
hash	md5
another issue is that you are storing only the md5 hash of the password inside the cookie and you expect to be able to decrypt it later with formsauthentication.decrypt which is not possible

9836044
awt	swing
this is required for almost all interactions with awt and swing classes

9836044
awt	swing
notice that this uses a swing helper library that should be fine for awt but even better is to start using swing

9836055
strtol	atoi
you could use isnum to check the individual strings or just call strtol atoi and check if errno was set to einval

9836079
put	get
you can download the command line tools or simply get mysql workbench and put in your hostname and test the connection

9836093

9836388
boost	allocator
since boost intrusive list leaves allocator to you you could keep your objects in a std vector and allocate them in batches

9836388
boost	allocator
since using the custom allocator for std list is probably around as messy as using a boost intrusive list i d go with boost because you get many other useful features with that such as keeping the same object in multiple lists etc.

9836438

with kplaylist you can stream your music ogg mp3 wav wma etc. you can upload make playlists share search download and a lot more

9836448
getter	setter
not sure if i get what you mean but you in objective c you use setter and getter to modify your variables

9836453
superclass	subclassing
another simple solution would be to use a class hierarchy with the superclass implementing the - void draw method and every subclassing that needed a different implementation could override it

9836462
button	checkbox
when you then click the show button it s another postback in which your checkbox has not been created so it doesn t exist

9836462
button	checkbox
you can keep the add button but it won t actually add a checkbox to the page it ll just make it visible by setting visible to true

9836481
button	checkbox
run the application and click the add button to create the checkbox then click the newly added button and the checkbox will be gone after the postback

9837529
hide	show
trying to make a toggle button that hide show the right window pane

9837531
jruby	mri
there s no such thing to my knowledge with webrick - it s basically the very same ruby code with jruby as it is with mri .

9837533
swt	swing
however there is a desktop application framework called griffon that uses the same language as grails groovy which should be easier than using swing or swt

9837582

the hide show is functioning based on the following script

9837713
lxml	beautifulsoup
since beautifulsoup uses lxml i tested to see if lxml could handle the files independently

9837713
lxml	beautifulsoup
my current suspicion is some weird memory issue since the file size seems to make a difference perhaps in conjunction with some bug in how beautifulsoup 4 interacts with lxml

via jquery i get the values of my browsers height and width

9837739
width	height
i send them with ajax to my script and simply calculate my width and height in the request

9837774
width	height
the itemscontrol then gets a datatemplate where height and width are bound to the properties of the items using a converter to display them properly

9837780
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
the push segue is modeled for use with changing views from the uitableviewcontroller uinavigationcontroller modal is acceptable switching between uiviewcontroller

9837808
youtube	vimeo
videos are from youtube vimeo etc

opera	google-chrome
works in google-chrome ie 9 not 8 and opera at least version 11.61 which is the one i have installed

9837921
telerik	radcombobox
i ve achieved this before but i did so using telerik radcombobox which was capable of including an item template

9837922

9838030
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
what i am doing currently is on a selection of a information required checkbox a dropdownlistfor is shown as follows

9838033

9838355
pull	push
i m guessing to create a master project and push new modifications to there and pull new version to all other projects

9838367
hide	show
in this example the information about the element to hide show is passed along with href attribute and the event handler is not inline so you can avoid to call the same function multiple times mixing javascript and markup together

versioning	upgrade
after moving my magento to a test area and upgrade my versioning to 1.6.2 my product data got corrupted

9842765
implements	extends
i created a class that extends window s richtextbox and implements docsitecontrol and then set suppressattachments 0 in its initialization but still no go

9842768
implements	extends
i think about all you could do is extends their class like you did above and then say implements

9842784
put	get
put file into js-beutifier or get not minified version and find getrowdata function

9842825
dbcontext	objectcontext
there s also a savingchanges event on objectcontext which you can obtain from the dbcontext

9842875
kde	kubuntu
i looked at konsolecalendar kde but it seems to be broken on my kubuntu linux

9842917
getter	setter
i always assumed that because c# getter setter are really methods in disguise then reading public field must be faster than calling a getter

9842939
hide	show
i believe it will only do a show hide but if you use it as an actual event handler it will do what ever you want it to

9842940
children	parent
this child module has dependencies on other modules in the overall set so the parent has 8 children 1 - 8 this module #5 depends on 2 and 3

9842945
google-chrome	firefox
at 1000 divs on the page ie9 firefox and google-chrome have no problem whatsoever and don t even seem to hiccup when scrolling

9842945
google-chrome	firefox
at 10 000 divs ie9 and google-chrome are able to scroll with a barely-noticeable delay still within the acceptable range in my book however firefox begins to lag more noticeably to the point where you feel the scroll bar is jumping into position a half-second later than it should

9842945
google-chrome	firefox
ie9 and google-chrome perform with only a barely perceptible delay in scrolling with google-chrome being the slightly smoother of the two and firefox has a delay that is very noticeable and would probably be considered annoying but still functions reasonably well it doesn t crash

9842949
portrait	landscape
however when the device is in the landscape mode the transition animation performs as if the device is still in the portrait mode

9842960
implements	extends
if you directly implements that interface rather than extends one of the above base classes then you need to implements handlerequest directly

9842963
width	height
example constructor gameobject x y width height text

9843000
getter	setter
as the getter setter are trivial very simple code the method calls are destroyed and the getter setter written in the surrounding code

9843000
getter	setter
this does not happen in debug mode in order to support debugging the ability to set a breakpoint in a getter or setter

9843005
min	max
however approx by default returns na for values outside the min or max x supplied

9843006
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
ie9 google-chrome firefox and opera all have good consoles for viewing objects

9843015
width	height
imagecopy base_image top_image 0 0 0 0 width height

9843029
portrait	landscape
in landscape mode the list and editor fragments are positioned side by side but in portrait mode only the list is shown in the main activity and the editor is shown by launching a new activity

9843029
portrait	landscape
under normal conditions this all works fine but when the screen is rotated from landscape to portrait and the main activity is destroyed and created again it seems to call onactivitycreated plus other callbacks on my editor fragment even though it is not part of the display now since in portrait mode it is just the list that is shown

9843043
google-chrome	firefox
i would appreciate any advice for changing the html and css to make it compatible between browsers ie9 firefox google-chrome

9843043
google-chrome	firefox
this is therefore not fixable by changing the relative positions of the buttons as any change to fix on browser results in inconsistent positioning in the others ie fix ie google-chrome and firefox misalign buttons

9843082
disk	ram
how much cpu ram disk io is in use

9843092
put	get
we get the unique video id from the url by matching the pattern but where i put this code to match before save

basically the idea is to start a interval on mousedown and clear on mouseup

9843133
width	height
canvas src bt.pjs width 450 height 450 canvas

9843142
google-chrome	firefox
i then use jquery s .each function to iterate through that array but in firefox it iterates down while in google-chrome it iterates up

9843142
google-chrome	firefox
firefox goes 610 - 606 while google-chrome fors 606 - 610

9843190
button	checkbox
my problem is the checkbox does not retain its state and also each time when i click the save button it removes the added roles choose

9843222
min	max
maybe it s just a glitch i found a workaround by calling axischange before setting the min and max

9843243
google-chrome	firefox
use firebug w firefox to debug your webpage or load the page in google-chrome and hit f12

9843249
popover	tooltip
to me a popover just looks like a larger tooltip with thicker borders

9843251
icmp	tcp
you should read up on icmp and tcp as well as the osi model

9843266
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox

ok first the basics i m running cordova 1.5.0 phonegap with the latest version of childbrowser from the phonegap-plugins the one compatible with cordova 1.5 xcode 4.3.1 and ios 5.1

9843296
for-loop	arrays
if it evaluates as true you should then get the depth as an integer and use a for-loop such as creating an arrays of arrays as the one written above

9843311
spaces	delimiter
you need a spaces after the word delimiter

9843326
pop-up	dialog
i ve noticed when enclose the smart wizard within an additional tag with the intent of displaying the wizard within a jquery dialog pop-up the wizard will not advance steps when a function is specified for the onleavestep event

9843335
put	get
but i want to get a good advise here on where to put it and if possible how

9843342
popover	tooltip
for example popover have a header and content section but tooltip are just content

9843374
google-chrome	firefox
it looks like google-chrome needs preventdefault and firefox needs stoppropagation so return false accomplishes both of these

9843419
filesystems	ntfs
a quick search suggests that you should be using session_write_close to close the session when you are done using it if you are on an ntfs filesystems

9843426
opera	firefox
i cant test in any other version of ie just yet and firefox and opera work fine and even as i say ie works with the fiddle i created

9843447

my maven project has a few library dependencies defined in the in pom.xml

9843450
hide	show
im using this code to show hide a div

9843462
popover	tooltip
popover require tooltip to be included

9843462
popover	tooltip
aside from the visual difference popover have an option to display both a title and content while tooltip only have an option to display a title

9843498
google-chrome	firefox
it gives a different incorrect value for position.top in google-chrome but correct in firefox

9843515
folder	directory
for example if i have a parent directory of sales with child folder management customers and salesteam and i define a deny rule for sales then all users roles must be explicitly allowed in the child directory

9843555
pull	push
the basic commands you re going to need to learn to use git effectively include add status diff commit pull push checkout merge and branch

9843559
qtreewidget	qabstractitemmodel
i have a custom qabstractitemmodel used to display information in a qtreewidget

9843560
freetype	libpng
building matplotlib requires libpng and freetype as well which isn t a python library so pip doesn t handle installing it or freetype

9843565
ant	maven
in case you don t get an answer on how to do this from the ant plugin take a look at the copy goal of the maven dependency plugin

9843568
width	height
pixels is an imagedata array obtained by calling context.getimagedata left top width height with the stored drawing coordinates

9843577
pop-up	dialog
or you could pop-up a working alert dialog and remove it from within onpostexecute .

9843578
width	height
they fill up the whole bitmap in width and height both but in all four edges there are transparent areas of course as it s a circle in a square

9843631
post	put	post	get	put	get
but the core verbs are get post put delete which map to their associated http verbs

9843699
google-chrome	firefox
the code is working correctly in firefox and google-chrome

9843711
rss	feed
i tried to include an rss feed into one of my tabs but at the moment - it seems like i am having no luck

9843733
apache	nginx
you need to have mod_rpaf installed in apache and in nginx add the following

9843756
accessor	properties
also you should use ember s universal accessor get getpath set setpath when using properties on ember.object s

9843840
children	parent
bound to multiple selectors relating to same element bound to children within a parent ...

9843905
rss	feed
i did this some time before for validating rss feed

9843963
put	get
put quotes around the bar to make it actually have a value semi-colons and var on the objects but you get the point

9843976
rss	feed
my application is pulling in xml data from an rss feed

9844005
google-chrome	safari
since the performance profiler is pretty much identical in safari and google-chrome you should be able to determine this yourself

9844005
google-chrome	safari
your demo runs fine on both safari and google-chrome on my machine

9844005
google-chrome	safari
anyway i can t tell you why drawimage performs worse on google-chrome than safari only that it does when an image fails to load and is then drawn

9844005
google-chrome	safari
it seems to show google-chrome 19 running twice as fast as safari on my windows 7 machine

9844047
portrait	landscape
when the screen is rotated from landscape to portrait and the main activity is destroyed and created again it seems to call onactivitycreated plus other callbacks on my editor fragment even though it is not part of the display now since in portrait mode it is just the list that is shown

9844084
put	get
if i try to call a function that takes a parameter which i need to do so i can get the text entered by the user in the text box it won t even hit the function at all i put a break point on it and it never hits the break point

9844138
versioning	upgrade
so those are my two points - try to find an ics based device so you don t need to upgrade right away - and so that you can test your app on live hardware for the newest sdk versioning

9844165
tablet	galaxy
i would get the samsung galaxy 10 tablet

9844177
folder	directory
if you re not worried about losing history do a git checkout mybranch and then copy the directory contents to another folder

9844179
switching	screens
it doesn t want to work when certain movie clips are underneath it but i don t want to make it more complicated by switching to another screens

9844184
opencv	emgucv
using emgucv opencv wrapper the problem here is that when i use setcaptureproperty with cap_prop.cv_cap_prop_pos_frames avi_ratio or msec to sets capture s position the position isn t seted correctly i checked it using getcaptureproperty next to the setcaptureproperty instruction

9844224
explode	implode
use implode explode

9844238
tablet	galaxy
i d probably +1 for galaxy 10 tablet - they seem pretty popular and good modding scene support

9844274
pull	push
pull down the branch like normal and then push the branch to a new repository that you have created using git init

9844282
multiplying	add
if we take advantage of the property that bit shifting to the left is equivalent to multiplying by 2 to the power of the number of bits shifted we can bit-shift up to the nearest power of 2 and use our previous algorithm to add up from there

9844291
put	get
which is why i put the for instance in instances but now i get this new issue of not displaying errors when saving a invalid object

9844403
for-loop	loops
and concluding with a quote from delphi s help on the compiler error message for-loop variable element may be undefined after loops

9844403
for-loop	loops
you can only rely on the final value of a for-loop control variable if loops is left with a goto or exit statement

9844469
put	get
the firefox browser does get launched but it does not put the url in address and program throws exception with out sufficient information

9844494
gson	jackson
i ve been given a sample of the resulting json and i am concerned that i will have to parse the json by hand that i won t be able to use normal class mapping provided by tools such as gson or jackson

9844517
avr	microcontroller
there are some implementations of classical string tools for avr microcontroller like arduino but they are done in a procedural way and not in an object-oriented way for c-style strings

9844528
idictionary	ilist
i also chose to implement various methods for sorting the way that does since this is essentially a hybrid ilist and idictionary

9844536
post	get
see the documentation for jquery get and jquery post

9844561
width	height
try this to loop through each select element and change its height width as you mentioned in your comment

9844585
superclass	subclassing
-creating a superclass for sprite resources and then create subclassing for every type of resource i need

9844594
filesystems	ntfs
one option is to create a hidden filesystems or map the virtual filesystems to the directory on existing ntfs drive eg

9844641
put	get
an awkward way of doing things i know but it s for coursework and i wanted to put an insertion sort in somewhere to try get an extra mark l

9844665
scrollable	panels
this does not pose a problem since the panels on which this thing is embedded is scrollable

9844733
postgresql	mysql
not free but i use navicat premium as a front end for mysql postgresql sqlite ms sql oracle

9844737
onfocus	onblur
try adding onfocus event on the window object to trigger your updates and add onblur to stop updating your live feeds

9844750
hide	show
but with javascript especially when using jquery it s pretty trivial to show hide change form elements and page sections dynamically based on the state of the form

9844750
hide	show
what you would do is attach event listeners to the form elements which drive the dynamic content and those listeners would show hide change page elements accordingly

9844757
uitextfield	accessoryview
even better idea is to make the uitextfield an accessoryview of the cell instead of adding it as a subview

9844770
accessor	properties
when using properties on ember objects always use ember s universal accessor get getpath set and setpath

9844846
uitableview	nsindexpath
- uitableviewcell tableview uitableview tableview cellforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

9844856
realloc	malloc
i am dynamically allocating the memory using malloc and realloc

9844880
put	get
on the other hand it doesn t make sense to put against an uri which will return a 303 see other when using get

9844920
getter	setter
checkoutclientconfigurationdto minus all the boilerplate getter setter

9844999
width	height
because of that i stored width and height in the struct as well

9845010
for-loop	loops
if you are using any js loops then for each loops is slower than normal for-loop you might wanna take a look at this

9845059
put	get
but i don t get how to put the xml in the mule-config.xml file

9845067
width	height
position fixed absolute are default take content width height

9845096
stdout	fflush
if you want stdout to update frequently make sure you call sys.stdout.flush to guarantee that the stream is actually published at that point rather than relying on implicit fflush which may not happen until the work completes

9845112
width	height
the audio player is going to be completed obscured to user aka zero width height div element so the look of the player is irrelevant for my needs

9845124
opera	google-chrome
the custom elements specification is available in google-chrome and opera and becoming available in other browsers

9845134
folder	directory
when i had the uploads folder in the same directory as the uploader.php script it was working however i placed my uploader.php script in the admin folder while keeping the uploads in the root folder

9845272
puts	gets
it gets the userid username email for each user and puts it in an array

9845277
bytearrayoutputstream	inputstream
since the input is a java inputstream we could use some kind of encoder to encode image as a png and write it to a bytearrayoutputstream which later will be fed to the above test class as a bytearrayinputsteam and the the gamma information if any will be removed

9845292
matplotlib	scipy
i have a bunch of matlab code from my ms thesis which i now want to convert to python using numpy scipy and matplotlib and distribute as open-source

9845305
postgresql	mysql
i don t know how great is triggers support in mysql since i switched to postgresql before mysql even had them

9845337
width	height	actualheight	actualwidth
update to get the actualheight and actualwidth values of the canvas during runtime you can add an event handler for sizechanged easy to do within the xaml but not too hard within code to handle the change in height width value during runtime

9845420
strdup	malloc
this can be done either manually with malloc or using strdup

9845437
width	text-align
update 2 setting the ul to block fixes it as its currently inline-table but that removes the ability to have it set to the width of its childs and align it via text-align

9845474
versioning	upgrade
if you need string concatenation in sql upgrade to a more recent versioning of se

9845476
folder	directory
directory php_dir which is your pear lib folder

9845476
versioning	upgrade
upgrade your pear install to current versioning cmdline pear upgrade pear

9845478
int	boolean
add a variable that will keep track whether it is the first or second if testing whether it is the first or second then you can use a boolean variable otherwise use an int counter and do an if else based on the variable

9845478
for-loop	loops
or you can take an alternative approach by subsituting the while loops for a for-loop as in the following code

9845504
mouseup	mousedown
however it appears that click mousedown and mouseup events are handled correctly

9845533
width	height
the height and width of both are same

9845541
gridview	linqdatasource
create a gridview using a linqdatasource with your new datacontext to pull in the appropriate data and display it

9845550
websphere	ibm
i m developing an ear war application with ibm rad 7.5 and websphere 7

9845579
children	parent
the reason for all this effort is that if a parent object is deleted then the children objects which contain data should still be allowed to be viewed even though their parent is gone

9845579
children	parent
fair enough but there is no point of keeping it around when the children have become more relevant than the parent and for whatever reason the parent no longer is required to be kept

9845579
children	parent
at a later time the children may be re-assigned to a different parent object

9845590
versioning	upgrade
so the only thing i can think of being a variable is the versioning of py2app and its deps which have obviously been upgrade over time

9845633
stdout	stderr
i understand how to use stdin stdout stderr to interact with a user via the command line on a per-command basis like git maven javac etc.

9845699
mef	prism
i am having another go at a wpf application incorporating prism mef and attempting to gain a better understanding of the mvvm pattern

9845825
userprincipal	directoryentry
userprincipal has a method getunderlyingobject which will return the directoryentry

9845828
prepare	execute
so prepare your insert syntax iterating over your data array in a regular loop or using custom query builder than execute it once

9845831
put	get
if you instead put it in tableview didselectrowatindexpath note the slightly different name you ll get the callback as soon as the cell is tapped and the accessory view should appear immediately

9845848
children	parent
for extra credit you can make it a nested set relationship which will allow you to pull the parent and all the children in one query

9845924
pop-up	dialog
i have a very large wpf application that i work on and there are certain places where it just doesn t make sense to do mvvm usually when you get into simple dialog and pop-up windows

9845931
jar	war
the main maven idea is that each module must produce a single build artifact a jar or a war file

9845945
stateless	stateful
i was just reading an article ibm.com developerworks webservices library ws-restful about restful apis and after encountering the bit about paging i was worried that my quite stateful queue was similar to incrementing by a page but they re actually quite different as next page is relative on the client side whereas pop is always stateless for the client it doesn t matter what was popped before

9845963
put	get
but it requires you put all of your code into a single statement without a semi-colon to get the result

9845976
int	double
none of the other answers has mentioned visual basic which at least through version 6 has two operators for dividing int converts the int to double and returns a double while performs normal int arithmetic

9845976
int	double
another alternative would be to have only one int operation which always returns a double and require programmers to truncate it

9845976
int	double
this means you have to perform two int- double conversions a truncation and a double- int conversion every time you want int division

9845976
int	double
when the floating-point division of int is needed it may be invoked explicitly with a simple short and clear cast double a b rather than a b

9846018
gmail	hotmail
i used the same code with gmail and it worked but it didn t work with hotmail

9846027
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
for google-chrome 17 firefox 10 and opera 11 no issues

9846038
pull	push
-- then everybody can just push to and pull from it and that s it

9846038
pull	push
hg update creates a working directory in the repository on the server which you don t need if you only want to push and pull from that repository

9846038
pull	push
setting up the server also includes permissions not necessarily file permissions on the server - more like who has push pull permissions on a certain repository

9846038
pull	push
so the cloning to the dev subdomain is not for the sake of having one more repository to push pull but just for deploying a test environment

9846071
google-chrome	firefox
the test case passes in firefox and google-chrome but fails in ie9

9846102
submit	submission
so make a form submit event handler that displays your message and or replaces the submit button with a working icon - this keeps impatient users from plugging up your server and possibly breaking their data by compulsively submission again and again

9846125
mouse	keyboard
an alternative for the scenario of chrome is to send all mouse and keyboard interactions within the content to that child process then do all processing and calculation in that child process and send the rending information back over the named pipe to the host which then dose the rendering

9846164
mouse	keyboard
i m writing a screen capture utility and i d like to be able to store the current state of the keyboard and mouse whenever a screenshot is taken

9846198
oncreate	setcontentview	oncreate	findviewbyid	setcontentview	findviewbyid
you need to call setcontentview in oncreate before calls to findviewbyid can be made

9846203
memcached	apc
if you serialized your data you could use apc or memcached to persist an object array that contains your data

9846203
memcached	apc
memcached would require that your server runs the actual memcached server along with having the memcached extension installed while apc doesn t require anything special besides the extension

9846217
hide	show
then i know i need to go from here to inspect the itemdata to determine the type so that i can figure out what to hide or show

9846236
folder	directory
the process is simple you code in one directory using special tokens that the preproc can catch and then to test build you just run the preproc and have it copy the files out to two or however many you want folder dedicated to each target

9846273
vundle	pathogen
i have switched from pathogen to vundle a while ago and haven t looked back

9846283
hex	binary
what it basically does is to decrypt a 3des encrypted string first it convert the hex string to binary using pack function and then does the actual decryption

9846322
put	get
then when you get to the other page just call the value back and put it in

9846339
hash	md5
however i m having trouble getting upload to work when setting the content-md5 header value with an md5 hash of the file i m uploading

9846353
post	get
if your client is still configured to use an http url and you re relying on the redirection to get it to use https the redirected post requests will lose their body and are likely to be a get in fact see this answer

9846354
int	chars
however if you assume that you can always interpret those values as encoded ones you could try writing something that analyzes each chars in turn use ord to convert to a code-point int decodes chars 256 as utf-8 and passes chars 256 as they were

9846355
mouseleave	mouseenter
the areas to the left and right are defined by two rectangles with mouseenter and mouseleave events

9846356
portrait	landscape
it changes size because i load different layouts for portrait and landscape mode respectively

9846356
width	height
as long as i do not use setcontentview i get width and height of the imageview and the scaling is done accordingly

9846356
width	height
as soon as i load a new layout the width and height of the imageview become zero

9846400
portrait	landscape
it will launch softkeyboard in portrait mode however once it switches to landscape it will no longer open in either landscape or portrait until i close and relaunch the app

9846400
portrait	landscape
the form opened the softkeyboard in both landscape and portrait

9846541
google-chrome	firefox
as you can see on the homepage using ie it seems like it not recognizing the height of the div of each picture whereas on google-chrome and firefox there is no issue

9846543
radiobuttonlist	requiredfieldvalidator
sometimes the questions are required in which case after the data is retrieved from the database and the radiobuttonlist is populated i dynamically add a requiredfieldvalidator for the radiobuttonlist

9846575
background-image	background-size
assuming you want to set the background image to a div you will need to make that div s width and background-size 100 and set the background-image to no-repeat

9846576
put	get
and don t put anything in the javascript code i get this error

9846625
implements	extends
both hinge around the idea of a function which receives the unevaluated form as an argument so that it can implements a custom strategy thereby extends the evaluation model with new behaviors

9846673

with pre-c++2011 you can force a minimum storage by using a suitable range of values

9853782
integer	unsigned
i think the compiler is free to choose either a sign or an unsigned integer type as the underlying type

integer	unsigned
however as of java se 8 there are a few new methods in the integer class which allow you to use the int data type to perform unsigned arithmetic

9854205

in java se 8 and later you can use the int data type to represent an unsigned 32-bit integer which has a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 2 32-1

9854205
integer	unsigned
use the integer class to use int data type as an unsigned integer

9854205

the reason i want to disable is that if i use my custom controls and if i mouse hover i need to show my custom controls and when i leave the mouse it should hide the controls and the problem is that when i select the showcontrols the default controls is showing up which i dont want

9854263
nsstring	nsdata
this method recursively validates that all the contained objects are property list objects instances of nsdata nsdate nsnumber nsstring nsarray or nsdictionary before writing out the file and returns no if all the objects are not property list objects since the resultant file would not be a valid property list

9854294
post	get
however when i do the same for an object in this case the point object defined in the same post i actually get its prototype

9854308
int	double
generating random int by scaling a double in range 0..1 is fine provided that the generated double is sufficiently evenly distributed

9854308
int	double
however most pseudo-random number generators including mersenne twister natively generate 32-bit unsigned int so it would be nice if we didn t need to make the roundtrip to double

9854334
for-loop	arrays
the second for-loop puts only the names into the arrays - which causes the value is not a function error when you try to access the arrays values as buttons because the value is really a string

9854336
hex	binary
now how to convert that hex to binary and save as jpeg file on disk

9854354
folder	directory
in development its ok to delete all these 3 new folder assuming you don t have any need for the logs and data stored in data directory

9854399
pull	push
everything like push pull update is doing okay but one thing is going wrong when i am using push it is showing something like this

9854400
wordpress	phpbb
i need to take a phpbb database and convert it to a wordpress database

9854441
width	height
just set the width and height to 100 like that

9854457
margin	height
you get this because i think that the margin is added to the height of the content that is 100

9854481
width	height
you can also remove the height and width - the right and bottom values will take care of that

9854501
wordpress	phpbb
with this you should be able to select information from the old phpbb tables and insert it into the new wordpress tables

9854534
int	chars
the fgetc function returns an int result which is either the value eof typically -1 if there was an error or there s no more data to read or the value of the chars that was successfully read treated as an unsigned chars and converted to int

9854534
feof	fgetc
or you can call the feof and ferror functions after calling fgetc

9854547
ciimage	uiimage
in 1 we create the ciimage if you are getting nil there then make sure you are passing the right uiimage cgimage or path

9854555
post	get
t grab progress on http post file upload android -- include the multipartentity class from the full apache httpclient library and then wrap the input stream it uses to get data in one that counts bytes as they re read

9854575
portrait	landscape
the document is in landscape proved with preview but the uiprinterinteractioncontroller prints the document in portrait mode

9854590

you can use the maven javadoc plugin for this scenario by augmenting your pom.xml

9854645
post	get
encrypt your password and then send it over get or use post

9854648
google-chrome	firefox
this has been observed in firefox and google-chrome on mac os x

9854682
serializable	deserialization
this process is called serializable on output and deserialization on input

9854714
getter	setter
most people including me will advise you not to access your ivars directly unless it is really what you want for example if you are creating a custom setter or getter for the property

9854723
maven	m2e
however due to the fact that the embedded version of maven within m2e is broken when performing releases i have configured eclipse to use my maven installation located at e maven-3.0.3

9854737
portrait	landscape
if you switch between portrait and landscape onsaveinstancestate will be called and you ll fill in the bundle that s passed in

9854737
oncreate	recreate
then you ll get back that same bundle in a future oncreate so you can recreate your activity from where you left off

9854757
rtp	rtcp
these two ports will be used for the rtp and the rtcp streams video and control data

9854757
rtp	rtcp
in addition the rtp port number should be an even number and the rtcp port the next odd number see that question if you want the port range to be random rather than user selected

9854760
accessor	properties
now using the properties and synthesize directives creates those accessor methods for you as well as the variable itself

9854811
email	dkim
first you need to set up dkim domain key signature spf for your mail server then you should use some php mail module like phpmailer so your email would not go to spam

9854852
pull	push
i have enabled the extension for progress but here i can t see the progress bar when i am doing anything push or pull

9854859
width	height
i know that in java i could use the graphics.create x y width height function to create a copy of my graphics object which i could use which would draw within those bounds of the original graphics

9854888
put	get
when you ve done that submit that fingerprint to google to get a new api key then put that in your application to replace the existing one

9854906
sse	avx
but if you want to invest development time maybe you should redesign your code so that it can adapt to other paradigms for example vectorization to take advantage of sse avx or gpus

9854906
sse	avx
but if you want to invest development time maybe you should redesign your code so that it can be either parallelized or vectorized and thus take advantage of sse avx or gpus

9854918
dlsym	dlopen
i have created wrappers around the pthread functions using dlopen and dlsym

9854918
dlsym	dlopen
this approach is very unlikely to succeed in general for pthread functions because both dlopen and dlsym themselves call pthread_mutex_lock and pthread_mutex_unlock and possibly others as does the dynamic loader itself

9854940
folder	directory
for example i have gradua.as at trailcrest gradua gradua.as and that trailcrest folder is located in the same directory as my flash project .fla

9854941
fancybox	colorbox
i m using a jquery-ui dialog although i could switch to fancybox or colorbox etc if i had to

9854944
getter	setter
and finally you can declare properties as virtual and override them in deriving classes allowing you to provide different implementations for getter and setter

9854944
getter	setter
starting with c# 7.0 both getter and setter can be written with expression bodies

9854975
versioning	upgrade
i have just upgrade my dotnetopenauth versioning from 3.4.7.11121 to 4.0.0.12079-rc1 to get support for oauth2

9855064
range	minimum
but i want the values of contours to grow exponentially from the minimum value of z up to the maximum range which is 350

9855068
hex	binary
is the only solution converting them to binary performing signed subtraction and then converting the answer back to hex

9855071
filtering	grouping
you should use aggregates and grouping to sum travel costs filtering by job id

9855075
hide	show
i am simply switching classes to show hide the div which works great

9855087
integer	unsigned
i have a byte 4 which contains a 32-bit unsigned integer in big endian order and i need to convert it to long as int can t hold an unsigned number

9855118
integer	unsigned
for example if you have an array of 32 elements or less you only need an unsigned integer to keep track of your array

9855150
post	get
if javascript is turned off on the client browser none of your javascript will run the form will post or get to whatever action you define editpost.php

9855167
daemons	systemd
i believe your systemd is linux since you used the term daemons

9855192
post	get
file_get_contents is going to make a get request to the url specified but oauth2 token needs a post request

9855201
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works in firefox but not in google-chrome or safari

9855230
ethernet	wireless
or just wireless and ethernet

9855231
pop-up	dialog
when clicked this toolbox icon will display a pop-up dialog containing options to manage the topic - however in ie9 it is impossible to click the toolbox icon

9855287
width	height
another approach relies on the fact that browsers respect an image s aspect ratio when you resize only its width or height

9855317
post	get
the only way you will keep the ui dialog open as far as i can see is to either use an iframe into which the new page gets loaded or to load the new page into a specific content div by using for example jquery load or ajax or post or get - while you keep the ui dialog div outside of the iframe or content div

9855335
superclass	subclassing
i ve read somewhere that at first in the subclassing s constructor the constructor of the superclass is implicitly called

9855367
hide	show
from there you can bind your own show hide event maybe call an ajax method that deletes the entry behind the scenes and make a re-call to .load again and refresh the page

9855406
post	get
i have found from analysis of the markup on this page that this is done by way of a simple xmlhttp post to shell.cgi parameters and the output is the stdout you d get if you performed this on a local shell

9855433
rss	feed
basically it works like parsing an rss feed then combine its articles into a magazine which can be converted to mobipocket too

9855516
integer	unsigned
edit 26 march 2012 and although the declaration i provided indeed works replacing long with uint would be even better as win32 s dword is a 32-bit unsigned integer

9855518
for-loop	loops
the for-loop works fine but the while loops is not printing the desired result

9855587
ubuntu	linux
i deployed my application to a linux ubuntu server

9855621
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
here s what i m trying to do i m using the nscalendar and nsdatecomponents objects to create a loop that will display text and an image based on the date

9855640
put	get
some folks program linearly and once some block of code has nothing to do with the language is typed twice in more than one place and there is a risk that it might be changed depending on that risk it might get put into a macro or function

9855677
int	chars
it is meant to receive a chars argument but in your case the int gets converted downgraded you might say

9855684
folder	directory
2 if you have access to one directory above the root of the site then copy there all the other folder except for public

9855693
ilist	icollection
the collections that i have in mind are ilist icollection and collection

9855702
int	chars
in general it is probably not a digit according to isdigit because this function only returns true for int values of the chars 0 1 ... 9

9855702
fgets	fgetc
if scanf fails you can read one character using fgetc and retry again or read an entire line not using gets but using fgets

9855723
folder	directory
so i would like to copy recursively a complex folder files structure to another directory but i d like to only include files with txt extension

have to post as an answer cause i want to get a screenshot up to you in case you want to diff before i m able to pull down your code and actually debug

9855775
google-chrome	firefox
my junit test case changed the firefox driver to google-chrome driver

9855777
inline	inlining
inlining in this context means inline as the resharper refactoring functionality

9855778
firefox	safari
for instance safari on the mac not sure about firefox renders with mac-styled controls which can have different sizes borders font-sizes etc

9855787
textarea	textbox
we need to be aware of the fact that if that input goes into a textbox value or into textarea value or into a division html area and so on

9855796
google-chrome	firefox
i have the following javascript code that works fine in firefox and google-chrome

9855806
put	get
buggy plugins -- even if the plugin exists across all operating systems like flash generally they work best on windows and then linux and mac fight it out for second place usually more effort put into the mac port but on linux there may be wiki guides to get it working better and the distro packagers may use these tricks when auto-installing the plugin for you

9855806
ubuntu	linux
the only solution i know is if you re a windows dev to have a virtualbox image of a linux distro like ubuntu or fedora that you test your site on and see how poor the plugin performs when you add all of your bells and whistles then assume that macs are roughly the same performance

9855811
put	get
choosing which images to put together to get minimal palette

9855821
atexit	main

9855845
m2e	pom.xml
also receiving an error about m2e ignoring one of my plugin goals from the company level pom.xml within the module

9855881
mouseup	mousedown
a click is defined as holding down the mouse button and then letting go of the mouse button. it is a combination of a mousedown and mouseup event executed on the same element

9855881
mouseup	mousedown	mouseout	mousedown	mouseout	mouseup
if the user moves away from the element they are no longer executing a click simply a mousedown and also a mouseout and then a mouseup on a different element

9855881
onclick	onmousedown
if for your application it is really important than any click result in this submit happening for you then don t go with an onclick go with onmousedown

9855890

the main difference is the other pages that work are located in a sub folder while form.php is in the root directory

9856457
width	height
store the width and height in a variable that is later referenced in closure

9856460
for-loop	loops
i now understand from your comments that the code you show us is surrounded by a while or for-loop which is being run 100 times and that allquants and mostcommonletters probably change inside that loops

9856503
min	max
i have a scheme assignment in which a user is to input a list of numbers and the output should be the max value and min value from the list

hide	show
you can use this api in your servlet jsp to show hide the comment button for example and also show a message

9856592
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
hence the fix is to repair the .net framework installation which can be done by reinstalling it running a repair on it or installing a newer versioning which in my case was the async ctp which while not a full .net framework versioning upgrade was enough to correct any mismatched resource references used by the compiler

9856593

for-loop	loops
for in loops are often cause for problems in javascript imo use helpers like jquery s each or do a regular for-loop like i have in the example above

9856652
setinterval	clearinterval
what you need is to set and clear the same interval using setinterval and clearinterval or basically leave the interval running the whole time but put a test inside its callback to test whether it is currently paused

gif	png
i can think of only two ways of doing that using gimp there are gimp-python bindings - or manipulate the final gif or png file manually

9856883
gif	png
manipulating the palette manually is not hard since you will b dealing -both in gif and png formats with fixed binary structues at the file headers - it may be the more suitable way of doing it

int	chars
from your explanation you might initially start with an array of int who s values are chars then as the game progresses the chars values will no longer be relevant and become int values

9875331
int	chars
imho the problem is not putting chars into an int that works and is built into the language

google-chrome	safari
but i cant seem to figure it out in google-chrome and safari

9879706
post	get
sometime ago i went into a page to debug html forms that allowed me to change the post to gets in the form request and that really helped me get some info from html forms by just doing everything in the url instead of having to make my program fill some forms

9879706
google-chrome	firefox
i tried both firebug in firefox and developer tools in google-chrome but they don t seem to do this

9879739

i was really puzzled where this retain was coming from since the code it was breaking on didn t have one not in the getter or setter of the line it was on

an access violation occurs when you run a .net framework 2.0-based application that has a virtual call the ilist ienumerable or icollection interface in an lcg lightweight code generation method

a dataset does implement ilistsource that has a method getlist which returns an ilist which implements ienumerable

9879760
mouseup	mousedown
that seems to be called on a mousedown type event and not with mouse motion or mouseup

9879760
mousemove	mouseup
to accomplish the same kind of thing in the provided link it looks like i need to find a way to access mousemove and mouseup

9879763
post	get
you can also use firebug and inspect the form element and change it from post to get

9879774
folder	directory
you have to make sure you are invoking java in the right directory which is the part to the first package name folder in your case org

9879794
post	get
i want to get total number of topics and post for given category and using following query.

9879794
post	get
and it gives correct results for total topics but how can i get total number of post for all categories i am abit confused about please help me to write this query

9879819
disk	ram
when the query is run first most likely the data is still on disk sql server has to fetch this data when you run the same query the data is already in ram and thus it will be much faster than going to disk

9879836
google-chrome	firefox
but since you re also positioning your wrapper absolutely the overflow hidden clearfix is also unnecessary as position absolute will also clearfix at least in google-chrome and firefox

9879878
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works on ie9 firefox google-chrome safari but not ie8

9879897
int	chars

width	height
after the dialog has been opened the width and height are static unless resized

9879933

int	chars
or if that chars value is directly your int value

9879993
pop-up	dialog
i have been able to get the single left-click editing of the metric value working through jeditable but i have been unsucessful so far in finding a way to make the field also allow the other-click pop-up of a dialog box to enter the miss information

9879993
pop-up	dialog
once that dialog is closed if i left-click on the field it would enable editing of that field so basically i don t want to ever turn off jeditable completely i just want it to go into hibernation mode between the time that the user ctrl-clicks on the field and when the dialog box that pop-up because of that is closed

9880112
width	height
note do not rescale video with the height and width attributes

9880112
width	height
downsizing a large video with the height and width attributes forces a user to download the original video even if it looks small on the page

9880112
width	height
so guess you can t scale up a video with width and height tags

9880120
groupbox	panel
in this situation the labels will often have a common container such as panel or groupbox control

9880137
width	height
i tried setting position absolute and then left top right and bottom to fixed values in pixels but unless i also set width and height i cannot get it to work properly on firefox 11

9880137
width	height
using 100 for width and height is sometimes a solution but not when the element is not completely covering the parent container

9880137
width	height
firefox width height to 100

9880137
width	height
firefox without width height

9880152

most of the time the problems were related to the label format and size landscape instead of portrait one report split to multiple physical labels... which sounds similar to the problems you are having

9880152
epl	zpl
zebra printers have a built-in language called epl or zpl depending on the model which you can use to send commands directly to the printer

9880152
epl	zpl
creating the labels in epl zpl is not as comfortable as dragging and dropping stuff in a report designer but the printing is reliable just works and has never failed me in all the years we are printing hundreds of labels per day for nearly 10 years now

9880152
epl	zpl
i m afraid that creating the epl zpl code is not directly possible with sql server but you can do it with c# or any other programming language

9880152
epl	zpl
i know that you are trying to generate the report directly with sql server s report builder now but i would advise you to generate epl zpl code and send it directly to the printers if possible

9880156

my problem is that afther a post back the list change and the controls are loading but the text box s keep that same data befor the post back even though i get the data from flickr every time

9880302

therefore to get a click event on a canvas element shape you need to capture click events on the canvas html element and use some math to determine which element was clicked provided you are storing the elements width height and x y offset

9880311
width	height
you might be talking about nissans which could end up as a type class extending the abstract class car but the engine size height width and gas mileage is all data

9880441
qplaintextedit	qmainwindow
now when i use the tool widget the qmainwindow is shown as inactive like it should and the selection background of the selected text in the active qplaintextedit is rendered as inactive slightly grey but i want the selection to be rendered like the qmainwindow would be active with the default selection color w o loosing the focus on the tool widget

9880540
hash	md5
the aim of my script is to calculate the md5 hash value of a file

9880663
post	get
the post or get data your script receives will then contain an array instead of a single variable

9880673

9880772
width	height
with api posting to me feed adding width and height parameters can post a swf up to 398x398

9880786
children	parent
the max heap is an array that could be more easily represented with a binary tree where the parent node is always greater than it s children and every time you add a child you added it towards the left so that every time the tree increases it s height it is a full tree

9880820
ubuntu	linux
i need to do this programmatically on linux ubuntu server using free tools or external free api

cos	sin
by normalizing c12 s12 you will end up with cos a12 sin a12 which you may be able to use more directly

9881489
int	double
nowadays just about the only time one should be comparing values of types double and either int or long for strict equality is when for some reason one is stuck storing or passing integral quantities as floating-point values and later needs to convert them back

9881489
int	double
nonetheless in the days before 64-bit long became available double was a handy storage type for int quantities which were too big for a 32-bit int but small enough to be handled by double

9881502
directions	infowindow
is there a way to load the infowindow in a different directions if the marker is at the top of the viewport to display the infowindow in a downward directions

implements	extends
additionally if you are looking to just find out what class interface a class extends implements you can just use the class reflection api via the class attribute

9881796
vertica	infobright
i d look at infobright first - it s open source based on mysql so it s probably the easiest to put into your existing system make sure the data is going to the infobright db then point your analytical queries to the infobright server keep the rest of the system as it is job done or if vertica ever releases its community edition

9881820
margin	height	width	height	width	margin
the idea is to position the top left corner of your element in the center of the page but then shift it up and to the left by adding a negative margin of half the height and width

9881820
width	height
if you don t know the height or width at design time don t specify the margins either

for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
there are two prices one is arrays inside the for-loop and another is int outside loops

9882369
implements	extends
asynctask is an abstract superclass not an interface so you extends it rather than implements it

9882369
implements	extends
but regardless a method cannot extends a class or implements an interface

9882396
for-loop	loops
loops can either repeat n times for-loop with xrange step over elements in a list for item in list or repeat until some condition is satisfied while condition_is_true

for-loop	loops
i m trying to create a for-loop with nsdates so that loops would increment by 1 day each cycle of the for loop.

you could then save that location to a variable so as to move whatever piece to it that you are changing it with and on drag update the bitmap x y in relation to the touch

9882720
superclass	subclassing
this new f would not call the constructor of superclass so when you create a subclassing maybe you need call the superclass at first like this

9882875

rtp	sdp	rtp	sip	sip	sdp
there s the sip handshake protocol that you re missing as well as the sdp that you re missing that specifies the rtp streaming info of the data the part that you have a rough start on above. all these protocol messages have to be formatted correctly to be interpreted by your phone for reference here s the rtp header structure

9883224
rtp	sdp	rtp	sip	sip	sdp
the sip sdp messages establish information about the rtp endpoints including port numbers and codec selection that happen outside of the sip traffic

9883224
rtp	sdp	rtp	sip	sip	sdp
my recommendation is to pick up a packet-sniffer tool like wireshark and examine the packet information of a softphone -or- hook an existing sip phone into a hub where you can observe the sip sdp rtp traffic

9883224
asterisk	pbx
you could also try configuring an open-source pbx like asterisk that would let you configure a network of soft phones you could get by with a network of just one or two softphones

9883224
sip	sdp
i suggest checking codeplex for sip projects that will let you skip most of the sip sdp drudgery

my solution is to read the sampling frequency bit rate and mono stereo characteristics of the uploaded file and choose a corresponding copyright introduction that matches those characteristics and then append that to the front of the file by reading in the introduction and the user recording as fileinputstream s and writing out the intro and the user file into a fileoutputstream

9890452

rtp	sip
in the end each ua sends its rtp to the other ua directly while sending the sip signalling information to asterisk

9891242
rtp	sdp
i would suspect since jitsi handles this setting well that the ua you wrote is not honoring the new destination ip address in the sdp of the re-invite asterisk sent to it and is instead continuing to send the rtp to asterisk when it should instead be sending it directly to the jitsi ua

9891255

i understand how ajax works but i need some help to create my function in order to achieve the url to be correctly sent to the server for both get and post requests

9891834

9891895
qtableview	qtablewidget	qtableview	qstandarditemmodel	qtablewidget	qstandarditemmodel

here s the problem i need to validate the form before submission in the next way before user can submit anything he should click save button if he tries to click submit one receives message something like you should save form before submit

9892360
onclicklistener	onitemclicklistener
as you can see instead of an onitemclicklistener i ve set a onclicklistener to each list item

9892372

9892592
int	double
you have declared your method as returning a double even though the spec says to return an int and you are attempting to return an int i in the function

9892698
realloc	malloc
my guess is that the realloc call manages to extend the memory allocated by the call to malloc

9892698
free	realloc
you do not need to free foo at all because realloc will do that for you if the memory area was moved during reallocation

9892712

9892724
folder	directory
it s an easy way for me to go to a directory which has a number of project folder and print out summaries

9892725
free	realloc
at the point at which you call free foo foo is invalid since it was already free when you called realloc

9892725
free	malloc
of course since this is c++ you should be avoiding malloc and free altogether and using

9892734
for-loop	arrays
the c function is called correctly the for-loop that fills the samples arrays is ok but it crashes somewhere between the return and the next c# line so i guess it has something to do with unmarshalling although i don t want any marshalling unmarshalling the arrays is blittable and must be written to from c

9892740
free	realloc
when you realloc memory you should not free the old memory

9892803
put	get
this works fine however if i want to use the same expression to convert a single field in member to an addressdto in the anonymous type the only way i can get this to work is to put the field in a single item array cast to queryable and then call select on that - this seems a bit circuitous and i am wondering if there is a better way

9892823
range	max
itertools.product from range 1 upto n where n is the max word size would give the desired result

9892827
free	realloc
once you ve passed a pointer to realloc it is formally deallocated free and you must not free it again

9892827
free	realloc

v8 compiles the code into an intermediary bytecode then the hotspots are analyzed by the crankshaft compiler and if it determines that certain variables will never be anything other than an int a double a string or so on it generates machine code with it unboxed.

9894107
salt	md5
you may generate it by hash_hmac sha512 token salt where token uniqid user_id true and salt md5 mt_rand

9894113

in google-chrome and safari the color measures off by a hair #e9e8e0 and sometimes #e9e8df but to me it s quite noticeable that there s a color difference

9894218
google-chrome	safari
the bizarre thing is that eyedropping the color in the kuler app in safari google-chrome is always correct no matter what screen it is on

9894236
hash	md5
the easiest would be for the service to compute something and send it to the javascript last modification time or an md5 hash of the list of filenames

9894308
equals	gethashcode
create a custom type to hold the row data and if it is a class override equals and gethashcode

google-chrome	firefox
anyway i have the following code that works in ie but not in google-chrome or firefox

9894674
int	chars
try casting your placeholders to the expected type when you call the function so postgres can resolve the signature eg something like func1 param1 chars varying param2 chars varying param3 int or func1 cast param1 as chars varying cast param2 as chars varying cast param3 as int

9894702
int	chars
i was not aware of the differences between an int pointer and a chars pointer

9894757
put	get	jcomponent	bufferedimage
create a bufferedimage call getgraphics on it to get its graphics object draw to it using the graphics 2d api then call graphics.dispose not strictly necessary but a good habit and as the previous poster suggested either create an imageicon with it and put in a jlabel using seticon or subclass jpanel jcomponent and draw it in paintcomponent

9894874
ienumerable	iqueryable
when you use ienumerable you are generating the enumerable at that point whereas iqueryable allows you to defer the generation of the enumerable until a control point of execution

set min-height on each of the elements that u ve given height and width in percentage.percentage will be effective only when the resolution is big enf to encompass ur children elements

9895078

for multiple files also see maven pom.xml file for installing multiple 3rd party commercial libraries

9895449
versioning	upgrade
i recently upgrade it to php versioning 5.3.10 thread safe versioning

i tried to use jquery for show hide toggle etc but for example i couldnt find how to keep those big divs unvisible within my html i tried css display none

9895479
put	get
ok i m trying to put my asp.net website onto my university s web server but when visiting my webpage i get the following problem

9895495
folder	directory
because your ror-related plugins only work in a rails folder and you are not in a rails folder -- you are probably in check pwd to know what the working directory is -- those plugins don t work

9895608
next	except
this code works great in theory except that once the dynamically loaded content on the next page is appended to the document the .on routine is being run on every single element a second time rather than just the newly added elements

9895668
post	put
i can t put the image because is my first post

9895695
int	chars
said getchar returns an int code of the chars not the number the chars represents usually it is the ascii value but it is platform dependent

9895711
sorting	grouping
in this example notice that i have a grouping header as well for which i can disable sorting

9895738
mvvm	delegatecommand
normally i would use delegatecommand from prism or relaycommand from mvvm light

9895767
getter	setter
it is now a setter not a getter

9895771
hide	show
i want to show a contextmenu take only the contextmenu s screenshot convert the screenshot into image and hide the menu

9895933

9895949
width	height
you could even use this to store up to 4 layers in a single image cutting max texture width height

9895964
mouse	keyboard
the strange thing is that using osk for entering characters by sending mouse presses on the osk keyboard buttons from robot is working fine

9895983
bash	subshell
so in shells such as bash and the classic bourne shell derivatives the suprocess subshell is on the right of the pipe reading from the current shell and that process ends after its read at the semicolon in this example

9895983
zsh	subshell
korn shell at least as far back as 93 and zsh put their subshell on the other side of the pipe and are reading data from those into the current process

9896082
post	get
really if you re doing something other than fetching data like a search your form should be using a http post not a get

9896097
int	double
most arithmetic and logical instructions of the jvm work only with int long float and double other data types have to be cast to usually int s in order for these instructions to be executed on them

9896097
int	double
the default type of number literals is int for integral and double for floating point numbers

9896121
post	get
if this isn t clear enough to get you there i ll try and post some actual code later

9896148
mouseleave	mouseenter
it is basically the same but with use of .hover which is the combined function of mouseenter and mouseleave

9896149
jruby	rubinius
there are alternative ruby implementations like jruby or rubinius that provide native threads without a global interpreter lock and thus allow your app to use more than one core but you d probably need to adapt your app a bit

9896166
opensplice	opendds
at the most recent omg meeting opendds demonstrated inter-operability with both rti and opensplice among other dds implementations

9896302
width	height

9896320
versioning	upgrade
this is my first versioning upgrade on sql server so i m new to this problem

9896339
unsigned	short
when you want to convert the signed short int -3 to unsigned short int you get just 65533

9896353
post	get
using post in this case may not be necessary but you need to be aware that using get will encode the form parameters in the url as in and some of this information may be sensitive and therefore desirable to be submitted to the server in the body of the http request as opposed to transmitted encoded in the url

9896375
integer	unsigned
you used c++ to interpret a signed integer and represent it as an unsigned 2 byte integer

9896384
mouseleave	mouseenter
the mouseenter and mouseleave events are specifically designed to handle this situation correctly

9896425
pull	push
i made the modifications however when i make backend controller library model patches updates and i push these updates to origin and pull down from origin on the server i need a way to avoid overwriting those changes in the views

9896716
width	height
the width and height are very important as they determine the actual clickable region within the button div

9896726
viewdidload	viewdidappear
i would try viewdidappear instead of viewdidload depending on your viewcontroller

9896727
put	get

9896727
put	get

9896742
accessor	properties
a small improvement is to move your uidisplaycontroller instantiation to a lazily loaded accessor method for the searchdisplaycontroller properties

9896774
hide	show
hide it before changing the html then show it

9896786
listview	gridview
another approach is to use a listview gridview and have cost as another column

9896805
keydown	keyup
thinking about it the events fire in this order keydown keyup keypress

9896805
keydown	keyup
then the keydown event will finish it will later fire the keyup event on the now-focused field and should write the character into the field and then fire the keypress event that other events if any tied to the field can use

9896826
width	height
page.clientscript.registerstartupscript this.gettype open window.open + redirect + setup width 500 height 200 0 status 0

if you are requesting locationupdates don t forget to unregister the updates by overriding the onpause and onstop and re-registering in the onresume otherwise it will be a huge battery drain

9897023
hash	hmac
validation of hmac generated hash requires the key to be known to the validator

9897023

in the for-loop the null arrays are being instantiated into ever increasing arrays sizes

9897065
width	height
as the descriptions state screenheight and screenwidth provide the actual screen height width

9897089
mamp	wamp
basically you need to run a local host using something like wamp mamp xampp

9897148
google-chrome	firefox
when the jquery function returns false the code works in google-chrome and firefox but not ie

9897148
google-chrome	firefox
when the jquery function returns true the code works in ie but not in firefox or google-chrome

9897214

a console application can not provide asp.net compatibility mode only a real web server like iis or cassini or iis express can provide that

9897287
post	get
to get the latest plugin when a new version of firefox comes out check out the google groups for gwt as alan leung a gwt dev will post the latest builds within a day or so of release

9897304
google-chrome	firefox
i ve also tried firefox instead of google-chrome without a noticeable difference

9897404
qiodevice	qnetworkreply
qnetworkreply inherits from qiodevice which is a stream

9897430
getter	setter
so the solution would be to save the mysqli object in a different field and add getter and setter for it or delegate the methods to it

9897433
thin	webrick
if you re using webrick to run your application on heroku you should switch to using thin see

9897445

9897531
submit	submission
i m using this on wordpress where the goal is to send some data through to wordpress via ajax upon form submission and then force the form to submit

9897579
getter	setter
it s up to the event exactly what it does but i think of events as like properties - except instead of a getter and a setter you have add and remove actions each of which take the delegate to subscribe or unsubscribe to from the event

9897606
std	ostream
error 1 error c2995 std ostream operator std ostream

9897612
jtree	jtable
it works automatically if your model fires the correct events similar to the standard jtree and jtable

9897664
folder	dir
but dir b s ad will give a concise listing of an entire hierarchy with the full path included for each folder

9897677
post	get
i then thought that in my create get post actions the view should probably just have the courseid but i still need to display it as a dropdown and populate it and i was unsure as how to do that correctly

9897687
put	get
assuming you re talking about designing a restful api yes it makes sense to return a 404 status when you receive a request get put delete to operate on a nonexistent entity

9897693
pop-up	dialog
i m writing a driver which needs to immediately pop-up a dialog to notify the user of an event

9897772
folder	directory
i need it to successfully find the exact directory of the plugin folder so that it copies the file process.php to the exact root directory no matter the location of the wordpress install

9897790
inherited	properties
when i create an instance of this class i assign to the instance some properties inherited from its ancestor listviewitem

9897791
fflush	gets
using fflush it gets rid of the second line output

9897806
versioning	upgrade
you can also keep multiple server versioning for the duration of the upgrade

9897808
width	height
the view needs to have 3 columns like pinterest with individual images having constant width but variable height

9897816
oncreate	ondestroy
with a service you have a well-defined lifecycle with appropriate lifecycle callbacks oncreate ondestroy etc. just as you do with an activity

9897824
onresume	onpause
on my logic file i have onpause and onresume events as follows

9897825
integer	unsigned
c++11 3.9.1p4 unsigned integers declared unsigned shall obey the laws of arithmetic modulo 2n where n is the number of bits in the value representation of that particular size of integer

9897825
integer	unsigned
46 this implies that unsigned arithmetic does not overflow because a result that cannot be represented by the resulting unsigned integer type is reduced modulo the number that is one greater than the largest value that can be represented by the resulting unsigned integer type.

9897825
integer	unsigned
because a result that cannot be represented by the resulting unsigned integer type is

9897864
ready	each
onreadystatechange script to be run each time the ready state changes the ready state tracks the state of the media data

9897894
hash	salt
combining the salt with the original password into the password hash protects against the attacker using rainbow tables of millions of known and well-known password hash to obtain the passwords of some of the stolen user ids

9897894
hash	salt
having hash the password and salt together makes it many orders of magnitude more difficult to crack even a single password on the basis that the salt invalidates the password hash known in the rainbow table

9897894
hash	salt
an attacker could for example target a small subset of your users with the hash and salt in hand and that s another reason to encourage strong passwords which are less likely to appear in a rainbow table

9897911
hash	salt
making the salt available should not degrade the security of the hash password

9897921
inherited	properties
using reflection i load all types except base classes not abstract ones into a combobox and expect the user to select a type book food medicine other all inherited from productbase class and set its properties and add into a global order object that contains a list of productbase

9897921
inherited	properties
ps this is actually a known interview question but i want this reflection approach in order to support all kinds of future messings with the inherited structure and moving adding removing of properties

9897954
width	height
and depending on resize argument image can be automatically resized after uploading and width height fields are correctly updated without saving object twice

9898044
versioning	upgrade
i guess i could do a general import __future__ but then i would get different behavior when i upgrade to a higher versioning v2.7 might have more features in __future__ and my scripts might stop working then

9898076
for-loop	arrays
in addition to the answer previously posted use instead of and in the for-loop you should cache the length of the arrays with var mems

9898091
isnull	nullif
so i thought to myself - obviously i should be using nullif and not isnull so i reversed them

9898097
super	extends
i also have another class sub that extends super

9898107
rss	feed
ideally by an rss feed

9898139
inherited	subclassing
if i use the table per subclassing inherited strategy i don t see a possibility for defining a unique constraint on multiple attributes that belong to different classes and then in the db to different tables

9898150
rspec	capybara
i use rspec 2.6.0 and capybara 1.1.1 for acceptance testing

9898157
width	height
other times you can use a frame with defined width and height attributes

9898157
width	height
this approach works when the element that needs to have a width and height does not have that feature

9898178
versioning	upgrade
i d like to upgrade my tortoisesvn to versioning 1.7

9898180
dependency-injection	service-locator

9898181
folder	directory
you may create manually two projects in eclipse pointing to the same source folder but with different inclusion exclusion filters and different target directory

9898188

9898217
hash	salt
i would opt for storing salt along with hashing algorithm s identifier and the hash itself

9898217
crypt	hash
if you are using crypt function for creating hash with good algorithms recommended would be crypt_blowfish then cracking even a single password can be exceedingly long in the scale of years

9898251
swing	windowbuilder
i ve already created new project windowbuilder - swing designer - application window

9898356
set	bag
the problem was that my remote client did not included necessary hibernate libraries which were necessary since hibernate internally casts properties of an entity like set bag to its own counterparts like persistentset

9898367
post	get
maybe the ploblem is that the parameters in this form j_username user j_password user submit send are parameters for http get not post you can try get the parameters on this way

9898396
fiddler	charles
in order to try to troubleshoot this problem i cranked up a program named charles similar to fiddler

9898396
ssl	https
however as soon as charles is shutdown or its ssl proxying is tuned off the https requests fail

9898405
for-loop	loops
i find this solution incorrect due to the fact that the second for-loop now has its correctness coupled to that of the first loops -- if i remove the first loops the second loops has to change

9898431
put	get
so far my applet runs smoothly when invoked within eclipse but when i try to put it on a server i get a null pointer on the xml files

9898442

9898528
int	double
your variable could have an int or double value and math.floor variable always has an int value so if your variable is equal to math.floor variable then it must have an int value

9898613
ceil	floor
rint is measurably faster than floor or ceil

9898624
versioning	upgrade
also it might be a good idea to upgrade to a new versioning of codeigniter - beware of the new parent controller name though

9898648
width	height
the code is a very simple video tag with src poster width and height attributes

9898670

9898987
listview	gridview
i ve got an area control of type border on my window with content that relates to the selected object in a nearby gridview within a listview

in your test project if the assets folder is added to project build path which was automatically done by adt plugin before version r14 you can load file from res or assets directory directory under project build path without context

9899079
decltype	auto
use decltype instead of auto to declare i

9899093
mp4	h.264
and now javafx2.1 finally supports mp4 h.264 so you should now be good to go without the above posted stunts

9899120

this method actually creates the tmp folder in my application directory

9899184
pull	push
also note that push and pull are symmetric operations

9899185

edit i think the answer is probably to use setinterval and not settimeout

9899215
google-chrome	firefox
ä have facebook application works on firefox ie google-chrome

.3.glibc2 x86 64bit compressed tar archive

9899335
actionscript	mxml

9899525
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in google-chrome firefox but in ie i am getting the same error as before - basically the plugin gets stuck at the form.submit part

9899528

9899560
width	height
thanks to how to set device height and width for a bar chart in android

9899631
getter	setter
the second think to know is that attr_accessor creates instance method for getter and setter of the given parameter

9899631
getter	setter
in the second one you are creating 1 class method where you are trying to access another class method setter but your getter and setter are defined as instance methods they will become instance of method of class which will include your module you cannot get to them this way you have no access to your getter and setter

9899686
put	get
since the way you pass data in get requests is via the query string you d have to put all that data on the query string

9899898
pull	push
if not you could use push pull instead of pub sub

9899898
pull	push

9899952
maven	pom.xml
if you use maven add the following to your pom.xml

ftp	telnet
you mentioned ftp telnet and sftp

9900320
postgresql	mysql
all non-aggregate columns in the select-list must be listed in the group by clause unless you re using mysql which plays by a very different set of rules or unless you are using a sufficiently recent version of postgresql which is able to deduce functional dependencies

safari and google-chrome have lots of trouble with certain css selectors sometimes with fixes that really take you back to the good ol days of ie5 ie6 and ie7

there is a firefox profile in java that does the simliar thing for firefox but obviously that won t work for google-chrome

9900379

i have a requirement where the interface which contains a video is portrait only but when the user rotates to landscape the video goes to full screen and starts playing then when the video reaches the end or the user clicks done the video exits full screen and the interface is still portrait

9900387
int	chars
if the file doesn t need to be human readable you could fwrite the int as binary data instead of ascii chars to the file and access them with

9900402
g++	gcc
being that i have compiled everything with the gcc g++ version that came with our development kit i assume that the elf binaries are 32-bit

i have a date time value declared as chars in this way 1985-01-01-00 00 and i want to extract the year month and day as int

public class colouroption extends jpanel implements actionlistener which is then set up in a jframe

9900478
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and safari shows the slideshow fine

9900490
implements	extends
a class extends one other class and can implements many interface

9900545
implements	extends
with gwt s compiler when it sees an interface extends remoteservice they automatically expect that their is a paired interface by the same name + async that implements the same method names but they have a little different structure

9900989
google-chrome	safari
with other browsers latest versions of ie google-chrome and safari the result is still object object when clicking on the link

9900999
hide	show
use that for your hide show display toggle settings it sounds like you hid the text boxes inside the column resulting in your blank space

9901002
hide	show
alternatively you could hide the exe s in some folder but the trick here is that the name of the exe will be show in task manager and once users see this they could search for the exe

9901052
subtraction	addition
i am creating an application in which i want to access a web service and perform a particular task like if i enter the two number into the edit text and click on the button the addition or subtraction or whatever shows on to the screen

9901090
button	checkbox
the onitemclicklistener for the listview will not work if you have any clickables like button imagebutton checkbox etc in the listview

9901103
accessor	properties
so i can t use the properties s accessor to change the value

9901166
free	malloc
you cannot assume that the executable which has loaded your dll is using the same version of the c runtime library so if it tries to call free on the returned memory you might end up corrupting your heap due to differences in the malloc free implementations in the different runtimes

9901169
for-loop	arrays
i have two arrays which im checking against in a for-loop but am stuck on how to make the for-loop work on the arrays

9901220
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	ubuntu	linux
absent an add-on or malware i suppose doing that there s no reason that or would get redefined with the page you posted and i ve now tried it on google-chrome 17 firefox 11 and opera 11 on linux ubuntu 11.10 as well as ie9 firefox 5 safari 5 and opera 11 on windows 7

i m having an issue when trying to position ajax loaded content with position fixed in the center of the window element in webkit browsers google-chrome safari

9901289

if you write your own implementation of boolean equals object you must also implement int hashcode

9901292
post	get
thus i did not get the expected result like in your last post

put	get
get put principle

9901424
versioning	upgrade
one solutions is please upgrade the plugin to newer versioning it may solve your problem

9901432
free	malloc
it s likely that you have also trashed malloc internal data structures and so it s likely that subsequent malloc or free calls may crash your program leading many programmers to falsely believe they ve found a bug in malloc

9901509
listview	gridview
i have a form with one gridview as master linked to a listview in the same page

9901530
innodb	myisam
it looks a little as though you should investigate mysql s fulltext index - last time i looked at it it was not good enough to make a search engine but it might solve your problem it also looks as if modern mysql supports fulltext indexes on innodb tables as well as the myisam tables it was historically restricted to

9901577
width	height
i get a floating point exception when i use sdl_opengl as the flag for sdl_setvideomode width height 32 sdl_opengl

9901614
sorting	filtering
sorting and filtering are efficiently done by database

9901617
slideup	slidedown
the open and close methods involve jquery s slideup and slidedown methods so i need to be able to call the close method and then call the open method as a callback

9901679
dictionary	map
another way to do would be using dynamics or dictionary instead of anonymous class - that would remove anonimity problem and would just require to map specific keys on to properties - may be done with reflection again using for example mappingattribute key for distinction - attribute is a fiction just to give a general idea

9901725
awt	swing
don t mix swing with awt components without good cause

wordpress	joomla
check out the documentation related to wordpress and joomla

9901813

width	height
to reflect the width and height of buttons in layout parameters

9901833
width	height
use layoutparameters to set width height and margins on button

9901855
post	get
so the url will always return to me the response for a get request since there is no way of knowing if the request was a get or post

9901861
width	height
try setting height width and padding using setlayoutparams as

9901870
width	height
set height and width programmatically you have use set layoutparams like below

9901901
width	height
note the width and height of the sample image may change

9901909
getter	setter
yii seems only to call the setter getter after to check if the attribute exists at the table

9901912
post	get
i m trying to construct a mysql query right now that will get popular tags in a certain time range based on how many times they ve been used in the date range and with it the most recent post with the tag

9901918
free	malloc
notice if the second malloc fails i have to free a first

9901918
free	malloc
the problem is this can be very messy if there are many such malloc s and error checking s unless i use the notorious goto clause and carefully arrange the order of free s along with the labels

9901943
int	boolean
so if you are going to pass in url s and use int to update progress and return a boolean indicating success you would write

9901948
ocl	uml
i tried using dresden ocl to describe constraints for an uml class diagram

9901982
width	height
so what i want to achieve is popup width height should be auto adjusted to content width and height and if the content is too large if it exceeds body width and height content div tag must be auto scrolled....is there a way to achieve...code is appreciated.

folder	directory
suppose you have images inside a images folder in your application directory

9902093
getter	setter
in jsf managed bean i have properties and its getter setter methods which are mapped to the jsp componenets in el like this

9902123
hlsl	glsl
i m sure someone who knew hlsl glsl could write a blur effect that works correctly

9902123
width	height
you should put them in a constant buffer and use them instead of the hardcoded 500.0 for width and height

9902123
width	height
they need to be the width height of the rendered object

9902124
put	get
if i put return c inside the json function i get the error bodycontent is undefined

jtextpane	jeditorpane
seems like what you should be using is jtextpane jeditorpane for changing colours of random string literals try your hands on this code seems like this is what you wanted -

9902193
getter	setter
when you add a public field to a groovy class string firstname in a domain class the groovy compiler converts this to a private field and a public getter and setter

9902193
getter	setter
in grails domain classes properties are persistent by default but properties are defined as a matched getter setter pair

9902193
getter	setter
so when you add a getter or a setter it looks like half of a getter setter property pair and since the setter isn t there it s a problem for gorm

9902240
jar	war
if you package this code in both the war file and in a jar file in your ear this might return you the correct information depending on the classloader

9902266
equals	gethashcode
for equivalence yes you should write that yourself if you need that but it is rarely all that useful really and there s a problem because if you override equals you should override gethashcode too with a suitably parallel implementation

9902275
post	get
this means that it is not necessary to send all the table s value through form post get method

9902310

the easiest would probably be to use jquery and the show hide div

i assumed that because i have inherited from the pfitemobject i should be able to assign values to the superclass properties without problem

9909276
rss	feed
i am working on custom rss feed for one of my clients website example.com and for that the feed url takes query strings to customize the feed like

9909315
stdout	stderr
what i am trying to achieve is to read from both stdout and stderr whilst in addition writing to stdin and ensure that the output can be matched up with the inputs

9909320
unsigned	short
if it doesn t contain strings in a given format or if it contains more lines than what will fit inside an unsigned short the program will crash burn

9909378
min	max
you could fetch min max values from database and then assign them to javascript variables inside of the tag

9909378
min	max
where min and max contian data from db

9909397
junit	testng
spring-test.jar library helps to integrate testng and junit by the way with spring for testing purposes

9909408
post	get
using an access token that you said you already know how to get the administrator of the page will be able to call the above urls and get the wall post

as a rule in a css class then addclass and removeclass

9909521
google-chrome	firefox
ie9 8 7 firefox google-chrome

9909551
put	get
i don t get why you didn t put them yourself unless you wanted to assign none to strusername strwage and strhours

9909570
min	max
likely your query will need to pick using an aggreagate function on dataadded use the min or the max function

9909604
pull	push
this repo was cloned from an svn repo which we still use to push from pull to the svn repo is our central blessed repo for triggering ci etc

9909604
pull	push
but i don t know how git-svn handles line endings during the push pull operations

9909609
bash	zsh
personally i d make it absolutely clear and perhaps explicitly call bash or zsh or whatever with the path to the shell script as the first argument or directly call ruby with the -rubygems and script test_s2t.rb as arguments

9909652
stdout	fflush
in your case you redirected pipe to stdout then called fflush to make everything in stdout fflush and move them to read buffer

9909655
cpu	affinity
the parking is not controlled by the cpu affinity setting of your process it is done automatically by the windows cpu scheduler

9909655
cpu	affinity
adjustments to your cpu affinity can perhaps force utilization of certain cores but then windows will just park different cores

9909655
cpu	affinity
setting your own cpu affinity is something you should do with extreme caution

9909655
cpu	affinity
the cpu scheduler is aware of such things so usually the affinity is best left to it -- unless you know what you re doing and have checked that system s cpu

9909689
tunnel	vpn
i think what you want to achieve it create a vpn tunnel connection form your system server to another system server that has smpp installed

9909749
fast-forward	merge
if it can simply be fast-forward git merge --ff-only otherbranch will succeed

9909786

use any other method like get post or ajax to get the content from php and then append it inside the required container

9909820

my problem is i want to get data to be transferred from another controller by passing same parameter to its method via post

9909905
jax-ws	jax-rs
i use jax-ws soap and jax-rs rest annotations in my code along with jaxb for data binding

9909905
post	put	post	get	put	get
you can call a restful service in approximately the same way without the soap envelope but it could also be a get or a put not post

9909912
cruisecontrol	jenkins
this can be trivially run by cruisecontrol or jenkins or whatever

9909921

9910100
mongohq	mongolab
i m moving to heroku and mongodb either mongolab or mongohq for the database solution

9910157
getter	setter
if you expect your class to be extended and the getter setter overridden it is best to use the methods instead of the variables

9910157
getter	setter
you can mark the getter setter as final and then you don t have to worry about overrides

9910175
getter	setter
rule #1 always limit the access to the least necessary unless you explicitly need to change the values of the first last names make the object immutable constructor with parameters no setter only getter

9910178
hide	show
you could change your approach by having a hidden div with those contents already within it then your problem comes down to having the drop down show hide depending on the field

9910189
vb.net	vb6
i have a winforms control written in vb.net for vb6 program

9910199
screens	tablet
my goal is to create an activity where the android load some object for example notes and place this notes into the activity in order to give the illusion at the final user to have a lot of post-it on the screens of the tablet

9910228
qthread	qobject
i creati a simple class which extends two classes qobject and qthread

9910228

freemarker	velocity
many exist but the two big boys are freemarker and apache velocity

however the example only works in google-chrome and safari i guess

9910302
filtering	grouping
basically you want the specified user and any of these other filtering that are grouping together using internal or s

9910304
vtk	paraview
when i try to load a vtk file which is approximately 100mb in size in paraview the program crashes

9910361
inherited	properties
say for example you want a properties which as inherited has the browsable true attribute but for your control you want browsable false

9910445
joptionpane	jdialog
often you might want to use a jdialog joptionpane to handle login

9910477
int	double
int is converted implicitly to double so no errors occured

9910485
wmv	asf	wma	asf
if you do want to differentiate between wma and wmv and not just asf you will have to parse the media file using asfmojo

9910510
pop-up	dialog
one of the button as you can see in the code below is a preview button where if clicked another dialog will pop-up to display more info about the intended operation consequences

9910515
wmv	asf	wma	asf
the only difference between asf files and wmv or wma files are the

9910596
post	get
what i didnt want to do is do one query to get the post then iterate through each one and query to get and set the tag category array - but maybe that s my only option

9910616
m2e	pom.xml
there are several possibilities how the lifecycle mapping can be configured in the pom.xml in m2e extensions since m2e 1.1 snapshot in metadata provided by the plugin

9910628
getter	setter	public	protected
it is considered best practice for encapsulation to use private fields with accessors getter and setter instead of protected and public fields

9910628
public	protected
so by following this best practice we never use protected and public anymore

9910654
public	protected
sometimes protected is acceptable if you expect there to be subclasses though. and public static final attributes are also perfectly okay

9910654
public	protected
that said public and protected methods are absolutely necessary

9910722
jmenubar	jmenuitem
another way is use cardlayout if autentification passed then to display jmenubar with jmenuitem for access to another cards

9910725
public	protected
apart from that and some protected cases - but need always to be careful i think it s very rare to see that and you should have some good reasons i can t think of for making a field public and not final at least

9910725
getter	setter
however i also think that use of getter setter should be limited to the minimum indispensable - i saw in the past people putting getter on every field - even when not needed

9910735
folder	directory
i have a ruby on rails website which i have successfully tar the apps directory which included the current folder ect

9910762
put	get
i understand that they exist in order for your class to get more information about itself like its data or whether it should do something i just don t always know where to put it

9910828
width	margin
css note that i have removed margin and place it using absolute positioning since you know the width is 220px

9910830
getter	setter
it s certainly more convenient and readable to just have a class with public fields than a class with a bunch of getter and setter

9910851
min	max
so there will store many matrices data in that table now i need to get average value for each matrix edge by edge if one matrix is 20 30 and had value in 5 3 5 7 5 15 12 4 17 5 17 10 i need to get four groups of data one for all values that x 5 one for all values that x 17 one for all values that y 4 and one for all values that y 15 cause they are the max min for x and y

9910854
versioning	upgrade
which got implemented when it got upgrade to versioning 3

9910875
post	get
other wise you can define the time from last interaction with the server and calculate the time to expire in the client by getting the date from last get post that returned successfully

9910879
google-chrome	firefox
it s working fine on google-chrome the icon is centered on the button but in firefox the icon is completly down

9910894
public	protected
public private protected and package are not limited to fields

9910966
bash	zsh
suppose a script that if the user is using zsh then put path to his .zshrc and if using bash should put in .bashrc

9910981
vim	sublimetext
i ve poked around in the sublimetext documentation but haven t come across a good way of replicating the above vim command in subl

9910988
getter	setter
using getter and setter is not best in all cases

9910988
public	protected
again because direct access is much simpler in some instances you may use protected to give direct access to subclasses while denying access to the public

9911007
google-chrome	firefox
using the example code below i am able to set the cursor position in firefox google-chrome and ie9 to after the inner div

9911032
pop-up	dialog
then when i get to the place in my app where i ve set a breakpoint instead of hitting the breakpoint eclipse is not even going into debug perspective my app suddenly expires and the emulator pop-up the dialog

9911103
post	get
you can have a single function to handle both post and get

9911104
screens	tablet
so im making an android app that i want to support both tablet and mobile phone screens sizes i tried using the supports-screen method but when i type in support xlarge screens gives me an error

9911124
put	get
however when i put the plugin on the website i get a complete different results which looks like this

9911131
width	height
this is because because i wan t to increase the border property of that button control and at the same time wan t the button to stay same size height and width

9911148
getter	setter
i think with a custom setter and getter

9911243
bufferedoutputstream	inputstream
therefore need to write the inputstream to a temp file by bufferedoutputstream

9911285
clang	llvm
gcc shows both warnings as does llvm s clang 2.9

9911295
google-chrome	safari
i m not going to use this with ie browsers just safari google-chrome if that helps out

9911322
strcpy	strncpy
the strncpy version of strcpy limit the characters you can copy

9911333
width	height
3 to handle the horizontal fit i found that css gave me problems with iframes pdf combos in a few browsers as of today and resorted to using old-school width and height as follows

9911333
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
quirky but it works in firefox google-chrome ie9 safari so please do not neg me for browser quirks

9911338
portrait	landscape
keep in mind that you must support both orientations landscape and portrait when developing an app for release on ipad

9911373
versioning	upgrade
we are unfortunately using an older versioning of magento 1.1.8 and have no opportunity to upgrade at this point

9911382
post	get
aside of binding same function to post and get as suggested by justsid in other answer you may use app.all handler to route all request types to function

9911383
min	max
cause a select list cannot include both a group function such as avg count max min sum stddev or variance and an individual column expression unless the individual column expression is included in a group by clause

9911383
min	max
remove the group by function ie min max sum count from the select statement

9911390
portrait	landscape
the portrait mode sets images with correct orientation but once i use landscape mode the images are set rotated 90 degrees clockwise

9911390
portrait	landscape
if i look at uiimageorientation on all images the value is always 3 nslog d uiimageorientation in both portrait and landscape modes

9911423
comparator	icomparer
you r idea is basicly right only that you need the icomparer as well the comparator alone is not enough

9911455
ember.js	backbone.js
i was looking for information comparing ember.js and backbone.js for use with a ruby on rails backend

9911456
put	get
put particular emphasis on the application access token that is where i get confused

9911572
qthread	qobject
qthread inherits qobject already so you must not inherit from qobject

9911573
put	get
you could still put some incredibly simply puzzle on your start page to get rid of them i guess but that might alienate some visitors as well

9911625
udp	tcp
the only reliable method for tcp udp integrity checking is encapsulation inside a cryptographically secure layer

9911628
width	font-size
divide the nowadays 17 monitors standard resolution 1440px width with this pixels 1em font-size result

9911658
inherited	properties
i keep it in one class not multiple inherited classes for simplicity sake there are ten types but they mostly have the same properties

9911664
tabs	tabpanel
i ve seen how to handle extjs window and tabpanel but i can t figure out how to get the reference of the dialog i m in so that i can manipulate it add remove tabs

9911697
int	double
means divide the int 3 by the int 2 and then cast the result which is the int 1 to a double giving you 1.0

9911699
int	double
both 3 and 2 are int so despite receiver being double you still get an int result and it is then converted to double

9911700
zipalign	apksigner
if you use apksigner zipalign must only be performed before the apk file has been signed

9911700
zipalign	jarsigner
if you use jarsigner zipalign must only be performed after the apk file has been signed

9911703

9912696
google-chrome	safari
the other half is that google-chrome and safari have poor printing options and cannot print background-images or background-colors

9912696
google-chrome	safari
although google-chrome and safari will work they do not have the print background options

9912696
google-chrome	firefox
it s compatible with google-chrome firefox and ie and doesn t require users to toggle a specific option to get the correct output

9912696

free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
if you re trying to allocate using pure c you use malloc or calloc to allocate and free to deallocate

9913026

you should change the 3 occurrences of 10 in your two for loops by the max variable so when the user define another size your for-loop will take his input instead of the 10 value

9913033
getter	setter	superclass	subclassing
i want to get my head around the idea of using setter and getter in superclass and subclassing in terms of software good practices

9913033
superclass	subclassing
declaring a protected instance variables in the superclass and let the subclassing uses them

9913033
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
declaring a private instance variables in the superclass with public getter methods to let the subclassing inherited the getter methods from the superclass

9913083
google-chrome	firefox
it works perfectly in google-chrome firefox ie9

9913099
getter	setter
normally i would have public getter setter methods since anyone can use them not just subclasses

9913103
cos	sin
however an interesting issue is that computing the trigonometric functions sin cos and tan requires reduction of their argument modulo 2ï

9913103
cos	sin
this is how most all c versions of the sin cos tan functions work

9913107
post	get
servlet will communicate through post get to the backend

9913149
draggable	droppable
so i have these draggable elements which are pulled via a database that drag from one area to a droppable sortable area

9913152
getter	setter
if your ultimate goal is interoperability and scalability you re safer using getter setter

9913152
getter	setter
another advantage is with the getter setter you can perform multiple operations instead of only a single operation for instance getusers may actually tabulate multiple data rows

9913170
width	height
first of all you calculate the contentsize for the scrollview when you want to use the ipad in landscapemode with 8 pages then the width should be 1024 8 8192px and the height 768px

9913213
getter	setter
otherwise i always pick 2 creating getter setter

9913213
getter	setter
any good book on object oriented programming will list other benefits of using getter and setter

9913260

because the number of replies varies for each comment i cannot do a simple mouseover mouseout script

9913295

post	get
also try doing a post instead of get some servers do not allow that verb

9913344
innodb	myisam

9913362
ddms	adb
go to ddms perspective click on the down arrow next to the screen capture camera icon and select reset adb from the dropdown menu

see fpdi documention on setting width height

9913461
width	height
you re looking for images are rectangular that have similar height width dimensions

in the build events for the project the only macro seems to point to the build output in the solution files on my computer not to the end directory on the mobile device output file folder under deployment options

9913557
nexus	artifactory
the latter can be improved by adding maven repository manager such as nexus or artifactory that would cache and optimize access to all remote maven repositories

9913600
for-loop	loops
like mentioned above the nested for-loop is unnecessary and can be inefficient if you plan to create larger rectangles in the future not saying you re going to have to but try to stay away from nested for loops if you can

9913652
gif	png
if you want to convert the bitmapsource to other file format like png or gif you have to use third party libraries like .net image tools

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
happens with google-chrome safari and firefox

9913765
google-chrome	safari
this method uses a controlled amount of memory grows to 100mb and stops but it is slow especially in safari 50 cpu usage there 17 in google-chrome

9913902
versioning	upgrade
i m pretty sure that other upgrade always copied the user settings from the previous versioning so i d guess that there s some problem related to the new certificate

9913910
keystore	jks
client certificate .cer .crt .pem and it s corresponding private key .key should be packaged into pkcs#12 .p12 .pfx or jks .jks container first keystore

9913978
versioning	upgrade
it looks like the user settings framework can see the previous versioning but they just didn t get upgrade for some reason

9913978
versioning	upgrade
i used mitch s technique for upgrading user settings to manually call upgrade the first time i run a new versioning

9913978
versioning	upgrade
a useful trick for testing this upgrade process several times was jason s suggestion of copying old versioning of the application manifest over the current versioning

9913998
pop-up	dialog
the jquery ui has a real nice pop-up function called dialog

9914024

for-loop	arrays
i have an arrays of structs and i intend to pass each element of the arrays into separate pthreads in a for-loop

9914115
hash	salt
on our users table the password salt and hash are different on each record -- which leads me to believe that somehow rails is somehow running transactions save operations twice

9914128
for-loop	arrays
but the objects will be created dynamically since the amount of balls could range from 3 to 25 preferably with a for-loop pushing the different balls to an arrays

9914177
put	get
how did those get there i didn t put them there

9914191
cpython	pypy

9914212
width	height
the max width and height are there to make sure the image dont size to big

strcpy	strncpy
one solution is to pass the size of the buf in the function and check it before strcpy or use strncpy

9914251
sitecore	kentico
for .net i am looking at sitecore ektron and kentico

9914258

jquery to show hide steps and preventdefault on steps 1 2

9914327
vsto	add-in
they don t live together happily in the same add-in so you should either base everything on excel-dna which allows you to access both the c api and the com interfaces or make two separate add-in vsto has some ribbon and other high-level wrappers which can be convenient.

9914333
implements	extends
i ve looked into extends newtonsoft.json.serialization.defaultcontractresolver and implements my own newtonsoft.json.jsonconverter but i have not discovered any way to implements this desired override

9914379
client-side	server-side
few ways you can do this from the collection but whichever way you choose you have to call destroy on each model which will run sync and destroy it on both the client-side and server-side which localstorage is acting as

9914425
client-side	server-side
i m currently new into client-side programming especially using the jquery ajax method to call server-side methods

9914437
rtp	sdp
as i understand it you need to have a sdp information so that the receiving ffmpeg instance can interpret the rtp stream

9914477
pop-up	dialog
i am trying to avoid leaving the page because the dialog pop-up is a lookup that helps a user populate a form field

9914477
pop-up	dialog
i somewhat like the built-in jqm implementation of the dialog pop-up for long multiselects

9914518
hide	show
you can just bind the menu click event for all divs with .evtog classes the handler hide the submenus that are visibles and show the submenu

9914522

9914586
button	checkbox
however when the currently selected radio button is selected again the selection is cleared like a checkbox i guess

9914586
button	checkbox
my implementation checks the status of the radio button and if selected clears the selection emulating the un-selecting like a checkbox

9914586
mouselistener	actionevent
one solution would be to essentially log the buttongroup s selected button right before any actionevent fires although my program isn t psychic like that i suspect i could easily implement this using a mouselistener although that restricts functionality to mouse-usage and i could use the keyboard etc thanks for any pointers

9914622

i put the gridview inside an aspxcallbackpanel and am trying to get my gridview to update on the page after an attachment is uploaded using aspxcallbackpanel.performcallback

9914696

9914726
getter	setter
in this case use a property instead of a public field or explicit setter getter methods

9914726
getter	setter
properties are compiled down to setter getter methods which allows you to change your internal implementation later on if required so still respects encapsulation

9914726
getter	setter
explicit setter getter methods are not idiomatic for c#

9914876
jcheckbox	jradiobutton
this is common issue with jradiobutton and jcheckbox and occasionally for another jbuttons jcomponents these events must be wrapped into invokelater

9914876

if you however need to use grid for some reason you can set horizontalalignment to left and verticalalignment to top specify appropriate values for width and height and then set margin to x y 0 0

9914935
width	height
now it is nessesary that this canvas object has always a ratio between width and height

9915210
jpql	hql
jpql and hql expects a path between the entities in order to join them

9915228

although one should avoid creating threads which will simply run for a short time and quit or creating really huge numbers of threads using a dedicated thread for each serial port will ensure that when data comes in there will be a thread ready to handle it

9915238
onmouseover	onclick
i tried applying this to radio buttons too that would change the bg color onclick however if i wanted a preview of the color by using onmouseover that part didn t work as it doesn t with the above

i know using wp function the_title i can get the title of the post

9915400
titlebar	window
this removes the click action so it becomes like a modal window without losing the titlebar

9915403
int	double
i think mvc doesn t cast convert from int to decimal so the .00 tells it to hydrate using float double decimal

9915446
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i m setting up a uistoryboard in interface builder and while everything is working fine i seem to be unable to hook up the delegate outlet of the uitabbarcontroller to any of the uiviewcontroller s in the uistoryboard regardless of their position in the uistoryboard

9915446
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i ve set the uiviewcontroller s to be a in the .h file but interface builder won t allow me to select the uiviewcontroller as the delegate for the uitabbarcontroller

width	height
and you have to make sure that the canvas parent does not set its width or height at the same time

9915480

width	height
in the css file i ve set your image in background of my container with fixed width and height

9915501
folder	directory
make sure that the thumbdest destination folder directory is writable by the user that apache or the web server is running as

9915508
min	max
you can use the same thing to make sure value is min and max

9915512
implements	extends
if you re using default android styles then the idea would be to extends whatever style you re implements and just change the elements you need

9915521
min	max	range	min	range	max
if you range between 0 and 10 and want 0 10 to fail exclude min and max - simply replace with and with

9915528
filtering	grouping
that way you can join on one table where feed id s match as well as grouping by or filtering by content type

9915535
google-chrome	firefox
my rendered html looks great in google-chrome but not in firefox or ie the links are not as wide and the page looks weird because the fourth link doesn t hit the right edge of the page

9915640
uilabel	uibutton
after a bit of playing around i realized that uitextfield can be thought of as a uibutton rounded rect style with a uilabel on top of it

9915640
uilabel	uibutton
in my case i wanted a read only text-field so i used uilabel on top of uibutton

9915664
stdout	stderr
simply open 2 two files fd1 and fd2 and then use dup2 fd1 1 for stdout and dup2 fd2 2 for stderr

filtering	grouping
i grouping on the productid then use that in a 2nd query to filtering the original collection

9915758
hex	binary
to expand on comments below if this problem was expressed in hex or binary it could be done very simply using shift operators

9915775
width	height
if you have a recent enough compiler you can replace your height width weight etc code with

9915798
post	get
you ll know there if the browser is actually hitting the server on every click and you can even see with what parameters whether post or get

9915847
rss	feed
i have an expression in the middle of a bunch of html actually an rss feed of the form

9915849
popover	tooltip
currently no since the popover script is basically extending the functionally of the tooltip script but nothing is impossible

9915874
width	height
i doubt this is the cause of your issue but the width and height that you apply to are declared outside the tag which might prevent those attributes from being interpreted

9915881
filtering	grouping
you might try a grouping and filtering approach something like the following

9915882
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
i ve only used while loops to put data into arrays but i figured using a for-loop here would be easier

9915882
for-loop	arrays
not sure if it s my for-loop that is messed up or if it s an issue with passing the arrays

9915884
google-chrome	firefox
under firefox and other google-chrome it is right

9915893
implements	extends
if instead you have a concrete beveragedecorator class that extends or implements beverage by simply delegating each call to the wrapped beverage subclasses can extends beveragedecorator and only implements the methods they care about leaving the base class to handle delegation

9915919
umask	chmod
if you ve already installed gitolite then existing files will have to be fixed up manually for a umask or 0027 that would be chmod -r g+rx

9915943
children	parent	onresume	onpause
when you create a tabhost to hold activities the children inside it can t manage their own lifecycled methods onresume onpause oncreated etc and the parent the holder must do all the managements

9915943
onresume	onpause
i ve implemented this behavior by overwriting onpause and onresume in the holder the activity that defines the tabhost like this

9915943
onresume	onpause
with it i think that your onresume onpause methods gonna be triggered

9915971
portrait	landscape
the image centering must persist through a screen rotation from portrait to landscape

9915997
children	parent
in all the examples i have seen there is no reference to the parent in the children

may be you can put the desired cell in the tag property which accepts objects then at menu item click get the cell from the tag and set it s value

9916013
folder	directory
the filewatch folder is the watch directory

9916016
hash	md5
consider for example restoring the original value from its md5 hash

9916016
hash	md5
for a lambda calculating md5 hash inverted function must break md5 in cryptological sense

9916036
implements	extends
public class andactivity extends activity implements locationlistener

9916051
min	max
for example a sampler can have uv wrap modes min and max filters and anisotropy

9916051
dictionary	map
another way of doing it would be to add samplers to my resource dictionary so they can be shared by any map that happens to have the same parameters

9916075
post	get
no user can change any variable of your code unless you leave it open to them using some sort of post get cookie etc

9916081
int	chars
use int to get the values then you can place them in chars array since they have byte values

9916108
google-chrome	firefox
i have a standard membership provider for security and everything works fine as long as i use google-chrome or firefox

9916108
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
so this all works fine in google-chrome and firefox but when i try to run the same code using ie or safari the membership object is null

9916117
post	get
i can get the questions to post

9916119
interpolation	splines
i found solutions to this which use splines interpolation and or other things i don t understand to smooth the line by adding a bunch of additional vertices

9916128
int	chars
strings in c are terminated by the 0 chars which has the int value 0

9916198

te way we solved this problem was more specific css to override all the properties we don t like that got inherited from jquery

9916206
width	height
what i want is that it only changes the related comment width and height

9916253

i have a url from an rss feed that when viewed in a browser redirects to the full url which contains id s that i need in the app

9916264

i m trying to create a simple queue with java thread that would allow a loops say a for-loop with 10 iterations to iterate n 10 threads at a time and wait until those threads are finished before continuing to iterate

9916277
hash	md5
that will invalidate the md5 hash of the existing registry and force it to build a new one

9916332
salt	md5
beyond md5 vs sha2 which is a good idea it s actually much more important to add a randomly generated salt to each password

9916343
for-loop	arrays
the problem is every time it ticks it always creates the arrays and the for-loop

9916350
width	height
after reducing the code and commenting out it was the animation of width and height that are causeing the problem

9916368
versioning	upgrade
if you re using a lesser versioning upgrade before going any farther

9916399
processors	hyperthreading
if the processors supports virtual parallelism hyperthreading i think it is the name

9916399
processors	hyperthreading
ex 4 processors with hyperthreading 8 threads max

yacc	bison
if i wanted to write - for example - a simple yacc bison style parser that converted a simple syntax using + - etc

9916436
int	chars
if you want to read into a chars instead of an int use the modifier hh

9916441
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine for firefox and ie or if i execute the query in the google-chrome browser

9916454
setinterval	settimeout
without having read the code myself from what i understand it is indeed using standard javascript methods and properties to update the dom elements and css styles at regular intervals ticks which it accomplishes using standard setinterval and settimeout methods

9916458
put	get
however i put the in the while loop just to see if the data was actually going in and i get -858993460 each time

9916465

9916808
int	double
this question is about the threshold at which math.floor double and math.ceiling double decide to give you the previous or next int value

9916840
ceil	floor
floor and ceil simply act on their argument in exactly the way you would expect

9916875
folder	directory
if you want to hide your file url from users its better to move upload folder above of your webroot directory

9916881
width	margin
if your button is a block-level element you will need to define it s width and use margin auto like you did with the centerbuttons element

9916903
google-chrome	firefox
once you ve done this your original code will work in ie7 and greater just like it does in firefox google-chrome

9916926
put	get
since a runner may put his phone in hand on the shoulder or in his pocket my first intuition is to use gps to get locations and calculate running speed and running distance

9916927
put	get
i still get the same error lines generated when i put the war file into the webapps folder

9916935
post	get
normally -d will tell curl to send a post but i have confirmed that the -x get is overriding that and it is sending get

9916980
portrait	landscape
i like techzen s accepted answer but as pointed out in adam s comment it leaves the portrait view controller in the navigation stack when you rotate to landscape

9916980
portrait	landscape
this means tapping the back button in the navigation bar while in landscape will take the user to the portrait view

9916980
portrait	landscape
to go from portrait to landscape

9917037
postgresql	mysql
i need to be sure the database i m connecting to is mysql and not postgresql or microsoft sql server.how can i find out which type of database is being used

9917056
postgresql	mysql
the first hint might be the connection error you re likely to get if you try to connect to a postgresql database with a mysql database driver

9917070
folder	directory
using a .htaccess file with deny from all will stop people accessing that folder it wont stop php from accessing it but you could put your files one directory lower then your htdocs www public_html folder and use php to grab and serve thos files

9917084
post	get
the tradeoff is that every post will do a get for each script

9917091
google-chrome	firefox
i developed it mostly in google-chrome and a little firefox

9917104
children	parent
for example if you have have a parent div with two nested children and you need to have even 10px spacing between the children and also have the children be spaced 10 px from the parent

9917104
children	parent
or would you leave the parent at 0 padding and have the children define what seperation they need from each other and also their parent

there is of course no permission on the external storage filesystems because it s a fat filesystems

9917479
ubuntu	linux
tested on python3.2 ubuntu linux

9917487
for-loop	arrays
that means your for-loop will cause an arrays access beyond the end of your prio_q arrays

9917518
button	checkbox
you are looking for a ui paradigm that is neither a checkbox nor a radio button

9917527
portrait	landscape
however if you open a previous view controller in landscape and then try to open the viewc ontroller hosting the table in landscape the width of the table uses the portrait width not the landscape width

hex	binary
you could convert the hex 2f to an integer 47 and then convert it back to a binary string 101111

i searched for the past couple hours reading dozens of post on the topic of memory management in objective-c and i just don t get it

in the caller function while testing i put an nslog to print the return string and i dont get anything not even the log part

9917856
portrait	landscape
the only problem is that it uses the api level 9 camera.camerainfo to get the orientation of the camera with respect to the device presumably to deal with landscape vs portrait devices

9917901
getter	setter
you provide getter and setter for each property again implicitly telling users of your class that it is ok to set on but not the other

9917965
width	height
the idea is to subtract half of the width and height from the x and y to centre

9917969
google-chrome	firefox
the simplicity of google-chrome is definitely preferable to the slightly steeper learning curve for firefox extensions however as long as you build your extension using mostly html css js there isn t much difference between the two browsers

folder	directory
but somehow i cannot make it to display the sub folder within that directory

9918209
hide	show
when a cpu intensive function runs it locks the main executing thread and the browser doesn t do a repaint until the function has finished executing hence the div is getting hidden and show really fast because both show and hide were queued

this is not guaranteed to work cross browser and i have only tested this on ie google-chrome and firefox

macports	homebrew
you can use macports or others as well i prefer homebrew

9918369
children	parent
1 parent can have any number of children

the primary argument for not allowing init to use accessor is that it is possible that a future unknown subclass might create side-effects in the accessor

9918418
subtract	add

subtraction	addition
matter whether addition or subtraction is done first

my site looks fine in firefox but when i open it in google-chrome the slides are stacked in one page

9919187
google-chrome	firefox
but what confuses me is when i use inspect element in google-chrome it sets the layout right just like in firefox

using a bufferedwriter is recommended for an expensive writer a filewriter and using a printwriter gives you access to println syntax that you re probably used to from system.out

9919216
printwriter	bufferedwriter
but the bufferedwriter and printwriter wrappers are not strictly necessary

9919224
filewriter	printwriter
your printwriter wraps another writer which is probably a filewriter

9919883
switching	screens
so if one would want to achieve that what i was trying to achieve - that is to get one panorama item to stretch over 3 screens widths - the best way to go is to make 3 separate panorama items and try to set the margins of each one manually so the user feels like he s browsing the one and the same panorama item seamlessly switching from one to another

post	get
thanks to the answers below i came up with the solution my issue wasn t getting access to the data from the array as i was recieving it a different way but from an array all the same but correctly encoding it in the post request here is what i ended up with note that i m using gravity forms to get the data

post	get
the web pages should support get head and post

9923433
post	get
get and head being much more frequent than post

9923433
post	get
the page content will not change with get head only with post

9923433
post	get
therefore i want to serve get and head requests directly from the file system and only post requests from the servlet

9923433
post	get
a first slightly incomplete idea is that the post request would pre-calculate the html for successive get head requests and store it into the file system

9923433
post	get
post in this case would not generate any html but only update the database appropriately and delete the html file from the file system as a flag to have it generated anew with the next get head

button	checkbox
one possible solution would be to have your row.xml file contain both 2 textviews and a checkbox and edittext + some button but make the edittext and button default to then you could set an onitemclicklistener for the listview that will call view.setvisibility on the proper views to make them visible invisible

9926410
persistent	transient
some of records should be persistent why some as far as i understood - 1st stream are transient

9926410
persistent	transient
in a nutshell - my suggestion to pick up hbase for data you want to persistent and store sorted and consider some more lightweight solutions for transient but still considerable big data

just a thought but i think this is one of the results of default styles that every browser has in this case google-chrome and the other browsers aside from firefox are displaying the p tag inside of the list item as an inline item by default and thus the number from the ordered list is displaying side by side the p tag

doesn t occur in firefox and google-chrome as their java script executes much faster

9935311
onclick	onsubmit
there is no way to submit properties of an input besides the name and value however you can have hidden inputs on the form with whatever information you want and you can even create them or populate them dynamically in the button s onclick even or the form s onsubmit event

9935311
post	get
and if you are really out for ideas then you can stuff the info in the query string of the url in the action attribute of the form and then get the info by checking the get array however if the form method is get instead of post then the values might get overwritten

9935311
onclick	onsubmit
1 that the onsubmit function doesn t know which button was pressed however you can instead use the button s onclick event but you will have to bind to every submit button on the form you can do this much easier with jquery etc.

9935311
submit	submission
for problems 2-4 you can aldo solve them by having the ajax just the extra content and then return true to let the default submission submit the form

or it can choose a base automatically if base is specified as zero same as the c compiler does depending on how the number is written a leading 0 chooses octal a leading 0x or 0x chooses hexadecimal else decimal

9935443

if you re doing the comparisons in java the java.util.date class already implements comparable so you can just use its comparator method

ssl	https
accept that tampering can t be avoided if you don t use a secure protocol like https can either use ssl or tls

9935465
hash	salt
on client side you call the script and provide the username as non encrypted and your password as a sha1 hash rehashed with a random salt sha1 sha1 pass +salt the salt is stored in the user session on server side

9935465
hash	salt
the script would then compared the provided hash with db password hash rehashed with session salt

9935465
hash	salt
plus if you use as salt a string using hex char of a variable even length it will make the job harder for the attacker to recognised that the value bruteforced by the second hash is a sha1 hash and even if he know it s an sha1 he will have to test multiple case to try to find the right portion of the value that correspond to the hash

9935465
hash	salt
because of variable salt a same password won t be the same if hash

9935465
hash	md5
finally sha1 hash are safer than md5 i tell you that because you used the md5 tag in your post

9935465
3des	aes
an hardcore way still without using https would be to encrypt your password and username with a strong cypher like aes or 3des and use a secure key echange algorythm like the diffie hellman one to exchange a random shared key

i have a jframe which consists only of a jlist the jlist has its own cell renderer in the cell renderer a jtextpane is returned with a custom size

implements	extends
currently i implements buildings by adding a simple look-up in the route-dictionary during onactionexecuting in a base controller that all my controllers extends so what i was thinking was that i could check for the existence of a buildings-querystring-parameter and if it was present create several instances of the current controller set the building-variable on the child controller and call the method in question but i don t know if this is a good way to do it and i don t know how to invoke the autorizeattribute on the child either so what i m asking after writing all this is a good way to orchestrate this problem in a good way

ready	each
the document ready function will execute while the page load or each time you hit the refresh button

9937291
width	height
if you want more control over that - you can bind both width and height to the same value from a view model that you change depending on the need or write a converter that will convert a hardcoded width height value to actual value depending on detected screen size resolution or settings

9937333

depending on how you are initialising the arrays there may be a vectorised way to achieve this without using a for-loop

you could apply the max function to that column or min or any other suitable aggregate function

9938224

doing this with pure php on your own will get very messy so i recommend using fpdf in combination with fpdi to open your templates

my couchdb is actually a ssl cloudant database and my app is hosted on heroku which is deferent than the app on heroku that is actually combined with cloudant

9938644
equals	gethashcode
distinct prefers both gethashcode and equals to be defined either for the type being compared or to have an equality comparer supplied

9938644
equals	gethashcode
you can implement gethashcode and equals for your type - but i sometimes find that a definition of equality in one case isn t always suitable for all cases - in ui cases it might be enough only to check that two objects ids match because the ui might not have all the same data defined on the object that is actually available therefore a single true equality can t always be satisfied

9938652
min	max
a database with min max temperatures with humidity and rain snow info etc

9938689
getter	setter
it seems that you are reluctant to write getter setter for some reason but that s pretty standard oo technique

9938718
equals	gethashcode
you need to implement in your class and provide your own gethashcode and equals methods

9938719

9938827
comparator	comparable
i would recommend you to use some inner class and than use arrays.sort for sorting you have to implement comparable interface or implements comparator interface for sorting

9938852
int	double
this way you will get double value then multiply it with 10e6 you will get int which you need to use in creating geopoints

9938888
children	parent
the most obvious ones are that the explicit tree has a greater memory overhead either involving pointers within each object or a separate object to be allocated for each object in the heap and is also slower as any time an object moves within the heap you have to update multiple pointers to children and possibly parent

9938888
put	get
the reason why you need to be able to get at the last element easily is that to add an element you make it the last element and then reorder it with respect to its parent and sibling an o log n operation or to remove the smallest you simply put the current last element in its place and reorder downwards

9938893
int	boolean
like float int boolean string

9938938

together these mean that you have a table which you want to filtering by two columns and grouping by a third

9939354
filtering	grouping
then for each grouping you just need to filtering the records with a join to filtering item_name and a between to filtering inv_date

9939356
int	chars
since c is not an interpreted language there is no internal representation of int or floating point numbers or chars

9939359
comparator	comparable
always safe to use either comparator or comparable interface to provide sorting implementation if the object is not a string or wrapper classes for primitive data types

9939388
post	put
post requests are being put straight into an sql query which allows someone with a specially crafted post request to execute any query pretty much on the server.

9939459
getter	setter
and you are missing the getter and setter of game and gamecodecolorindex

9939476
int	boolean
the point is that in perl there is no such thing as an int variable a float variable a string variable or a boolean variable

9939476
int	boolean
in fact as far as the user can usually tell there aren t even int float string or boolean values all you have are scalars which are all of these things at the same time

9939531
width	height
this can be useful when you need to determine text height in cell and you dont know width of that cell

9939568
division	multiplication
division may be heavier than multiplication but a commenter pointed out that reciprocals are just as fast as multiplication on modern cpus in which case this isn t correct for your case so if you do have 1 x appearing somewhere inside a loop and more than once you can assist by caching the result inside the loop and then using y

in this case you would usually set #content s width and height to 100

9941658
min	max

getter	setter
i guess it s because private fields with public getter and setter only generate line noise and don t add any real value

9942274
for-loop	loops
outside of inner for-loop so i assume that i has been declared outside of for-loop too which is not being changed anywhere so outer loops will only show i value which is declared outside the block you have been provided which i think is field of class

9942275
for-loop	loops
but this is done in a for-loop and the value of the two-dimensional array-value gets changed as loops runs since it is just used as an temp-variable which makes all of the variables stored in the arraylist gets changed as this variable changes

the behavior is the same in google-chrome and safari

9943106

9943669
put	get
just put this block of code to get the month

9943700

9943985
hex	binary
hex to binary in ruby

9943986
width	height
inline blocks table cells and table captions are also elements that you can affect height and width but that are not intrinsically 100 of the parent yes table tr td is one that would fill 100 of it s parent but it is designed to allow for multiple td s so the td doesn t count as it will automatically shrink to accommodate additional td s this also applies to any overflow other than visible because it breaks the containment of the block element

9944099
pop-up	dialog
for example when new button is clicked dialog pop-up asking user to fill some data

9944099
factories	presenter
inject factories to presenter

9944237
width	height
there is a random image inside for which i know some metadata width and height

9944237
width	height
otherwise the media query style applies and the image is at its default width height i know the image is never wider than 700px so all is fine

9944237
google-chrome	firefox
the behaviour of google-chrome firefox is the same but is quite strange for me

9944237
width	height
it would be perfect if the width and height attributes set for the image applied

9944247
reportlab	xhtml2pdf
reportlab xhtml2pdf have worked perfectly until now when it crashes at this style bit in html

9944267
put	get
if you put all together you get

the screen is implemented as a user-controls in a tabitem of a tabcontrol

9944365
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i currently have a menu using hovering image maps that works in firefox ie opera and google-chrome

9944365
google-chrome	safari
i m not sure if this is a quirk with safari or an actual bug but it surprisingly doesn t cause any issues with google-chrome or any of the other popular browsers that i have tried

9944377
post	put
thirdly my advice is that you put a break point once the page post back and you add a watch to request.allkeys so that you can see exactly what are the key names that you can use to retrieve the values submitted

9944384
width	height
in your markup remove the width and height attributes and then in your css add

9944386
tcpdf	fpdf
you can use any pdf creation tool fpdf zend tcpdf to create the form using xy or first convert the template to php and generate it on the fly

9944467
implements	extends
so you have a lot of control how you implements and extends functions in scala but i think you have a real replacement in mind

9944508

9944610
jflex	cup

9944633
textile	liquid
the content is still in textile because monthly.html is a html file and jekyll doesn t run any text processor over html files other than liquid which just does a substitution with the text in page.content no conversion

9944633
textile	liquid
however jekyll has some built-in liquid filters to help with this specifically textilize to convert textile to html

9944678
width	height

9945007
post	put	post	get	put	get
i honestly do not know anything related to rest structure so i ve done some research and find a valuable information that one of the key things that separates rest from other structures is that it utilizes the get post put delete requests of http

9945007
post	put	post	get	put	get
for example if i code it and simply enter a url www.example.com users 1234 how will my server side analyze whether its a get post put or delete request

google-chrome	firefox
see in google-chrome and then in either firefox or internet explorer

the standard game loop approach is to use the keydown event to set a key-is-down flag and use the keyup event to reset it

9949448
min	max
alternatively since min and max are the same for all three dimensions you could use np.minimum and np.maximum like so

9949448
min	max
i recommend calling min and max something else so that they don t shadow the builtins

9949470

9949527
scalapack	mpi
the only way i ve ever used mpi_type_create_darray myself and indeed the only way i ve ever seen it used is to create an mpi file view of a large matrix to distribute the data in a block-cyclic fashion so that one can read the file in and then use scalapack to do parallel linear algebra operations on the distributed matrix

9949573
queue	fifo
for events each subscriber is queue up put at end of list a fifo model

cos	sin
keep in mind that i have tried the various versions of the basic calculator and have been through a few of those tutorials and just want to learn and may use the methods to add scientific functions such as rad sin cos and some other stuff in the app

9949747
public	protected
as for your question of where your code goes yes the import goes at the top with the others your addcallback statement goes under the entry point comment and the function becomes a function on the main class just like the init function - within a class it will need a scope declaration like public protected or private

9950538
inherited	subclassing
this is critical to understand when deciding to use subclassing and class inherited as a means of constructing programs you don t make your subclassing more specific than your interface or super classes

9950538
superclass	subclassing
for subclassing to work in ways that solve problems instead of create problems you need to abide by this guideline all subclassing must be functionally equivalent to the superclass liskov substitution principle this means that three classes which provide database access to three different databases is a good candidate for being subclassing from a common class or perhaps sharing a common interface because the functionality is offer database access

9950539

treat postmaster localpart as case-insensitive but all other as case-sensitive

9950546

9950558
apache	nginx
the idea is that during development you have a simple single process that you can run and check everything is working and where performance isn t an issue but when you deploy to production you configure your webserver usually apache or nginx to serve the static files as it is much better at that than ruby

9950602

do not use typedef for struct unless you are trying to create an opaque type

9950904

i moved the code to launch the webview from viewdidload to viewdidappear

9959703
post	get
i think the easiest way to do that is by registering a custom post type for the special post that get this special single.php template

9959706
post	get
the access_token value has to be passed as a get instead of a post with the rest of the parameters

9959710

i also have alot of getter and setter

9959840

9959902
int	chars
in some cases this easily allows analysis and synthesis code to abstract what the underlying datatype might actually be signed long int unsigned chars etc

9959923
int	double
for ieee double you have a 53 bit mantissa which is enough to represent 32 bit int considered as fixed point numbers between -1 0x80000000 and 1 - 2 -31 0x7fffffff

9959942
actionscript	haxe
here s a demo code for your reference for actionscript and haxe

9959951
oncreate	onstart
if you get rid of the isfinishing check i think you need to move the acquirebinding call from oncreate to onstart onresume depending on sdk version to ensure that your ref count doesn t get messed up

9960004
min	max
you can use just about any aggregate you want max min sum etc. above it doesn t matter as long as there s only one value for each distinct combination of tag and timestamp

9960007
int	double
when an int is converted to a double the number is held with an appropriate exponent 1023+10 and the same bit pattern is effectively stored as the original int actually ieee binary floating point does not store the top bit

9960007
int	double
a 32bit int will require a double to hold its value perfectly and an 8bit int will be held perfectly in a float

9960007
int	double
when code divides that 32bit int stored as a double to map it to the range + -1 then error will very likely be introduced

9960007
int	double
double holds 32-bit int perfectly

9960007
int	double	rational-numbers	fractions
so when an int is mapped to the range + -1 and hence is converted to a rational-numbers n m some numbers can not be represented by the finite number of bits in a double s fractions part so errors will creep in

9960007
int	double
so they can be converted back and forth between int and double using rounding and the error of double representation will not cause the int to be wrong

9960018
libpcap	jpcap
i built a webapp that uses libpcap via jpcap

9960384
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome will work fine

9960436
post	get
one way to get around this is to create a viewmodel struct that has both your post and key info untested but this is the gist of it

9960463
express	node.js
i can also do this with a hardcoded query in a node.js app using express restful routes and mongoose

9960497
width	height
to create the little triangular tip at the end of the speech bubble i used a css technique where the element is given a 0 width and 0 height and given borders

so with that as a background i formed the hypothesis that google-chrome was using wifi hotspots but firefox was falling back to geoip

9960515
google-chrome	firefox
results google-chrome places me right where firefox did far away in hood oregon

9960515
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome calculates your geolocation using wifi hotspots if available whereas firefox does not

9960515
google-chrome	firefox
perhaps it is as simple as google-chrome is setting this to true while firefox is not

9960538
for-loop	arrays
a typical for-loop from 0.. arrays count would fail to run harmlessly but counting from index 1 on an empty arrays is a bad access crash

9960675
namedtuple	dictionary
i know there is no frozen dictionary data type but if there was one how would it be different from namedtuple

9960702

imo getter and setter should be as logic-free as possible no more no less

9960717
hide	show
i want select div_answer to show hide

9960732
put	get
the problem is in the spec that tests the point 2 i check that sending a put request to the user_path i m redirected to the root but running rspec i get the following error

9960761
portrait	landscape
in my case i had portrait settings for the activity and changing it to landscape fixed it

9960761
width	height
my guess is that you re just mixing height and width of the preview

9960763
free	strdup
it is fine sometimes you have to do that the c function strdup does the same you just have to follow the convention to free it after use

9960784
namedtuple	dictionary
namedtuple instances do not have per-instance dictionary so they

9960787

google-chrome	firefox
in firefox the first timestamp is 0 and in google-chrome the timestamp is a sensible number

9960913
google-chrome	firefox
in both firefox and google-chrome the second timestamp is a sensible number

9960923
hash	md5
to find the md5 hash of a byte array you can use something like this

9960932
hash	md5
assuming that you re only being asked to use the hash functions and not to implement the hash yourself python s hashlib module has routines for md5 and sha1

9960939
mp3	ogg
in this example a get request to should return one http url to a mp3 ogg whatever

9960943
width	height
it may have been replaced by the source parameter in the newer feed dialog api which i don t think you can define a width height for

9960945
int	chars
to get the x and y values of the array from that input we just treat the chars in inputlocation like int and subtract either 0 or a to start in the correct index

9960967
initializer	class-method
i d like to split some of my classes into other files and have most of my database logic in those other class-method and keep application.py for the routes and initializer these other classes when needed and passing the necessary data to them for the database

9961093
google-chrome	firefox
edit one addidtion that might be important the code i m writing is part of a firefox extension so it s not really running inside a pgae but in google-chrome - i m starting to think that it may be the cause

9961094
folder	directory
let s say you want in a folder like stuff but your pull is creating a directory under repo tokens

9961098

viewdidload	viewwillappear
you assign self.user in viewwillappear which is called after viewdidload

9961366
mouse	keyboard
if you say it s because they ll both be instigating the same actions then by all means have both control classes share the same model but otherwise create separate classes -- one to handle mouse interaction and one to handle keyboard interaction and as trashgod states 1+ to him -- using key bindings not a keylistener

minimagick instead dynamically generates methods by iterating through a list of mogrify_commands that match up with numerous dash-prefixed options specified in imagemagick s mogrify documentation

9961434
imagemagick	mogrify
according to the imagemagick docs mogrify -crop takes an argument geometry

9961434
width	height
mogrify -crop can take a geometry as a string width x height + xoffset + yoffset so we just need to build a similar string

post	put
if this is too vague i can post my code to put it in context

9961964
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
you could use offsetx y and layerx y but layerx y is deprecated in webkit google-chrome and safari and firefox does not have offsetx y

9962030
folder	directory
you need to add the firephpcore folder to the same directory that this code is being run in

9962047
joptionpane	jspinner
i m trying to put a jspinner in a joptionpane as follows

9962048
getter	setter
a serializable javabean with two properties long id and string value a default constructor and a constructor filling both properties a bunch of appropriate getter setter equals and hashcode overriden

9962122
children	parent
a node has a parent children and some other things

9962135
folder	directory
but this code is not yet able to flag warnings if any particular file under a folder is opened by an editor which is another cause that makes a directory not deletable

9962212
int	double
since your extern declaration says var is a double when it s actually an int attempting to access it as a double causes undefined behavior

9962212
int	double
in reality however in a typical case a double will be eight bytes where an int is four bytes

9962212
int	double
it s also possible that probably on a big-endian machine instead of the bytes corresponding to var happening to be in the right place on the stack for printf to access them as an int that the other four bytes that would make up a double will end up in that place and it would print garbage

9962216
for-loop	arrays
the problem is that you have in the outer for-loop and then simply assign max1 to numincommon if max1 is contained within the second arrays

9962226
superclass	subclassing
i would think you should instead say that a subclassing instance can be equal to its superclass instance

9962226
superclass	subclassing
your subclassing might have added many new instance variables for example but if you set it equal to a superclass those ivars are lost or at least the superclass doesn t recognize them so it isn t truly capturing the object it would seem

9962226
superclass	subclassing
going the other way saying the makes sense since everything in the superclass is in the subclassing

9962226
superclass	subclassing
you just don t get values for the extra ivars that are in the subclassing but not in the superclass they might be set to default zero but at least they exist

9962235
width	height
you would probably want to use glortho 0.0 width 0.0 height -1.0 1.0 to setup your projection matrix

9962255
superclass	subclassing
a superclass pointer can point to an object allocated from the subclassing since the class members of the superclass are always present in the subclassing

9962255
superclass	subclassing
this isn t true the other way around since the subclassing has members that are not present in the superclass

9962299
post	get
i can get all of a user s post but i can t find any way to fetch everything a user have +1ed or commented on

9962323
hash	salt
adding a user-specific salt to the password as a hash defends against an attacker who can obtain the password hash and who knows the system

9962372
width	height
however i am calling this at the time of the creation when it can t get the actual values of the width and height

9962394
min	max
normalize the data using max and min values from both the dimensions

9962446
lattice	hmisc
for the record here s a lattice solution which uses a couple of functions from the hmisc package

9962507
multiplying	add
to decipher ciphertext you need to multiplying the ciphertext by the modular inverse of r add the offset you applied and then convert back to a character from the numeric unicode representation

9962507
multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract	subtract	add
in short you need to get the unicode for a character subtract some offset multiplying by 2 add 2 and take the mod of that number mod 26 to encipher something

9962507
multiplying	add
to reverse the process multiplying the ciphertext minus 1 by the modular inverse add the offset and convert back to a character

9962558
google-chrome	firefox
i have found in some articles saying that firefox s javascript engine partially adopt google-chrome s v8 feature ï¼œor even some sourcecode are from v8

9962604
width	height
product_info length product_info height product_info width

9962605
width	height
it seems you need to add the width height attributes to your canvas

9962605
width	height
i tried canvas id d width 300 height 300 on a fiddle and it worked

9962611
post	get
while i do a huge post request a file upload that takes more than a minute i can do other get requests at the same time

9962629
post	get
this means that thin does async receiving of your post request while serving get requests in the meanwhile

9962632
xpages	lotus
i am working in xpages on lotus notes 8.5.3

9962715
mdpi	hdpi
all i do is scale image using gimp and put them into hdpi ldpi and mdpi

9962736
mdpi	hdpi
in android we have phones of different resloution and a single app code we develop supports multi resolution in order to maintain in the image clarity we need to have images in hdpi mdpi ldpi

9962753
post	get
i m trying to send a simple post to a web service but the server doesn t seem to get the post data

9962771
union	distinct
but since you need to access the same fields in two distinct ways y- a and x- a are different i would use union

9962775
fast-forward	merge
merge your new_feature to master branch without fast-forward mode

9962795
hide	show
to hide the containing divs of those not selected and have the reset show them here s a demo

9962829
ienumerable	iqueryable
the difference between iqueryable and ienumerable is important when dealing with remote data but that s what the repository does in the first place it hides the fact you re dealing with a storage which can be remote

9962866
express	node.js
the most popular framework for node.js right now is express but express doesn t even include a way to connect to a database

9962866
django	turbogears
for comparison note the relative obscurity of python s turbogears a bunch of disconnected parts compared to django

9962866
django	turbogears
django ate turbogears lunch because it s cohesive and consistent

9962881
range	max
i guess the final formula will be some sort of combination of countifs and max on the date range columns but i can t see how i can apply this on a row-by-row basis

9962921
post	get
check this post for answer to get mime type which should be set for your content type

9962979
onclick	onchange
shiftfocus is called onchange and scategories is called onclick

9963018
jruby	mri
like the guy who started the thread i have an ubuntu os 11.04 und mri and jruby installed

9963021
rss	feed
i have records with no time attached so with the rss feed i m just getting 00 00

9963081
ubuntu	debian
its called libqt4-opengl-dev on ubuntu and debian

9963141
post	get
i made a previous post and i fixed the issue in that problem but i get something weirder now

9963161
mouseleave	mouseenter
also i puted the mouseenter mouseleave methods instead of the old ones under the .prod divs because when you get your mouse on the desc it had a strange effect

9963180
width	height
how can i constraint carmen such the width and height are pre defined the spacing between characters is rendered by the browser

9963213
letter-spacing	font-size
if the header always stays the same you can also adjust the font-size and letter-spacing attributes until it fits

9963229
children	parent
then to loop through the children in the parent div you can do

9963246
setinterval	settimeout
it only has settimeout which does not seem to be working from within my setinterval loop

9963255
post	get
it is not invoked during those phases when i perform an initial get load of the view.xhtml with id parameter only during a form submission post and subsequent redirect and get

9963257
implements	extends
you have to implements yourself this validation you can do that using model validation or you can extends the django-uploadify form and add some validation there

9963298
free	malloc
you allocate with malloc and when finished you call free on it this is important to avoid memory leaks

9963300
hash	md5
name etc hosts it would be better to accept an image id instead of a file name or a hash of the file name you can use md5 to generate the hash but remember to name the image files according to their md5 hash in this case you always lookup the image file only in the images directory

9963316
setinterval	settimeout
settimeout works perfectly inside of setinterval but since you re trying to emulate sleep which javascript does not do or have it sounds to me like you are trying to write synchronous code when settimeout works asynchronously

9963394
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome actually returns the correct values after rotation but firefox does not

9963394
width	height
so there doesn t appear to be any normal way to get the top and left positions after rotating unless there is some kind of formula that could calculate it based on the height and width and the angle

9963413
ostream	istream
that works fine but i want to use this for full duplex i o where one thread can input while another is outputting so i d like to use an istream for the receiving thread and ostream for the sending one while sharing the network streambuf as that abstracts all the socket stuff

9963413
ostream	istream
it would be better to be able to do that rather than have to separate the socket stuff from my streambuf abstraction so the socket can be shared between istream and ostream with separate streambufs--then i d also need two versions of the streambuf--one with a single internal buffer for use in either istream only or ostream only and one with two internal buffers as i have now for use in iostream.

9963527
oncreate	onstart	onresume	onpause
onpause method is called followed by the onstop and then the method oncreate of second activity is called followed by onstart and then onresume

9963527
onresume	onpause
onpause method of second activity is called followed by the onstop and then the method onrestart of first activity is called followed by onstart and then onresume

9963605
vim	emacs
why did i meet so many vim and emacs fans fanatics and hardly any fanatic of xcode visual studio code blocks eclipse dev-cpp whatever

9963605
vim	emacs
i know emacs vim are really old and what comes with that more experienced but are they better anyhow

9963605
vim	emacs
don t get me wrong i m not against using emacs vim - i m currently experimenting with one and another and i m not underestimating their power i just want to know what s wrong with these modern ides

9963617
implements	extends
public class mypaypalactivity extends activity implements onclicklistener

9963621
google-chrome	firefox
this works prefectly in firefox but not in google-chrome

9963682
navigationcontroller	pushviewcontroller
using core animation you can make navigationcontroller s pushviewcontroller like animation on writing code in thirdvc s viewwillappear method

9963721
int	chars
so since the difference in int s between and is identical to the difference in chars s between and - you get the same result for both

9963739
rss	feed
the google product feed rss 2.0 example in their docs doesn t include a doctype either

9963763
vim	emacs
on the other hand my friends who knew linux better than me preferred vim and emacs

9963763
vim	emacs
vim and emacs are designed with two principles in mind to be available in terminal environments with limited graphics and keyboard capabilities vim does not require two keys to be pressed at the same time to invoke a command for instance and to increase productivity of programmer for example keyboard shortcuts in emacs are designed to be easily accessible - save exit equals to ctrl+x s ctrl+x c

9963763
vim	emacs
you may save exit fast in emacs but you have auto-completion feature in visual studio but you can work only with keyboard in vim but.

9963790
pop-up	dialog
not working means that execute returns false without a pop-up see updated code example always the message false pop-up without being preceded by the dialog

9963791
width	height
then see which one fits your needs better and resize to img_width height or width img_height

9963801
jruby	rubinius
but using either jruby or rubinius which don t have the gil allow for true threading which in the long run allows for a lot more efficient memory usage better garbage collection and allows you to use threads where you would normally spin up new processes

9963822
hash	md5
according to this post spl_object_hash creates md5 hash of the internal pointer of the object

9963893
onresume	onpause
as the article points out for a running activity onpause onresume are always called when the power button is used to blank unblank the display so if you have something that you don t mind doing even in those cases for which the power button was not the reason for the onpause or onresume call you can do it in those methods and thereby catch every instance of the power button being used to blank or unblank the screen along with calls due to other causes without the overhead of creating a broadcastreceiver

9963893
onresume	onpause
in fact as the article shows even if you only want to respond to the power button events the proper way to do that is to set a flag in the broadcastreceiver and then test that flag in onpause and or onresume to see if the power button was the specific cause of the call to those methods

9963962
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
other browsers like safari firefox and google-chrome do it correctly

9964070
children	parent
i ve set up a parent and a child however some children don t have parent

9964070
children	parent
these stray children need a handler to put them in a new parent or model like foster parent and have a way to access the foster parent and iterate with a foreach in a separate list

9964102
gridview	onclientclick
then another activity that show the selected image in full screen will be appeared when one of image in gridview is onclientclick

9964203
getter	setter
if it is should getter setter be declared in the interface or only business methods

9964219
google-chrome	firefox
for me this snippet is working perfectly in firefox and google-chrome

9964226
children	parent
when parent checkbox is checked all children checkbox will be checked

9964226
children	parent
i am looking for a plugin that is smart and flexible to define which is parent and which are children

9964231
gridview	onclientclick
in your gridview onclientclick you are starting activity with startactivityforresults intent 0

9964232
getter	setter
several classes with the same interface might implement it in a different way so there s no need to specify variables and thus getter and setter in the interface

9964242
getter	setter
interface definately shouldn t contain getter and setter

9964242
getter	setter
interface provides only functionality that your class can perform if you need getter setter - use abstract classes

9964278
jobs	cron
it could be handy but somehow over killed for normal cron jobs

9964286
submit	submission
add a input with type submit element which is hidden to support submission by the enter key

9964327
put	get
it s not invoked during those phases when i perform an initial get load because when you perform a get the component tree isn t traversed in those phases only the metadata is processed which is the reason view params are put in a special metadata section

9964327
post	get
in order to make the id that you received from the get request available in the action method after the post back you d best use the view scope viewscoped for your backing bean

9964501
width	height
i need to do calculation like a x y sum from z 0 till z n b x y z +c x y z where matrix a has dimensions height width and matrix b c has dimensions height width n

9964512
hide	show
edit however if you often show and hide the form and you can easily change the code to make it use the same formular then go for it because sometimes memory leaks are difficult to recognize especially in case of events etc

9964521

maven	m2e
disclaimer i like maven and m2e and i have not experienced any of the issues that you mention

9964656

if only one of the four possible answers for each question is correct it seems more logical to make single choice questions radio button rather than multiple choice checkbox groups

9964732
try-catch	exception-handling
this is a standard exception-handling caused by response.redirect caught only if you have an explicit try-catch over a block which does the redirect

9964735
getc	gets
works on any os unlike the sollution from detect key press non-blocking w o getc gets in ruby

9964750
width	height
in one variable i would like to store its width and in other variable its height

9964750

9965098
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
bebin overriding usually comes with inherited when the superclass implements a method but the subclassing needs to implements that method in other way like

9965098
superclass	subclassing
saying that a constructor can be overridden would imply that a superclass constructor would be visible and could be called to create an instance of a subclassing

9965128
put	get
as well you should put the get bitmap in the thread as you have putting the parse json in the thread

9965137
children	parent
id and there may be any number of children for the parent

9965137
children	parent
i am trying to run a query to find the n parent rows with the most recently-uploaded children

9965137
children	parent
i am willing to fudge this definition a bit in order to make it fast consider only parent which have one child perhaps or find the parent of the n -most-recent children

9965137
children	parent
ideally there will be exactly n results in the first version if one parent has n children which are globally most-recent there will be only one result so the second one is better in that sense but i will accept other compromises

9965187
stdout	stderr
only stderr is unbuffered not stdout

9965225

std	ostream
the output you re seeing from using cout on an unsigned char is down to the mechanics of the operator when used with a std ostream specifically different overloads of the operator will display the value in different ways - the char unsigned char overloads usually assume that you want a character representation instead of a numeric one

9967050
int	chars
the underlying representation of your unsigned chars is still the same number which you pushed into the vector - an unsigned chars is still an unsigned 1-byte int

9967087

i imagine most implementations of settimeout and setinterval are set to wait at least the amount of time you specify

however in javascript rather than with sleep or wait primitives this is accomplished in an event-directed manner with setinterval or settimeout

9970396

free	malloc
what is the use of malloc and free when we have new and delete in c++

9972225

in c++ it is rarely useful that one would use malloc free instead of new delete

9972268
free	malloc
if you do not want to get your memory initialized by implicit constructor calls and just need an assured memory allocation for placement new then it is perfectly fine to use malloc and free instead of new and delete

9972268
memset	malloc
new guarantees callng of constructors of your class for initializing the class members while malloc does not one would have to do an additional memset or related function calls post an malloc to initialize the allocated memory to do something meaningful

9985171
prepare	execute
prepare statements allow the database to pre-compile and optimize the statement one time then execute it multiple times with changing parameter values

9985171
prepare	execute
i am not certain about mysql but some databases also let you specify a number of rows to cache before a prepare statement actually execute across the network - if this is possible with mysql doing so will allow you to tell the database that although you are calling execute on the statement for every row read from the csv that the database should batch up the statements up to the specified number of rows and only then execute across the network

9985172
gif	png
instead of using a gif i would suggest using an animated png

hide	show
you can have a single function say onanchorclick which you can call on anchor click and passing the elements to show hide as an array then execute your logic inside this function

i think the trick is making sure to delete the invisible .git folder in the project directory via the command line .

i found it is much easier just to wrap whatever value you would like to put in xml json and it will automatically get deserialized

9985580

not using bundler to start your app lets rubygems satisfy the requirements of your app according to it s own method and that is a fairly random - i would be quite surprised if your app is currently running all the same gem versions that you ran your tests on for instance eek

9990429

wordpress	ipb
the ipb has the index.php file because of having indexed url s and the new wordpress s index.php file has been renamed to blog.php

9990553
google-chrome	firefox
if you add width 100 to the mix it seems to behave the same as in google-chrome and firefox

9990553
box-sizing	border-box
however this can be avoided with box-sizing border-box

9990556
pull	push
add your tasks to a pull queue instead of a push queue

9990556
queue	fifo
in this way you can simulate fifo behavior for your task queue

9990594
decoder	encoder
what about using more than one encoder to encode my code because if we take a look at ioncube you will see some people can decoder it

9990600
width	height
you need to do this for rest of the ids too set height n width properly

9990659
jobs	cron
so i have these two cron jobs but as you can see from screens they fail but i don t see any exception in the logs

9990696
background-repeat	background-position
if you want to use that then you need to also use background-position and background-repeat

9990725
post	get
if you need any pointers on how to get started or get stuck post a question on the rabbitmq-discuss mailing list

9990764
disk	ram
if you have 20gb of data and 4gb of ram then most of your data is not in memory which means that your disk are doing a lot of work

9990801
for-loop	loops
it looks like in the first example you are passing in 2 data objects and a string however in loops you are passing in 3 strings and no data object i believe in javascript you would need to use eval or something similar if you wanted to pass a data object called data n for each iteration of the for-loop

9990872
folder	directory
i have few jar files which i am not getting from any repositories.i have these jar files in web-inf lib folder for src directory

9990901
handlebars.js	icanhaz.js
i have recently been studying different options icanhaz.js + mustache.js jquery templating handlebars.js + mustache.js to generate the content from the client side

9990914
next	except
i am processing one binary file in which i want to retrieve first 4 bytes next 4 bytes again 4 bytes and then rest of the file contents except last 8 bytes of last line

9990938
behat	mink
i ve just started using behat + mink with symfony session by default for testing my app

9991007
nexus	artifactory
ideally you have a shared repository installed on your local machine or on a remote server nexus artifactory archiva and you deploy your jars to that repository

9991013
richtextbox	tabcontrol
i m creating the tabcontrol its tabpages and richtextbox at run-time

9991013
richtextbox	tabcontrol
the tabcontrol creates with a tabpage with a richtextbox added

9991041
put	get
in the bean dostuff method get the parametes by the name fragment couse before the input name jsf put some other identifiers and the resulting parameter name may look like this someformid j_idt54 somehtmlinputid

9991060
libs	buildpath
this way eclipse will automatically take all its libs in the project s buildpath

9991075
hash	md5
for example a md5 hash over both xml-examples above would result in complete different result-hashes although both examples provide the same valid data in xml-form they are semantically identical

9991078
google-chrome	firefox
i m trying to implement the w3c geolocation api even though i give the browser permission regarding my location i get error 2 position unavailable while using it from firefox and i get error 1 permission denied while trying it from google-chrome

9991103
nsurl	nsdata
myimages.image uiimage imagewithdata nsdata datawithcontentsofurl nsurl

9991105
folder	dir
rtmp dir port folder

9991138
getter	setter
for properties with both you re almost always going to use the setter before the getter so it s in a valid state

9991138
getter	setter
also the setter would typically have some validation logic which the getter doesn t need

9991138
getter	setter
i know there are no rules with these things but practically every example ever ever of properties defines the getter before the setter

9991140
strlen	strcpy
the example above is not going to work as expected it is not going to iterate over all the characters within a because strings in c are null terminated and this is how various functions strlen strcpy and others know that they have reached the end of a stream of chars

9991141
post	get
this will make the link a get request not a post request that might be the issue try using a simple link and replace post will get in your routes.rb just to test if the issue is arising due to this

9991179
opera	firefox
this works fine in webkit mobile and desktop and firefox yet when i try to open the page in opera 11.6 or the internet explorer 7 to 9 hell breaks loose

9991190
disk	ram
the size of the buffer should thereby be set taking into account available ram performance and disk speed

9991229
width	height
the get_serving_url currently does not support resizing image width height independently instead only allowing square resizes using the size param

9991231
hex	binary
it may be simple ascii text or binary hex codes

9991303
range	max
use a zset to index the max value of your range

9991303
range	max
retrieve the unique range whose max value is greater than an ip

9991303
range	min
check the the min value of this range is lower than the ip

9991303
range	max
score is the max value member is the id of the range

9991303
range	minimum
then the client program just has to check that your ip is greater or equal than the minimum address of the returned range

9991312
getter	setter
the order of the getter and setter are totally irrevelant i think the reason for the convention is visual studio s property snippet which generated the properties in this way getter before setter

9991316
width	height
a flexible switch couldn t resize width or height as it is system drawn for its size

9991336
post	put
i dont post the code because its alot...dont want to put two chunks of code here but essentially the php reads rows from a db section and post the latest 10 post from the db via echo

9991347
hide	show
before the loop i show the loader div when loop ends i hide the loader loop

9991347
google-chrome	firefox
this works only in firefox and not in ie and google-chrome

9991347
google-chrome	firefox
both approaches work in firefox but not one of them works in ie and google-chrome

9991347
google-chrome	firefox
no errors in console firefox or google-chrome

9991351
sudo	nohup
in my situation i can run it like sudo nohup python download.py

9991368
screens	tablet
however on hc3.2 tablet where no menu hardware key is present i expected a soft-menu key on the bottom of the screens but it didn t appear so i can t open my menu

9991436
folder	directory
i have the following syntax to change the directory access permission of the logo folder in the web application

9991444
put	get
all you have to do is to load qunit.js and qunit.css files then put this snippet to your page to get visual feedback about the testing process

9991450
onclicklistener	ontouch
if i return true in ontouch onfling is called but then the onclick in the onclicklistener of the parent view layout_base is not called

9991450
onclicklistener	ontouch
if i return false in ontouch onfling is not called but then the onclick in the onclicklistener of the parent view layout_base is called

9991469
getter	setter
i d like to use getter and setter methods i wrote in my nation class with arraylist but it doesn t work

9991498
ready	each
you do not call populate on an itemizedoverlay until all of the items are ready not for each item

9991535
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
it seems to work fine in ie8 ie9 firefox and opera but it fails on google-chrome the image spans over the boundaries of the cell

9991554
width	height
when this event is launched you are able to get the width and height of your pictures so you can set your canvas to the same size

9991573
put	get
its just a string...when someone pushes the button it should get the server time and put it in the text field.

9991581
width	height
but i want the table to have a default minimum height width should be managed by the gridlayout of the composite

9991581
width	height
there is nothing else added to the composite and the composite seems to grab all the empty space from its parent but the table does not expand to a height of 300 width is correct

9991609
width	height
most of them just vary the width of the image but doesn t shrink the height of one side and increase the height of one side to produce the effect that you are viewing the image from another angle

9991612
width	height
try using table-layout fixed on the table element and defined width height on the td

9991649
uiview	subviews
i could turn off the scrollindicators or ideally i d like to place this uiview underneath the scrollindicators but not get scrolled with other content which is what would happen if i made it a subviews of the scrollview via scrollview addsubview mymaskview

9991679
width	height
which means you will need to define what will be your width height or both will be and it will hide anything which des not fit there

9991756
google-chrome	firefox
in ie9 firefox and google-chrome

9991818
getter	setter
just don t do business job in getter setter

9991818
getter	setter
the getter setter should solely do the things as their name suggests returning a property or setting a property

9991822
children	parent
both parent and children and children of children

9991827
hide	show
certain links on the iframed page load content via ajax and then show hide it using the slidetoggle jquery animation function

9991870
implements	extends
depending on whether you extends servlet or implements a servletcontextlistener i would recommend to create an instance variable for the context and then store it from one of these methods

9991901
for-loop	arrays
but as counters is an arrays you have to use a normal for-loop

9991942
implements	extends
by extends the application class and implements it as a singleton you get an object that will exist whenever any of your application components exist providing a centralized place to store and transfer complex object data between application components

9991948
viewdidload	viewwillappear
for example in the viewwillappear method and the viewdidload method and both give me the accurate indexpath and i even checked the array outputs and all of them return accurate results so i really don t know why it s giving me the error

9991988
width	height
the method changewidth height will set the width and the height of the layer and not the content of the layer

9992031
int	double
the argument you passed is int which is not instance of double so it returns false

9992044
int	double
as for the double comparison as explained by other answers you are comparing a double with an int in new double 0.0 .equals 0 which returns false because the objects have different types

9992051
int	double
the 0 in your first expression is interpreted as an int which may be autoboxed into an int but not to a double

9992052
hide	show
how i can show it in code and don t destroy possibility of click it to show hide how it always works

9992054
multiplying	add
if i m correct from studying the generated assembly code the ideal schedule would look like follows where the mov instruction takes 3 cycles the switch latency from the load domain to the fp domain for the dependent instructions takes 2 cycles the fp multiplying takes 4 cycles and the fp add takes 3 cycles

9992054
multiplying	add
note that the dependence from the multiplying - add doesn t incur any switch latency because the operations belong to the same domain

9992059
slideup	slidedown
i have a little question regarding to slideup and slidedown the problem is in slideup actually once i click the link the content is sliding down and thats ok but when im trying to close this slide it slidesup and slidedown automatically i mean it can t be closed once it is opened anyway hope everything will be clear after i show u the code

9992083
google-chrome	firefox
in ie firefox google-chrome everything works fine and the page is printed

9992127
slideup	slidedown
you have a slidedown after your slideup

9992193
int	double
this line compares a double value of 0 which is not exact zero with int of 0

9992203
imagemagick	mogrify
a simple solution would be copy followed by mogrify - another imagemagick tool - this will keep the same names it takes all the same args as convert

9992234
google-chrome	firefox
the present implementation works fine for firefox and google-chrome

9992277
google-chrome	firefox
i installed the user script in both firefox and google-chrome the issue is the number of scripts for the same site is different in both browsers

9992277
google-chrome	firefox
i am getting the number of scripts in firefox as 17 and in google-chrome as 15

9992332
post	get
try http post instead of get or set the ifmodified and cache options to false as below

9992336
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
however i attempted to uninstall rmagick and imagemagick so that i could have a version that works with graphicsmagick

9992394
put	get
that is the most general methods at the bottom of the program and the more specialized you get the higher up in the hierarchy you should put it

9992409
post	put
ok but i m not sure how to create an archive for my custom post especially as i m not using pretty urls because it wouldn t work with my custom post so had to put it back to the default

9992425
width	height
if you don t set a width and height of the jcrop object and fancybox you need to run .fancybox.resize as a callback after you ve loaded the jcrop object

9992425
width	height
since you re loading the images dynamically the fancybox will open with a width and height of 0 otherwise

9992435
memcached	apc
on the other hand if you want to cache for a longer time multiple requests etc you should use something like memcached or apc

9992451
int	chars
secondly chars to int conversion just requires an explicit type

9992466
pop-up	dialog
when using fb.ui https hosted iframe pages give a proper modal dialog but the same page via http gives a pop-up

9992466
pop-up	dialog
so when i go to the page via i get a proper modal dialog but gives a horrid pop-up

9992470
google-chrome	firefox
that you are getting different counts in firefox and google-chrome may happen because you are not viewing the same page

9992505
post	get
usually you can get to the acrhive of a custom post type via exapmle.com customposttype

9992508
scatter	graphing
as you can see below there is two graphing the right side is the boxplot of all macrocosmes with the mean values and the left side is the boxplot with scatter plot of all mean the macrocosmes

9992515
memcached	apc
you can use file cache or memcached apc

9992515
memcached	apc
zend has good cache lib called zend_cache it supports many backends like file memcached apc

9992580
post	get
the html specifications technically define the difference between get and post so that former means that form data is to be encoded by a browser into a url while the latter means that the form data is to appear within a message body

9992580
post	get
might even work imo with post since the url should still be transmitted to the server but the server would need to detect that the post request is actually a get request and behave accordingly

9992704
onchange	onsubmit
you don t really need ajax just a javascript variable that gets incremented on any onchange event you place on each html input dropdown etc... then onsubmit pass that javascript variable

9992721
client-side	server-side
finally by understanding that the custom decimalmodelbinder would only handle server-side validation and not affect the jquery.validate.js which handles the client-side validation i found a solution to the problem

9992754
post	put	post	get	put	get
get requests work fine but not post or put

9992761
margin	height	width	height	width	margin
you can set the height width and the margin by below code

9992774
vmware	virtualbox
if that doesn t work out consider to install the client server stuff in virtual machines virtualbox vmware virtualpc and use virsh to start stop them from your tests

9992834
post	get
the sends a post request but you apparently want to send a get request

9992843
mouseleave	mouseenter
note that hover isn t an actual event the function is just a shorthand for binding to two different events mouseenter and mouseleave

9992845
post	get
if you post up your html there is most likely a better way to traverse the dom to get to the checkbox

9992910
post	get
you are using a post instead of a get

9992910
post	get
the post call above will give you and error where as the get method will not

9992959
for-loop	loops
add a new for-loop inside the outer loops of sorting to print the values after each pass

9992984
inherited	properties
i know of at least one control vendor componentone who has a control that inherited from textbox and provides a watermark properties

9993019
hide	show
the clusterer show and hide the individual markers by calling setmap so it is likely overriding your call to setmap null

9993029
width	height
set the geometry call qlabel setgeometry x y width height

9993032
folder	directory
ssh to that node and identify the location of the hadoop.log.dir directory check the mapred-site.xml for this node - my guess is the hadoop user does not have the correct permissions to create sub-directories in this folder

9993049
inherited	subclassing
and finally i can access just the things i need from all the classes that inherited class b the ones that would be concrete decorators in a controlled manner as opposed to through the access function without the need to make all the subclassing of b friend s of class a

9993107
bde	dbase
i have got a ttable component that uses the bde to access a dbase table

9993107
bde	dbase
i was under the impression that with this constellation bde + dbase it is also possible to set the recno property to move to the corresponding record

9993170
width	height
iframe id xxxx width 70px height 70px scrolling no src content.html

9993177
accessor	properties
you have to defien a properties such as ipaddress and its accessor method

9993178
haskell	ocaml
this would be a task for a maybe x in haskell or an x option in ocaml

9993237
superclass	subclassing
the only solution which i have found is to declare the interface in both superclass and subclassing

9993350
put	get
in other words you will not get a count of zero for gerry chandan if you put the date condition in the where clause

9993382
paradox	dbase
tbdedataset implements recno setter only for paradox not dbase

9993386
for-loop	arrays
if you are saying that the arrays is empty because the for-loop was not entered it is probably because your integer i is not initialized

9993386
for-loop	arrays
therefor it contains some garbage value which was likely higher than the value of self.arrayquattro.count making it appear that the arrays was empty hopped over the for-loop

9993414
implements	modifiers
pass only a read-only interface of subject to observers - this is the easiest to implements with no side effects however an evil observer may still attempt to downcast subject to access its modifiers methods and or to access the full subject via some other object s

9993441
firefox	safari
the jquery file change event is not working in ie yet works perfectly in safari firefox etc

9993445
switching	screens
this will generate a prompt for permission when you switching to full screens mode similar to isolatedstorage quota prompts

9993445
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
for the app showing in background i only have experienced this using safari on macos i never had this issue on windows ie firefox or google-chrome

9993452

9993516
accelerometer	gyroscope
in addition ipad also has gyroscope and accelerometer chips

9993528
mvp	presenter
obviously i m sure there are a lot of others possibilities like the mvp pattern model view presenter - and here are answers talking about mvp in android but you should still take a look on it

9993539
width	height
note the text gets clipped to the given width though just that it doesnt seem to clip to given height

9993552
disk	ram
with even more variables or if you want to manipulate the values a lot or if you don t have huge tables or disk space ram is not an issue or if you are not sure what to pick i would consider bit n or bit varying n short varbit n

9993552
int	boolean
for just 3 bits of information individual boolean columns get by with 3 bytes an int needs 4 bytes maybe additional alignment padding and a bit string 6 bytes 5 + 1

9993552
int	boolean
for 32 bits of information an int still needs 4 bytes + padding a bit string occupies 9 bytes for the same 5 + 4 and boolean columns occupy 32 bytes

9993552
int	boolean
this answer on how to transform the types boolean bit n and int may be of help too

9993597
hide	show
it s api won t allow you to hide and show leaves easily

9993610
hide	show
switch between tab would mean show and hide different preloaded div s

9993627
hide	show
use javascript to show and hide your message

9993689
inherited	properties
every other model inherited from that basemodel and each has specific properties relative to the view it represents

9993714

folder	directory
it s not a major problem but i ve gotten used to just shift+clicking in a directory and opening a terminal there whereas i now have to run an elevated cmd prompt type the administrator account name and password and navigate to the right folder in order to run the script properly

9993808
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
whenever you need the index of loops you can use the for-loop instead assuming it s an arrays

9993823
src	attr
use attr src to get the src attribute

9993844
.htaccess	httpd.conf
it works fine in my httpd.conf file but not if i move to .htaccess

9993891
width	height
what you need to do is calculating the proportions of the original image to resize it to your desired width and height after that you should have the calculated size value to pass to the serving url and get what you want

9993924
decoder	encoder
it is design to work with a concept of encoder and decoder that could fit your need there are a lot of default implementation of encoder and decoder for zipping using ssl.

9993924
decoder	encoder
than it should be quite easy to write both the encoder and the decoder in each language

9993938
3des	aes
note that people often suggest that using older algorithms gets better performance not a very good tradeoff imho but that s generally not the case you ll need to test it against the library you use and aes ends up way faster at least from 3des

9994007
rss	feed
as mentioned by roni it is possible to use the notifications rss feed of your page to retrieve an rss 2.0 xml feed of all notifications sorted by time

9994279
sorting	filtering
i want to query this post type using raw sql because i have to do some sorting and filtering based upon user request

9994302
implements	extends
even if type was a system type you could just create a class that implements it and extends it

9994342
jar	war
this entity class is wrapped inside a jar file that is used as a dependency in a web application war file

9994369
gif	png
i am basically trying to convert a gif image to a png image using the imagetools library in wp7

9994427
for-loop	arrays
you will need to create for-loop that goes through the length - 1 of your arrays and calls push_back to put each item in the vector

9994491
int	chars
as part of an assignment i need to read data from a binary file which consists of int chars datatypes of data

9994491

it displays properly inside a normal div but i want to show it only by clicking on a button and that s the problem i used jquery to show and hide the div but when it show almost the entire map is gray

9994529
mvp	presenter
one of the main reasons to use the mvp pattern is to isolate your logic in the presenter so it can be unit tested

getter	setter
when creating a vanilla python class if one wants to execute code on assignment to an attribute the usual pattern to to create a protected leading-underscore attribute to hold the data and use property to create getter and setter

9997665
getter	setter
the only other approach i can see would be to use a custom field that can register additional getter setter handlers

9997667
for-loop	arrays
now based on the error you posted ios is expecting a single object in the arrays so the for-loop may be unnecessary

9997770

i make this in my wpf application dividing work in two parts first thing i create shapes by setting the properties of each of them like margin fill width etc... after i add shapes as canvas s children

9997950
getter	setter
of course this would require you to duplicate your actual django.db.models.fields fields with getter and setter

9997965
.htaccess	httpd.conf
also note upload_max_filesize and post_max_size are of type php_ini_perdir which means entry can be set in php.ini .htaccess or httpd.conf

9998322
post	get
use get_the_content to get the contents of the post

9998332
width	margin
basically you use left 50 then back it out half of it s width with a negative margin

9998385
3des	aes
i ll add a few one related to the backwards compatability if you have a hardware implementation that only does 3des many older smartcards then 3des could be preferred over aes

9998385
3des	aes
3des has a 8 byte blocksize compared with 16 bytes for aes which can lead to a bit more overhead when using it in block mode encryption

9998385
3des	aes
none of the three reasons above is generally enough to choose 3des or blowfish over aes of course

9998429
width	height
i have a video tag with width and height set to a dimension that does not fit the video s aspect ratio

9998429
width	height

portrait	landscape
the device orientation portrait or landscape

9998740
width	height
it s because the within the the submenu ul.dropdown ul has style visibility hidden if you removed that rule and add display none - you won t see the scroll bars because visibility hidden preserves the width and height of the element and hides the element while display none is like removing the element from dom

9998743
folder	directory
you ll either need to temporarily move var session out of your project directory and then restore it after the cleanup or just blow the var session folder away assuming this is a development staging server and your session information isn t critical

you can then hide and show correct page by switching between tabs or programatically removing and adding appropriate tab to the control

a basic approach would be to use data binding for the label value and settimeout or setinterval to cause the delay between updates

9998876
prepare	execute
and then use the result of this first query to execute your prepare statement

9998899

only generate nunit tests not mstest

10012827
min	max
you can combine them and then call min or max

10012837
width	height
in the attributes you need to tell the runtime that you re expecting the width and height as an url parameter

10012837
width	height
at the moment the runtime assumes that you re calling the url without parameters but the method being called expects parameters so the runtime really doesn t know how to find the values to pass to your method for width and height

in order to do that you have to take the dimensions of your camera 1024x768 in our example and check to see if the sprite s position is inside the rectangle of the camera s view - which is the position of the camera s upper-left corner plus the camera s width and height

10013128

i think your properties are causing a stackoverflowexception because the getter and setter invoke themselves in an endless loop dtype - dtype - dtype ...

10013303
getter	setter
you have a property referring to itself and thus calling its own getter and setter inside respectively the getter and setter

10013316

i need to use a multibinding to get the stringformat property used in the converter

10013658

the width and the height are set to pct values because the application has several sizes that can be chosen by the user so the correct size is set on the embed s width attribute

i have double checked that the width height set in xaml are correct and same as the fw mockup so no idea what s wrong with it

10013707

10013918
hash	salt
the inbuilt classes i m using for this purpose are rngcryptoserviceprovider - to generate the random salt and rfc2898derivebytes - to hash the actual password

10013918
pbkdf2	salt
the reason i want to make it work with ascii encoding is because the same db in which this hashvalue is stored will also be used by a php application the hashvalue produced by pbkdf2 implementaion of php matches the hashvalue of rfc2898derivebytes only if the salt encoding is ascii

10013966
width	height
you could also give it a very large pixel value rather than 100 for the height and width if you don t want to use position fixed

10014030

10014133
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
i m afraid you must at minimum rebuild all your python and perl installation making this upgrade an ideal time to clean out packages that depend upon older versioning ala python26 and perl5.8

10014145

iboutlet	ibaction
i know that they are in fact connected to both their iboutlet and ibaction as i ve tried some nslog-ing to make sure of that

10015038
width	height
what happens is that when amcharts creates the svg it needs to or at least decides to define the width and height in absolute terms

10015038
width	height
this forces a recalculation of the width and height based on the div s new current dimensions

10015063

10015265

10015308
actualheight	actualwidth
according to that post you cannot bind to readonly properties which actualwidth and actualheight are

10015345
post	get
second perhaps your plugin works on pre-creation and pre-creation means that the record does not exist yet in the database but if you changed the plugin to post then you can get the guid of the newly created record

10015366
actualheight	actualwidth
if you absolutely want to go the actualwidth actualheight route in silverlight you d have to do something like.

10015447

10015481
for-loop	arrays
it is also very fast to use instead of arrays and do a simple for-loop

10015537
int	chars
once that is done you can go in and tweak the data types to better fit your needs if desired and you can add your own restrictions to the data such as requiring that an xs int value be in a range of 0 and 50 or an xs string value be less than 10 chars long - there are dozens of other possibilities but that should give you the idea

10015540
pull	push
i haven t tested this there is a chance that it might let you only pull and push from and to the same repository

on mid-sized screens anything with a smallest width of 600dp and up the landscape orientation accomodates the two-pane layout pretty well but on portrait orientation it should use the one-pane layout

versioning	upgrade
at that point you may want to promote your branch to the new master if you think its likely that the versioning of rails on the server won t upgrade soon or ever

10020107
children	parent
but if the parent has two children they can t both have the same id

10020107
children	parent
you will lose the feature that parent and children have the same id but gain massive simplicity in your object id scheme making database operations faster and the code simpler to read

10020130

this will give you one event handler on the parent instead of 4000 event handlers on the children

min	max	range	min	range	max
the min and max for the range are the expected values from your input but if we turn the range into an array the last element is u1036 and it s successor is u1000

10020792
min	max
under the covers range# must be enumerating the string#succ sequence rather than simple bound checking on min and max

10020792
int	chars
btw as a work around you could use a range of int ordinals and test against ordinals if you only care about single chars

i understand how to with int and cant find any reference online on how to deal with just chars specifically im trying to port.

at this point you can push your changes to it or have it pull from somewhere else which is probably the better route which will give it access to the history you ve built

the expected behavior the behavior seen in google-chrome firefox and safari is that the login window should close and the app should receive the login success callback

10021455
put	get
now normally as a software engineer you would not intentionally put yourself in a situation where you needed to get at 10 bytes at address 5 you would probably do 12 bytes at 0x4 or 16 at 0x0 or something along those lines even if you only use 10 of them you would align them more logically

10021483

to put it simply i need to get only rectangle that bordered with a solid color and cutt of alpha chanel

the element at the front is always the min or it could be max

maybe you could try to post back to the page where the changes are expected to be found with a nonsensical query string to force browser to get the new page

you re already calling setcontentview r.layout.splash in oncreate so you don t need to call it again in onresume

next	except
i suspect that the web view is being made visible it doesn t have anything to display yet so renders a blank white screen then does the download of the html whatever from the external website still displaying a blank screen until it has everything downloaded and is ready to render something onto the screen except your next activity is invoked via the onpagefinished web view client method

there s very little that it offers in benefits over direct2d and directwrite which are both what microsoft is pushing as the replacements for gdi gdi+

10021965
directwrite	direct2d
there might be some benefit to using opengl if you absolutely must target windows xp because as far as i can tell direct2d directwrite are only supported on vista and later but that s because as i mentioned originally windows xp falls squarely into the legacy or obsolete camp itself

10021965
directwrite	direct2d
alternatively if you already know opengl well and don t have time or the desire to learn direct2d directwrite then it might make sense to continue using it in a new application

10021965
directwrite	direct2d
edit hmm it looks like directwrite has also been declared by some people at least obsolete as well having been replaced by direct2d

10021965

everything i ve seen written in directdraw or direct2d has had serious rendering bugs and is a performance nightmare even on reasonably competent machines

if you ve got the gesture on a view and you want to see for example if the user released their finger while over a particular subview you can get the cgpoint for the release via the locationinview as vignesh pointed out you can then also get the cgrect for a particular subview s frame and then check to see if the cgpoint is inside the cgrect via cgrectcontainspoint

such a document then goes through schematron validation which is basically an xslt transformation

there are also garbage collection libraries such as the boehm garbage collector which are usable in c by calling the provided malloc free replacements even though free is then a dummy function call kept for compatibility

there are also many possible uses for example one may write a debug malloc free function that could trace memory allocations and liberations in the library such as one that i wrote that uses sqlite to record statistics about how the memory is used admittedly at the cost of performance but it is a debugging situation

while this is easy enough to implement for future passwords i d like to also retrofit the existing md5 hash passwords preferably without forcing all the users to change their passwords

10028308
salt	md5	hash	salt	hash	md5
my idea is to just use sha-512 and and an appropriate salt to hash the existing md5 hash

10028308
hash	md5
i can either then set some flag in the database that indicates which passwords were hash from plain text and which ones were hash from an md5 hash

10028308
salt	md5	hash	salt	hash	md5
or even just hash new passwords with md5 and then sha-512 salt so they can be treated the same as old passwords

10028308
salt	md5	hash	salt	hash	md5
programmatically i don t think this will be a problem but i don t know enough about encryption hashing to know if i m compromising the quality of the hash in any way by applying a sha-512 salt hash to a password that was already md5 hash

you have the benefit that if someone obtains the sha512 hash and doesn t know the salt this you have to enforce somehow can t look up the hash and get the passwords -- something that would be possible with the md5 database you have now

10028512
hash	md5
but as explained in the first paragraph it would be a bad idea to apply md5 to all new passwords as well and then hash them as sh512

10028512
hash	salt
a easy implementation would be to have a boolean salt field in the database next to the hash but don t put the salt there

10028547
hide	show
put both fields in the same column and use the rendered attribute to dynamically show hide the field using an if-statement

10028569
hash	md5
should never compare two hash as a possible answer because what if md5 abc 123 sha no 123 that means someone could have typed in the wrong password but still gets in

maven	pom.xml
also if you know the name of the bundle such as log4j you can almost always do a quick google search bundle name maven pom.xml within the first few hits you should either get the maven repo containing a quick snippet on how to include it or the actual website for the bundled up jar and the maven instructions

10037178
inherited	properties
i need inherited events and properties

10037183
qstring	qlist

folder	directory
i have an apache webserver that will host a development testing site that contains a foundation directory tree- a set of folder and files

10037458
folder	directory
i ve been trying to hypothesize a solution for this problem and i ve come up with two either with a linux filesystem and somehow linking directory with this proposed behavior or possibly through the apache webserver somehow telling apache to search for a file in a different folder if it doesn t exist- perhaps in the httpd.conf file somewhere or a custom module

10037466

10037504
typedef	struct
typedef struct is creating a new type

10037504
typedef	struct
the typedef is defining struct_int and p_s which are synonymous to struct my_struct and respectively

10037504
typedef	struct
because you would have to use my_struct as struct my_struct but you ve typedef d struct_int to refer to that type and it s simpler

10037504
typedef	struct
you can use struct my_struct or struct_int struct_int is shorter and it d defeat the purpose of typedef ing struct_int

10037508
lapack	gsl
if you need more advanced solvers you should take a look at gsl or consider the c version of lapack

getter	setter
you need to remove the index parameters from the getter setter methods since the properties does not use indexes by using non-array properties you can declare them as __published

10038449
getter	setter
if you want to use separate properties for the individual array values i would suggest going back to using indexes with a single set of getter setter methods by using the index specifier on the property declarations i would even go as far as declaring a public array property again for good measure in case you ever need to loop through the values in code

10038486
rss	feed
in addition i ve encountered the access-control-allow-origin error above when trying to fetch an rss feed from a remote server

10038486

xdomainrequest is too basic when compared with the xmlhttprequest object that s implemented in all other major browsers

10038979
xmlhttprequest	xdomainrequest
xdomainrequest offers only a subset of xmlhttprequest s features

10038979

10039235
int	chars
at a guess your chars is 8 bits and int is at least 16

10039235
int	chars
that means all values of unsigned chars can be represented as signed int s

10039235
int	chars
that in turn means in your expression your unsigned chars will be promoted to int then the or operation carried out then the result of that cast back to unsigned chars

10039254
fadein	fadeout
so either do a display none or fadeout before fadein again

10039264
fadein	fadeout
if you insist on having fadein fadeout use transitions

10039279

10039868
ubuntu	debian
if you re on debian or ubuntu

10039869

10040031
getter	setter
previously we were asked not bother commenting on getter and setter as long as it is obvious what it does

10040033
getter	setter
actually i deliberately don t javadoc getter and setter because you aren t adding any value by doing so - they are what they are.

10040040
getter	setter
this means the getter and setter are redundant

10040040
getter	setter
i would strongly recommend to make your auto_key field private and keep the getter and setter

10040040
getter	setter
then adjust the name of the getter and setter to match java conventions autokey setautokey getautokey

10040040
getter	setter
and consider firing propertychangeevent s when the autokey is changed as a getter setter combination typically suggests - see javabeans

implements	extends
3 we can extends max of one abstract class but can implements more than one interface

10040071

implements	extends
the shortest answer is extends abstract class when some of the functionalities uou seek are already implements in it

10040148
getter	setter
while documentation for setter getter methods may seem like code bloat i would still suggest creating it for a couple of reasons

10040148
getter	setter
it gives you a standard location to mention important information such as setter arguments that should not be null or getter that are woefully inefficient in a particular implementation of an interface

codeblocks	codelite	qt-creator	codelite
for me benefit looks huge in terms of code simplicity and performance however stability availability on some platform such as android debugging migrating from visual studio to gdb as we have many visualization tools developed for visual studio debugger and code editor not so much as for heavily templates code i do not find much uses of auto completion refactoring etc and codelite codeblocks qt-creator works well with our build system are some of the issues

width	height
then you do some simple logic to check whether or not it is located within the viewport hint - use the page offset and width height properties of the window object

10041630
width	height
you could do some hacks if you know where exactly your element will appear and its height width is really of no consequence here but that s a brute force approach

10041691
profiling	benchmarking
use the profiling and benchmarking class to profiling your code

getter	setter
i think getter setter aren t really necessary most of the time so they would only be used when they actually trigger something

10042767
getter	setter
the classes would provide a list of variable names and either a pointer to the variable either a pointer to getter setter

10042774
ostringstream	std
the same approach works for serialization except you use std ostringstream

10042803
public	protected
and declaration class variable as var is deprecated - use public protected or private

10042804

it is more elegant to define it anyway and when working with extends it s recommended because you can get weird situations if your extends are gonna use the same varnames and also don t define it private protected or public

hide	show
if so then open group properties for last14days_ct go to visibility and for when the report is initially run select show or hide based on an expression. use the expression

10045146
hide	show
register the view user control that you want to show hide with the windowregionadapter so that when the view is requested it opens up in a new window

10045146
hide	show
create compositepresentationevents for show hide close of the view and put them in some common infrastructure assembly

10045146
hide	show
in the event handlers you can use the prism region manager to add remove the view from the region which will in turn show hide close the window

10045146
hide	show
then whenever you want to show hide the view you can simply publish the appropriate show hide events wherever in whichever module viewmodel you want and the appropriate event handler will be called in the module subscribing to the event and the window will be show hidden

10045483
hex	binary
pretty random distribution of values leading with hex 0 s will likely be binary numeric comp fields

10045483
hex	binary
some programs use spaces on numeric fields so if a field contains all sorts of binary and also hex 40 spaces it s probably best to toss the hex 40 out of the mix

10045512
websphere	ibm
however sometimes it s the server that has some kind of cache i say that because with ibm websphere i often get cache problems that i can t resolve with a simple f5 on my browser

you obviously need to fill in the values of x y width and height

10045636
rtp	rtcp	udp	rtp
assuming you are using udp rtp for the protocol of the media delivery your server will periodically send rtcp packets to report progress of stream delivery

10045636

in order to recognize state changes on the underlying rtp stream look at using the rtcp channel for a signal to state changes in the media stream s

10045636
rtp	rtcp
read the rfc s on rtp rtcp

10045697
int	chars
primitive local variables are local variables whose type is a c primitive like int float chars etc

10045730
profiling	benchmarking
for serious benchmarking you should use visual studio profiling which provides function call counts timing and memory allocation measurement etc or even use third-party memory profiling

10045771
mergesort	in-place
this solution is n log n complexity and could be performed in-place if needed in this case in-place implementation is a bit harder than with normal mergesort because adjacent parts could contain gaps from the removed duplicates which also need to be closed when merging

10045815
textview	listadapter
if i add the rest of the textview to the listadapter it makes the textview to big

10045873

well as said in the title i get two errors on the class where i put the sso code saying

10046043
clang	llvm
i ve tried several versions of this command including setting the environment variables before sudo including -m32 -m64 in fflags using the osx command line tools a full xcode install using clang instead of the llvm that comes with osx following the official scipy install instructions easy_install instead of pip and even . configure ing separately etc. but i can t seem to get it to work

10046054

my problem is i am trying to allow people to write reviews on games av got it so that all users that post a game are unique and the games are only viewable by there own accounts but when it comes to edit deleting updating i cant get it so that the user posted the game review can only delete update edit there own games and not the other users

10046056
superclass	subclassing
i have the capability to extend a class at compile time but i need to be able to create an instance of this subclassing at runtime using an instance of the superclass that was already instantiated

10046056
superclass	subclassing
this should be possible in theory because superclass constructors are already called before the subclassing constructor

10046133
rtp	sdp
normally when the output is one rtp stream ffmpeg prints the sdp information in the console so you just have to redirect it and then use the sdp

10046133
rtp	sdp
get it to print the sdp when 1 output is rtp and the other mp4 .

10046133
rtp	sdp
anyway what you can do though is to generate the sdp file for the first time and as long as you dont change the video characteristics resolution format ... or the rtp address this sdp file will be valid and your previous command would work with it

10046199
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
if the sayhi method is in a separate thread you can make use of a manualresetevent or an autoresetevent and use a waithandle to wait inside the while loop

10046210
width	height
instead of setting width height attributes set the css properties instead

10046224
post	get
in both your get string and your form which uses post the field is confirm not confirm

10046286
width	height
we have a 64 by 64 pixel display each pixel is 4 4 so total width and height are 256

10046313
width	height
and width and height are the width and height of the frame

10046316
addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	division	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction
here s a basic arithmetic grammar which gives multiplication and division operators precedence over addition and subtraction

10046322

i d like it to write to a log the name of the files that copied along with their size and the directory of the file that did not the folder where the day s .bak should have been

10046352
bash	tcsh
it was pleasant to have the same key bindings in both emacs and a shell bash tcsh for the most frequently used cursor movements so that i do not have to consciously think which one i have to use

10046367
put	get
which i dont get as the documentation for the library says to use get and i use put on tree for the kdtree and it worked

10046397
post	get
when i submit a form that has method post the view that handles it is getting method get and i can t seem to get it to be a post which is necessary for file uploads

10046397
post	get
when i don t include method post it submits with method get and the fields are included in the request.get dictionary in the email

10046397
post	get
however when i change to post post it remains method get and the fields are not in the request.post or the request.get dictionaries

10046405
width	height
that width and height bit is probably a paste mistake while posting or such but needs to be out

10046417
hash	md5
in this case you would have to compile the assets then change the css js links in the static html files each time you updated the code thus causing a change in the md5 hash

10046429
button	checkbox
at first i gave the users a checkbox but now i am thinking a better way would be to use the jquery ui button and toggle this to show either the text html editor or mce editor

10046434
slider	supersized
i am using supersized jquery slider plugin which change one on clicking nav anchor

10046452
nsdata	nserror
nserror is nil and nsdata object is not nil

10046478
put	get
note that this is a lame test and system.time should be put inside replicate to get more accurate differences you should take outliers into an account etc

10046513
google-chrome	firefox
there is a way to do this in firefox and google-chrome so i was wondering if it could also be done in ie

10046529
uilabel	uitextview
i could just hand layout 20 uilabel 20 on off switches or 3 position and 20 uitextview but that sounds really kludgy

10046556
google-chrome	firefox
on localhost socket.io seems to work ok but when i push to production on no.de on firefox 11 and google-chrome 18.0 it takes forever to connect and after about 5 seconds the connection is lost and not reestablished

10046573
bionic	libc
implement getprotobyname bionic libc bionic stubs.c 378

10046584
int	boolean
the api documentation for nearestneighbor#get indicates that the method takes four arguments of types kdtree p int boolean which are all java types

10046635
width	height
my question is how can i ensure that the height is the same pixel length as the width given that the container is not a square so i can t merely set the height percentage to the same thing as the width

10046673
versioning	upgrade
and if someone upgrade the library it is immediately visible in the versioning control who did what

10046719
rss	feed
suppose you wanted to display inside your layout the last x news items from your db or web service or an rss feed independent of which controller was requested

10046742
hide	show
i think you got too much dom operations for a simple show and hide

10046744
children	parent
my child s controller exposes parent as well as children parent.children and this works when the index method is called in the context of a parent but not when the child show method is called without a parental context

10046752
google-chrome	firefox
to workaround the problem in ie either force your users to upgrade use firefox google-chrome etc

10046776
post	get
set up a custom page template using a category feed loop then you can just create individual reel post that will get funneled to the page

10046792
dbcontext	objectcontext
dbcontext is a simplified api to entity framework which still uses the core objectcontext under the covers

10046811
width	height
this will keep the height the same as the width even if the window size changes

10046811
width	height
i used jquery because it helps a lot with the way browsers handle the width and height of elements

10046828
redmine	chiliproject
this was created and tested for the redmine fork chiliproject but should work without changes in redmine

10046860
int	double
now each instance of param has different template parameter double int string.

10046865
folder	directory
for example if a file is in the watch folder within the root directory of your account you can setup it s data-url attribute before jquery mobile does

10046887
int	chars
it does not represent a struct or primitive type int chars etc

10046887
int	chars
but you can convert a int etc to a nsnumber a chars to a nsstring and wrap a structure inside a nsobject-dervied class

10046924
post	get
i can successfully post to the controllers save method but upon simply returning the view return view i get the following

10046982
inherited	properties
i also ran into this problem but i just added some dummy properties into my inherited entity thinking it can be useful any time

10046982
inherited	properties
i know its not the perfect idea but it helped me keep my data model intact and give me the possibility to have own properties in the inherited entities in the future

10046992
getter	setter
in one class i define an nsmutablearray with getter and setter

10047003
multiplying	multiplication
through this could get the multiplication factor and then multiplying this factor with the actual height of the element

10047137
joystick	keyboard
i m working on joystick keyboard

10047320
clang	llvm
i have installed clang and llvm from source and am trying to compile some c++ code using features of the new standard

10047320
llvm	clang++	clang	llvm	folder	directory
at the moment i have just built clang and llvm into a folder in my home directory and am calling clang++ from there

10047376
libstdc++	libc++
clang can use gcc s libstdc++ but they also have their libc++ project

10047389
autocompletetextview	expandablelistview
you can rather use an autocompletetextview with pre-populated items of your expandablelistview so that you can have smooth functionality of search and allow the list to be refreshed based on user selection instead of the above mentioned functionality...you might affect the end user experience with your above mentioned functionality....but if you are so persistent on your implementation..you can use the same autocompletetextview with onkeydown functionality or textvalidation functionality.

10047420
post	put	post	get	put	get
some apis overload get and post request using x-http-method-override put or

10047435
google-chrome	firefox
this happens in firefox and google-chrome but ie9 draws them on separate lines and in order to have the same effect as in the other browsers i need to specify a width of 102px in the parent element

10047473
width	height
i first created a new basemap image file with width and height halved then in the annotation_raster i did the following

10047483
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
there are benefits in being case-sensitive and benefits in being case-insensitive

10047523
for-loop	loops
my observation is the initial for-loop seems necessary because its calculating and checking the values against the list but once that is done all the other times it loops is repeating the same process

10047576
boost	stl
if you want to store pointers in an stl container consider using shared pointer wrappers std shared_ptr or boost shared_ptr

10047584
ssl	https
the answer still applies because the second redirect is stopped when there is a change in protocol to https ssl

10047589
16-bit	64bit
if contrary to expectation no 64bit integer type is available you can calculate the modular product by splitting the factors into low and high 16-bit

10047607
google-chrome	firefox
this is how your given code looks in firefox 11 and similar in ie9 and google-chrome 18

10047689
int	chars
a is a pointer and an unsigned chars is treated like an int so you are making a pointer from an int without a cast

10047701
jlist	jtable
it seems the standard jlist has no methods to adjust the sorting why on earth did they only added that to a jtable ... but there is a tutorial for sorted lists

10047722
sin	sqrt
and the above will be equivalent to log sqrt sin 2

10047722
sin	sqrt
if you need to invert the order of function application for example sin sqrt log 2 then do this

10047859
getter	setter
the advantage of using setter and getter on member is to be able to overwrite

10047890
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine with firefox but does not play using the html solution when using google-chrome chromium

10047905
x86	64bit
when installing 32bit java on 64bit windows system set android_swt to e android-sdk tools lib x86

10047911
punctuation	words
w matches any words character but that includes numbers some punctuation

10047925
requestfactory	gwt
i m using gwt and requestfactory on a new project that needs authentication

10047970
min	max
this is an expensive process that s why i strongly suggest you to create a table with only an integer field with values from 1 to x where x is at least the maximum amount of dates that separate the min day and max day from your table

10047978
int	chars	unsigned	short
because calculations are not done with types below int unsigned int chars short unsigned short etc

10047978
unsigned	short
uint16_t is possibly unsigned short on your implementation which is promoted to int on your implementation

10047978
unsigned	short
on older implementations that calculate with 16bit int may not be able to represent all values of unsigned short because both have the same bitwidth

10047978
unsigned	short
such implementations must promote unsigned short to unsigned int

10047979
exif	xmp
i have written an application that writes metadata into the image file itself into the various namespaces iptc exif ifd and xmp

10048027
post	get
this seems to be a commonly used function to get the first image out of a post

10048033
implements	extends
the java language specification says that type variables can only be constrained to extends implements particular classes or interfaces

10048033
implements	extends
since annotating a class does not cause the class to extends or implements a particular type you can t constrain by annotation

10048039
width	height
just subtract half the width and height of the internal frame from the corresponding center coordinates of the desktop pane

10048102
google-chrome	firefox
this issue doesn t occur in google-chrome firefox nor ie

10048185
int	chars
if chars is unsigned the original int value is reduced to the unsigned chars range modulo uchar_max+1

10048221
google-chrome	firefox
but it does not render properly in google-chrome or firefox the tab is only wide enough for the tab one text and edit x are mostly under the tab lower z-index apparently

10048223
prepare	execute
i want to initialize prepare and execute the qsqlquery in a method that is a const

10048226
base-class	subclassing
the individual configurations are correct new-table with discriminator at base-class and superclass-table at subclassing for the first case and complete-table only at base-class for the second

10048242
put	get
in this example i assume that you ve put the code objects from all your functions in one file one after the other and when reading them in i get the code object s name and use it as the basis for both the function object s name and the name under which it s stored in the sandbox dictionary

10048293
jboss	glassfish
one strategy would be to use jboss infinispan in glassfish

10048295
integer	unsigned
4.7 2 if the destination type is unsigned the resulting value is the least unsigned integer congruent to the source

10048295
integer	unsigned
integer modulo 2 n where n is the number of bits used to represent the unsigned type

10048297
ccscene	cclayer
it s the center by default except for ccnode cclayer and ccscene where it is the lower left corner

10048297
width	height
since the ccnode has 0 width and 0 height the lower left corner equals its center unless you set the contentsize property manually

10048360
src	attr
#myiframe attr src

10048404
google-chrome	firefox
the javascript code below tested in firefox and google-chrome based on matthew s post will warn the user the good innocent one a priori to uploading a large file saving both traffic and the user s time

10048411
post	get
in a class i have a handling method which performs actions based on what post get variables are available

10048465
post	put	post	get	put	get
the hostsitesectionheadereditscreenobject instance passed as an argument to the post handler method is not the same instance as the one you put in the model in the get handler method

10048465
post	put
so if a parameter isn t present in the post because you didn t put an input in the html form for it that field will not be set by spring it will just be whatever the default initial value is for the field

10048502
post	get
i need to post it and get the response code

10048516
width	height
but i suppose worst case you can give the glass style some insane height width in the css

10048545
hash	md5
you might generate the entire set of brute force values and the md5 hash on the gpu

10048545
hash	md5
there are approximately 27 6 keys 387 420 489 keys and hence md5 hash

10048545
hash	md5
an md5 hash is 16 bytes so that would consume 6.2 gbytes if it were to be stored

10048653
google-chrome	firefox
for mozilla firefox and internet explorer every thing works ok but for google-chrome it works only for one time after the browser restart the file become as it was before modifying it

10048654
google-chrome	firefox
being limited to a specific browser such as firefox or google-chrome is acceptable but all of the browser combinations i have tried don t seem to work with any of the multitouch demo applications i have tried such as

10048707
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
especially if you re using a modern browser google-chrome firefox safari opera

10048736
ati	nvidia
one with nvidia card and one with ati

10048755
decoder	encoder
edit actually decoder and encoder have both a lookahead time

10048783
folder	directory
i have no problem and it creates the folder in the root directory

10048795
datamapper	activerecord
that is not possible datamapper implements the activerecord pattern which expects the tables to be there

10048798
decoder	encoder
i am working on creating a snappy encoder and decoder for netty

10048801
filtering	grouping
what im trying to do is be able to return a list of grouping filtering by tags

10048806
nowjs	node.js
i ve been using socket.io with node.js and came across nowjs it seems this just wraps socket.io and provides a more user-friendly interface

10048830
google-chrome	firefox
it worked in firefox but not google-chrome

10048850
margin	border-color
or as dmackerman suggestions set a margin of 0 but a border of the size you want the margin to be and set the border-color

10048925
hide	show
the code hide all fields initially the second-to-last line invokes the change event to achieve this showing only the default selected option and then show only what was selected

10048936
for-loop	arrays
in order to iterate through the arrays of objects you can use a for-loop like this for example

10048989
hash	md5	crypt	hash	crypt	md5
i should comment that crypt is not as bad as marc b makes it sound and may in fact be the easiest way to good hash as long as you don t rely on its weaker schemes like md5

10048996
aggregate-functions	sum
when you use an aggregate-functions line sum you need to tell the sql server what columns are going to be used to group by for doing the sums

10049000
post	get
based on my experience on google s refresh token method i think you should do an http post instead of http get to given url

10049014
google-chrome	firefox
ie and firefox google-chrome are simply behaving differently just their interpretation of the specifications

10049014
google-chrome	firefox
to be honest that fact that firefox and google-chrome are similar and ie has had a long history of float bugs i d side with mozilla google here although can appreciate that ie seems to be behaving nicer in this instance

10049037
aggregate-functions	sum
if bill_country and ship_country are going to be included in a query that also has aggregate-functions like sum you need to group on them

10049079
opensuse	debian
i installed a copy of debian instead of opensuse and tried again and this time i no longer encountered the error on top

10049079
zlib	libz
ran into a few issues of missing libraries and had to install gcc and various zlib or libz libraries after the compiler kept complaining about missing them

10049147

10049642
children	parent
the child update panel will only refresh its children not its parent if the update mode is not set to conditional

10049659

one common approach to hide the setter from your client is to encapsulate all the getter that the client needs in an iemployee interface and code the service apis to that interface

10049694
interpreted-language	compiled-language
especially in an interpreted-language like php where classes add more overhead than a compiled-language

10049726
width	height
the solution to one of my problems had to do with browser-supplied gradients on un-styled form objects propagating for the full width and height of the page even when on a lower z-index than other elements they were hidden behind due to a variable not found error in my javascript

10049756
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
if you really want separate classes for it you could use single table inherited have a votes table a superclass vote and two subclassing voteup and votedown

10049759
entities	entitymanager
flushing the entitymanager doesn t clear anything from memory it only synchronizes entities with the database

10049759
entities	entitymanager
this guy had a similar issue. clearing it will indeed remove all references from entitymanager to your entities however you should probably re-evaluate how you use your entitymanager in general if you find yourself constantly having to call clear

10049860

10049920
folder	directory
when you install add-ons no upgrades just extra bundles they go in .eclipse a hidden folder under the users home directory

10049954
post	get
what i would do then is inject a content script into each page and use something similar to the below example as inspired by reading this so post - get selected text #39

10049978
client-side	server-side
there are two types of flows you can take the server-side and client-side from your code it seems like you need to use the server side flow in order to have an access token for the user on the php side then the call for the getuser method should return the user object you want

10049982
innodb	myisam
it s especially important with mysql because of the myisam innodb thing but if you specify it grails doesn t need to inspect the connection metadata to figure out what database you re using

chunked	transfer-encoding
my intention was to add transfer-encoding chunked via httpaddrequestheaders remove content-length via httpaddrequestheaders http_addreq_flag_replace and then in my internetwritefile loop write the data in chunked encoded blocks

10050153
chunked	transfer-encoding
even after removal it ends up sending content-length 0 to the server in addition to transfer-encoding chunked which is confusing the server

10050227
many-to-one	one-to-many	many-to-many	many-to-one	many-to-many	one-to-many
if your relation between student and teacher had additional attributes apart from the foreign keys of both entities then you will need an additional entity but you already existent entities student and teacher will no longer have a many-to-many relationship but a one-to-many many-to-one with that intermediary studentteacher entity

10050241

you should post your asynctask for us to get the full picture but from the log i would tell that you re trying to inflate some view in doinbackground

10050454
daemons	systemd
hostname is set by the systemd syslog daemons before it forwards the message to a centralized server

10050454
daemons	systemd
also it s worth noting that sysloglogger is basically wrapping the c openlog and syslog functions so basically all post-log configuration happens on the systemd daemons

10050454
daemons	systemd
generally that s desirable but sometimes you may want your rails app to log directly to a specific destination like to simplify automated deployment change attributes not allowed by syslog or run in environments without access to the systemd daemons

10050502
width	height
next give inner-block to span and the image height and width

10050571

my problem is that i do not want to inherited this class but i have other classes that need to access the ds dataset properties

10050643
g++	gcc
basically what is covered in shared libraries applies to c++ just replace gcc with g++

10050643
g++	gcc
if you tell gcc g++ to stop after the translation stage with the -s upper case s option and then look at resulting .s file once with the -fpic option and once without you will see the difference the dynamic code has gotpcrel and plt at least on x86_64

10050924
client-side	server-side
the rendered attribute is server-side and the visible attribute is client-side

10050932

another method is to determine the title bar height and window frame width and just subtract them from the given coordinates since you are positioned adjacent to them inside the game window - if you move adjust appropriately for the position relative inside the content frame

10050969
rss	feed
use a heuristic to look for link titles or hrefs containing rss feed or xml which may indicate an rss link

10051047
knockout.js	upshot
i m pretty sure that upshot should be able to send only the modified properties as it uses knockout.js observables so it can keep track of what s changed and what s not

10051073
width	height
remember always set the width and height if you are going to float elements

10051108
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
with the testing framework you can write one test and run it against ie firefox google-chrome and safari

10051209
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
if you re developing web sites professionally i d suggest getting a nice large screen they re cheap nowadays and installing all of the major web browsers ie firefox google-chrome safari etc.

10051209
width	height
avoiding css padding combined with width height can help as some older browsers use a different box model

10051272
client-side	server-side
in addition to your syntax being wrong you re trying to mix client-side and server-side code

10051316
put	get
you would have to copy what they put and remove the in order to get it to run correctly or copy the one line version above

10051371
realloc	malloc
in c your pointer can be invalidated by a malloc and realloc where in c++ your pointer can be invalidated by delete

10051433
sorting	grouping
even though there are few grouping i don t think you will be able to avoid the initial sorting into grouping while still keeping the reduction step efficient

10051438
width	height
i found a way to get the x y coordinates along with width and height

10051485
spaces	delimiter
if you want to separate the errors with a delimiter other than a spaces just replace the spaces in the first parameter

10051487
daemons	launchd
but when you need to launchd a thread for a single task operation or instantiate a daemons thread that run for all the application time or for a long specific time then could be better create a single thread and terminate it when you don t need it anymore

10051499
post	get
for example in php i find it annoying to have the _ and then capital letters for session post get and cookies

10051592
express	node.js
i m trying to post data from an ios app to node.js express

10051592
post	get
however when i try to post from my ios app i get no console app - it s almost as if node never sees the incoming post request

10051604
udp	tcp
however unlike udp which transmits a complete message at a time tcp just keeps sending data until the connection closes with no protocol-level concept of individual messages

10051605
qdatastream	qbytearray
due to the fact that this code is called extremely often i would like to avoid this unnecessary std copy operation and make either qbytearray or qdatastream work on preallocated user memory pointed by out

10051643
google-chrome	firefox
use a google-chrome or firefox extension that lets you view cookies

10051670
google-chrome	firefox
my code is working fine in ie and firefox but in google-chrome i get following exception

10051688
pull	push
so br1 was originally supposed to pull push from master and we end up with br1 pulling from origin master and pushing to a branch we never knew existed

10051716
hash	salt
currently i store a salt value and an encryption key in the config file but i d really rather move to a password hash

10051716
hash	salt
since i can t store the salt separately i wonder if it would be ok to derive the salt from the password itself and then hash the combination of the two

10051716
salt	md5	hash	salt	hash	md5
for example i might take the password md5 hash it then use the md5 hash as the salt

10051727
udp	tcp
should work - dst port 443 and greater 100 is a complete filter expression which checks for packets that are being sent to tcp or udp port 443 and that have a total length including link-layer ip and tcp headers

10051732
hash	salt
if you derive salt from the password all the same password have the same hash and the salt became useless

10051747
client-side	server-side
your server-side code does its job of retrieving data and sending it to the client while your client-side code does its job of dealing with the view

10051756
packets	pcap
you could either capture the traffic with tcpdump make sure you capture with -w so that the trace is saved in pcap format and with -s 0 so that you capture all the data in the packets or with wireshark

10051758
salt	md5
the problem with your example is that if some attacker wanted to find a match they could create a rainbow table where all the passwords are salt by their md5 couterparts

10051758
salt	md5
salt should be unique per entry so that way a hacker would have to have a reverse engineered table of every possible combination of the md5 with every possible salt

10051760
hash	salt
if a salt has 65536 different values for example then it means that the same password can hash 65536 different ways

10051794
sorting	filtering
sorting paging and filtering do not work together

10051821
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

10051863
pop-up	dialog
i hope this piece of code will able to help you figure out how to implement the pop-up text dialog box

10051863
pop-up	dialog
the way of this example work by implementing a button in the main window root when you click on it the pop-up dialog will appear mydialog class object will be created then it will use wait_window to wait until it is finish

10051863
pop-up	dialog
you can see how the pop-up dialog box is implemented it is an simple toplevel widget it is just like another frame you can think of you pack your label your entry field and finally a button mysubmitbutton

10051870
boost	eigen	eigen	ublas
i d recommend you use a library such as eigen very fast or the boost ublas matrix not so fast relatively speaking class

10051887
hash	salt
if the purpose of your salt-like scheme is to make the password resistant to a dictionary attack using pre-determined hash then your approach may be a little more secure than an unsalted hash but not nearly as secure as using a valid salt

10051887
hash	salt
one significant security benefit of a valid salt is that two instances of the same password would yield two different hash

10051888
post	get
but currently i can t get even a simple post to work

10051939
getter	setter
i d suggest limiting functions to at least 3 lines with one exception methods that require access to an object s internals like getter or setter for example can be smaller

10051962
hide	show
depending on the screen size and orientation show hide the appropriate fragment s using fragmenttransaction.show fragmenttransaction.hide

10052053
sorting	filtering
doing sorting filtering becomes very difficult

10052111
inherited	subclassing
itemset could have various subclassing using single table inherited or you could possibly achieve this kind of behavior another way

10052119
hide	show
i have a photo gallery i am working on building and i have a previous and next button that show and hide and change opacity depending on hover and such

10052151
octal	decimal
the algorithm to solve this issue is closed to the process we learn for manual mathematical division or also to convert from decimal to another base like octal or hexadecimal - except that two examples only look for a single canonical solution

10052170
post	get
in express s routing framework app.get only responds to get requests post are ignored and probably result in a 404

10052214
getter	setter
the animaldata is just a typical getter setter so i will just skip the code for that

10052223
integer	unsigned
i trying to write a mips program that gets an unsigned integer as argument and returns the sum of all decimal digits in the integer recursively

10052233
serializable	deserialization
binary plists looks pretty simple to use for objc objects serializable deserialization this is important point cause its experimental non commercial project but it looks inefficient

i have a circuit made from and not and or gates i need to convert it so that it only has nor gates this isn t working to well for me so any tips would be much appreciated

10052554
redhat	fedora
here are my notes from my recent redhat enterprise linux rhel installation of ruby which i believe is pretty similar to fedora

10052582
min	max
so for example if i set the min and max options to 10 and 100 then the slider would increment by 10 s like 10 20 30 etc

10052593
integer	unsigned
in c++11 long long is a standard integer of at least 64 bits so for example unsigned long long has these limits

10052640
for-loop	arrays
depending on how many items are in the arrays and how often you want to search for different items it can get very costly to have a for-loop iterate over the entire arrays every time you want to count things which would happen if you did what the other two answers suggest

10052688
post	get
if you also get the out of memory exception with this i think you will then you should take a look at the following post

10052736
filtering	grouping
the definition of filtering class which you use don t use grouping part on the input

10052736
filtering	grouping
the simplest code which add support of the grouping part of filtering can be

10052738
g++	gcc
i mainly work in c hence the default compiler is gcc rather than g++

10052745
mouseover	mouseout
without the code one has to guess but my guess is that you re using mouseover and mouseout to determine hovering

10052745
mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave
because jquery doesn t use mouseover and mouseout it uses mouseenter and mouseleave which are more suited to this scenario

10052745
mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave
if you re not and you re either not using a library or using one that doesn t emulate mouseenter and mouseleave for you you need to check which element the mouseout operation is coming from and ignore it unless it s the li itself

10052745
hide	show
this css will do it you d want more than this for positioning but this will do the show hide part

10052756
put	get
if you use two different streams most likely each will manage its own put and get pointer each will have buffering which means that if you don t use flush you won t be able to determine what is the order the operations will be done on the file

my apps uses fragments to show a listview in portrait mode or the listview and details view side-by-side in landscape mode

10064987
portrait	landscape
the problem is if the user rotates their display from portrait to landscape or vice versa while the asynctask is running the asynctask is killed

10064987
portrait	landscape
however adding that attribute then prevents the fragments from automatically switching to the landscape portrait view

in c an int expression can be used implicitly as a boolean expression although i would argue that it is a bad idea where zero is false and any non-zero value is true

10065697

in java that is not allowed so you have to make the expression explicitly boolean by comparing the int result to some other int value or expression using a comparison operator

then when verifying the hash he decodes the base64 string and splits out the salt and hash bytes

10065933

10066178
folder	directory
try executing the command as the super user by using su or sudo and if this doesn t help the other possiblity is that the location of the filename is out of bounds so i would try copying it to the desktop or your home directory or folder where you know you definitely have full permissions and see if this works

10066185
scheme	racket
as i learn scheme and racket i find myself repeating this pattern again and again

10066244

the issue was not in senddatatoallpeers it was in the conversion of the nsstring strtosend to nsdata

10066337
post	get
if your site is coded using php you can send a http post request to the page try avoid using a get request for security reasons and then do the necessary processing you need to do with the data

10066355
rss	feed
instead store your data in sdb notify machines of updates via sqs and create your rss feed on the fly with caching

10066360
stdout	stderr
you should try to capture stderr in addition to stdout so that you can find out exactly why the program is failing assuming it does indeed print some errors for you

10066374
dictionary	map
i might be confused between hashmap in java and map dictionary in python

10066402
dictionary	map
in essence a map in java is like a dictionary in python both data structures create associations between keys and values with expected o 1 performance for the get and contains operations

10066414
put	get
so if we put all this together we get the following untested but pretty trivial hook to which i ve added the ability to invoke it from the command line

10066428

folder	directory
i m a front-end developer for my college jsp project and so far i was using sublime text 2 for writing markup and my css less and ran the project directly from apache tomcat configured manually where i placed my project directory in webapps folder but later the project required to use servlets obviously and i realized the need of ide while my colleagues at the development part are now insisting to use ide

10066431

10066747
children	parent
this is why you can distinguish code blocks in your program which should be executed by parent and children

10066754
post	get
if you are writing a window gui style application - usually with a winmain entry point and a message loop then wsaasyncselect on a socket handle will get read and write ready notification messages posted to a hwnd - settimer likewise post periodic wm_timer notifications and gettickcount can be used to detect which socket has been idle too long

10066805
mp3	wav
i start with a 1 min wav and it lands up as a 5 min mp3

10066821
vim	emacs
it generally fills the same niche as vi vim or emacs but generally follows modern interface standards and has some really useful features that i haven t seen in any other editors such as the minimap and multi-selection hit ctrl-d with some text selected and it will select the next instance of the same text while still keeping the old selection intact essentially putting your input cursor in two places so you can edit them both in tandem

10066862
width	height
there s no content and you re not actually setting the width or height of the block so it s not going to be visible

10066905
post	get
after some trial and error i came to the conclusion that the 501 error occurs due to the google openid url being passed to the page either as querystring for form method get either as postdata for form method post

i do it like that set a default width + height when opening colorbox with these options

10067044
width	height
and make sure all images inside that iframe have a width height set or have fully loaded

10067097
width	height
is the height of the image changes as does the width but they don t change proportionally

10067097
width	height
instead the width changes correctly and the height changes correctly but independent of one another

10067139
children	parent
i ve tried creating model_child and then assigning it also using build_model_child and each method shows model_child is clearly in the parent however the query for not nil .ne fails to find all modelparents with children

10067168

cruisecontrol .net threads on stackoverflow the general consensus appeared to be to go with jenkins

10067358
cruisecontrol	jenkins
having not really tried cruisecontrol i can t vouch for that but i will say that jenkins is very good

10067363
metaclass	subclassing
i think this is better done with a metaclass in order to handle both runtime and subclassing method decoration

10067390
uiview	subviews
or you could create a uiview subclass and place the uiwebview within it as a subviews then make its hittest withevent method return views beneath the uiwebview

10067390
uiview	subviews
here is a generic hittest method for a uiview subclass that gives priority to any interactive subviews that aren t uiwebview even if they re underneath the uiwebview

10067404
getter	setter
attr_accessor is a ruby function to generate getter and setter which will interfere with things

10067412
getter	setter
i ve already found that using getter setter is considered bad too

10067424
width	height
otherwise as long as you have the original ratio ration orgwidth orgheight you could take it and reflect it on the width height

10067469
public	protected
there s nothing wrong with using protected data members if using private won t work for your solution using public data members however is almost never a good idea however it can be sometimes too

10067469
getter	setter
i would probably make your vectors private in this case but simply create getter and setter methods

10067488
put	get
when i use embeddedwb i don t get the script errors but the same problem is still there i can t interact with box in which i need to put my answers

10067537

10067542
post	get
i tried to get all the code in the header to make it easier to post but the dependencies did not allow it and so i had to have a little cpp as well

zlib	libjpeg	gif	png
make sure your pil is compiled and installed with jpeg and png gif support which requires libjpeg and zlib

10067625
client-side	server-side
note i m assuming you re asking if you can access a method or function in the php code on the server-side not call a javascript function on the client-side

10067642
factors	mean
becos big-oh represents rapidly growing and not just by a constant factors but there is no such condition with h n function defined i mean i consider as literally greater than here is that wrong

10067650
int	chars
it just seems to me like with one int arrays you re incrementing the pointers as each pointer can only point to one memory location but with chars arrays it can point to all of them somehow

10067696
width	height
the width of the two images is the same and it s the height that s different

10067702

10067757
memcpy	memset
you can use memcpy and memset etc which are portable and safer than string functions

10067835
versioning	upgrade
i m trying to upgrade joomla versioning 1.5.20 to joomla versioning 2.5.4

10067842
calloc	malloc
you should allocate the name array inside of getname on the heap with malloc calloc so that when you return the pointer the data won t be destroyed

10067843
sorting	grouping
this keeps the test at the top level and would allow all sorts of internal refactoring perhaps lazy sorting of the grouping

10067849
min	max
combiners are typically suited to a problem where you are performing some form of aggregation min max etc operation on the data - these values can be calculated in the combiner for the map output and then calculated again in the reducer for all the combined outputs

10068003
packets	multicast
i have 2gbps multicast all around my network in europe middle east asia north and south america and never lost a single packets - all switches are voip ready so this way they automatically internally prioritize the multicast traffic and this is the best way to approach this problem

10068034
post	get
if you do a print_r of your post values you get something like

10068069
children	parent
you don t want to get into the habit of having children classes control the behavior of their siblings just because they can access the parent and the parent s methods easily

10068078
freebsd	linux
i use vim on both freebsd and linux os sharing the same .vimrc configuration file

10068078
freebsd	linux
there s one problem that on freebsd the ctags binary path is usr local bin exctags while on linux it s usr bin ctags

10068116
uiview	calayer

post	get
try doing these you should get closer to the actual problem also post these findings in your question

10072761
put	get
forking is probably the right thing to do here and daemonising better but a simple way to get mostly the same effect without changing the script is as the comment on the question suggests to simply put the script in the background

check this question 1 it states that the focus events do not get fired on radio buttons in google-chrome and safari

10073071
fastcgi	scgi
so you either will implement a small incomplete subset of http which might not work with most browsers or http clients or you have to use something which helps you making a full http server some http server library like onion or libmicrohttpd and they are not very simple anymore or plugin your web application perhaps using fastcgi or scgi jserve etc.. to connect or plug it inside a real web server

getter	setter
now i am using these getter and setter from other classes in my project using static way i.e mypreferences.getprefsisappenabled

10073099
getter	setter
my question would it be a better logic to make all these 10 methods non static and instantiate mypreference all over my project before accessing the getter and setter methods or should i move the code present in the constructor into all the setter getter functions and repeat it everywhere its required before calling the methods of mypreferences class

google-chrome	firefox
apparently google-chrome and firefox treat cross domain requests a bit differently

10073217
google-chrome	firefox
the difference between google-chrome and firefox is that google-chrome sends also the authorization header with the credentials whereas firefox do not

10073217
google-chrome	firefox
but if somebody finds a solution to force firefox to send the credentials like google-chrome it would be great and i would chose this one

10073232
imperative	declarative
where invariants necessary to enforce business rules can be stated declarative that is almost always better than enforcing them with imperative code in a trigger

10073236
ant	maven
you should use ant or maven to create a war file and let your script upload this war file to your local server production server

if the superclass has a protected method and subclassing has same method with public

10073767
inherited	subclassing
subclassing don t inherited private methods

10073780
addclass	removeclass
using a framework like jquery would make this much easier since it has helper functions such as addclass toggleclass and removeclass

10073798
getter	setter
maybe you should not define getter setter methods for the preferences they seem redundant

10073798
getter	setter
unless the listener uses your getter setter but then it should just use the standard way to access the preferences

10073840
post	get
i can help with code if this is what you want but you ll need to post your ajax so i can get a better idea

then i put this into a drupal theme and it inserted some extra div s inbetween and i am struggling to figure out how to get my original look back

querypath	phpquery
i think you should look at phpquery or even better and in active development querypath

10074158
post	get
this way one method is processed when the method post is used and the other when the get is used

10074162

udp	tcp
what i am debating is if i should go with enet which is udp based with reliability or plain old tcp ip

10074442
switching	screens
in tests i did in ios 5.1 when switching to another application from mobile safari after double-pressing the home button the pagehide event seemed to be fired immediately before the application actually switched whereas if i pressed the home button just once to get to the home screens it seems the javascript thread is suspended immediately and listeners for the event are only called when mobile safari is brought into focus again

10074451
public	protected
should i inherit with private protected or public

10074454
public	protected
if messageupdate is-a messagewrite then by definition it has access to all of its protected and public members

10074475
public	protected
the closest parallel to this line of thinking that i see in php s capability is using protected scope rather than public for these kinds of methods

10074481
verilog	vhdl
since it is a c code so i am sure i cannot use the same environment as that of verilog vhdl

10074491
google-chrome	firefox
for example in gecko-based browsers such as firefox and in webcore-based browsers such as google-chrome google-chrome you could execute

10074492
post	put
when the time comes to submit the order a commonly used approach would be to convert the array to json and submit it to the server as via a http put or post

10074545
post	get
if you make request then id is a queryparam to be more precise this is get request parameter if you make post request with a form inside body then these form parameters filled usually by user are translated to formparam-s

10074564
implements	extends
for the scenario you describe the best path i can see is to have all those potential classes implements the same interface or perhaps extends from the same abstract parent class

uicontrol inherits from uiview so you can add a subviews to your uicontrol by calling addsubview

10074942
udp	tcp
i m unclear on how enet uses udp sockets and how it manages connections so i m unclear whether you re better off with lots of open tcp sockets or lots of open enet connections

10074975
hash	md5
if you want to avoid collisions while sacrificing speed you will want cryptographic hash functions of which md5 128 bits sha-1 160 bits and sha-2 usually sha-256 or sha-512 are the most widely used and have fast implementations

10074975
hash	md5
very efficient hash collision finding algorithms for md5 are available but if you input random messages you ll get as close to the as you re ever going to get while still running in reasonable time

if i change the width however to something like 720px then it ll look fine in safari but be out of place in google-chrome

this conversion can lose precision but also lose range resulting in a float zero from a nonzero double and a float infinity from a finite double

add android scaletype fitxy and fill_parent for height and width both in you layout xml

10075256
mapquest	directions
unfortunately the mapquest open directions service does not support a change to the speed associated with a route as an input parameter

as far as i know you can t really trigger pseudo classes like hover in that way but you could use a class or set the styles in a mouseenter mouseleave event in js or just change the css directly something like

10075299
udp	tcp
tcp and udp sockets are not language-dependant if you have an udp server in nodejs and an udp client in java this should work out of the box

the delegatedmap used in the sample code does not extends java.util.hashmap it just wraps an instance of one and implements the map interface

ultimately the grid s will sit inside of a tab panel but if i can get this simpler example working and understood i can take it from there. i could put the following grid panel into a window getting draggability out of the box and then add this window to a viewport but the extjs4 layout documentation seems to warn against this

my personal experience is that unicorn is much much faster then webrick when using a remote machine ubuntu 4 cores 8g mem connecting though vpn - ssh as your development environment as i do -- i see sub-1 second page load times with unicorn while webrick takes 3 to 5 second or more

10076390

10076552
maven	pom.xml
one questions comes to my mind why are you defining maven central in your repositories list cause it s already defined in maven itself...btw repository definition should be put into the settings.xml instead of the pom.xml apart from using a repository manager

10076580
width	height
set the dimensions width and height and see if your problems are resolved

10076581

the advantage here is that you don t lose the height and width of rows and columns during the process - they re restored to exactly their original formats

10076673
put	get
if inputview on the text field doesn t get you what you want you can also simply put an invisible button on top of the uitextfield and just show the popover from the button s action

10076695

as for scaling the canvas i believe that is still necessary all of my other widget scale to their width and height before drawing with no issue

10076709
int	double
if the compiler assumes atof returns an int casting it will solve the conversion warning but it will not cause the return value to be recognized as a double

10076718
children	parent
this means locking not between siblings of the same kind but between parent and children which might be from different types

10076727
put	get
can someone explain very simply how to get the id of the new record and put it into the id field in my grid

10076805

10076835
sorting	filtering
you d then handle your sorting filtering etc

10076839
int	chars
if let s say i send this as the buffer to recv int s chars buf int len int flags

fgets	fgetc
then you can read from your file by line using fgets to read by lines or fgetc to read by characters

10076863
int	chars
continue with converting the num s chars into int here stdlib.h also has to be included

10076865
inherited	properties
the parent class s properties will be automatically inherited duh

10076881
boost	allocator	boost	stl	allocator	stl
the best way to avoid buffer overflow is to avoid the use of static buffers and use libs like stl boost etc for any objects that require memeory allocator eg use an stl vectors inplace of array

10076898
put	get
i just do not know how to get all the prices and put them into an array

10076972
put	get
take a look at your apache httpd configuration files and get an idea of how everything is put together

10077036
super	extends
in your case this would be both parent and child types if one extends the other just add it to super type and that s fine

10077058
nowjs	node.js
i am very much interested to learn node.js and nowjs

10077080

there was plenty of scope for reuse so an dao object for a particular entity may well extends an abstract dao which housed the re-usable stuff which in itself implements a dao interface

10077080

i found these resources helpful the node beginner book building your first node.js app series nowjs and node.js tutorial â creating a multi room chat client beginnerâ s guide to node.js and node.js websocket - simple chat tutorial

10077392
put	get
a rare exception is the content property in your example which you can get away with not explicitly binding since wpf will assume you intended to put it in the contentpresenter

10077393
public	protected
yes the visibility of the type is the same as any class member and effected by private protected and public

10077414
junit	jmockit
i m using gradle milestone 8a to run junit tests on my project with the ibm j9 jvm which according to running tests with jmockit requires that i pass the argument -javaagent jmockit.jar to the jvm

10077414
junit	jmockit
i ve also added jmockit and junit to the testcompile configuration making sure that jmockit is first and verified this by running gradle dependencies

10077511
fadein	fadeout	fadein	hide	hide	fadeout	hide	show
i also switched the code to fadein and fadeout because those automatically do the show and hide as needed

10077620
put	get
my source .java files are in the src directory the file i want to execute is src tedi.java the class files get put correctly into the build directory and all my jars are in the directory jung2-2_0_1

ssl	https
the reason i ask for example as shown above the form submission calls an https and the site i m on is http only no ssl

10077694

if the same branch usually the master is in different places because one machine pushed it to the server without merging first then the other machine has to pull merge and then it will be able to push just fine

10077706
width	margin
currently i achieve this by getting the screen width and dividing it into n equal parts and setting the appropriate margin to this view

the operating system is linux centos

10077747
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
thus it would seem to me that all three browsers are behaving according to the spec but google-chrome safari firefox all have ua rules that more closely match what most users would expect

10077747
google-chrome	firefox
however if you edit the test case to add both google-chrome and firefox do not properly show the overflowed contents

10077753
multiplying	transpose
you can multiplying it by its transpose though

10077833
profiling	instrumentation
you can use the time profiling tool from instrumentation

10077836
free	malloc
in a pinch i believe that you can customize boost shared_ptr with a custom deallocator so that you can allocate with std malloc avoiding the initialization overhead and deallocate with std free while still maintaining the goodness that shared_ptr brings to the table

10077837
oncreate	onstart
it seems the screen isnt actually drawn until the activity is running after oncreate onstart etc

10077844

it isn t possible to bind multiple processes to the same tcp socket but it is possible with udp

10077976
qtimer	qwidget
when my qwidget is closed is must delete this qtimer but i can not because closeevent is not called

10078019
udp	tcp
you could parse the tcp udp header create an own socket with the same src dest port ip use protect on this socket so it not routed over tun0

10078019
udp	tcp	icmp	tcp	icmp	udp
since tpacketcapture only supports udp tcp and not icmp they might use this approach

10078020
width	height
make sure x y width and height are doubles and if you want further information check out this

10078044
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome firefox and ie if i just change the background color to red and then select the item from the list the color is now blue

try setting a max-height on it if that doesnt work try using just height and width

10078148
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
you are adding notifications from both viewdidappear and viewwillappear

10078184
free	malloc
sometime during the history of the project someone decided that #define malloc my_malloc and #define free my_free had some use

10078184
free	malloc
these didn t do much more than call built-in malloc and free but project already compiled and worked this way

10078184
free	malloc
with new delete it might be trickier but still with ld_preload you might be able to replace malloc free without even recompiling your app

10078186
buildout	django-lfs
i m using django-lfs that i installed it using buildout

10078200
post	get
this blog post and the slug engine source code should be enough detail for you to get your own code up and running but that open-source engine seems to be exactly what you re looking for if you want a drop-in solution

dict file ftp ftps gopher http https imap imaps ldap ldaps pop3 pop3s rtsp smtp smtps telnet tftp

10078217
jms	nms	nms	xms
i used jms not available in .net directly unless you use api from some jms provider like ibm xms or apache nms tibco ems and tibco randezvous previously and if i compare pub-sub pattern available in wcf with real pub-sub infrastructures the wcf implementation is like a bad joke

10078266
mapbox	cartodb
you might want to look at google fusion tables or solutions like mapbox or cartodb for quick hosted solutions

10078266
leaflet	openlayers
willing to invest more time and depending on your skills and language preferences you could delve into postgis geoserver mapserver with a frontend of openlayers leaflet or any other libraries

10078467
google-chrome	firefox
next time check your browser s console shift-ctrl-j in firefox google-chrome for errors

10078485
google-chrome	firefox
the end result is close enough that the majority of users would never know the difference between ie google-chrome and firefox

10078497
octal	decimal
note that 00 through 07 work fine because both octal and decimal interpretation yield the same value

10078501
post	get
then for app.post request you can get post values via

10078549
folder	directory
find your install directory eg c csvn .this will contain a folder named data which contains a file named csvn-production-hsqldb.script

10078562
jboss	glassfish
yes you try using jboss cache infinispan ehcache memcached etc but the glassfish team does not test those frameworks with glassfish

as opposed to strict consistency acid compliance

10078579
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox

i m having this issue in safari only works fine for firefox and google-chrome on mac os 10.6 and 10.7

10078660
awt	swing
i m using java and i m using swing and awt

10078680
put	get
as oli has added you want to shift by 32 not 31 - shifting by 31 will put it in the 31st bit so if you shifted back to the right to try and get the first number you would end up with a bit missing and the second number would be potentially huge because you could have put a 1 in the uppermost bit

10078685
hash	md5
signature object already does the hash md5 and encrypts with the private key rsa

10078711
width	height
height and width are my window size

10078749
mouseleave	mouseenter
split the hover into mouseenter and mouseleave which is what hover is shorthand for anyways

10078768
rsa	dsa
although with rsa the mathematical operations used for the signature are very similar to those used for encryption in that signing more or less the same as encrypting the digest this is not the case for all algorithms dsa

10078779
mouseleave	mouseenter
hover is shorthand for mouseenter and mouseleave events

10078793
int	chars
i want to convert chars into int based on predetermined values for example

two int will not overflow if you assign them to a long or a double

10078843
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
in watching through fiddler it appears that when my silverlight application calls the service it is as expected looking for the clientaccesspolicy.xml and crossdomain.xml files from the wcf data services site to be allowed cross-domain access

10078865
for-loop	arrays
you can not do this in java and if you feel you must print these separate variables with a for-loop then your best bet is eugene s answer of putting them in an arrays first

10078867
for-loop	loops
otherwise i have to put a for-loop just after initialization which ranges from index 0 to index size-1 and inside that loops i am assigning element to -1

10078870
width	margin
set a width on the wrapper and set margin top and bottom to 0 and the left and right to auto

google-chrome	firefox
this chunk of code works as it should in google-chrome and firefox the background image occurs just once

10078953
post	put
if you want to post some values in your form to resumecomment.add you need to put them in hidden inputs

10078978
maven	m2e
i m guessing the former in which case make sure that you have the latest version of the m2e plugin installed and that both projects a b are maven eclipse projects

10079047

you should create getter and if needed also setter methods for the instance variable workout in view1

10079098
imagemagick	im4java
i am trying to run a simple imagemagick command from a java class and as i have to run only a few commands i thought instead of using im4java i could directly use processbuilder.start

10079151

in relation to another so post i need to update my model so that the new column activebool doesn t try to get matched against a database table

10079163

10079318
put	get
similar to the described way i extract the token from the response of the first get and put it into the form parameters of the second

10079346
post	get
look at this form post to see how to avoid this type of encoding if you are able to get the service configuration changed

10079378
children	parent
as far as reading all the children and their parent etc from the xml are concerned you can try python s xml.dom.minidom module

10079406
post	get
you get sample code showing usage of this method when you enable migrations or you can see an example in this older blog post from the ef team

10079446
hash	md5
instead of create your own algorithm to hash or encrypt a password try using a well tested and reliable algorithm like sha1 md5 and so on

it s a simple qmainwindow with buttons to pop-up dialog

10079483
viewdidload	viewdidappear
i have tried both versions of the code in my viewdidload and viewdidappear methods

10079485
width	height
you don t need declarations of width 100 or height 100 as div are already block elements and will fill their containers

10079510
bash	zsh
it works with bash or zsh though

10079522
chunked	transfer-encoding
according to the http specs if a non-identity transfer-encoding header is present then the message is considered to be chunked

10079584
implements	extends
then i have 2 other classes that extends the main class and implements runnable

10079585

window functions are available in a wide range of dbms oracle called analytical functions there microsoft sql server db2 called olap functions there postgresql teradata sybase vertica and partially in h2 database

10079687
crypt	hash
php s implementation of the crypt function will include it automatically in the resulting hash value so there is no problem where to store it but it should be generated correctly from a random source

10079694
cil	ildasm
the point is write it in c# then use the compiler and ildasm to show you the correct code that you would need for one parameter then you could write a routine to generate that cil for you which you would then plug into the .net profiling api to attach to any routine you want

10079746
salt	md5
md5 and sha with salt are the most widely used ones

10079801
ssl	spdy
also how would this function when the server does not support spdy and the channel falls back to a standard ssl connection

10079839

now in my projects i tend to have things like a virtualenv folder live in the root dir but you definitively shouldn t have apps at that level it just won t work

10079860
width	margin
the parent width is 960px with margin set to 0 auto to achieve a centered affect

10079878
width	height
to resize the image specify the width and height in the drawimage

10079895
free	malloc
the rule of thumb is that you need one free for every successful call to malloc and generally these occur in the reverse order

10079925
portrait	landscape
if my previous view is in portrait mode it works perfectly by rotating it to landscape but when i am in landscape mode it initially places the x y coordinates wrongly on device

10079936
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox

10079942
postgresql	mysql
postgresql with the optional hstore module might be better than mysql at this.

10079962
spaces	delimiter
when i split a string in python adjacent spaces delimiter are merged

10079979
free	malloc
if some of the members are complicated structs themselves they would in turn be allocated free with makewhatever and destroywhatever instead of malloc and free in the above two functions
