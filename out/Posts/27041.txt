21606637
put	get
i am trying to get a contact from the phone book and put the number in the edittext

21606646
width	height
if the method absolutely has to have parameters which somewhat defeats the purpose of using oop here since the shape s dimensions should be defined in the object and not passed in as parameters then you ve got to go with something and i guess width and height as good as anything though this excludes having the design work with a wide variety of shapes

21606679
put	get
i also want upon selection to take the date selected and get its tostring date representation put into the scrollviewer.content x name part_contenthost

for who says use 1 and 0 well pdo doesn t accept as boolean values the int 1 and 0 it needs real boolean

rss	feed
so i am using this great software called website-watcher which is rss feed reader and web content tracker

21607587
getter	setter
in the second case you ve defined a var which defaults to the internal scope since you didn t say public but that s another story which being externally visible implicitly defines a getter and setter

21607655
int	double
let us suppose i have twenty different classes each of one is very different from the other for example class 1 can be constructed with two double class 2 requires a double and two int class 3 can be constructed with two bool etc...

google-chrome	firefox
this works well in firefox but google-chrome seems to think that it is unsafe cross-site content drops the filter and outputs a warning to the console

21607965
int	chars
i tried the following code where i read the first chars in the string and stored it in a separate variable then tried to convert it to int but does not work

21607998
folder	directory
another solution would be to move the angular app folder to the directory root but it would be illogical to have a separate set of views header footer includes etc. for the ang.js app and for the rest of the codeigniter build

21608006
for-loop	arrays
also the indexing of your input and output arrays is incorrect in the for-loop should be i instead of 1

21608010
pandas	pytables
my first thought was to use pytables since i store various numerical data together with log line timestamp and log lines themselves in pandas anyway i could use table format iirc to store in pandas hdfstore use built-in pytables querying

google-chrome	firefox
this code works fine in google-chrome and firefox but in ie doesn t

21608256
filtering	grouping
the intent is to avoid multiple instances of the same store and applying filtering as this won t necessarily apply any changes to the grouping id and avoiding multiple stores as to keep the overhead of querying the server to single requests

21608298
int	boolean
boolean is a type of its own in c++ so you want the method to return bool and not int

for your specific issue the app delegate will always be the same instance just put a property in your app delegate.h file and assign to it the string you get when you run the method

21608847
put	get
for each item you get you ll have to copy the data into your objects and put them together into a collection say an array

textview	imageview
you can create a relativelayout or another viewgroup and into it insert an imageview as well as a textview

21609074
implements	extends
however while a class can extends only one superclass a class can implements any number of interfaces so method calls through an interface are more complicated

21609085
istream	getline
instead of using istream_iterator your best bet is probably to use the istream getline function

21609089
button	checkbox
however in case the captions span multiple lines which they do in my case this leads to the radio button checkbox no longer being aligned to the captions

21609119
put	get	post	get	post	put
i am in a process of designing apis to allow customers to manage their data using post put get

21609133
put	get
if you understand what thread safety means then you would be able to understand how it applies to get and put on your own

21609133
put	get
if you don t understand thread safety then there is no point to explain it specifically in relation to get and put

21609133
put	get
however answering your question anyway the fact that concurrenthashmap is thread safe means that if you have several threads executing put s on the same map at the same time then a no damage will occur to the internal data structures of the map and b some other thread doing a get will see all of the values put in by the other threads

21609210
overlapping	insets
the insets box shadow was actually overlapping the border and not letting it display

21609229
istream	getline
first you get the whole line with getline and then consider that line a source of std istringstream which essentially is a usual istream and split the input into words

21609263
int	chars
the problem is that will extract whatever int is in the input stream but will leave the following newline chars which is there from hitting enter after typing in the value

21609287
pull	push
then developera makes git pull --rebase and git push

21609298
geocoding	geocode
the long answer is that google has designed the geocode api such that the clients will not exhaust the request limit if you do client-side geocoding

21609333

filtering searching sorting and paging should all be done on the server side

qtimer	qdialog
anytime i close the modal qdialog before the qtimer is elapsed the modeless dialog is accesible

21609504
put	get
this will get you started however i will note that i think you need to tweak the input statement so the user does not have to put quotes in to not get an invalid syntax error

21609595

the example i post below is silly i could transform the item as i like and put it directly in the output queue but its mechanics are clear and reflect part of the concept i need to develop

superclass	subclassing
i want to override the function to_string in my superclass and all subclassing but i cannot get it to work because of an integer in the superclass

21609663
nsurlconnection	nsurlsession
alternatively you could also download the image using nsurlconnection or nsurlsession which wouldn t require the use of dispatch_asyn but using that is more involved but it gives more flexibility if you need to deal with more complex network situations such as error situation redirects authentication challenges etc

21609697
children	parent
each page will have the usual fields like title url etc but also they will have a field which tells me if it has any children p_has_children as well as a field which will tell me its parent page p_parent if it is a child of a page

21609840
post	get
there are ways to improve ux with this idea through javascript for example to validate if the textarea contains data if act paste or if there is a file in the file upload if act upload before allowing the post but you could also do this all server side if you don t want to get into js

21609888
put	get
now in your avcodecdescriptorwrapper you should get avcodecdescriptor object and put all information in the managedavcodecdescriptor object and pass it to c# class

21610045
division	multiplication
i have heard division takes more time then multiplication but beyond that i could not determine whether writing this in one line or multiple assignment lines was more efficient

21610046
percentile	max
the idea with the ramping feature was that you would enter an acceptable failed request ratio accepted fail ratio and a maximum acceptable response time max percentile response time for a given percentile of users percentile and then it would gradually ramp up the number of simultaneous users for as long as those limits weren t exceeded

21610238
stdout	stderr
a useful trick for debugging issues with scripts is to redirect stdout stderr to a file

21610253
setcontentview	findviewbyid
most problems with this not working appear to be related to not using setcontentview or not using findviewbyid before calling settext - but you can see i am doing both of those hopefully correctly

inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
another option is to provide a superclass that cannot be inherited from outside your assembly and create two subclassing from it one for each desired interface type

21610558
uipangesturerecognizer	uigesturerecognizer	uitapgesturerecognizer	uipangesturerecognizer	uitapgesturerecognizer	uigesturerecognizer
use a uigesturerecognizer such as a uitapgesturerecognizer or uipangesturerecognizer

21610559
superclass	subclassing
if a superclass has a constructor superclass int int int then that does not force a subclassing to have a constructor subclassing int int int

21610587
post	get
i ve been using this code to get other post to display in the end of the page as a list and those post should be in the same category as the post that a visitor is currently reading

21610609
hide	show
below is an ajax function i m trying to use to show a loader gif during the request and hide when successful

21610613
getter	setter
given that this isn t an nsobject subclass unless you are overwriting the getter setter methods i don t see the purpose of making it an property anymore since that is mostly useful for arc to help with your objects memory management

21610623
fadein	addclass
secondly you can chain jquery calls see below how fadein and addclass chained

21610627

21610692
children	parent
within the parent show view children can be created using nested forms

21610723
starttls	smtps
this isn t surprising given that smtps has been deprecated in favor of starttls for a number of reasons most of which have to do with seamless interoperability between new and old clients and servers

21610723
starttls	smtps
smtps has its own dedicated port and cannot optionally support starttls because starttls by definition requires the server to accept and respond to the opening ehlo and starttls commands before using ssl

21610723
starttls	smtps
smtps servers on traditional ports like 587 or 25 however have the option of supporting starttls should the server software support it and service administrator choose to enable it

21610723
starttls	smtps
the short version the smtpclient class supports starttls and not smtps over ssl smtps

21610723
starttls	smtps
ports 25 and 587 are used for regular smtps or smtps w starttls support when starttls is available optional

21610983
folder	directory
the user is then prompted to select another directory their time-stamped folder

21610983
folder	directory
if the string comes back that it exists then the script will then goto the move sub-routine to attempt to recursively move through the time-stamped directory that the user selected to move all .arc files into their media1 folder

21610996
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i tested on ie8 ie9 google-chrome firefox and opera

21611015
children	parent
for example if i have a parent entity and a children entity

21611015
children	parent
children are assigned to parent

21611015
children	parent
i can get a parent entity and have only the children with blonde hair and that are male

21611015
children	parent
i know i can just get all the children then filter them after i have the object but if i change the children assigned to the parent with the filtered results it messes up the inverse

21611019
client-side	server-side
what i usually do for simple cases when i need to share data between javascript client-side code and c# server-side code is create an aspx file that will recieve the javascript variables

21611043

post	put
after migrating from iis6 to iis7 all sites using a wcf odata service would prompt for credentials when attempting to make post put patch delete request

21611298
integer	unsigned
because a result that cannot be represented by the resulting unsigned integer type is

21611331
post	get
but when the grid post to get the results it doesn t send the data along with it

21611378
int	chars
since unsigned chars is a narrow type an unsigned chars operand to the + operator is promoted to int assuming int can hold all possible values in the range of unsigned chars

21611378
int	chars
the assignment implicitly converts the value 256 from int back to unsigned chars

21611378
int	chars
on such a system the promotion would be from unsigned chars to unsigned int

21611395
folder	directory
i need help creating a script that will go through a specified directory and rename folder that match a name

21611412
int	chars
there is a hidden promotion of c to int here and an int conversion from int to unsigned chars and it is perfectly defined

21611412
int	chars
and the conversion from int to signed chars is implementation-defined here see c99 6.3.1.3p3 on int conversions

21611448
fadein	fadeout
so it plays with fadein and stops with fadeout

21611454

i want to do is if i click send to excel button ...an excel save dialog will pop-up in order to save my filtered data to excel

21611496
switching	screens
ideally whenever i click the play button to switching to the loading screens this bubble image would rise up from the bottom to the top as a transition

21611502
nsstring	nsdata
i know there are a lot of posts about converting nsdata to nsstring nsdata to base64 encoded string generating hmac etc

21611516
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
ie10 and 11 google-chrome firefox and safari didn t have this problem at all so if you re getting intermittent customer reports of baskets suddenly being empty check the whole site for 404 s all it can take is one missing image to lose the session for ie9 and older ie s

21611523
fgetc	fread
see also speed comparison between fgetc fputc and fread fwrite in c

21611551
folder	directory
this code works perfectly for whatever directory i m currently in but what i want is to run a script from a parent folder which contains 11 child-folders

21611572
width	height
set the anchor s line-height to that of the div or set it to display block otherwise your width height values won t work

21611574
listview	gridview
you populated your data in a gridview and listview

21611618
for-loop	arrays
what i want to do is to use the for-loop in order to push all the functions to the calls arrays and then run async.parallel to run all the functions

21611618
for-loop	arrays
the problem is that the calls arrays looks like this after the for-loop finishes

21611637
subtract	add
but we can now add more characters to this negated character class that should be subtract from the set of valid characters

21611658
put	get
when you lookup something say an item to be put in a sales order we may want to get information like the item s price from the lookup so that it can be copied in to the sales order record

21611682

21611683
sudo	passwd
so echo passwd outputs passwd which is used as the standard input for sudo -s poweroff

21611683
sudo	passwd
the â s stdin option causes sudo to read the passwd from the standard input instead of the terminal device

21611683
sudo	passwd
it makes sudo to read passwd from stdin in this case is exactly the output of echo passwd

21611686
sudo	passwd
summed up after waiting 5 seconds give the passwd to sudo which executes poweroff

21611696
temporary	tablespace
this change should be only slightly less efficient than your original approach but should use significantly less temporary tablespace

21611696
temporary	tablespace
this should still perform well and use less temporary tablespace although it will be one helluva large sql statement

21611696
temporary	tablespace
note that the optimizer estimates it will use 262gb of temporary tablespace and the execution is pretty similar to yours

21611696
temporary	tablespace
replacing the single txn idq_lkp with multiple txn partition pxx idq_lkp reduces the maximum temporary tablespace estimate from 262g to 10g

21611696
temporary	tablespace
this example only contains 2 of the 25 partitions but adding more partitions does not increase the temporary tablespace required

21611750
uilabel	uitextview
calculating a lot of sizes of uilabel s or uitextview s is expensive so i wondered if there s a cheaper way than configuring a label or text view and then asking it for the size

21611750
uilabel	uitextview
turns out there is uilabel seems to be built up uikit s string additions for layout and drawing while uitextview uses text kit in ios 7

21611798
superclass	subclassing
your subclassing will then have to pass the appropriate template parameter to the superclass

21611852
equals	gethashcode
it uses the fact that anonymous types have equals and gethashcode defined by default

21611852
equals	gethashcode
because the equals and gethashcode methods on anonymous types are defined in terms of the equals and gethashcode methods of the properties two instances of the same anonymous type are equals only if all their properties are equals

21611869
width	height
so when the browser window is shrunken och expanded which will adjust the container with the blue border it ll resize all images to the width of said container the height of all images must remain the same at all times so that no text will look larger than the other

atexit	main
just remove the atexit at the start of main if you don t want that

21612286
width	height
by the way the real elements i m using are models of all different widths and height so simply using width or height across all the elements is not an easy solution

21612335
for-loop	loops
i also tried using a while loops reiteration of the for-loop

21612369
hash	md5
the final task is required to generate a md5 hash code of all the files names this hash is then written to a file in the same folder

21612542
minimum	max
i then set the minimum of the y axis to 0.1 and the max to something beyond the biggest bin

21612542
min	max
the code which sets the min max intervals on the axis is below

21612542
min	max
eta again i m thinking i could use a rangecolumn type of chart and specify the min and max y values for each bin

21612544
portrait	landscape
i can move between portrait and landscape no problem and i can even save some of the data

21612544
portrait	landscape
i cannot debug this because it wont debug on my phone and my emulator when i switch between portrait and landscape the emulator does not do anything

21612560
portrait	landscape
in portrait no text or icon appears or at least they aren t visible in the top bit but in landscape they do

21612575
width	height
then use positive relative position absolute and align-items strech to create a container of correct width but auto height

21612581
width	height
in html when you have an image and it s set to 100 width the height of this element automatically stays proportionate

21612652
comparator	comparable
in this example i m comparing the fruit objects on the basis of fruitname using comparable comparator method and quantity here by using comparator if you want this object to be compare using fruitdesc then create one more static innerclass as i did for fruitname

21612660
comparator	comparable
using comparator means that you are using the comparable interface which defines only one natural order for your class

21612696
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception	classcastexception	runtimeexception
because classcastexception is an unchecked-exception since extends from runtimeexception

21612696
classcastexception	runtimeexception
classcastexception ---is-a-- runtimeexception another example of a possible legal cast

21612702
put	get
i still get the error even if i put in the code

the items are children of a common parent and it applies to all the children of that parent root item

21612838
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
the reason i included this particular block of code is because my script renders just fine in google-chrome firefox ie11 safari and even the stock android browser

21612842
opera	firefox
what happens is that the two lines of text align with their respective baselines to each other tested in opera and firefox

21612842

21612895
width	height
but i would need to do some math to make the border width and offset exactly half the width or height of the image

21612929
qevent	qgraphicsview
basically that s not working because of special nature of qgraphicsview -- it always translates event of type qevent mousebuttonrelease to it s special qevent graphicsscenemouserelease type and sends it to it s mouse grabbers mentioned previously but even if there isn t any of those mouse grabbers it still sets graphicsscenemouserelease event as accepted and thus mousebuttonrelease also becomes accepted so in the end it s never being sent to further eventfilter s

floating-point	integer
the error is not minuscule the error in representing an integer by a floating-point if error there is is at least one

21616042
floating-point	integer
if your compiler offers ieee 754 the floating-point standard implemented exactly by the sse2 instructions of modern and not so modern intel processors semantics then any + - and sqrt operation that results in a number exactly representable as floating-point is guaranteed to produce that result but if several of the operations you apply do not have exactly representable results the floating-point computation may drift away from the mathematical computation even when the final result is an integer and is exactly representable

21616042
floating-point	integer
then you may end up with a floating-point result slightly above the target integer and cause ceil to return something other than you would have obtained with exact mathematical computations

21616069
required	placeholder
when placeholder is used for a non-multi-value select box it required that you include an empty tag as your first option

google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
this is working well for me in google-chrome safari and after a small padding tweak here firefox as well

21628302
textarea	pre
the key to this technique is to make sure that the pre element exactly mirrors the textarea s behavior - not only in size but also in font characteristics and wrapping points

21628302
textarea	pre
the textarea s content is in red while the pre s content is in blue

21628302
textarea	pre
ideally the textarea s content would sit directly on top of the pre s content and only allow us to see red text

google-chrome	safari
this works great in google-chrome safari but as you start playing around in ie the text gets out of sync after the first wrapping point or so

21628302

we only see the blue pre text on we because the textarea content has already wrapped

exif	xmp
from what i ve found so far there should be ways to add tags to my image file using either xmp or exif data to store extra strings but they seem to be quite long-winded i was considering just making a custom data type that would hold an image and an array of strings for the tags but this doesn t seem logical if there is already a specific structure within the image to store such metadata

hash	md5
my rails application has some files which are excluded from the rails asset pipeline so do not have an md5 hash in the name of the file

21634965
hash	md5

the user can enter upto 6 lines in format string double int int

21635069
int	double
the error check i want is say if the int the user enters is below 0 or above 100 it should provide an error and if the double is below 0 it should provide an error and also if the string does not match

21635075
int	double
in fahrenheit - 32 fahrenheit is a double and 32 is an int so the 32 gets promoted to a double and the result is a double

21635075
int	double
fahrenheit - 32 is a double see above and 5 is an int so the 5 gets promoted to a double and the resulting multiplication is a double

21635075
int	double
now is a double as we saw above and 9 is an int so the 9 gets promoted and we end up with double-precision floating-point division

2 then find the p and q based on min max comparison

21637727
min	max
then take care of q- min or q - max records

21637727
min	max
then check the min and max index .in this case min as 0 max as 3 obivously any one of the would match with currentindex which ever used to loop

21637727
min	max
rather than start the hole process from index 1 save this number position 2 3 2 then start same process from currentindex assume min and max as a currentindex as we did while starting

21637751
int	chars
also string#charat int expects an index of a chars within the string not the chars itself chatat temp1 is incorrect so your method will not work as expected even if you fix the former problem

21637754
google-chrome	safari
so it looks like this issue is related to the maximum length allowed by an input div in google-chrome and safari webkit browsers

this met all of my needs regarding height issues but i have no idea what the best solution is for getting the divs to switch to more of a float method of dropping to the next row when they each convert to a width of 50 for tablet since the display table

21638515
profiling	debugging
you should look at what s happening by using debugging and profiling tools

21638535

there is no reason to use volatile if your property is atomic and you always go through the setter getter

21638567
post	get
my android app uses php to get the post from this table

21638584

i have a uiscrollview with a uiview subviews which has a uitableview subviews

width	height
in drawimage you need to adjust for half the desired image width height because you ve already translated to where you want the center of the image to be

21638859
width	margin
my solution was to declare position relative and set negative margin values roughly equal to 50 of the element s width but the closest i ve been able to come is to half the element s percentage of its parent s width

21638876
post	get
i ve read dozens of related post but i still can t get this to work

i also need to be able to drag a draggable from one droppable to another

21639020
draggable	droppable
if you drag two items onto the first left-most droppable container and then drag the bottom one up to the top to re-sort them you ll notice an animation coming from the source draggable up top

21639020
draggable	droppable
with the two items on the first left-most droppable container if you try and drag one of the items over to the middle droppable you see it revert again animate back from the source draggable up top

21639020
draggable	droppable
otherwise if the draggable has been dropped has the class dropped and changed droppable i won t re-clone it but append it to the new droppable

21639025
put	get
i have an array of objects and i want to get all the ids of those objects and put them in an array

21639026
int	boolean

21639028
min	max
then map min and max to the list

21639053
queue	fifo
no amazon sqs does not guarantee fifo access to messages in amazon sqs queue mainly because of the distributed nature of the amazon sqs

21639059
width	height
keyword objectboundingbox should not be used when the geometry of the applicable element has no width or no height such as the case of a horizontal or vertical line even when the line has actual thickness when viewed due to having a non-zero stroke width since stroke width is ignored for bounding box calculations

21639059

it consists of some checkbox with printer names and a button that initiates the install

21639188
filtering	grouping
i would apply separate filtering to each route grouping then specify error handling events in each filtering

21639189

or even better if you store the width and height parameters in a class say .shadowbox_modif class.

21639215
post	get
so here s what happens it comes to trying to do something and then nothing happens and the done doesn t get echoed that means there s something wrong with curl i don t really know what is up with curl so i thought i would post here

use an editor like vim or notepad++ where you can inspect the bytes and actually see whether your stuff is correct or not

21639309
mojolicious	catalyst
i would recommend using cgi.pm to generate your response headers or even better a modern web framework like catalyst dancer or mojolicious

21639333
nsoutputstream	nsrunloop
using nsinputstream and nsoutputstream abstractions as opposed to creating a new thread and calling the standard unix functions socket bind listen accept send recv allows one to easily receive network events in the same nsrunloop as the rest of the run-loop based apis on osx

21639335
pull	push
if you do not wish to respond then you need to choose some other socket pair than req rep - ex push pull or maybe look at xreq xrep router dealer if you wish to handle multiple requests at the same time

when you use the key word union to join 2 queries it will automatically call a distinct operation to join only unique data from both queries

21641159

setinterval	clearinterval
the id value returned by setinterval is used as the parameter for the clearinterval method

bash	zsh
below is a more robust solution that works in zsh as well as in bash plus a solution for posix-compatible shells

21642150
bash	zsh
assuming you re using bash or zsh

21642150

21642426
gridview	datalist
it s quite complicated when you are using runat server controls like gridview and datalist etc

21642446
children	parent
i basically wrap all the strings in tags as they don t cause any forced styling by browser or css of course unless you have default styling for span s and they allow you to itterate over the children of the parent para1 element and determine if you should use the .val function or just the normal .text function to get the data to build up your string

ubuntu	linux
i m using ubuntu linux so of course it s a bash console

21642761
for-loop	loops
the first for-loop is generating 5 functions each of them creates a closure which captures the i as 5 last value of 5 for that loops after last increment so they all render out 5 it just shows in chrome as the first 5 with 5 in a circle next to it meaning the same value was logged out 5 times

21642854
cos	sin
on the xy plane a typical 2d view if you draw a circle with radius r any point on the circle at angle theta can be given by p r cos theta r sin theta

21643561
hex	binary
at this point i m about to either fire up wireshark and figure out how to filter for the packets that i m sending or implement a really simple tcp server that waits for connections spits the transmitted binary to disk maybe processed to hex and then test that i m sending what i expect to send

keydown	keyup
try using a keyup event instead as the keydown fires constantly and keyup fires once.

21644762
int	chars
and finally since you are converting only one letter to an int to best solution is to convert them to chars and for the values between a and d to do

21644812
noexcept	throw
well it s all fine and good to declare it noexcept but it requires that you can guarantee that it won t throw an exception and for portable code in all it s implementations

21645928
int	chars
also in the first case the code where you use getc c should be int - you can have an infinite loop if the target platform uses unsigned chars because c will always be converted to a positive int again only in platforms with unsigned chars and thus will never be equal to eof

21645928
int	chars
if you check the manpages for getc and putc and other functions that deal with a chars you will see that they receive int not chars

children	parent
there s an easy rule-of-thumb that you could apply in a validator if there are no element children and there is a sequence or choice or all with then this is assumed to be the reason why the content of the parent is valid

21648133
int	boolean
you are trying to compare an int and a boolean as the ide is telling you

21648173
inherited	properties
this would be a great place for you to inherited from the form class and add your own properties and methods to make the behavior uniform across all of your forms

21648197
getter	setter
one alternative would be to use a getter setter methods

21648259

instead of the you will be passing your post or get parameter there

21648677
width	height
the width or height for vertically spaced views of the spacers are set to be equal

21648682
int	double
so casts 10 to int and then multiplies it by xi which is a double again

21648682
int	double
an int multiplied by a double is a double. you could fix it by wrapping the expression in brackets but it should still be rounded so making a helper function is a good idea to reduce clutter

21648693
ienumerable	icollection
so i would have thought my query would work since icollection implements ienumerable

21648727

if id is the dynamic querystring which you are expecting to the action then at the end of action execution when onactionexecuting is called id will be accessed in the action-filter using routedata

21649601
getter	setter
my answer assumes you know the difference between class and instance methods and focuses on the difference between creating a property versus creating an instance variable with an associate setter and getter

21649601
getter	setter
a property is merely a convenient way of creating three things at the same time an instance variable a setter and a getter

21649604
accessor	properties
properties is a shorthand notation for creating an instance variable and associated accessor methods with defined access modification criteria

21649617

put	get
the interesting thing is that when i put my phone in airplane mode i get a result code equal to 2 which is smsmanager.result_error_radio_off

21649807
stdout	stderr
this gives you access to stdout and stderr as streams which means that you can work with the data as it comes out rather than only once it is finished

21649810
noexcept	throw
that is in a quality implementation and it does not take heroics to create a quality implementation in this regard not only will the copy members of exception types not throw an exception naturally because they are marked noexcept they also will not call terminate

21649822
stdout	stderr
i realize that the files dev stdout and dev stderr do not exist on an unrooted android device

21649832

note if you do not want that question mark at the end then make a post instead of get

21650060
express	node.js
i have created a simple node.js app with express and i run it locally

21650162
apache	nginx
it does this by looking at the typical http header that remote proxies like apache and nginx add into the http header x-forwarded-for and use the user s ip address it finds there

21650162
apache	nginx
this is often means have the reverse proxy like nginx or apache handle all your incoming traffic and have your application that actually uses proxyfix safe behind a firewall

as far as how many threads are useful from a performance standpoint as you said it depends on the number of available processors and on whether the task is io or cpu bound

21650310
for-loop	loops
the parsing function works no problem now i did switch back to using a for-loop instead of a while loops on the second loop.

the height is weird though at 768 there s about a 10px margin below

21650889
put	get
and on model s __init__ get the connection from where it has been stored and put it in an instance variable this is what i thought to be the best approach but have no idea of the best spot to store that connection object

21650906
width	height
but the wp_get_attachment_image_src returns an array containing the image attributes url width and height of an attachment file

21650907
children	parent
i will create a parent object in an initial call and send an asynchronous call to an api which fetches children information based on the child s name

21650907
children	parent
while that async call is out i return the parent as is because the user doesn t need to see the children s information immediately

21650916
width	height
basically you apply a corner radius equal to 1 2 the width width height on a square image

for-loop	arrays
i m trying to define a 2d arrays inside a for-loop

21651349
realloc	malloc
casting malloc and realloc is never good in c

21651379
mouseup	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown
like i said in comment the best way of doing this kind of behaviour is by using the events mouseup mousedown and mousemove

21651379
mouseup	mousedown
i defined a var named ismousedown to know that the ship is dragged that i set to true on mousedown and false on mouseup

21651433
mousehover	mouseleave
thanks for all the solutions but none had the desired effect but i have come up with a solution using mousehover and mouseleave

21651438
put	get
any time you run a map you must always get the same result if you put the same record into it

21651512
prepare	execute
to execute the prepare statement and supply values for the bind variables you d do something like this

21651512
prepare	execute
so the prepare would be done before your loop the execute can be done inside the loop

21651543
implements	extends
so i ve made two tabs so far in mainactivity which extends fragmentactivity and implements actionbar.tablistener

21651544
getter	setter
you re accessing the property in getter and setter

21651643

21651683
post	get
i need to query with http post request to get a 0 indicating incorrect user info or anything else to indicate the user can successful log in

21652248
int	chars
the concatenation isn t working probably because both operands in this case are chars int

21652285

as an alternative i then considered differentiating according to request method using put for json and post for files

21652290
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
also amazon-web-services differentiates between elastic beanstalk cli 2.6 and 3.1 by the former using lowercase eb and the latter using uppercase eb

21652320
google-chrome	firefox
this is the case in both google-chrome and firefox which would imply either intended undocumented functionality or a poorly implemented specification

21652352

21652613
getter	setter
i tried this after realising i hadn t created a getter or setter for the arraylist

21652636
typedef	struct
drop the struct and include stdio.h to get the typedef

21652639

our workflow is that we work on each of our own branches and every time someone finishes their work they push it and send a pull request

21652644
post	put
unified methods put is put regardless of content-type post is always post

21652666
superclass	subclassing
in order to make this work you have to reconstruct your superclass and subclassing a little

21652668
implements	extends
for this you need to extends objectwritable and to implements writablecomparable

21652777
width	height
you can however perform a media-type query for dpi along with height and width

21652851
mp3	wav
i m trying to associate multiple music-extensions with my program mp3 wav etc etc

21652853
packets	multicast
my experience with the sony google tv is that the multicast packets are reliably sent out shortly after the box is started

21652892
pull	push
this works well in xcode however i see green lights next to the repo during a pull but red lights next to the repo during a push this might be a bug in xcode 5.1 beta but it works without complaint and without the need for a password which is great if you use jenkins to do your release builds

21652909
width	height	background-position	background-size
other than that just been playing around with height width background-size and background-position to see if i can get the golden ratio but so far no luck

21652918
width	height
i set the width the height the leading space and the top space to superview so this should not be the issue but i might be mistaken

21652932
folder	directory
first problem is that my boolean is giving false as answer directory exists for sure and all permissions are granted to see folder

21652943
submit	submission
everything with the exception of the modelthree collection submit on the form submission

21652944
int	chars
i intentionally made the string 4 chars so in the average scenario it will have the same number of bytes as the integer. this will dereference the memory where str is stored and give you the value if it was an int 522207554 if i did the conversion right

21652958
for-loop	arrays
you can use a for-loop but you can t use arrays methods on them or htmlcollections because they do not inherit from the arrays object

21652983
fileoutputstream	filewriter
instead of outputstreamwriter and fileoutputstream consider using filewriter

21653002
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox display fine

21653021
width	height
then i ll have a constructor which initializes the vertices array inside of the glfloatwithsize relative to the length width and height fields and sets the size of that object to sizeof vertices

21653046
width	height
you can edit the width and height in the url string and fields to change how it looks

21653092
uilabel	uibutton
have a reference to a view a uilabel uibutton etc

21653102
daemons	systemd
systemd cleans up the firewall rules for us making sure to remove them when the daemons isn t running

21653103
express	node.js
i m writing my first node.js app using express and mongoose

21653119
prepare	execute
you have to keep in mind that you want a complete prepare and execute process in term of security you have to pass each parameter separately

21653145
awt	swing
was noted in painting in awt and swing the paint methods swing programs should override paintcomponent . moreover you need to invoke super.paintcomponent as shown here to avoid visual artifacts

21653188
post	get
currently your server is redirecting on both get and post requests

21653188
post	get
change your servlet implementation so that the post sends a redirect but the get actually serves up a normal 200 response with html ajax etc

21653220
folder	directory
but when i browse the loaded archive the child files and folder are still hosted in the parent directory

21653226
pull	push
this works well in xcode however i see green lights next to the repo during a pull but red lights next to the repo during a push this might be a bug in xcode 5.1 beta but it works without complaint and without the need for a password which is great if you use jenkins to do your release builds

21653240
int	double
the problem is that you re comparing a int value with double values

21653311
mouseover	mouseleave
with mouseover on the header i would like to stop the animation and see the linked text and on mouseleave of all the box restart the animation

21653324

however there is a work-around to hide the outline if you know the background-color of the parent element

21653416
post	get
i m trying to pass the header type custom_post_type_slug in order to get the data of a custom post type and can t get that to work either

21653452
initializer	class-method
class-method are stored independent of the initializer objects and interaction with an object is actually just interaction with the interface that the object implements

21653483
width	height
can someone please tell in this code how to declare the constructor such that when the object is instantiated height is initialized with passed value while width is always default 2 in the case below

21653485
spaces	delimiter
in your example if you are sure that fields are delimiter by spaces you can use python s csv module and set the delimiter to spaces and parse the lines

21653513
width	height
it sounds like you want to completely ignore the width argument and just make the width 2 while the height is optional and defaults to 1

21653513
width	height
2 arguments first goes to width and the second goes to height

21653513
width	height
1 argument which goes to height and width becomes 2

21653513
width	height
0 arguments width becomes 2 height becomes 1

21653564
hash	md5
i ve started working on a new web project and this time i thought i would put some more thought into how i handle user authentication previously only working with md5 hash passwords

21653564
ssl	https
i know a lot of people will want to say that https ssl is the only way to accomplish a secure site and i hear you but since this project isn t supposed to have more than a handful users all created manually by me and there will be no secure information like financial transactions or other sensitive data exchanged i only want to have a reasonable means of protecting the password data during login

21653598
noexcept	throw
as pointed out by scott meyers on 00.34.45 only if a class s move functions are declared non throw preferably with noexcept and only then vector push_back can use move semantics

21653617
width	height
not sure how this will work if you give exact dimensions but it should work if you set width height to match parent

21653677
int	chars
so instead i looked into the chars class to see if it provided methods for retrieving an ordinal value -- or unicode index or numeric value -- which could be returned for a starting letter such a a in a unicode block and category which could then be added to an int producing a result used to look up the chars required using another method which would return a chars given a valid int value where valid is dependent on the unicode encoding

21653677
int	chars
because chars is considered an int type -- and the only unsigned int in the language -- it is subject to the same conversions even though a chars is not a number and other issues crop up

21653685
chown	sudo
if you are running as user ubuntu you can do sudo chown ubuntu

21653718
dictionary	map
upon further investigation it should be noted that there is a _mainthread instance is stored in _active _active and _limbo are both dictionary that map thread names to their instances

21653735
i2c	spi
ideally i am looking for a bluetooth module that support a2dp 24 bit if available and avrcp 1.3 or higher with a uart or spi or i2c interface where i can send it play pause next prev commands to control the music player and request artist album track name elapsed time track length metadata

21653810
int	chars
it builds a simple gui creates a new printstream and outputstream which overrides write int b to append a chars to the jtextarea uses system.setout printstream then system.out.println string to test it out

21653836
getter	setter
i want to set a flag when any update made to my database add del edit in android.i have done this by creating a getter and setter in my database adapter class

21653841
getter	setter
there is a third approach - making a static variable at the level of the translation unit and adding two separate functions - one for getter and one for setter

21653843
move	drag
i can zoom and drag individual chart independent of other charts but i would like to have other charts move or zoom together with the chart on which navigation action is applied

21653854
int	chars
so i m looking for input of type int but i noticed when running a program that if a chars input is received not sure about string that it is converted to int i read in my textbook that this is normal c++ behavior

21653863
ssl	https
first i found that for google analytics to use ssl it has to send all data to the https version of google s server

21653868
noexcept	throw
before n3025 wasn t specified with noexcept but its description did contain a throw nothing

21653877
mongodb	bson
yes it can be used that way but the sole reason for it s existence is to overcome the 16mb limitation mongodb has on bson document storage

21653877
mongodb	bson
there is no magic that occurs on the server side at all as far as internal operations to mongodb are concerned this is just another bson document with fields and data

21653888
vmware	virtualbox	virtualbox	parallels
popular vm runners are virtualbox parallels and vmware - google them up

21653927
salt	md5
perhaps you can consider creating a random salt on the client side with say md5 or some other supported techniques

21653971
for-loop	loops
think of a for-loop as a little anonymous function that takes loops index value as a parameter

21653971
for-loop	loops
in some languages particularly scheme and who knows maybe java 8 or 9 the compiler is guaranteed to compile a recursive function such as the function loops above just the same as it compiles the for-loop above

21653981
bower	npm
lodash has a memoize function and the latest version of lodash also includes a chunk function so we can create this filter very simply using npm modules and compiling the script with bower or webpack

21653993
mvp	presenter
my understanding of mvp is that you would want your presenter to talk with your view through a separate interface

21653993
invokelater	invokeandwait
also just fyi you can always call out to eventqueue.isdispatchthread to check before you make any calls to invokelater or invokeandwait

21653993
invokelater	invokeandwait
invokelater won t hurt anything to call it from the edt but invokeandwait would throw an exception

21654006
client-side	server-side
although you don t really want to be mingling server-side and client-side code to the extent you are either putting any java code within a javascript function

21654035
folder	directory
i have successfully achieved this by setting up separate directory in tomcat for different clients and then creating soft-links to the main application within that folder

21654059
rss	feed
i am trying to grab a piece of information about the length of a mp3 file from an rss feed

21654067
mouseup	mousedown
a click is defined as a mousedown and mouseup

21654080
children	parent
also when calculating width of children you have to account for the parent s padding which you haven t

21654080
children	parent
if you add up the total width of children it is equal to the width of parent 620 so by calculation there isn t enough space in parent div for both of them to stack side by side

21654086
int	double
because the arrays are of type int but the average-method requires a double array

21654161
children	parent
you ll only need to have a strong reference to the root level objects of the ui anything below this can be weak as the parent objects will own their children

21654179
exponent	addition
when performing the repeated addition there are 9 roundings taking place the first result a+a is always exactly representable but after that further additions are inexact since the base-2 exponent of the addends are not equal

21654189
public	protected
there you will learn that only public and protected class member methods properties can be overridden private ones cannot

21654189
public	protected
as a good example try changing the visibility of the bar testprivate method to either public or protected without altering anything else in your example code

21654196
public	protected
btw overriding a method and just calling the super -version of this method does not really make sense as long as you are not increase the visibility from protected to public or so...

21654207
16-bit	64bit
both compiled as 64bit running on 64bit native platform lp64 short 16-bit int 32-bit long 64bit pointers 64bit

21654207
for-loop	loops
this is because compiler performs some loops unrolling oddly it does not unroll the for-loop and performs the summing using mmx registers.

21654212
qtreewidget	qabstractitemmodel
what you are saving is a generic qabstractitemmodel - after all a qtreewidget is a view and has a built-in model

21654224
multiplying	add
i can not figure out how to multiplying by an odd number i know i need to multiplying to get as close as i can an add 1 but i dont cant figure out how to do that

21654259
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
it displays properly in firefox opera and ie but not in google-chrome

21654334

all this is assuming that the str pointer is to already allocated memory with malloc calloc strdup

21654362
inherited	properties
javascript inherited and the constructor properties

21654387
width	height
the approach i ve recently used was making any position relative to my skscene width and height

21654420
width	height
to make your updating and layout code straightforward once you calculate the new positions for these leaves make sure you save the x y dx width and dy height values in their respective data objects over-writing the position and size created by the partition layout

21654434
versioning	upgrade
i ll admit that i m not sure if it ensures all the versioning are compatible but sbt-updates will tell you which dot minor and major versioning upgrade are available for your dependencies

21654451
for-loop	loops
because y is not updated in loops which will make the second for-loop always true run forever

21654463
getter	setter
the name property in namecontroller is simple with a variable of type string a getter and a setter just how you would expect

21654480
min	max
i believe there should be a way to solve this using a max flow min cut algorithm

21654481
fgets	fseek
also it looks like you need to use fseek or rewind before the successive calls to fgets

21654481
strstr	strcmp
now using gdb i found out that your first segmentation fault happens on line 18 in strcmp because strstr returns null if the sequence is not found in buff

21654481
strstr	strcmp
you need to move strstr out of the parameters to strcmp and check for null before passing the result to strcmp

21654594
put	get
i want to use put and get helper functions for my bimap

21654601
put	get

21654673
stdout	stderr
i m trying to capture both stderr and stdout to a variable using the following code

payload is chars datatype and other members of the structures are int

21654684
int	chars
so convert the int to chars and then write into write.txt

21654689
distance	polygons
so what you need to calculate is a polygons that is a certain padding distance larger than the convex hull polygons on all sides

21654689
distance	polygons
for each vertex in your convex hull calculate a point that is padding distance farther away from the center of the polygons

21654725

i checked the password and the password in the database right away with by using the if statement and put the inside the if statement in order for me to get access to and change the password

21654749
hide	show
you can show so probably you can hide

21654759
printf	fgets
you want to write text data which is usually done with fscanf or fgets for input and printf for output

21654775
int	chars
the part i don t understand is that was assigned to the variable defined as int and so that got me confused on where my content went which was a chars

21654781

you should not rely on ordering of stdout and stderr

21654795
let	curry
first let s looks at what curry and autocurry actually do

21654820
width	height
the only difference is that the width and height of things on the mobile version is set to auto

21654850

by doing this it s basically a one-time setup except when it s time to upgrade the jdk or tomcat jetty versioning and then you ll need to re-upload to blob storage

21654858
namedtuple	dictionary
the namedtuple uses just under a tenth as much memory as the dictionary

21654932

21655178
integer	unsigned
integer arguments which are no larger than int are converted to possibly unsigned int

21655183
strstr	strcmp
the strstr strcmp is confused you probably just want strcmp or maybe just strstr

21655219
versioning	upgrade
upgrade ie browser to the latest versioning

21655240
spaces	delimiter
in this example i added extra spaces around the delimiter but it doesn t really matter either way

ubuntu	debian
other modern versions of debian and ubuntu specify utf-8 as a default and this avoids problems when languages fall back to operating-system character encoding for reading input

21655345
cpu	processors
like mentioned before cpu s give time slices to each processors and you are subject to the jit doing optimizations but more likely at 4 threads the cpu is able to balance both time slices and thread context switching at an optimum rate for your program

21655360
post	get
you can also just change form to post method by default a form will use get

21655436
int	chars
chars inputs thru std cin do not convert to int

21655436
int	chars
the conversion attempt stops converting digit s into part of the int at the first non-digit chars

comparator	comparable
violations in our comparable s comparator method -

21659020
comparator	comparable
2 treeset is self balancing tree.what that means is that what you consider objects as equals may not be used by treeset for comparing as it keeps on adding objects.treeset will traverse the tree in a specific order as defined by comparable or comparator and keep traversing between the nodes according to the value returned by comparator -1 0 1 .hence it is highly possible that your equals objects are not even encountered for comparison while adding an element.note treeset is not a ordinary sequential traversal like a list or an array but a tree traversal

21659020
equals	compareto
to solve the issues you need to be sure that your compareto var var method follows the equals contract of object

21659029
range	max	range	min	min	max
to check if the min and max date are within date range of your choosing using the second example add where condition at the end if i understood correctly

i m using a container div which is set to scale while keeping its height relative to its width using this approach

21659197
width	height
from your snippet it looks like you re not assigning the text element a size either explicitly or via anchoring so it has a width height of 0 0 which means it will never contain the mouse cursor

21659197
width	height
an item without explicit width height attributes or anchoring will have a size of 0 0 no matter how it appears on screen

metaclass	superclass
when deciding the metaclass of a class without an explicitly specified one as in the case of your c python examines the metaclass of all the superclass direct and indirect of the class being created and picks the one metaclass which is a subtype of all the metaclass of the superclass of the class being created

21659408

in your example metaclass2 is that one metaclass which inherits from all the metaclass of c s superclass

the behavior sounds to me like you want the rectangle to resize horizontally when you drag on the far left of right of it and to move around on the canvas when you drag anywhere else on it please correct me if this is wrong

21664611
width	height
once you have each action drag or resize managed by a distinct gesture you should just be able to update the size of the rectangle by either directly changing its height and width values or by using a scaletransform

21665561
for-loop	loops
a for-loop indeed serves well for the intended purpose although you could also use a while loops and an iterator.

21665568
put	get
alternatively you can also put a default value for your ali so you get at least some output

floating-point	fixed-point
you should try a format like rgba 10 10 10 2 fixed-point or rgb 11 11 10 floating-point to store your normals if rgba8 is actually inadequate and then with the space you saved you could afford a 32-bit floating-point depth buffer

21665855
floating-point	fixed-point
right off the bat by using a floating-point format to store your depth you lose 1-bit of precision because it has to store a rather meaningless sign bit fixed-point depth buffers do not

int	chars
for the first number parse the first string in the from the 2nd chars at index 1 not 2 onwards into an int

21666155
getter	setter
i see that you already provide direct access to the data with your getter and setter so you might as well make the data public

21666166
min	max
first add 4 values to a list min price max price average price and threshold

21666166
min	max
depending on your data you can always chose to find a threshold based on 20 of the average of min value max value and a new number min+max+new 2 0 2 you can change this calculation if the difference should ever change

21666202

it repeats the whole block of code regardless of how i answer and ignores the cout and cin statements causing it to give me errors when it evaluates v1

21666622
sin	sqrt	cos	sqrt	cos	sin
for example if the time is mostly spent in sqrt cos and sin that already is native code and you won t get much faster

21666622
free	malloc
for example a c translation of this might be faster due to manual heap management malloc and free rather than garbage collection

21666671
superclass	subclassing
if you want to avoid multiple instanceof checks you could have dog cat and mouse derive from the common superclass mammal which itself would be a subclassing of animal

you should not throw in asynchronous code since a try-catch cannot be used to catch the error leading to uncaught exception-handling

21666718
google-chrome	safari
this trick is reported to work at least android based browsers iphone safari ipad safari ipad google-chrome

21666723
superclass	subclassing
instead of the instanceof checks i d recommend adding a polymorphic method in the superclass and overriding it in all subclassing so that you could later call it without needing to care what type the actual object is

21666724
google-chrome	firefox
not sure about what you are willing to do with this code but it actually restricts google-chrome to visit 2.php the reason firefox is able to redirect is you don t test it for firefox

21666782
awt	swing
painting in awt and swing

21666791

another problem might be if you have a 64bit computer you may have the older version installed to one program files but eclipse is looking through the x86 program files and not finding the correct version or vice-versa

21666844
int	double
if the result is going to be a float or a double then it is better to convert the int into a float or double before performing the division eg 25 10.0 10 will be ok because the compiler will do floating point operations

21666880
fadein	hide	hide	show
oddly when running any show hide fadein etc an iframe is created at the base of the page just before the body

21666899

the width of this picture should be 500px but the height can vary so distortion doesn t occur

21666928
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
in safari 7 google-chrome 32 and firefox 26 storing this inside a variable seems to run slightly slower than not storing it

21666928
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
in google-chrome and firefox storing a boolean object and then referencing the value of that variable later seemed to run a bit faster than writing true or false every time in theory creating a new boolean object every time. but in safari the opposite appeared to be true

21666928
google-chrome	firefox
was a bit faster in firefox and google-chrome than

21666933

21667076
subtraction	addition
prefix will perform the addition subtraction before executing the current statement of code

21667077

21667187
free	malloc
it is left to the programmer to understand that the pointer is allocated with malloc and is expected to be released to the memory manager by a call to free

21667187
free	malloc
to release it even though what it actually does is little more than malloc and free but by having you call these functions they provide a well-defined and clear api which assumes responsibility for knowing such things

21667231
min	max
you can use max and min though it s not necessarily as clear

21667245
width	font-size
one thing i want to point out is that if you try to multiply an empty string by a number for example if you use style.fontsize where there are no inline styles and multiply that which is now an empty string by an integer such as your screen width which in this case is 768 it will output 0 which would set your font-size to 0 thus making it disappear

21667252
puts	gets
so far my script is working fine basically it gets all htm files out puts results however im using dom to get the html title tag from each file that s where im not get to get it in the random array

21667259

21667468
put	get
put and get functions are for generic-ness

21667477
mouse	keyboard
on the other hand if you can safely remove the keyboard and mouse you re able to simply use the built-in full-screen mode in safari as of os x lion to achieve what you re looking for

21667549
put	get
i was thinking if i was able to put all variable names and values into one array to send it as query for sql there must be a way to get them back from that array to original state

21667556
google-chrome	firefox
this responsive page and similar works fine in google-chrome an firefox but it does not work properly when viewed in ie when the browser windows is made small

21667557

21667721
free	malloc
i m guessing gsl_odeiv_step_alloc and gsl_odeiv_step_free are similar to malloc and free

21667760
cout	cin
if you want to ask for multiple input it might sometimes be best to do it with separate cout and cin statements

21667772
min	max
min and max of a bunch of numbers unlike sum is not a linear form and i don t think cplex or milp generally has a special form for this

21667772
sequence	permutation
in this particular example a smaller number of binary auxiliary variables might be enough instead of but in general a permutation variable like this gives you the order of a sequence of numbers and allows you to pick any of them by rank in your case the largest item

21667798
put	get
1 using import-export wizard this will do is get the data from source for you will be access and put it in destination database which will be sql server

21667801
filtering	grouping
so i m having issues testing an angular filtering that takes an array that has previously been sorted by a grouping property

21667811
hash	salt
this is even still true if you add a salt to the hash

21667811
scrypt	pbkdf2
an indication that the password code is maybe ok and modern enough is when it uses stuff like pbkdf2 bcrypt scrypt sha512-crypt internally

21667815
java.util.calendar	java.util.date
especially with java.util.calendar and java.util.date â if ever there were a case for imports it would be those two classes

21667848
google-chrome	firefox
after clearing all cache browser and java punching holes through my firewall even disabling it to see if that would resolve it as well as running things as administrator verifying java was installed and running in all my browsers it failed in ie google-chrome and firefox

21667891
put	get
i have a aspx page and there is a form in it i get the user input and then in a script i add those inputs in a sentence and put it in a string now i want to show the final string in a textbox or any same asp container which i can call it from codebehind

21667905
google-chrome	firefox
i have tested this with windows 7 and ubuntu in both google-chrome and firefox

21667949
yeoman	package.json
basically clone the yeoman repo and edit the package.json to remove the post install call to doctor.js

21667991
hide	show
then in your touch handler show and hide the object

21668001
for-loop	loops
programmers often refer to it as the for-loop because of the way in which it repeatedly loops until a particular condition is satisfied

21668011
width	height
the css works fine if i set height width properties to my images -- for example

21668013
versioning	upgrade
guys i upgrade my mysql to the 5.6 versioning and now this is what is being returned

21668023
range	minimum
this one clamps your number to the minimum or maximum specified value if it is outside of those range

21668124
superclass	subclassing
also if the implementation a of is a strict subclassing of t then the antisymmetry rule seems to suggest that t must be an implementation of for some superclass ap of a

21668126
for-loop	arrays
so the outside for-loop runs through each index value of the arrays

21668126
for-loop	arrays
the inner for-loop starts at the decimal and ends at the end of the arrays

21668130
mouseleave	mouseenter
i know it requires two functions one for mouseenter and one for mouseleave

21668148
implements	extends
extends from an abstract class you must implements all methods of

21668148
public	protected
i see that in the source they are protected methods dopost doget etc and even it says compiled code but even if they are protected how we can extend the methods to create new servlets is it because the public abstract httpservlet signature

21668148
subclass	abstract-class
when an abstract-class is subclassed the subclass usually provides implementations for all of the abstract methods in its parent class

21668150
mouseleave	mouseenter
hover is a utility method to register both mouseenter and mouseleave handlers

21668191
width	height
because of the chrome that goes with it the images are fixed size which is why you cannot specify a width and height

21668194
for-loop	loops
the do-while loops does not check the condition on the first iteration but a for-loop does

21668212
implements	extends	abstract-class	superclass
an abstract-class may not implements methods but they can and if you extends from an abstract-class you must implements all methods of superclass otherwise the new class must be abstract as well

21668212
implements	extends
an abstract class does implements methods you just don t get to use those methods until you extends the abstract class into a concrete class

21668291
for-loop	loops
as others have mentioned the problem arises that the for-loop will check the condition at the beginning of loops but your do while loops will check the condition at the end of your loops

21668310
hash	md5
do not use md5 or sha for password hash - they are too fast

21668310
hash	md5
hash algorithms including md5 take time proportional to the size of the input or o n

21668366
folder	directory
it was tested working if i put the war file under the webapps folder on my local tomcat directory

21668368
portrait	landscape
this approach is pretty damn close it uses javascript to determine if the image is landscape or portrait and applies styles accordingly

21668373
uiview	calayer
so turns out that these annotation objects have a layer property that is actually a calayer meaning you have to use caanimations on them and not uiview animations

21668394
width	height
notice that several of the width and height combinations in preview sizes and picture sizes are the same

1 get output area aspect ratio width height

21669163
folder	directory
it searches for the templates directory inside the settings folder

21669319
toolbar	tabs
this is the toolbar i have mention so when we create a new vehicle manage tab will cause the all tabs unfunctional

21669332
pbkdf2	md5	pbkdf2	hash	scrypt	md5	scrypt	pbkdf2	hash	md5
for a moment forget about hash algorithm md5 sha pbkdf2 bcrypt scrypt etc and lest focus on password strength first

21669332
scrypt	pbkdf2
password_hash uses by default with is sufficient for a password but there are better alternatives such as pbkdf2 or scrypt for more information on what i mean see how to safely store a password

21669417
super	extends
you will have to define a custom adapter which will extends the adapter classes for super implementation for your listview

21669449

google-chrome	firefox
i m sure i m missing something simple but i ve been searching with google-chrome and firefox web tools without luck and can t find a duplicate question here on stack

21669509
width	height
for one thing you ve explicitly set the width and height attributes of the svg-containing img to 0

21669509
width	height
solutions are either to specify the size on your html page in css or to give it the image itself a width or height

21669762
post	get
if on the other hand you really mean post.children to be a singular many-to-one to a particular post then you need to set on that relationship and you won t get the lazyload if parent_post is none in that case though not zero that is a non-null value

21669783

21670440
min	max
if not for instance if you do it by solving a linear programming problem because you happen to have a linear programming solver handy notice for example from aaw wang maxflowmincutalg.html that one half of the min cut is the set of nodes reachable from the source when the graph has been modifies to subtract out the edge capacities actually used by the solution - so given just the edge capacities used at max flow you can find it pretty easily

21670447
submit	submission
you can use javascript function on submit button and set some hidden params in your form and change the values according to your form submission and get the hidden param in your controller

superclass	subclassing
it allows you to use any methods created in the superclass in the subclassing and it also allows you overwrite methods in the superclass

21670649
superclass	subclassing
basically if you have one method you want to use in a bunch of classes you use the superclass to create it and then the subclassing can just call the method using standard dot notation

in terms of fragment s life cycle events onpause onresume oncreateview and other life cycle events will be invoked in case of replace but they wont be invoked in case of add

21684520
onresume	onpause
in this scenario even though you follow the best practice and register the event bus in onresume and unregister in onpause event bus would still be active in each instance of the added fragment as add fragment wont call either of these fragment life cycle methods

this issue is that a click is a mousedown + mouseup

21684898
children	parent
gets the corresponding task_struct and its parent and tries to list all children of the parent and of the spawned process itself

21684898
children	parent
so i can see that kworker u 1 is typically the parent and it has no other children than mytest - and since mytest is very simple in my case just a single write to disk file it spawns no threads of its own so it has no children either

21684904
post	get
another method is injecting some specially writted dlls or extensions in browsers i ve seen it mostly for internet explorer they use bho dlls in order to receive all get post data so you don t need any actively running exe file just a dll which runs as you open internet explorer and the dll will send directly all your post get data as it is to hacker s server

21684904
post	get
it s mostly done in same time and bho doesn t store anything mostly and sends same post get data you ve sent to your bank in same time to hacker s server

post	get
if you get a dump from your post request you probably see invalid _post value with dropdownlist

21689918
uilabel	nsstring
i think the nsstring method is the best route to go down but as an aside if you d like to use the uilabel approach i d recommend creating the label only once to help the uitableview scrolling performance

21689948
uilabel	uibutton
i have two uilabel and two uibutton on a view and have code to make one label start timing when its respective button is pressed

now change double to int

21690167
width	height
you can do this with automatic height and width in your elements as demonstrated in this fiddle

21690167
width	height
basically your inner element will resize itself automatically to fill its height and width constraints but you then have to add javascript jquery to check the height of the element and make sure that it still fits inside the parent element

21690167
width	height
this works fabulously for height but there is one thing to note for width

21690181
tunnel	vpn
better still programs like sqlyog allow ssh tunnel connections to mysql which is how i usually connect unless the servers are on a vpn

21690225
implements	extends
moreover if your enum constants themselves override or implements methods like in this example then each enum constant will be an anonymous class extends booktype - if the enum were final and that was transposed onto the booktype class then this behaviour would not be allowed

21690267
post	get
my problem at least was that the options call to the server to check if the server allows a custom header to be sent fails so the actual get post call is never made

21690272

as such a lot of my code actually has the requirement that the object passed to it extends a and also implements ib but there is no way to declare that for my member variables i can think of

21690402
for-loop	arrays
you can define the sizes in a separate arrays and then use for-loop as follows

21690458
qapplication	qwidget	qevent	qapplication	qevent	qwidget
a way to achieve what is mentioned in the question is to reimplement this method by subclassing a qwidget or the qapplication and then handling a qevent updaterequest event by calling the update method or in any other case passing the event to the base class where the default handler will deal with it similarly to default windows procedure in win api

21690472
int	double
allowing this conversion would potentially allow attempts to put double s into lists of int s or the issue that generics moves detection of to compile-time

21690476
implements	extends
you could make a new abstract class that both implements ib with abstract methods and extends a

21691083
for-loop	arrays
what you did wrong is that your else statement breaks your for-loop if the name you re looking for is not at the first index of your arrays

21691083
for-loop	arrays
in my opinion you should remove else statement completely from your for-loop and place your print function right after the for-loop in case name wasn t inside the arrays or in case you want to keep it inside for-loop you can do it this way

21691089
lodash	underscore.js
this is heavily lodash underscore.js based

21691124

21691354
elf	dwarf
enum race human orc elf dwarf gnome

21691426
coalesce	isnull
i already tried using coalesce and isnull but since there are no values for those days there are no null values either so they simply just cannot replace null with something else

21692834
hide	show
what s happening here is that when your listeners fire you re running namechecker multiple times which will show or hide the elements depending on the order of the namechecker calls inside of the listener

21692834
hide	show
the better way to do this is to register one function to all of the listeners and every time that function runs it will hide all of the elements and then go over all of your namechecker functions at once to show the ones that are supposed to be visible

width	height
it is because your image hasn t completed loading yet so the default width and height of the image is returned both 0

21693146
width	height
as you cannot use 0 for the width and height of getimagedata you get an error

21693146
width	height
it s because the image is now in the cache and the browser happens to be able to provide it before you attempt to read its width and height no the bug is in your code -

in this case clustering by child table by the parent pk will reduce the number of pages read when the children are retrieved

it will be at the size of screen because width and height properties gives the maximized size when read

21704225

udp	tcp
you also might want to check out tcp rather than udp if you are wanting a continuous stream

21704721
udp	tcp
udp just creates a datagram packet and sends it out on the network whereas tcp creates a persistant connection between two hosts

21704830
sshkit	rvm
it probably a problem related to symlinks inside rvm rbenv â it could be resolved avoiding require_relative inside the sshkit gem but in the meanwhile i think the only option is stick with the error and wait for this issue to be resolved

21704832
hide	show
i would follow the first option as having a dedicated resource menu for each fragment seems cleaner and also reduces the code complexity you would have in order to maintain what is visible and what is not if you would go through onprepareoptionsmenu and have code to hide show different menus

21704845

put	get
there are lots of reasons not to use acronyms in your source code but in our situation we are gated regulated by the fda and several other government agencies that require us to put non-code relevant comments throughout our entire system for auditing documentation purposes -- i can t see how we could get through this process without using acronyms

try installing haveged this is a daemons which helps the systemd with generating random numbers for your key

21706038
nexus	artifactory
if however your submodules are stand-alone and don t have a lot of transitive dependencies particularly if they are in separate scm repositories they are independently versioned and you have a little spare hardware for a build server like say hudson and a maven2 artifactory like sonatype nexus you could just keep them as seperate projects and let maven handle the rest

21706066
udp	tcp
you can use socket programming to create a udp or tcp socket on a port number which is different from the port number on which you handle your video or any other media for that matter.on this port you should wait for incoming messages

21706375

i ve written this code please tell me what should i do to make the button do something depending on which checkbox is checked

21706702
sorting	grouping
as expected f4 is the slowest because it uses desc which i m guessing somehow involves in an ordering or sorting per grouping - a more computationally expensive operation than just getting max or which.max

21706718
post	get
you can use ajax from the .jsp to your controller with post or get

21706738
post	get
i was using url rewrite so every url that i had image js get load post i needed to use full url but it was missing www

21706764
int	chars
i found that as i wrote these values to an output file when reading an int value that was only two digits long the third digit or some other number would be left over in the chars buffer peek and the value would be written incorrectly to the output file this only happened after reading a very very large amount of data from the input file. so after tens of thousands of iterations when reading a number like 15 the value that would get written to my output file might have been something like 156

21706811
google-chrome	firefox
unfortunately google-chrome do not have pure silent print firefox is not a option so there is some annoying 1 sec splash screen in google-chrome when you add --kiosk-printing

the application uses a for-loop and and behaves as expected except when it reaches the while loops with start and end datetime conditions

21706920

note however that this code is not exception safe in fact if any code between the calloc and the free calls happens to throw a c++ exception the memory allocated on the heap for sallcodes and scode will not be released

21706920
free	calloc
in a more modern and more practical c++ style you could use std vector instead of calloc to allocate the memory on the heap and automatically free it thanks to std vector destructor just like for cstring

21706945
serializable	deserialization
there is this little special requirement that the deserialization must be backwards-compatible to older serializable versions which have might have a different order of elements are missing elements or have additional now unused elements

miglayout is another nice layout and it s easier to pick up than gridbaglayout but it also is not perfect or at least it wasn t a couple years ago when i last used it

21707183

21707403
snmp	mib
the snmp object navigator or the ios mib locator are your friends

21707443
portrait	landscape
i think the only way you would ever be able to achieve this would be to have diferent stylesheets for each orientation and when on landscape orientation your css would rotate and position every element making it look like it s still in portrait

21707522

i changed the post to get and it seems to have fixed the issue

21708513

the crux of the problem is that the uibutton is the parent view here every subviews you add is on top of the uiview that is the uibutton

21713857
uiview	subviews
you should make a custom uiview class myfancybuttonthing that does what you want by putting the uibutton view on top of all the other subviews of myfancybuttonthing

also coalesce on mysql does roughly the same thing that nvl does on oracle and current_date becomes a function called now

21714103
google-chrome	firefox

ps for this problem in particular i would try to use width and height to see if that changes anything

it requires a md5 hash of first and last 64kb of the video file

21714380
for-loop	loops
you re setting labeltitle s text in a for-loop so you re only going to see the last result because you keep changing it each time thru loops

21714380

as an alternative you could have an nsmutablearray at the top and add your strings to that arrays each time you go thru the for-loop

21714419
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine however in google-chrome or firefox

21714431

21714592

i initially defined a didinsertelement method on the listview to bind to the window s resize event and update the listitem s width and height but this way i apparently overrode the listitem s own didinsertelement method

21714657
typedef	struct
also using a typedef to a struct is not really that useful in c++ for these cases the name of the struct is usable by just declaring the struct

21714666
width	height
as well as the above information it looks like you re not setting layoutparams for the imageview and so the linearlayout doesn t know how to present it and chooses to give it zero width and height which would explain why you re seeing the green background and nothing else

21715199
superclass	subclassing
remember that you have to be able to use an instance of a subclassing anywhere you can use the superclass so the subclassing s return type must be at least as specific as the superclass s you re good here and its parameter type must be at most as specific as the superclass s and this is your problem

21715199
put	get
code using an abstractmanager needs to be able to pass any old abstractobject to get and put so you can t require something more specific in concretemanager

21715200

int	chars
if you just want to read a single chars from a glib.filestream you can use glib.filestream.getc which reads the next chars from stream and returns it as an unsigned chars cast to an int or eof on end of file or error. actually glib.filestream.read_line is implemented using getc

21715216
versioning	upgrade
i just recently upgrade my java to the latest versioning and i honestly have no idea how to fix this

21715312
min	max
you only advance the pointer if is greater than the current max or min

width	height
for 2d elements like a hud i generally set an ortographic matrix with left 0 right width bottom 0 top height where width and height are the size of the window

21716842
width	height
then your rectangle vertices would be at 0 0 width and height

21716844
width	height
width and height in that order so your code should look like this

width	height
the problem i am facing is that this code works fine as long as either the height width or style attributes are used

21717031
width	height
when the height width is set via a css selector for example a class selector the code is not working

21717086
google-chrome	safari
working with safari and google-chrome

21717108
for-loop	arrays
i would also like to point out that it s considered a bad idea to use for in on arrays you should change that to using a regular for-loop with an index variable or use .foreach

21717122

if you implements your model as a service or maintain instances of them in a service then you can bind to the service and then register your listener assuming your model processing extends beyond the life of activities

21717250
nsstring	nsdata
i think you need to pass nsdata instead of nsstring object to contents in createfileatpath contents attributes method or you can do something like below

21717304
google-chrome	firefox
standard inverse navbar looks fine on firefox but search form splits on google-chrome

i also know why we do try-catch finally and understood why java made certain set of exception-handling checked

21718362
try-catch	exception-handling

both are set to height of 50 one is perfect the other overlaps the cell and spills into the cell below it because it doesn t stretch to the height i specified but a proportional height based off the width

21720042
public	protected
although i did not find anything about it in the msdn it would make sense to generate the documentation for all publicly visible that means public and protected elements

21720061
google-chrome	firefox
so i set up a modal to open a embeded youtube video and to autoplay when it opens this works great in firefox but in google-chrome it starts autoplaying the moment the page is loaded even without the modal being triggered so you just end up with background music playing without knowing from where

portrait	landscape
in that app portrait landscape transition restart the activity when rotate the phone and interrupt the socket connection

21720168
maven	pom.xml
i have added a new to my maven pom.xml file

21720336
min	max
i have an array and i am able to calculate the max and min value for each array

21720350
put	get
for example consider doing a binary search for something with o log n time complexity and a basic print statement as something with o 1 time complexity and if you put these together you d still get o log n as there would still be log n calls within the composed function that prints a number each time going through the search

21720350
for-loop	loops
consider a double for-loop where each loops is o n complexity the overall complexity is o n x o n o n 2 which would mean that in the case of finding something that cancels out the log n would be challenging as you d have to find something with o 1 log n which i m not sure exists in reality

21720378

the ondestroy method should clean up all the resources those were acquired by the oncreate method and previously used by the now-destroyed activity

21721108
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox just hangs and synaptic package manager says

21721109

i want to set timer on body onload eventhandler to call function where i show hide div

21721251
hive	hdfs
failed with exception java.io.ioexception java.io.ioexception malformed orc file hdfs master 6000 user hive warehouse test.db transaction_details test_details.txt

21721260
udp	tcp
obviously the for bundle only caters for tcp however another params with for bundle would suffice for the udp requirement

21721277
listview	gridview
however since gridviewrowpresenter is most often used with listview and gridview

21721277
listview	gridview
i begin to wonder how does the listview and gridview setting the columns property for each row

21721297
xmlhttprequest	xdomainrequest
provided they whitelist your origin that works with all modern browsers although sadly in ie8 and ie9 you have to use microsoft s special xdomainrequest object rather than xmlhttprequest as of ie10 microsoft finally joined the party

21721297
post	get
alternately you might see if the server you re trying to work with supports jsonp don t confuse this with json although as your request is a post and jsonp is inherently a get operation they may not

21721313
width	height
by default it is set to 320 width and 289 height

21721313
width	height
i write out to nslog and it has my width at 320 and height at 88 for 2 rows which is correct

21721326
for-loop	loops
the else clause of a for-loop is only executed after the for-loop has ended unless a break statement was used to abort loops early

21721335

then to restore zooming you set the viewport again on domcontentloaded with the same scale except that this time you set normal min max scale values to restore user-scaling

21721335
google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari

21721379

you frist way somevalue 3600 is going to be calculated first and that s a int division and it will give you an int and then casted to a double which doesn t give you a correct answer

in my opinion if you can markup a page in twig or smarty you should be able to code a view page in cakephp

21721515

also make sure all the post data is available before you put the data in query and most important sanitize the data using mysql_real_escape_string or use pdo

21721516
inherited	properties
cf load navigation properties from inherited class

21721516
inherited	properties
i have read from above that ef cannot handle inherited of navigation properties so i place comments as a properties in both post and event

21721913
put	get
put bluntly the fmx source exhibits an extremely stupid exception-phobia notwithstanding the fact individual cases can get fixed over time

21721913
bmp	png
your apparent assumption that the fmx tbitmap like the vcl class saves to the bmp format is incorrect - it saves to png by default

21721933
prepare	execute
to the contrary it can decrease performance because instead of being able to always use the same prepare statement to insert a row in a table and be able to execute several inserts into a single batch hibernate must create a specific prepare statement for each entity to insert which depends on the fields that are null and the fields that are not

you ll probably have to make your two background overlapping background images the same size since the dimensions are different they might have different ratios of width height and use some media queries to clean things up though to make it work 100

21741885
post	put
add a foo validate endpoint that allows a post or potentially put of the foo they are hoping to make

qtnetwork for tcp udp ssl sockets as well as a high level http ftp engine

21742003
qtwidgets	qtgui
qtgui and qtwidgets were split

21742003
qtwidgets	qtopengl
qtopengl still contains the qgl classes but now links to qtwidgets as it contains qglwidget

21742003
qwindow	qwidget
then you can still use qglwidget or embed the qwindow via qwidget createwindowcontainer

21742003
qtwidgets	qtgui
given that now qtgui offers opengl support it would be natural to expect a qglwidget replacement appearing directly into qtwidgets

21742011
src	attr
first attr src will only retrieve the current value after changing it you have to use attr src newvalue to set it

21742044
inherited	properties
...in which the child classes would inherited the properties of the parent classes

21742078
spaces	delimiter
tokens in a pdf token stream may be delimiter by white spaces as usual for most programming language but also implicitly because the next character is a delimiter of its own since it introduces a special function

21742078
spaces	linefeed
the next character is tested against the whitespace characters from table 1 in 7.2.2 top to bottom spaces linefeed carriage return and the nul character -- though they are still missing the form feed code 0x0c and very odd the common tab 0x09

21742078

21742200
octal	binary	octal	hex	hex	binary
conversion to a binary octal or hex since those are all power-of-2 bases is simply a matter of bit shifting and masking

21742200
hex	binary
hex is a convenient shorthand for representing binary values

21742200
octal	hex
conversion to octal base 8 is essentially the same as conversion to hex

libstdc++	libc++
this would be the case if the code linking to the library was compiled using libstdc++ and because your new universal library is compiled using libc++ the code will not link

21742240
libstdc++	libc++
you have to compile everything with the same libc++ libstdc++ support you cannot mix and match as they will refuse to link

21742240
libstdc++	libc++
in general demangling the symbols using c++filt allows you to see the proper signatures and in the case of this code once you start seeing std __1 in the symbols it indicates that the library was compiled using libc++ and when you see the link failing with unadorned std symbols without the inner __1 then it indicates that the item performing the linking is using libstdc++

21742265
inherited	properties
with appropriate use of normal oo patterns proper use of base implementations and abstract properties to force the extending class to do the implementation you can get most of the way towards multi inherited with this option

21742269
accelerometer	gyroscope
if you do not know how to handle accelerometer or gyroscope in android check motion sensors

concurrent to installation of the libraries i had to also go from the old tutorial i was reading llvm 2.2. suggesting clang++ syntax to one for 3.0

21742826
width	height
if not another way would be resizing the view so it is the same width-height ratio as the image s size while keeping it no smaller than the image view was to begin with minimal increate to height or width no decrease to either

21743114
versioning	upgrade
2nd solution i had no more-recent versioning to which i could upgrade so i found another option running an sbt clean didn t do the trick so i went further and renamed effectively deleting as far as sbt knew all intermediate derivative object folders just added a .archived to their names in the project folder structure to force sbt to rebuild populate everything from scratch ie

21743259
min	max
result wanted is min 2 and max 4 values

21743294
min	max
since it s an array of objects try using two temporary variables to keep track of the min and max

21743294
min	max
i m assuming in this code you re looking for the max and min ordering

21743308
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
i set the width to 300px height auto left 50 and the margin 0 0 0 -150px

21743472
free	malloc
you want one 1 call to free per call to malloc

21743472
free	malloc
no other free calls are required and certainly not in a loop when you only had one malloc

21743945
fgets	strcpy
the segmentation fault is not caused by fgets but by strcpy

21744027
getter	setter
typically in standard practice you only ever use _property in a getter setter init dealloc method

21744027
getter	setter
in this way you can create custom getter setter for the method that all classes are required to abide by when they use this variable including the class holding the variable itself

21744027
getter	setter
now this doesn t matter so much if you don t define custom methods but if you have a custom getter or setter method in your object s class

21744084

pop-up	dialog
i am using imacros 7.6.0.2 i am trying to figure how to extract text from a pop-up dialog box not one that i have created

21744160
sorting	filtering
this may also be a side-effect of the earlier problem of returning multiple versions of a table in line 31 of server.py - you might be overwriting later versions of a table with earlier versions which you can prevent by filtering or sorting the query results

21744162
width	height
this worked for me i specified the height and width of the canvas inside the onload function

21744181
libusb	libdc1394
a www search led me to guess that i need to install libusb and libdc1394 in order to recognize the camera which i did using brew

21744181
libusb	libdc1394
i don t understand exactly how libusb and libdc1394 libraries work under the hood other than that they handle the hand-shaking with the camera and data transfer via the usb bus

21744181
libusb	libdc1394
i found python wrappers for libusb and libdc1394 and included them in my code which resulted in no errors but no luck grabbing frames either

21744190

libxml2	libxslt
way faster and gives a known good keg-only copy of libiconv and nokogiri s libxml2 and libxslt

21744398
libxml2	libxslt
don t bother link-ing libxml2 or libxslt sudo anything or make install libiconv either these are unnecessary and fragile

21744446
terminate	timeout
if you want your app to take a long time to process a query you must remove the statement timeout that is forcing it to terminate early

children	parent
so the parent element will have a fix height by its padding and children s height rather than expand to fit the height of the big element that i want to ignore

21744566
multiplying	addition
when you need to multiplying element-wise then reduce with addition think np.dot or np.einsum

if possible if you have enough ram add this processed data to an in-memory queue and when your io process has finished reading all of the files into memory you can then have it write the processed data back to disk

21744651
cpu	hyperthreading
you should run enough cpu processes to utilize your hardware threads which is probably the number of cores you ve got on your cpu or the number of cores 2 if your cpu and os support hyperthreading - run a few timing experiments with various numbers of processes to arrive at a good number

21744652
sorting	grouping
i have tried sorting the series grouping by sum fields

21744789
jlist	jtable
if you want to change the background color of a jtable cell or a jlist or a jtable or jcombobox then you need to provide a custom cell renderer capable of perfoming this task in which case you should have a look at.

hash	salt
that means thus everytime you hash your password a new salt is created therefore the string will always be different - even if the password is the same

21746779
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
that s one of the strengths over a simple md5 hash without salt

in the same vein i d advise you to remove the strdup and stuff and switch to std string instead - this would remove another location where you might mix up free and delete

21755087

when the second call is commented the width or height will eventually randomly drop below 2 ending the recursion

21765996
width	height
there seems to be a little confusion in your code about the exact meaning of the parameters height width mheight and mwidth

21765996

udp	tcp
2 as for running tcp and udp in parallel it is not as huge of a concern these days as others have noted

21766386
udp	tcp
at one time i heard that overloaded routers along the way were bias dropping udp packets before tcp packets which makes sense in some ways since a dropped tcp packet will just be resent anyways and a lost udp packet often isn t

21766386
udp	tcp
the one case where tcp may interfere with udp is that tcp by nature of it s algorithm is continuously trying to go faster and faster unless it reaches a point where it loses packets then it throttles back and repeats the process

21766386
udp	tcp
as the tcp connection continuously bumps against that bandwidth ceiling it is just as likely to cause udp loss as tcp loss which in theory would appear as if the tcp traffic was sporadically causing udp loss

21766386
udp	tcp
for a game like freerealms which does this the assets are downloaded from a cdn via http tcp and it will attempt to use all available bandwidth which will increase packetloss on the main game channel which is typically udp

21766386
udp	tcp
whereas the os gets the data from the network card then distributes it to various logical tcp connections internally for processing my background thread gets the data from the solitary udp socket via periodic polling and distributes it to my own internal logical connection objects for processing

21766420
width	height
if you are using the values returned from this method for layouts you should probably ceilf the width and height

21766442
hash	salt
using usermanager.passwordhasher the salt is stored as the first few bytes of the hash string so you should not need to manually enter the salt verifyhashedpassword will automatically read it in and set it for the verification process

width	height
you wouldn t expect to pass width and height to a rectangle constructor by writing

21766466

i m using dreamweaver cs6 and viewing it in the latest versions of firefox safari

21767583
int	double
note that the fact that your employee number and your hire date are both string values is a bit of a worry and it s a bad idea to use double for currency values - get into the habit of using bigdecimal or use an int to represent a number of cents pennies whatever

but safari and google-chrome appear to be doing something very different altogether they seem to be putting the marker box not only within the principal box but within the first child of the principal block box

21778308
google-chrome	safari
when you add list-style-position inside to the li other browsers correctly shift the p block box beneath the marker but safari and google-chrome simply move the marker into the p box

that s clearly not what safari and google-chrome are doing with the marker box

21778308

one of the differences is that whereas script captures stdout stdin and stderr as one big character stream i would like to keep them separate and record them as such

21778850
stdout	stderr
in order to do this i use the standard approach of running a child shell connected to a pty but instead of using a single pty with stdin stdout and stderr all connected to it i use two ptys - with stdin and stderr connected to one pty and stdout on the other

21778850
stdout	stderr
this way the master process can tell what is coming from stdout and what from stderr

width	height
the bare minimal of mb per app is still 16mb written about here and so if an image is of size width height after it gets decoded it will usually take 4 width height bytes

21782110
width	height
if the image doesn t have transparent pixels and you don t care much about quality you can use rgb_565 config instead of the default argb_8888 config which will make bitmaps use only 2 width height bytes

also just for anyone searching out there if you are having problems where min works but max does not you need to make sure that the variable you are assigning to max is a javascript number

21782365
min	max
you can assign a string 0 to min and it will perform the conversion fine but passing a string 99 to max will cause the max validation to stop working

ant	maven	ant	pom.xml	maven	pom.xml
jenkins can automatically run an ant build.xml file or run a pom.xml in maven

21787590
ant	maven
select whether to build with invoke ant build maven top level targets execute windows batch command execute shell etc

21787653
ng-app	ng-controller
if you want to share the data you have to store it in a service or take the controller declarations off of your views and just leave the top-level ng-controller next to the ng-app attribute

21787662
hash	salt
even in a non-ssl login only a salt hash of the password needs to be transmitted for the login -- not the password itself

21787662
hash	salt
the server can then begin transmitting counts with its responses and the client can respond with the hash of count+private salt on the next page request

21787662
hash	salt
the potential session hijacker does not have any way to obtain this private salt and thus cannot generate the next hash in the sequence

21787665
google-chrome	safari
however for some odd reason in both google-chrome and safari on iphone s and mobile in portrait mode aka should be using the mobile site which is less than 568px wide it is using the tablet version

21787677
google-chrome	firefox
p.s try using inspect element in google-chrome or firebug in firefox to peruse through css js

21787703
calloc	malloc
i have fixed this by using calloc instead of malloc

21787755
ubuntu	centos
scenario is very common lot of servers ubuntu centos servers of differents customers etc

21787774
getter	setter
if i were you i would write a utility class that would scan the given directory recursively for .java files and then parse them one by one to rename the getter setter methods and their fields as per the convention needed

21787774
getter	setter
parsing does not have to be full-fledged as you are interested in only renaming the fields and their getter setter that match a specific criteria

21787774
getter	setter
other option is to manually refactor each instance variable and its getter setter using the refactor -- rename dialog of eclipse

21787786
inherited	properties
just inherited from validationattribute and write the logic you need and toss the attribute on the properties you want to conditionally validate

21787896
dateadd	datepart
selectâ convert varchar 50 dateadd dd datefirst - datepart dw 05 06 2014 - 6 05 06 2014 101

21787896
dateadd	datepart
select convert varchar 50 dateadd dd datefirst - datepart dw 05 06 2014 05 06 2014 101

21787906
textwatcher	charsequence
a quick guess try doing your check in the ontextchanged charsequence s int start int before int count method of textwatcher

21787932
children	parent
there is a d3.js circle packing example where the children are displayed within their parent circle

21787975
hash	salt
thereafter the server provides a count value with each update and expects the client to respond with the hash of the secret salt + count

21787975
hash	salt
the potential hijacker does not have any way to obtain this secret salt value and thus cannot generate the next hash

21788032
button	checkbox
each button could contain unknown number of sub-controls such as checkbox combobox textblocks etc

21788077
width	height
calculate width and height

21788077
width	height
using layoutparams object set width and height to the button

21788097
getter	setter
update setter and getter are already in place i only pasted the relevant aspects of the code in here

21788104
public	protected
also paintcomponent should be protected and not public

21788114
folder	directory
my problem was i simply made a new folder in c directory to save my .java files like a test folder and set my path to ...jdk bin folder

21788118
folder	directory
however when i try to make the call to mkdir to create folder for each separate author it tries to make a directory for each separate word

21788138
google-chrome	firefox
every other browser i test google-chrome firefox ie triggers the error event so i can display a message to the user like so

21788141
post	get
if you want an easy way to post and get from restful urls like web api check out servicestack.text

21788146
google-chrome	firefox
menu works in current versions of google-chrome and firefox perfectly but breaks down in ie10 haven t tested others

21788205
hide	show
i need the reference to able to programmatically show and hide the master popover but i cannot depend on the users to rotate their ipads

21788219
for-loop	loops
no it doesn t loops 50 times because your for-loop condition is incorrect

21788248
width	height
assuming all bitmaps are 32-bit and have the same width and height

21788251
goto	break
goto commands break for loops

21788254
content-length	content-type	content-disposition	content-length	content-disposition	content-type
currently i m sending the pdf to the browser by setting the content-disposition content-length and content-type headers

21788265
getter	setter
i don t find the setter and getter for the attribute create it and set the value with above code

21788282
unsigned	short
if you switch to short unsigned m_bfield3 1 and short unsigned m_bfield4 1 i think there s a good chance your structure will become smaller and fit in only 16 bytes

21788287
free	malloc
edit if i remove the free call and simply malloc again it works but i believe this is the wrong approach as the old allocated space is gone forever and i can never free it

21788324
maven	pom.xml
so i created a maven project in eclipse from your pom.xml

21788348
int	double
the compiler is passing one type possibly an implicit cast to int and reinterprets the same bits as something else a double on the other side

21788400
filesystems	ntfs
if you use the finder to copy the files to a windows server that uses the ntfs filesystems it ll hide the metadata in an alternate data stream a windows-only form of advanced metadata attached to the file and if you use the finder to copy it back it ll be reassembled properly

21788428
google-chrome	firefox
i ve researched this for a couple of days now and come across this one which works fine for google-chrome and firefox but not ie

21788465
google-chrome	firefox
however in google-chrome and firefox the select box opened font size takes the one from the select box resulting in a very oversized and unusable select box

21788488
put	get
if you put the images in the public hierarchy as in olden times you would get normal path routing

21788498
nsmutablestring	nsstring
again think of them like static member functions which also have dynamic dispatch so an nsstring method may execute a different implementation than nsmutablestring within its class method via override and this is determined at runtime

21788528
hash	salt
afterwards the server can provide a count with each response and the client can provide a hash of count + secret salt with the next request

21788528
hash	salt
a potential hijacker has no access to the secret salt and cannot generate the next hash

21788528
hash	salt
even a non-ssl login can probably establish a secret salt if login is accomplished using one-time-use hash passwords

21788534
google-chrome	safari
facebook embedded posts seems to have an issue on ipads using safari or google-chrome

21788534
google-chrome	safari
as google-chrome on android tablets as well as google-chrome and safari on iphones do not have this issue i am currently guessing it is a facebook defect with the iframe

21788551
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
in safari the background of my menu navigation drop-down menu s is much wider than in google-chrome firefox

21788572
range	infinity
the accumulated error in multiple floating-point operations can range from zero to infinity or can be non-numeric nan

21788617
daemons	launchd
the penalty can be seen by launchd notepad from the daemons running in session 0 and trying to open a file through the windows dialog

21788653
folder	directory
by default apache is looking inside public laravel folder in the root of your server directory.settings related to that directory are stored inside .htaccess file

21788667
put	get
if i put the button in at the same xhtml store.xhtml page where im inputtext is placed i get the data

21788674
tinyint	varchar
1 added a new table called years to the database yearid tinyint pk yearname varchar

21788683
free	malloc
you also might need to do it for malloc free

21788699
getter	setter
you need getter and setter

21788724
hide	show
i have an edit form for a model and i want to be able to show or hide form fields in the edit screen to gather additional information based on the selection of a type within the form

21788737
hide	show
when you will click in the button you need to show corresponding form and hide all other form

21788761
std	ostream
the reason is that setprecision int is not a method of the std ostream interface but a global function composed from the following bits stolen from mingw gcc 4.6.2 implementation

21788769
width	margin
the margin and specified width is only to make it look good in the jsfiddle and can be changed depending on the size you want it on your actual page but you get my meaning

21788795
maven	pom.xml
i then created an empty project in intellij and attached the maven pom.xml files to that project

21788840
google-chrome	firefox
i am using jquery simple plugin for my modal popup script it is working on firefox and google-chrome but ie8 returns following error

21788871
google-chrome	firefox
all works fine in firefox google-chrome except in ie browsers

21788951
hash	salt
see the secure hash and salt for php passwords question for more information about hashing passwords in php

21788964
width	height
the desired and normally obtained effect is that this bg box sizes up to the width and height of the viewport

21788964
width	height
in safari it just behaves as if it had it s position set to absolute - it just sizes up to the width and height of the container div

21788965
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
and declare the width of your background for safari only so it same width like in google-chrome and firefox

21788988
required	placeholder
for some bound callables such as function pointers it is possible to deduce the number of arguments this also allows automatically supplying the required amount of placeholder

21788993
solaris	sunos
if you want to try this on a solaris sunos system change awk to usr xpg4 bin awk usr xpg6 bin awk or nawk

21789015
client-side	server-side
the only acceptable way to perform it is if you kept all keys and secrets server-side computed the oauth signatures and parameters server side then issued the request client-side from the server-generated oauth values

21789023
portrait	landscape
it almost works but if the table view is scrolled all the way to the top in landscape mode before rotating to portrait it will be scrolled down 12 pixels because of the previous inset the inset is correct

21789023
portrait	landscape
i ve noticed that for table views that are inset automatically the opposite happens if they are scrolled all the way to the bottom in landscape they will be scrolled 12 pixels up from the bottom when returning to portrait

21789043
gif	png
each thread is downloading numerous gif png files...enough that i want to split up the action to save some time

21789045
folder	directory
i used eclipse s jarinjarloader for my classloader which i obtained by creating a runnable jar in eclipse and extracting the org folder and copying it into my project directory

21789163
cpu	processors
it provides multiple metrics for cpu memory i o and network utilization and shows an instance for each processors on the machine

21789183
stdout	stderr
sometimes applications dump version information to stderr instead of stdout

21789185
textchanged	selectedindexchanged
there is no need to duplicate code between textchanged and the default selectedindexchanged

21789191
implements	extends
i am open to other design decisions in fact i am currently getting rid of the whole enum idea and creating classes that implements sections and extends an abstract class abstractsection but i am quite curious about how others make their decisions in similar situations

21789197
hide	show
i have a show hide div script that also logs the information when the user clicks to show the div

21789197
hide	show
the logs work fine and the divs show hide but only on second click it did not use to do this before i added the log function

21789211
post	get
users could use a javascript formatter like discussed in this so post to get the minified files back into a readable format

21789241
versioning	upgrade
perhaps because you upgrade to a different versioning of hibernate without deleting the old jars or something similar

21789308
inherited	properties
if you store it on you will be able to read it in any controller without injecting due to prototypical inherited but the minute someone decides to make a new properties in one of your controllers you ll lose your reference to the user properties on unless you have explicitly injected and reference directly

21789317
wsimport	xjc
i have just successfully used a wsimport xjc plugin named xew with maven using this post

21789391
stdout	stderr
one thing to check is to make sure you are not printing anything to stdout or stderr

21789391
stdout	stderr
you might want to redirect all of stdout and stderr to your log just in case and do this right at the top of your start script so that if some 3rd party import was writing to stdout you d be able to capture that

21789445
getter	setter
moreover i will advise you to go for annotation based mapping in your entities look for setter getter for the methods.in that design also you can have customized method by java logic for this go here to read

21789493
min	max
the method first creates an array called choices filled with all the values from the min value to max value

21789550
min	max
which from my very limited experience should return every min max priced record for each property type

21789550
min	max
my thinking was that if it just checked whether the price was a min or max and sorted it after this would work

21789559
width	height
here is the code to get size in bytes and width height

21789559
width	height
you have to remove the width and height from the img#uploadpreview tag for it to work

21789569
cpu	hyperthreading
let s assume i have a two socket sytem and each socket has a cpu with two physical cores and two logical cores no intel hyperthreading or amd two cores per module

21789624
subtract	add
you cannot add and subtract 1 from dates

21789681
jain-sip	jain-slee
jain-sip is at the core of almost all open-source java sip phones and servers - jitsi mobicents jain-slee uses jain-sip by spec and may be 100s of other projects

21789684
srt	subtitle
search for a video editing software that can insert srt into the video note this are not baked-in subtitle that are part of the video

21789684

21789879
post	get
and this is how you get the length of a number check this post

21789900
hash	salt
or better yet use a different hashing algorithm that hasn t been compromised and consider adding a salt to your hash passwords and sanitizing your inputs

21790030
min	max
if you want to get values from the last three columns so the null values go away then use max or min

21790038
subtraction	addition
i think it s technically possible to implement md5 in previous versions of office but it will be utter hell because you will have to convert values to binary then convert this to strings then do some character replacement mixed with arithmetical addition subtraction etc

21790146
width	height
like we are changing height width depth of 3d cube at run time in this fiddle

21790179
draggable	droppable
i am using jquery draggable droppable and swappable when i drop divs on other i will swap them and its working great

21790199
int	double
and if the goal is to get the int part of a double you could also simply use

21790249
pthreads	usleep
however should you want to use a standards-compliant function instead i suggest using sleep or usleep instead depending on what resolution you need which are specified by pthreads and supported by most non-posix systems as well

21790254
width	height
where width of all textfields is 3 height of name and amount paid are 1 whereas height of address is 3

21790268
ubuntu	linux
i ve tried ubuntu amazon linux

21790281
folder	directory
my local and remote folder match but when i take a file from the local side that is say 3 directory deep and modify upload it s putting the file to the root folder and not the directory location

21790297
subtract	add
then if you want to count the number of inversions in a range l r you add the inversions for the prefix starting at l to the inversions in the suffix ending at r and subtract the total number of inversions for the entire array

gridview	sqldatasource
i have this sqldatasource which my gridview is using as a datasource

my question is how can i read that data back in the view do i create another post would probably be get

21790438
client-side	server-side
it is a little more difficult because it requires the use of many interacting scripts some client-side and some server-side

21790516
junit	testng
if you are using a unit test framework like junit or testng then what i do is use configuration annoations like aftertest or afterclass to quit the browser

however to clarify the bower repository format is different from the npm format

21790627
bower	npm
the bower team is hoping to move everything to npm and stop development and hosting but that is an ongoing effort

invokerequired	begininvoke
the invokerequired begininvoke invoke members of a control require the handle property of the control to be created

21790733
int	double
then your original function should be renamed along the lines of double choice int n int k and use the new factorial implementation

21790734
int	double
this is an int value and you might as well use unsigned long long instead of double for it

21790747
rss	feed
i am having an issue with my rss feed that has not been an issue before

21790747

if you get more complicated like an auth covered directory or you want to show some forbidden but hide the rest you ll have to resort to other methods eg generate your own index then show it like in fred-ii- answer

21792375

then you ask all the turtles around them to add subtract from their energies

21792377

21792999
width	height
of course problem was that text was dynamic and while width would be fixed height should be recalculated every time i d set new text value

21792999
margin	height
boundingrectwithsize didn t work well for me at all from what i could see uitextview was adding some margin on top which boundingrectwithsize would not get into a count hence height retrieved from boundingrectwithsize was smaller than it should be

21792999
uilabel	uitextview
but advantage is that you avoid depending on compatibility between how boundingrectwithsize draws text and calculates it s size and implementation of text drawing in uitextview or uilabel which also you can use just replace uitextview with uilabel

21793039
serializable	deserialization
serializable happens in a different application from deserialization

21793039
serializable	deserialization
the correct course of action is to use the same formatter for both serializable deserialization - i will implement it this way and indicate if that makes a difference

21793733
uigesturerecognizer	subviews
one way would be to expose the subviews as a public property readonly perhaps on your subclass of uicollectionviewcell and attach the uigesturerecognizer directly to that subviews so that it would only fire when the subviews was tapped

21793733
uigesturerecognizer	uibutton
if the star was a uibutton you could forgo the uigesturerecognizer entirely by setting the tag property on the button and having the uicollectionview add it s self as a target on the button

21796575

- the applet s style specifies width 0px height 0px while

21796575

i discovered this subtle but useful difference between the width and height element attributes vs the width and height style attributes while trying to figure out a way to deploy a completely hidden applet

21796575

applet width 0px height 0px will not load the applet in chrome

21796575

21796998
google-chrome	firefox
as you can see the separator for the nav bar are shown different in google-chrome and firefox

21797072

after a property is already set it makes little sense to still show the method that sets it in intellisense so i would like to hide it if it is already set

21797072

some of the business rules which haven t yet been implemented deal with properties inherited from parent objects to their descendant objects

21797075

that is if we want the height it needs a width and that must be done in each call

21797085
google-chrome	firefox
you re using prefixes in your css which makes it render differently on google-chrome and on firefox

21797085

so now my client can successfully request a token from its client app in ad but when it post to the server webapi i get a 401 - unauthorized

21797164
width	height
yes you need to drag it back and then you will be able to change its width my suggestion to keep report page property 7.5in or less and gray window area property to width 8.5in and height 11in including margins and in this way everything will work perfectly

21797211
int	chars
you re reading every chars as a substring and parse it as an int

21797258
post	get
i looked at the post about smiler subject here but all of them failed to get one of the above styles

21797271

21797368
width	height
i resize the image if its width is more then 225 and height automatically fix with that width

21797368
width	height
now the problem is that the new height is according to the image width

21797396
width	height
actually jtextarea already implements all the features required to dynamically change its height based on its width

21797396
width	height
one can see this functionality in action when jtextarea is used inside a scrollpane where its height is automatically adjusted to fit the width of the scrollpane

21797396
width	height
to use this feature one has to first set the size of the jtextarea to some width and then jtextarea#getpreferredsize will return the required height to display the text if line wrap is set to true

21797396
width	height
so to dynamically change the row height of a jtable based on its width one can do the following

21797396
width	height
during the update of the row height one calculates the required size of the jtextarea by first setting the new width and then getting the preferred height as shown in the following code snippet

21797405
vmware	virtualbox
this is for vmware and seems to have fixed the issue couldn t find anything similar for virtualbox but as vmware is free it is a good workaround for anyone having this problem

21797428
int	chars
you will be printing chars after it out of the string and also this cycle will only terminate when p becomes 0 which will happen after int overflow

21797438
subclass	accessor
inside the subclass you would configure the appropriate view hierarchies and then provide accessor to these views

21797476
post	get
if you re stepping through code client and want to debug into the server you must place a breakpoint in the server debugger before making the get post from the client

21797519

so since every instance of it has a single unique key which mean it will always be unique in my experience every time i messed up with this keys like giving the same name key for both an int and boolean for example i end up crashing the app or having some kind of exception

21797703
mouseleave	mouseenter
not as a css background property but as an img element that comes before the divs with the mouseenter mouseleave event handlers

21797703
mouseleave	mouseenter
i do not use z-index property and i already confirmed that use it changes nothing i found that when this is the case an img element followed by absolute positioned divs that should render on top of it ie only fires mouseleave mouseenter events on visible parts of the divs

21797703
mouseleave	mouseenter
ie fires mouseenter when mouse pointer enters the div s border and then fires mouseleave when mouse pointer is no more over the border pixels even if it is inside the div probably because the div is transparent

21797703
mouseleave	mouseenter
possible workaround i will test it right now and update div background pixels must not be transparent or mouseleave will be fired right after the pointer is no more over the border pixels if no borders then no mouseenter mouseleave will be fired

21797703
mouseleave	mouseenter
i started to use console.log in different parts of the script and come to the conclusion that mouseenter and mouseleave aren t fired for ie 10 don t sure in other ie versions

21797703
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox

so when i populate the post array with i get the following output in console

21797915
width	height	multiplying	add
what s actually happening is it is checking whether it should add more pixels to the canvas by changing the dom attribute for width and height if it should multiplying it by some factor usually 2 then changing that and then changing the css style attribute to maintain the same size on the page.

21797915
width	height
for example when you run it once and your canvas width and height are set to 300 it sets them to 600 then changes the style attribute to 300.

21797915
width	height
but if you run it again it sees that the dom width and height are 600 check the other answer to this question to see why and then sets it to 1200 and the css width and height to 600

21797915
width	height
not the most elegant solution but i solved this problem while maintaining the enhanced resolution for retina devices by simply setting the width and height of the canvas manually before each successive call to chart.js

21800393
width	height
if you on the contrary want to make some kind of screen width height calculation and set the result as a particular value you may even use this

21800395
for-loop	arrays
it has something to do with the arrays and the for-loop i m having

21800395
for-loop	arrays
i m trying to store letters from a textbox in a arrays and then in a session and then search trough those letters in a for-loop and check if the letters in the arrays is equal to another letter from a txtbox

21800401
children	parent
another approach comes to mind have the parent document contain a sorted array which defines the order of the children

21800401
children	parent
this approach would certainly make it easier to change the order but will have it s own caveats the parent documents must always keep track of a valid list of its children

21800418
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
without that while loops break will exit the for-loop then you can enter a separate for-loop from 1 to 100 to print the contents of the arrays

21800418
for-loop	arrays
if the user enters less than 100 names at any point then the second for-loop will go from 1 to i and output each arrays entry along the way

21800469
versioning	upgrade
i realized that i was using an older versioning of ember so i upgrade to 1.4.0 but i still get the same ._super error however its only one error instead of two

21800478
gulp-changed	gulp-newer
an alternative is to use gulp-newer or gulp-changed which both use timestamps to determine if a file has changed or not

21800484
svnadmin	cvs2svn
the advantage of using a dumpfile for subsequent migrations is that the subversion repository only needs to be taken offline for the duration of the svnadmin load rather than for the whole time that cvs2svn is running

21800502
width	height
for instance will fill 10 of the height and 30 of the width

21800506
google-chrome	firefox
here is a complete solution that works in both browsers i tested firefox and google-chrome .

21800541
mouseleave	mouseenter
it seems that ie understands that mouseenter must be fired when the mouse pointer enters a visible part of the element and mouseleave must be fired when mouse pointer leaves a visible part of the element

21800541
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
the following links must be visited using ie 10 probably 9 and maybe 8 as other browsers firefox google-chrome opera safari will fire the events in any case

21800544
post	get
this is your table please post your table structure and inert queries in your questions while posting new questions so you will get answers quickly and clear to all

21800563
width	height
pure values will not work as height 100 does not equal width 100 as they refer to different things being the relevant dimensions of the parent

21800565
int	double
the standard defaulting order in haskell is int then double

21800565
int	double
there s no instance for variate int so the instance for variate double is chosen

21800565
int	double
to specifically specify that you want an int not a double

21800651
post	put
as an aside please put in the effort to post well formatted code when asking questions here

21800666
hide	show
when trying to hide show other columns in the data grid i m unable to change them via the code-behind

21800705
uitableview	uisearchbar
i have a uisearchbar and uitableview

21800791
width	height	width	border-box	box-sizing	border-box	height	border-box
in order to fix that you could set a top bottom padding to the container and use box-sizing border-box to calculate the width and height of the box including the paddings and borders

21800810
hide	show
but this code hide it immediately and i want to show the following effect

21800847
ssl	https
i have been struggling the entire day to get my c# windows phone 8 to talk to my php web server over ssl https

21800847
webclient	webrequest
the thing is though that trying to access the server via either webclient or webrequest both give me this error

21800917
width	height
basically i just want a 500px width white rectangle centered in the page horizontally that takes up 100 of the page s height

21800918
pop-up	dialog
i have button called sales and it have a javascript pop-up when i click on cancel it postback and the values in the form are inserted but when i click on ok it does not post back and the values in the form does not go in the database the javascript button is actually print call and when button is clicked it asks for print when print dialog box is open it does not post back and data is not inserted in the database

21800952
width	margin
you need to use left 50 and add a margin of negative half the width

21800962
put	get
when same code i put behind a winform button click i get only 1 property

21800996
strstr	substr
worry not though as you can easily replicate the strstr function using strpos and substr to make it work in older versions of php

21801000
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
turning the button red google-chrome firefox safari opera

21801000
google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari
only tested on google-chrome but as it is a webkit feature should also work on safari and opera as these are also both webkit-based

21801000
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
tested on google-chrome firefox and opera should also work on safari

21801000
google-chrome	firefox
update it seems google-chrome and firefox treat the url passed to the -webkit- filter rule slightly different

21801000
google-chrome	firefox
i had the strange situation that internal filters were working for google-chrome but not firefox and external filters were working for firefox but not google-chrome

21801048
jobs	cron
i found out that yahoo does not support cron jobs

21801052
equals	tostring
two different objects are always different if you compare them using whatever the implementation of equals and hashcode and tostring is

21801071
mongodb	bson
before storing any json document in mongodb i need to transform all the string id s in the document into bson id s and vice-versa when reading any document from mongodb i need to transform all the bson id s into string id

21801071
mongodb	bson
and of course i need to convert back all the bson id s into string id s when reading the document from mongodb

21801111
for-loop	loops
i can achieve that with for-loop but it takes too much time and i know that it s not recommended to use loops in r

21801121
inherited	subclassing	public	protected
for example when you extend a class the subclassing inherited all of the public and protected methods from the parent class

21801145
implements	extends
step 2 in the main activity i am extends fragment activity and implements an actionbar.tablistener

21801164
google-chrome	firefox
this works perfectly fine in ie it displays the table and all of the data but this doesn t seem to work in firefox or google-chrome

21801187
tinyint	boolean
bool boolean these types are synonyms for tinyint 1

21801253
width	height
we have for example image with name test.png with width 100px and height 200px

21801385
backtracking	greedy
it will greedy reach up to the of zillions then it will start backtracking up until it will reach the of billions and achieve the match

21801399
for-loop	arrays
also i don t know whether this is intentional - i assume not you have an extra comma in your arrays initialisation of which means there s a final 0 on the end and you are using this in your for-loop - it should count to not if you want 8 items starting with 0

21801517
versioning	upgrade
this means that it can ensure that an upgrade to one package cannot break others that you can always roll back to previous versioning that multiple versioning of a package can coexist on the same system and much more

21801525
textview	imageview
i need to put a textview and an imageview inside a fragment

21801525
textview	imageview
i was thinking of maybe having two textview lets call them tv1 and tv2 and an imageview img1

21801552
versioning	upgrade
it happens that i was using localdb v11.0 but i had to upgrade my sql server express to the versioning that accepts remote connections

21801555
versioning	upgrade
nix has various advantages over conventional package managers such as the option to install multiple versioning or variants of components safely next to each other a declarative language to specify how to build a component support for complete dependencies and atomic upgrade and rollbacks

21801567
int	double
since presumably inputimage is int using double inputimage doesn t rescale and you end up with double values in ranges like 0-255 or 0-65535 depending on the bit depth which therefore just show as white

21801602
latex	texreg
i m making a table to compare different linear models using r and latex through the package texreg it is my first time with this package

21801625
ready	each
if you try to send several after each other without waiting for the air-interface to be ready you can seriously crash the ble stack

21801630
datalist	repeater
as the nested plugin is doing the layout there s no reason to have the data in a table in the first place and if you swap your datalist for a repeater you can render your items without a table getting in the way

21801638
post	get
i saw there are some post on julian date but i am not able to get through

21801680
for-loop	arrays
and i m trying to log in console each item in arrays and the rest of arrays without that current item in it with for-loop

21801707
utf8-decode	percent-encoding
note both functions have the built-in intelligence that characters above 0x80 are first utf8-decode and then percent-encoding

21801777

i can put data in to array but i can t get data from array

21801896
memcpy	strcpy
i m really wondering why there s no function in c like strcpy memcpy etc

21801935
put	get
hmm at the moment i work from my laptop at home and i can t get passy s version running too and can not put my finger on the issue

checkbox	dropdownlistfor
now i want to display checkbox list instead of dropdownlistfor replace dropdown with checkbox and m doing with following way but value is not binding to knockout obersvable array

21801983
for-loop	arrays
the access violation might be happening during the reading of input numbers in the first for-loop because i goes to which might be larger than the size of your arrays

21802037
postgresql	mysql
basically unlike sqlite and mysql postgresql requires that any columns selected or ordered on must appear in an aggregate function or the group by clause

21802069
getter	setter
the thing i am interested in now is how to write getter setter for declared properties explicitly by hands

21802069
getter	setter
i would thankful for someone who could show me examples of how explicit getter setter should be written for the following property declarations given manual reference counting mrc is used

21802129
width	height
the default frame width and height for mkannotationview is 0 0

21802160
daemons	launchd
i have looked into solutions around the web like launchd and the keepalive key but as far as i understand those are only for daemons and can t be used for regular apps

21802190
post	put
so the method should be prefixed with put or change the request method post which is set by default so you may remove the method from the form if you intend to use post imo

21802205
getter	setter
what you see above is roughly what an atomic getter setter would look like but it might not be accurate

21802205
getter	setter
as you can read here the retain autorelease dance in the getter is meant to prevent a setter in another thread releasing the value before we can return it

21802239
width	height
think about your button you have told where the horizontal center should be where the right edge should be its width and thus the left edge but no constraint is telling your button its height

21802246
children	parent
so for example a parent contains three children

21802249

i can run exactly the same report with the same parameters in google-chrome and firefox and it returns within about 2 seconds

21802267
hash	md5
if they used the same simple hash md5 each company could easily know which members were in common not desired

21802267
hash	salt
if they used a hash salt with a company specific secret the addresses wouldn t be comparable any longer so the question couldn t be answered

21802271
google-chrome	firefox
and is it possible to debug ssl in google-chrome of firefox

21802275
put	get
this simplest way is to find all the spaces and character and put individual word into a two-level list you then get a structure like this

so when the horizontal scroll get enacted when i drag an item to the right i have to also drag a bit up or down to get the scroll bar to move to the right instead of just doing it by dragging directly right without this extra fiddling

21803000
int	double
in your c program where i0 is interpreted as an int but its bit pattern was stored as a double type which uses different logic for organizing the bits and in the standard variation also uses a different number of bits

texreg converts coefficients standard errors significance stars and goodness-of-fit statistics of statistical models into latex tables or html tables ms word documents or to nicely formatted screen output for the r console for easy model comparison

21803249
width	height
and i could only give the advice not to base your layout on knowing how width and or height any text element node would be

21803249
width	font-size	width	height
the only thing you may try is using javascript to get the width height of an element and to adjust the font-size as long as the size fits your needs

21803278
ubuntu	linux
and i m finding that a model update does not happen when using sqlite with flask-sqlalchemy on ubuntu linux

if i use put against a resource id - i do get to the right method but respond_with seems to return an empty content see code below

21803583
width	height
1 you are resizing image container where as you have set height and width to images as well removing height width will fix the issue

21803583
width	height
important with images css height width applied on images

21803583
width	height
3 last but not the least try this in addition setting images container height width through js that you are already doing this will make images to automatically fit to their container

21803602
public	protected
my problem is that when i encode the data all i get are the public properties and none of the protected attributes - the ones i actually want

21803643

21803671
packets	multicast
when i use either the ipv4 or ipv6 bind network interface address i see 3 packets go over the correct multicast address port but then tomcat throws an exception

21803671
packets	multicast
i know multicast is working and enabled because i am able to see packets with tcpdump and use mcsender to send packets

21803674
inherited	properties
the inherited datacontext is what will allow you to bind your dependency properties

mantle - greatly reduces boilerplate for model objects in objective-c automatic implementations of nscoding nscopying -isequal -hash etc.

21803822
width	margin
also you can give .mobilogo width and have margin 0 auto

21803822
width	height
in order for the width and height to work with percentages you need to give the parent elements width and height

21803840
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox and google-chrome and i know that this feature should be supported in ie 9 but all i achieved so far is no more than this screenshot

21803864
parentheses	curly-braces
you were possibly getting that error because of extra parentheses curly-braces in your code

21803887
comparator	comparable
what you did there is indeed a way of generalizing the algorithm so that it does not only work on comparable objects but on arbitrary objects by using a comparator

21803891
versioning	upgrade
i get this value directly from the decoder so that if i upgrade decoders the reported versioning automatically changes

21803911
versioning	upgrade
based on the answers below it looks like you will need to upgrade the versioning of crystal reports you are using or use some other program to convert the pdf

21803915
width	margin
even though it has a width of 50 you ll have to make it a block element to center it with margin 0 auto or else you ll have to specify the width in pixels

21803966
width	height
but it just a solution you need to understand why is happened this happened because your element is a block level element which wrap up your whole content width and height width as a 100

21803999
inject	interceptor
i know that nhibernate does provide interceptor to inject custom logic for each object before it gets persisted

21804015
udp	tcp	arp	tcp	arp	udp
i would like to know how to send a arp packet in language c the functions sent and sendto from sockets sends across tcp or udp but i didnt find how to use arp

21804017
width	height
but it just a solution you need to understand why is happened this happened because your element is a block level element which wrap up your whole content width and height width as a 100 but this is not the case with height you need to specify the related to content to give a height in percentages like as above body has given 100

21804023
pop-up	dialog
i am using a datepicker in such a way that the datepicker pop-up as a dialog box when i am clicking on button

21804025
range	minimum
the idea is to feed the function the minimum middle and maximum value within the possible range of values

21804025
min	max
myfunction min min max

21804025
min	max
myfunction min mid max

21804076

uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
while implementing my container i tried to utilize the same patterns uinavigationcontroller and uitabbarcontroller are using

21804114
spaces	delimiter
if no delimiter is specified it defaults to a spaces

21804142
nsoperationqueue	nsblockoperation
the technique i ve used in the past is to make an nsoperationqueue with a limited amount of concurrency say 3 concurrent operations then dispatch each block as a nsblockoperation

21804151
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
kind of like a hybrid between uinavigationcontroller and uitabbarcontroller

21804164
goo.gl	bit.ly
offloading the work of shortening links either to the user or integrating goo.gl or bit.ly via their apis

21804168
google-chrome	firefox
but surprisingly the same code works fine in firefox and google-chrome

21804174
width	height
to avoid choosing between width or height you can use qpixmap.scaled

21804187
getter	setter
generate setter and getter by hands for proper declaration using manual reference counting

21804200
java.util.calendar	java.util.date
the java doc says that java.util.date is deprecated and you should use java.util.calendar instead.

21804224
google-chrome	firefox
their apis only allow stylish to add author origin styles which meant that a style that worked in firefox didn t work in google-chrome

21804278
cbperipheralmanager	cbcentralmanager
but if you initialize a cbperipheralmanager with the solicited services no need to advertise those and use a cbcentralmanager to scan for peripherals that want to use those solicited services then in the end the scanned peripheral will probably be able to use the services provided by your cbperipheralmanager once the connection is established

21804278
cbperipheralmanager	cbcentralmanager
connecting back from the peripheral side may be possible if the retrieveconnectedperipheralswithservices method on the cbcentralmanager returned the other end as cbperipheral if it has its cbperipheralmanager initialized.

21804298
mp4	h.264
my scenario is i have an ip security camera that i can successfully connect via rtsp h.264 and save the video as file segments and they play back fine either through a standalone app like vlc or via a node.js web server app that sends the video mp4 keep-alive header and streams the mp4 files previously saved by ffmpeg to a html5 video client

21804319
width	height
when auto layout does it s layout magic then it will use the intrinsic height of the content to layout the views vertically and the width of the container to size them horizontally

21804324
nexus	artifactory
the best thing is to install a repository manager like artifactory nexus archiva and store such files into the repository manager and use them as usual dependency

21804346
width	height
so if i run it on an iphone instead of an ipad the app will run but will only fill the first 1024px height and will run over the 640px width

21804390
decoder	encoder
so add 2 lines within the while loop of encoder and decoder as follows

21804442
for-loop	loops
your loops variable will not be the proper value without wrapping it in a closure because your for-loop has run to completion before the event handler is actually executed

21804457
min	max
which is not what you wantâ so let s get back to what you want you say you want an argument that takes two values to define a min and an optional max

21804457
min	max
and get your min and max values through

21804485
multiplying	add
so the computation is made by multiplying i by 2 shifting to the left in binary and add 0 or 1

21804501
post	get
but i really can not figure out how rails to receive this post request and get the data from this post request

21804532
punctuation	words
i need to remove all punctuation at the start and end of a words

21804585
portrait	landscape
i would like to use the portrait layout in the regular layout directory when the tablet is in landscape mode

21804589
apache	nginx
nginx or apache and use it reverse proxy possibilities in block s vhost s config

21804610
kde	kubuntu
if you use kde kubuntu you can fix that by changing the tooltip background color in kde system settings - application appearance - colors - colors and change the tooltip background

21804697
folder	directory
1 i downloaded the folder containing the toon library files and moved it to the the directory thirdparty toon include

21804716
qmainwindow	qwidget
the main difference between qmainwindow and qwidget is that qmainwindow comes with a menubar toolbars docks and a central widget pointer set up for you

21804716
qmainwindow	qwidget
if you don t use any of the menubar toolbars docks etc the functionality and look and feel of a qmainwindow compared to a qwidget is almost identical

21804716
qmainwindow	qwidget
with qmainwindow you set any sort of qwidget as the central widget and go from there

21804733
google-chrome	firefox
i need some help with my javascript as it behaves strangely while i am testing on internet explorer 7 but it works fine on internet explorer 8 google-chrome and firefox

21804741
width	height
dont use float simply use width 33.3 and height auto

21804748
apache	lighttpd
rack legacy tries to provide interaction with legacy environments like php and cgi while still getting the rack portability so you don t need a full apache lighttpd stack

21804748
apache	nginx
i have used for some experiments and it seems is possible to have a wordpress running and served with the rails app server without having to mess up with apache nginx files

21804901
profiling	debugging
i used the cpu profiling to debugging and found that it got stuck in a call to layoutsbelowifneeded

21804914
int	double
you re multiplying an int by a double and then storing the result back in an int

21804924
memcmp	strcmp
for strcmp you ll want to be only comparing what you know are going to be strings however sometimes this is not always the case such as reading lines of binary files and there for you would want to use memcmp to compare certain lines of input that contain nul characters but match and you may want to continue checking further lengths of input

21804947
box-sizing	border-box
also you need to use box-sizing border-box

21804947
width	height
for the first div to calculate the width height of the elements including the white borders

21804987
persistent	transient
i see persistent and transient settings

21804990
fflush	gets
however every time i run the code the id gets overwritten by gorm even though i manually set it before calling the .save fflush true failonerror true method

21804995
width	height
i have a camera placed 10 meters faraway from a portrait rectangle having width 50cm and height 15cm i want to get the dimensions of this portrait inside the image captured

21804995
width	height
the image captured has width 800 px and height 600 px

21805004
implements	extends
the goal here is to make it extremely simple to bake in this extended functionality to new forms for example by extends a new type or implements a marker interface

21805051
jobs	cron
and cron jobs

21805089
put	get
i have tried various ways to put these together but can t get it working

21805094
flask	django
with flask you have no unnecessary module that have django admin auth... by default so you can focus on your database management

21805109
entity-relationship	diagram
i created database and entity-relationship diagram

21805109
entity-relationship	diagram
now i would like have this table in my entity-relationship diagram

21805213
superclass	subclassing
i have a superclass composed by an array of int with 8 values now i want to create a subclassing to randomly pick 4 items in the array and store them in another object

21805221
width	height
a button will expand the division - increase it s height and width - to allow the division to be read

21805247
google-chrome	firefox
does not run in google-chrome or firefox

21805252
prepare	execute
what you then need to do is use the mysqli_prepare function or connection- prepare then bind the required parameters to the query and execute it

21805260
fontfamily	font-size
at the moment i am first working on my laptop which is running on windows with xampp and when i style a page with a simple fontfamily like arial and font-size 70 for example when i look at it at chrome it looks perfect

21805380
oncreate	setcontentview
remove its setcontentview function in oncreate

21805397
jacoco	sonar-runner
i m able to generate test.exec and integtest.exec jacoco but have problem to force sonar-runner sonar-jacoco-plugin to use them

21805401
google-chrome	firefox
the callback takes a time argument which depending on browser is the current time in high resolution dart vm google-chrome js or low resolution firefox sf

21805407
splunk	logstash
tools like logstash or splunk might come in handy

21805412
for-loop	loops
however i will show you another way to do a for-loop and a while loops

21805412
for-loop	loops
also a for-loop is just a easier to implement while loops

21805438
post	get
i have been trying to get my server to work but when i send post data it just keeps loading and no results are given

21805449
int	chars
you re casting something you want to store in a chars to an int

21805463
int	chars
chars c int c -32 + key + 127

21805463
int	chars
c chars int c - 32 + key + 127

21805494
hex	binary
storing binary data as either a hex or d binary bytes would be my preferred options

21805534
integer	unsigned
to parse the file i first read a 4-byte unsigned integer then depending on the value of that integer i execute different read routines

21805540
spaces	delimiter
that being said the choice of spaces as a delimiter in a list of data that contains spaces as valid characters is a terrible idea

21805547
folder	directory
in the dialog click on the public directory and then click select folder button

21805574
int	double
however a programming language needs to be able to hold multiple data types such as int double strings and 3d vectors as in physics vectors with x y and z components just to name some simple things

21805592
gulp	brunch
run client app sources watcher to rebuild your scripts styles templates brunch watch grunt job or gulp watch task

21805595
for-loop	loops
so instead of doing the regular for-loop use a foreach loops

21805601
int	double
alternatively you can store not values but pointers to instances of a class value from which other value types such as int or double would derive

21805607
vaadin	errai
if you need gwt i d rather go with a full gwt framework like vaadin or errai

21805613
tablet	galaxy
i have those permissions in my manifest and the app doesn t show up when i launch the play store on galaxy tablet

21805624
mamp	wamp
i have been working on a wordpress site locally on a pc using wamp but now have started working on a mac so i am using mamp as my development server

21805645
width	height
the width and height of a table should be large enough to fit all the cells

21805655
jobs	cron
so i used cron jobs to run a php file every day at a time i set

21805656
ubuntu	linux
alternatively i assume you are using ubuntu linux you could try -lblas instead after installing it of course - afaik ubuntu follows a different naming convention

21805691
addclass	removeclass
addclass removeclass assumes the argument is a list of classes separated by spaces it will first remove the classes fa fa-plus-square-o and then add the class fa fa-plus-square-o

21805691
addclass	removeclass
it would be same as calling addclass removeclass twice as in

21805691
addclass	removeclass
this is the power of the addclass removeclass functions you can remove just a single class name from an element even though there may be 10 other classes

21805709
post	get
the former is derived from controller and controls a web page view while the latter is derived from apicontroller and handles restful http post get with our database through a repository class tutorial i followed is this one

21805709
post	get
however my issue is this in order to restfully upload the parsed data to the db i need to go through drugentrycontroller since it is an apicontroller and has the http post get calls

21805757
implements	extends
abstract methods only mean that they must be implements further in your code by a class that extends that abstract class

21805773
nsurlcache	uiwebview
in that case query the nsurlcache if a correct response is there and if not delete the storedvalue before reloading the uiwebview

21805804
int	chars
in c toupper and many other functions take int s even though you d expect them to take chars s

21805833
superclass	subclassing
if you wish to declare a variable in a superclass which must be set by its subclassing you can define an abstract method to set that value.

21805854
stateless	stateful
note this is based in soa concepts stateless ejb s if your app is more ria oriented could be useful for you learn how to use the stateful ejb s gateway pattern

21805861
firefox	safari
those link work correctly in firefox as the syntax was used in the menu but in safari on mac and ipad iphone the page just refreshes

21805961
put	get
edit i have bits and pieces but i can t put it together to get me the desired outcome

21805970
int	chars
but yes in general a chars value passed to toupper or to any of the functions declared in needs to be converted to unsigned chars so that the implicit conversion to int won t yield a negative value and cause undefined behavior

21805970
int	chars
if int is 32 bits converting the chars value -2 to unsigned yields 4294967294

21805976
express	node.js
how do you display the results of a mongodb aggregation query using node.js express jade

21805978
int	double
if the constructor of sodamachine expects string int double parameters call the constructor passing them without specifying the type

21806001
portrait	landscape
when you rotate the device my app has quite a bit of logic to lay out the view differently for portrait landscape - remove views change frame sizes redraw views switch images etc

21806079
width	height
alternatively you can add an image with a width height of 1px and z-index of -1

21806097
for-loop	loops
the reason for this is that the text beginning at an interest is being generated after the inner loops you need to move that bit to before the for-loop that goes through the years

21806141
qtabwidget	qwidget
i can t find the way to replace the qwidget of a specific tab in a qtabwidget at runtime

21806161
superclass	subclassing	accessor	superclass
like the following code shows having class accessor defined in the superclass could have unexpected behaviours because the class accessor is the same variable for all the subclassing

21806161
superclass	subclassing	accessor	superclass
i want to have an independent class accessor for each subclassing so a possible solution is moving the cattr_accessor from the superclass and putting it in every subclassing

21806193
firefox	safari
i ve had a similar problem on both safari and firefox on mac and resolved it by clearing the browser s caches .

21806226
put	get
it can t be in my drawaword method as i put an nslog result not shown above it is doesn t get called for i 3

21806228
children	parent
there are some ways around this most notably rails provides class_attribute which provides the ability of children to inherit the value of the parent s attribute unless explicitly overridden

21806234
lxml	beautifulsoup
if you are not stuck with lxml you can give a try to beautifulsoup

21806243
int	chars
reason is that chars is a signed type which is expanded to int with all high bits set when the chars has bit 7 set exceeds 0x7f

21806252
width	margin
negative margin pulls it back to the left by half its width centering it

21806255
put	get
i need to split it on the underscore and get rid of part2.jpg and keep part1 and put that on the end of this url

21806270
hide	show
i manage to do checkbox list that makes dropdown options to show and hide when clicking on check boxes and when i don t check any of the check boxes the basic dropdown options will show only and those dropdown options are required to choose before clicking on submit

21806270
button	checkbox
the problem is when any of checkbox are selected the basic dropdown options become hidden and the other dropdown options shows but when click on submit button the message pupup outside the browser shows that there is still fields are required which the hidden dropdown options

21806270
hide	show
and this is the code for show hide

21806296
mouseup	mousedown
the mousedown and mouseup events simulate the click of the button

21806301
xna	spritebatch
xna has some things that are very thin wrappers and others that are higher level constructs game spritebatch content

21806304
for-loop	arrays
i have to add code to the class to print numbers from this arrays in order to make a for-loop

21806311
jar	manifest.mf
they had meta-inf manifest.mf but it looks like felix requires meta-inf directory in jar s directory structure it might be using getresource method to keep handle of meta-inf directory

21806341
getter	setter
use getter setter methods to access them

21806401
folder	directory
the craft folder is only one directory above www and dont understand why it cant find it

21806412
put	get
if that assumption is wrong and you re using python 2.x then input will try to evaluate the input string which means you ll get a number for the recport â but then you re not reading recaddress right unless you want to force the user to put quotes around the ip address

21806502
ubuntu	linux
you ll have more luck using our ppa unfortunately binary compatibility on linux is at best a mess we ve already got compiled pypys available for ubuntu 12.04

21806553
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
a cross-domain xmlhttprequest works on firefox safari google-chrome and ie11

21806590
button	checkbox
i have a checkbox bound to the boolean value as well as a button click function setting the boolean and both seem to work fine

21806594
width	height
you could add some metadata to go along with the sprite sheet that defines the pixel positions plus width height of each frame in the sheet

21806594
width	height
for example not to scale if you go to fetch frame 1 you would find that it is 16x32 starting at pixel position 128 and you can calculate the texture coordinates based on the width height of the whole sheet

21806594
width	height
or cut the frames into individual images all with the same width height and assemble the individual images into a sprite sheet using something like imagemagick

21806606
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu is based on debian and has this tool

21806739
boost	allocator
throwing it all together and testing side-by-side this iterator method is about 10 slower than using the custom allocator method or boost container vector

21806739
boost	allocator
the allocator and boost method have virtually identical performance

21806789
width	height
this assumes you have a web view on your page with a width of 260 and height of 135

21806798
switching	screens
note the switching i am trying to customize is on a preference screens

21806831
hide	show
let me know if you have another approach in mind rather than getting the id or class to show and hide the right elements

21806951
oncreate	findviewbyid
usually in this case in oncreate its that you forgot to new an object accessed an object before you created it or used the wrong id in a findviewbyid

21806970
pop-up	dialog
right now i have an alertdialog that pop-up with an editview for the user to put in the name of the file they want to make which i would then pass into a file object and then a writer and a new dialog is supposed to pop-up asking the user if they want to launch the music player

21807013
folder	directory
i read moodles documentation where it says that if the data root directory has to be in the site s public html folder please see that i can not create it outside it since i dont have sufficient privileges as i am using a free account

21807017
post	get
i need something that allows me to supply a string path and some parameters or just a string path but that uses a post instead of a get

21807023
width	height
wrapper the wrapper height is dependent on the browser width so its value should be dynamic

21807072
int	chars
there is no int representation of a string only of a chars

21807141
subtract	add
i cannot find my error in my program which is supposed to add and subtract ints to a queue and then print out the average and max of each queue over 500 minutes

21807149
google-chrome	firefox
tested in google-chrome firefox and ie all have the same issue

21807181
for-loop	loops
the for-loop will loops the rows and retrieve the data ex

21807199
google-chrome	firefox
this is what you do i ll be talking for google-chrome dev tools but firefox should be similar too

21807206
ubuntu	linux
for linux google out how to check display information in ubuntu type flavor what you have

21807236
waitpid	fork
if you insist on using c you can use a combination of fork and waitpid to keep a process running indefinitely

21807278
build.gradle	gradlew
unable to find any references to the android gradlew plug-in in build.gradle files

21807290
youtube	vimeo
i m not sure if it s an option for you but i tend to recommend someone else do the video hosting eg youtube vimeo

21807342
versioning	upgrade
my windows 7 ultimate is an spanish versioning i just changed the windows interface by using a windows upgrade to make it appear in english

21807360
versioning	upgrade
you ll likely need to upgrade to a higher versioning of the gradle android plugin by bumping the plugin s versioning number in the build script

21807374
folder	directory
as long as you have configured the dataroot location with the moodle data directory and placed your .htaccess file in that folder it should be fine

21807378
rss	feed
feedzirra is a gem that parses rss feed

21807378
post	get
when i make the post request like this i get a 500 internal server error and this message from my server logs

21807455
floating-point	integer
if you really need to do this in general you can resort to floating-point which means you ll probably lose some precision or use some arbitrary width integer arithmetic package like gmp

21807472
int	chars
i tried simply casting an int to chars but i don t think its possible

21807476
post	get
i m trying to get header content from a json post request

21807480
int	double
conversion from double to int does the rounding or more precisely it is truncating

21807503
int	chars
for int arrays you can not really depend on a special chars indicating the end of the array since any int value could be a valid array element value so you have to know the length of the arrays

21807508
getter	setter
the proper use case for calling a getter or setter from within the instance is when you need to take advantage of the side effects validation or computations that the getter or setter provides

21807508
getter	setter
purists will refactor the side effects validation or computations into their own private method and then call that method internally and from the getter setter

21807513
getter	setter
getter setter are for encapsulation

21807513
getter	setter
a class using getter setter for accessing its own members is extreme encapsulation

21807513
getter	setter
you may use getter setter when there is some logic in them and you want to apply it always - even for private member access

21807528
post	get
i was reading up a lot of blog post and stackoverflow answers but still i am unable to find a real world open source project which uses claims based authentication and authorization so that i can get an idea on how to actually implement these

21807553
min	max
a simple solution would be to use a group by statement on department and the min and max salary in your selection

21807553
min	max
this would give you the min and max per department

21807568
int	double
the function totamt double double double double is returning an int declare as a double and it will run just fine

21807574
uitableview	nsindexpath
i used + nsindexpath indexpathwithtableview uitableview tableview sender id sender

21807590
getter	setter
by using the same setter and getter you have exposed publicly also within the class itself you get guaranteed common behavior whenever your member variable is accessed

21807593
post	put
...to put the post params into a new hash that i could call later on in the code like this.

21807608
subtract	add
when you add or subtract values from a you are altering the content stored in the memory where a is stored means the value of a not the address

21807621
lxml	beautifulsoup
for finer control consider using lxml s beautifulsoup parser along with something like this workaround to set an empty prefix for that namespace in the output

21807822
textwrangler	textedit
i found the quotes in textedit were slanted and in textwrangler they were straight

21807822
textwrangler	textedit
i don t know enough about it - maybe i had to set the unicode different in textedit or something but i m using textwrangler now anyway because it s easier to read the code because it highlights by colour

21807823
folder	directory
the only success i have had with a finished format is by exporting the jar normally and using a folder in the same directory called images to hold the files

21807878
implements	extends
i was observing that arraylist extends abstractlist and implements list

21807891
express	everyauth
i am not sure why everyauth is not adding the path login to express

21807920
for-loop	arrays
we also don t put the code for creating an arrays the for-loop of question objects into the controller s .m file

21807924
ifs	ash	ifs	dash
you can set ifs to get around this limitation on ksh bash mksh ash and dash

21807924
for-loop	loops
as an alternative you can change from a for-loop to a while loops with read

21807934
post	get
i would like to route the same uri to two different classes based on whether the http method is get or post

21807946
getter	setter
my understanding is that as long as we setup the property we would have getter and setter method so i use the setter method to implement it

21807958
dictionary	map
how about using a dictionary to map tag name to the dictionary

21807979
post	get
get the session info cookies of login page and pass login input as a request get or post based on form action type to action page

21807981
min	max
you can set the min and max line heights for the paragraph style attribute of the string

21808018
for-loop	loops
the bug is that at the end of first iteration value of variable c becomes eof and in all next iterations loops break due to for-loop s condition and couldn t print any char

21808030
queue	fifo
queue is a fifo data structure the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed

21808040
innodb	myisam
today i try to convert my wordpress blog mysql database table only wordpress system table engines from myisam to innodb

21808103
wordpress	phpbb
i am trying to iterate through the rows in a phpbb table called phpbb_posts and extract each entry in phpbb s post_subject column and compare its value with a predefined string in wordpress php file but i am having some issues - the expressions don t evaluate to true

21808103
wordpress	phpbb
my phpbb s tables are installed in wordpress s database so i have full access to the values

21808103
wordpress	phpbb
so in other words i have a topic posted in wordpress and i have exactly the same topic posted in phpbb and i want to iterate through the phpbb s table and when i find the topic i want to run some code

21808162
google-chrome	firefox
it is working fine in firefox and google-chrome but in internet explorer the s are not visible

21808204
onfocus	onblur
you need to make use of the onblur and onfocus events for the window object

21808218

integer	unsigned
and in fact it is since returns 11111111 11111111 11111111 11111111 and an and-bitwise operated on 11111111 11111111 11111111 11111111 for an unsigned integer leaves the number unchanged.

21816751
int	chars
if you want to convert your chars to an int just subtract 0

21816758
int	double
so you first need to cast convert those int to floats or double

21816758
int	double
it s enough to cast just one int because in java int double - double

21817246
int	double
overloading methods provides flexibility to your program by allowing multiple types of entries in this case providing the loan amount as an int or a double

21817246
int	double
create another method with the same parameters except instead of int loaned make it double loaned

21817246
int	double
what your professor means is that since some may enter an int and some a double for the loaned amount it is important to make sure you will accept both types

int	double
simple types include the .net primitive types int bool double and so forth plus timespan datetime guid decimal and string plus any type with a type converter that can convert from a string

21817260
put	get
rest is a way to model an interface to an application as a collection of typically http resources on the web that respond to standard web verbs in expected fashions get to read delete to destroy put to update

21817261
hash	md5
when the file is uploaded to your http api you should calculate the md5 hash of it s contents while storing the original file name owner uid and other metadata in a relational database

21817261
hash	md5
for example assume you have a photo whose content has the md5 hash e240a38624f4a370bd2ec65cf771134b

21817261
hash	md5
assuming your nfs mount is at srv content you would write the photo to the path srv content e240 a38624f4 a370bd2ec65cf771134b.jpg -- splitting the md5 hash to create prefixed folders

21817261
hash	md5
when your user later wants to retrieve the image they can request it via the data stored in the relational database your api can look up the photo s md5 hash and then locate it on the filesystem using a similar operation

21817291
rss	feed
i m using codeigniter library and i use the code below to generate an xml rss feed file

21817300
box-sizing	border-box
first trigger the box-model with box-sizing border-box

21817391

when i m trying to select one of the items and check developer tools in chrome to see if it move append to to body during the drag

21817401
concave	angle	concave	convex
3 - find the concave bounding polygon for each group of circles very similar to the algorithm to find the convex polygon around a group of points you already wrote and your last question angle between vectors was related

21817404
post	get
but also you could use post method instead of get and send your data in request body

21817458
hide	show
you could show it and hide it on window resize so that you make sure the menu is always visible in big screens and not visible in small screens

21817480
multiplication	exponent
that should increment the exponent assuming that the number is normalized both before and after the multiplication

21817543
google-chrome	firefox
after many many iterations here is my final answer to getscript s and loading asynchronously multiple scripts in a specific strict order with per script loaded callback option and overall callback on completion tested in jquery 2.1+ and modern versions of google-chrome firefox plus the forsaken internet explorer

21817640
inherited	properties
the derived class has access to only it s members but inherited the properties of the base class

21817753
avro	thrift
avro thrift might be an exception since those support schema evolution

21817761
width	height
judging from the logs your initial view s frame self.imagelogoview is reset to a width and height of 0 at some point

21817761
width	height
first select your imagelogoview and add constraints for width and height by checking the respective boxes as shown in the screenshot below

21817821
subtract	add
i am having trouble finding a way to detect for a + or - to either add subtract values in the table

21817826
hash	salt
you need to check using the salt as the salt and not the hash

21817844
crypt	salt
the variable has the salt prepended to it because crypt will automatically do that for you

21817844
crypt	salt
crypt will extract the salt from the because it knows the expected length of the salt based on the algorithm used

21817844
hash	salt
the password is not the same for you because you are using a salt when you originally hash the password to put in your database but you are not salting the password later when you check against the database

21817844
hash	salt
usually you will randomly generate the salt string for each password as you are doing and then save the salt string to the database along with the hash password either in the same column or its own column so that you can use the same salt to check the user s password on login

21817859
post	get
i bet i have to use get post methods

21817875

spaces	linefeed
sid â â the s represent any type of spaces tab spaces form linefeed

21818002
width	height
use this in youre code - your problem was that it had to be set to position absolute otherwise it ll just give you the width and height you need

21818015
installation	upgrade
even if never ever having an installation to upgrade either tool c++builder remains a bargain compared to visual studio

21818040
vb.net	vb6
so one would use vb.net to create a com object and then reference that com object from ms access so just like we set a reference to outlook or word from access such com objects are not limited to applications you purchase but you are most free to create your own com objects vb6 vb.net c# or whatever

21818086
cout	cin
i don t consider it smoother as cin cout dialogue is not smooth imho

21818109
post	put
my solution combines bits from those two post as shown below note i made the converter private static but it works the same if put in it s own class file

21818142
free	malloc
i am currently doing some university work in c+ really c just swap malloc and free for new and delete

21818152
width	height
a solution might be to avoid the scaling by resizing the width and height yourself

21818174
inherited	base-class	public	protected
if you use a base-class and inherited off of it just have the things you don t want derived classes to have just give them the private access modifier and then protected or public for the others depending on the situation of course

21818202
width	height
set panel width and height to same as the linked browser so

21818219
super	extends
you cant call super on a constructor that doesnt extends anything

the language model is usually a probability function assuming the article was created by a model that randomly selects tokens words bigrams ... n-gram

21818237
int	double
the double 3 is a conversion from an int int to a floting point number double

21818290
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
if you don t know how to work properly with events such as manualresetevent or autoresetevent you can find yourself drowning with excess code only to try and synchronize the set wait on them sometime even adding additional events just to do so

21818290
atomic	interlocked
usually in cases of consumer producer problems i tend to use the interlocked class and it s amazing atomic functions

21818295
maven	pom.xml
and if your project is a maven project add the following dependencies to your pom.xml

21818310
folder	directory
another option is to use windows explorer - tortoisesvn - properties on the root directory folder then multi-select the bugtrack properties click remove then recursive then commit

21818338
prepare	execute
you can t prepare and execute at once multiple sql statements with prepare and execute

21818338

21818440
subtract	add
i am having trouble finding a way to detect for a + or - to either add subtract values in the table

21818443
inherited	properties
secondly simplify your inherited chain to just indicate the phone type using an enum value properties

21818514
int	double
i want to change the item type from int to double so i have at least 3 places to attend and change it

21818516
inherited	properties
the problem is that the font size is one of the properties that is inheritet from it s parent and values like small don t set absolute sizes but relative to the inherited size

21818557
post	get
in this way you can pass the somevalue as a parameter get or post and you can process it on the server-side

21818570
vbscript	jscript
that is automatic event binding in jscript similar to the object_eventname naming convention in vbscript

21818579
portrait	landscape
i m writing a program that detects a change in orientation of the device portrait to landscape etc.

21818585
superclass	subclassing
when an instance of type y or z subclassing is treated as the base type superclass x this is an upcast

21818591
clang	llvm
now we can also test a plain c version for comparison using clang llvm as compiler

21818606
children	parent
i have two tables parent and children and they are trivial for this question

21818611
width	height
i want to set the dp of the table s width and height and have its contents automatically expand and contract to fit the table

21818612
antialiasing	transparent
on the mac it seems as images are not antialiasing correctly at the edges which will at some sizes leave transparent antialiasing pixels at the edges

21818617
jscrollpane	jviewport
the jviewport uses the component s view s preferred size as a bases for determining if the view expands beyond the visible bounds of the jscrollpane because you ve seen fit to ignore this feature the components have begun to break down

21818670
google-chrome	firefox
ie 8 is probably compensating but google-chrome and firefox probably have no idea what it is

21818670
google-chrome	firefox
with the correct mime type being set in apache then google-chrome and firefox will more likely react in the way you expect it to

21818672
google-chrome	firefox
the code below is displaying correctly in one line in both firefox and ie but google-chrome for some reason is displaying it in two lines as if both span and button elements had display block

21818701
folder	directory
it creates a node_modules directory in my root folder which i can change by using --prefix option

21818710
width	height
it turned out that for my purpose a framelayout with its width and height set to a specific dp was best

21818710
width	height
that way i can control the view and ensure it has the right height and width

21818720
folder	directory
my css files are in the same directory as the views folder

21818803
oncreate	setcontentview
above setcontentview in the oncreate method it will do what i desire

21818822
pdostatement	bindvalue
if you use pdo the replacement can be done using pdostatement s bindvalue method

21818832
imperative	declarative
with the sort of functional and declarative programming f# encourages there are a lot of cases where what is most naturally done in an imperative way in c# is most naturally done with a recursive approach

21818836
try-catch	exception-handling
i tried to use try-catch to identify the problem and used every possible catch exception-handling as.

21818846

i tried using location.assign and that seemed to work in firefox when i followed it up with a location.reload immediately afterwards but it didn t work in google-chrome

21818893
put	get
i looked at some examples of where to place the constructor and it seems like it is placed around my rollbutton class but i have tried to put it in multiple times and in multiple places but i cannot seem to get it right

21818930
int	double
important note places where your code is called may have to be refactored if you want to change from double to int

21818930
int	double
so with that in mind you can create your class as a generic base class that accepts a value type and you d then create a pass-through subclass that defines that value type int double etc.

21818930
int	double
and you would call it with just the numeric values as per my first note if you change the underlying generic type from int to double this will continue to work

21818930
int	double
however if you change from double to int then the calling code won t compile until it is refactored

21819023
entity-relationship	diagram
how would these tables relate to each other in an entity-relationship diagram in the format 1 n --- relationship name ---- n 1

21819034
strcpy	strtok
but the neither the strcpy nor the strtok are needed

21819116
google-chrome	safari
the other two - google-chrome and safari -- are fairly vague understandably so since these 2 are not open source

21819123
put	get
to get the correct order of evaluation you need to put parenthesis around the other function calls and + plus their parameters like this

21819151
put	get
should work on it s own and put foo as a get parameter automatically as it is not specified in your route rule it works in the twig templates haven t tested it tho

getter	setter
many of the php oop tutorials i am seeing are say to use getter and setter

21819202
getter	setter
avoid writing naive setter and getter

21819202
getter	setter
when writing classes in php you can save time and speed up your scripts by working with object properties directly rather than writing naive setter and getter

21819240
getter	setter
the main purpose of a getter setter is when there is a side effect

21819240
getter	setter
to do this you might not have an actual value for the width property just a getter setter

21819249
post	get
however in the more general case one needs to be able to pass a query string to the get section so the header must be at the bottom of the post section

21819252
notepad++	scite
1 the reg definition in notepad++ same as scite

x86	64bit
i downloaded the sdl2 developer which is for windows x64 my windows 7 is 64bit but the visual studio 2012 i have is an x86 version

21819335
getter	setter
as my near-namesake says the main purpose of getter and setter is side effects

21819335
getter	setter
the reason you would always use getter and setter is code maintainability

21819335
getter	setter	accessor	properties
ruby makes this into a general dogma there are no public properties only getter setter called accessor in the ruby world precisely because the only interaction allowed to the objects is message-passing unless you employ magic

21819399
post	get
i strongly suggest you do not send any json in a request parameter of a get request but rather send it in the body of a post request

21819452
glyphicons	twitter-bootstrap-rails
when using the twitter-bootstrap-rails gem the glyphicons aren t working

inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
note a class declared as final cannot be extended or inherited i.e there cannot be a subclassing of the superclass

21819559
versioning	upgrade
the simplest way is to upgrade to versioning 1.7 of the google maps sdk for ios released february 2014

i want to have a dropdown box at the end of that line a4 which shows a list of functions that could be used on these numbers for example sum average max min and for that to dictate the formula in a5

21819682
addition	multiplication
i hear this statement quite often that multiplication on modern hardware is so optimized that it actually is same speed as addition

21819684
everyauth	connect	express	everyauth
in my case in connect i had it after everyauth and in express i had the configure before everyauth

21819697

the cryptography class i am using works as it encrypts and decrypts if i don t put and get the string from sharedpreferences

21819699
compass	singularitygs
the compass framework can t load find the singularitygs framework extension

21819771
addition	multiplication
this is an even more complex answer than simply multiplication versus addition

21819771
multiplying	multiplication	multiplying	addition	addition	multiplication
most of the reasons why is that multiplication in the act of multiplying along with an addition step remember what it was like to multiplying decimal numbers prior to using a calculator

21819771
multiplying	add	multiplying	addition
functionally a multiplying will always take more time than an add because it combines a true multiplying along with a true addition step

21819866
google-chrome	firefox
cleaned firefox and google-chrome history and page cache not joy

21819866
google-chrome	firefox
i get no errors in firebug firefox or google-chrome and my cookies are working although it says .nilandspalce.com

21819896
post	get
i would get results such as this well it won t let me post images sorry

21819918
primes	palindrome
there are a huge number of palindrome that won t be primes

21819918
primes	palindrome
the sieve is pretty fast and after that you ll only have a few thousand primes to test most of which will not be palindrome

21819929
width	height
now the getactivity method works with no problems and i can now access the framelayout view of the main project and get the width and height of that view

21819937
put	get
what i really want is to get all the persons data from db then get the photos and put it on a autocompletebox

21819956
irc	xmpp
sniff it could be checked with special information in adapter and possible checks below for my environment on shell xmpp irc

21819958
post	get
we post to the log in a loop so that we get all the elements we selected separately

21819986
vb6	vba
since your title specifies vba and vb6 i ll reference the type of subroutines used by those languages

21819986
vb6	vba
vba and vb6 use function for subroutines that return a value and sub for those that do not

21819987
width	height
the game window is 1280 pixels in width and 720 pixels in height

21820014

- on the first onfocus event the elements are added and visible they are removed onfocusout onblur with no problem

21820078
maven	pom.xml
i added the dependencies to the pom.xml but my project can t resolve the joda libraries even with a maven clean install

21820103
dbcontext	objectcontext
for ef 5 or below your data service should inherit from dataservice where t is a dbcontext or objectcontext

21820107
uiviewcontroller	uipageviewcontroller
i have a uipageviewcontroller subclass with a bunch of uiviewcontroller subclasses contained inside

21820107
uiviewcontroller	uipageviewcontroller
at some point in one of the uiviewcontroller subclasses if the user does something i want to remove the whole uipageviewcontroller system to reveal just the underlying subview it was initially added to

21820107
uiviewcontroller	uipageviewcontroller
where in my uiviewcontroller subclass i have a reference to the uipageviewcontroller subclass it s contained in and i tell the uipageviewcontroller subclass to be removed

21820107
uiviewcontroller	uipageviewcontroller
i m afraid it feels sloppy as if i remove the uipageviewcontroller that contains the uiviewcontroller making the call maybe the second removefromsuperview call won t end up being called as the view would be removed

21820141
onresume	onpause
you should clearly remove references in onpause or onstop instead of in onresume

21820165
children	parent
assuming player is considered the parent and stats rankings are the children your mapping should look something like this

21820170
hide	show
i know this can be done with show hide feature of jquery but i am trying to keep it simple

21820175
mp3	wav
i ve created a simple batch script to convert wav files to mp3 in a folder on my server

21820185
libstdc++	libc++
debugging the program just shows a call stack containing __mingw_crtstartup clang is using libstdc++ as it didn t install libc++ and std cout

21820185
std	ostream
edit the same thing happens when using other ostream manipulators such as std dec and std unitbuf

21820189
mouseup	mousedown
and it seems it is mousedown event that is misbehaving mouseup works fine

21820256

i need to show hide some divs based on what is selected and it is working correctly for one of the selects that has the hardcoded html options

21820297
solaris	aix
this code works on hpux pa-risc redhat aix and solaris

21820326
inherited	subclassing
the way i currently have things i only have to implement saving functionality in persistabledatatype and then every subclassing inherited that functionality

21820334
put	get	post	get	post	put
do i need to make a get handler put handler delete handler post handler etc- and pass the files to a switch statement

21820363
rsa	dsa	rsa	aes
fingerprints are usually associated with asymmetric encryption keys e.g rsa dsa ecc â they are not typically used for symmetric keys such as aes and as such there is no standard way of doing this

21820385
post	get
the idea is to attach meaning behind http verbs get post are two you might be familiar with in order to affect change of data

21820402
int	double	int	chars
that ll make things easier and probably save memory since you can use a chars or short for operators and no memory wasted for saving the type of value also if you only use 32-bit int and don t need double then you can save some 4 bytes than if using union for int and double

21820402
int	double	int	chars
you can use a double type stack for all beside a operators stack probably of type chars or if it s small int

21820402
int	double
with 1 double stack you can do anythings because a double can contain all int type s range without loss of precision

21820402
int	double
you don t need to worry about int operations anymore just do everything in double unless there are specific int operators

21820402
int	double
if you don t want to store int as double then you can use nan-boxing or nunboxing punboxing like firefox s js engine in which if the value is int then the upper 16 of 64 bits are 1s otherwise it s double or pointer which you probable wouldn t use

21820423
maven	pom.xml
i m getting the following error after importing the project from maven pom.xml to mulestudio

21820444
777	tmp
i ve tried to fix it by changing permissions for tmp uwsgi.sock to 777

21820463
for-loop	arrays
because now the arrays elements go from 0 to numplay - 1 which fits with the accesses in the for-loop

21820476
int	double
my main problem is that i cannot understand calculate how i can use an overload method to choose between an int or a double

21820476
int	double
to explain i m trying to get my program to use user input to convert the value to either int to a double or vice-versa and store the result to show the correct answers

21820476
int	double
hereâ s where the overloading comes in some applications will define the amount as an int and others will define it as a double

21820476
int	double
if you convert the input value for the amount loaned to an int and store it in an int variable you can then convert the value of this int to a double and store the result of this conversion in a double variable

21820476
int	double
the use of cast operators to either convert int values to double or double values to int

21820595
width	height
the color_type byte is byte 25 after the 8-byte signature that begins at byte 0 4-byte length 4-byte ihdr chunk name 4-byte width 4-byte height and 1-byte bit_depth

21820595
width	height
the uncompressed is width height pixel_size and compressed is the size of the file you are checking

21820599
int	chars
basically i have several different int columns in my model income taxes and for each of them i need to check when the form is submitted and remove illegal chars which i m doing by setting a virtual attribute and using tr to strip the chars

21820610
put	get
if i call carrarray .drive and i get a honda it should out put a different value than if the space were occupied by a ford

21820626
int	double
how to test if a double is an int

21820626
int	double
convert double to int rounded down

21820642
clang	llvm
i managed to build clang + llvm 3.4 on cygwin 1.7.28 x86

21820642
clang	llvm
without it clang will fallback to its colorless mode because llvm wouldn t be able to detect whether the terminal supports colors

21820642
clang	llvm
this is the easiest and longest part and for the most part everything in llvm + clang s documentation applies here

21820642
clang	llvm
even if you only need clang you ll still need the llvm source code

21820642
clang	llvm
after extracting both clang and llvm move the clang s directory into the tools subdirectory of llvm

21820642
clang	llvm
if everything goes alright you can start building installing which will build both clang and llvm

21820669
width	height
i want them all to be the same width and height word wrap their contents and have a strong title text with summary text all text vertically aligned to the middle of the button

21820669
width	height
i ve achieved fixed width buttons and word wrap but i can t work out where to go from here to get them all the same height and then of course vertically align that text to the middle

21820716
rpm	yum
now remove any prior installation of git through rpm file or yum package manager

21820744
int	chars
note that if data s length is longer than the max value an int can store this invokes undefined behavior but that is unlikely unless int is very small or the string is very very long billions of chars

21820802
hide	show

21820803
fseek	ftell
the fseeko and ftello functions are identical to fseek and ftell except that the offset argument of fseeko and the return value of ftello is of type off _t instead of long

21820803
fseek	ftell
as much as possible try to avoid any using of ftell and fseek

21820810

i need to read the asynchronous result from post request but i can t because i get alert data before return result

21835119
width	height
i saw that you can set an onvideosizechangedlistener for a mediaplayer to get the width and height of a video

21835799
getter	setter
you can certainly put code into them and in fact adding code is the only reason to write more than eg as the empty non-abstract getter setter will be automatically generated at compile time but it s extremely uncommon to see a getter modifying a field as you ve done with area

21835799
getter	setter
implement the same behavior in c# getter setter

21836626
width	height
what i have been attempting is to use a transparent image that is 60 width of the header graphic same height - that way it would resize proportionately along with the header graphic but getting it to properly fill the table or stay 60 or do anything according to plan has proven to not work

21836656
postfix	dovecot
where do dovecot and postfix retrieve user accounts from

21836656
postfix	dovecot
dovecot and postfix do not maintain their own lists of user accounts they just take some existing list

21836656
postfix	dovecot
for example several years ago i had configured dovecot and postfix so that they were taking list of user accounts and respective e-mail addresses storage paths etc from mysql database

i don t know how dovecot and postfix are configured on your server

21836722
postgresql	mysql
what i would recommend is storing your users in a sql database such as postgresql mysql or sqlite

21836722

the postfix page has a few howto s on the subject and so does dovecot

i think that taking action to hash passwords with a salt is a good step for securing your application and accessing higher security levels

21836915
apache	nginx
nginx apache and node.js are all their own separate servers

21836915
apache	nginx
there are quite common cases where apache or nginx sits as a proxy server in front of a node.js server

21836915
apache	nginx
it s very possible to have nginx apache and node.js all running at the same time on the same machine but they will have to be running on different ports

21836915
apache	nginx
but your question how can i set up nginx to run both apache lamp and node.js on same server doesn t really make sense since nginx doesn t run apache or node.js

21836922
apache	nginx
if you have single site written on php and you want to enable socket.io you may bind nginx on 80 port the default http port apache on 8080 and node.js server on 3000 apache and node might have other

21837578
hash	salt
considering that you deleted the salt the hash will now have a different behavior compared to one with a provided salt thus it will output different hash for the same input which means permission is denied and will remain like this until you come back to the exact same salt

superclass	subclassing
the method invoked by this.test in the superclass constructor is however the overridden method in subclassing

21837764
for-loop	loops
the error you re getting is happening because the compiler doesn t know whether the for-loop will be entered so it think that it s possible for loops to be skipped in which case there would be no return statement

google-chrome	firefox
it works in google-chrome and firefox as well

teamcity however will not easily allow you to run tests before a commit as it uses your vcs to access the code you want it to build and test although you can configure it to allow a private build on your personal git branch pulling your changes into the head only if your tests all pass but this is overkill for most teams and you can probably achieve something similar with jenkins hudson or any other ci server

21862238
versioning	upgrade
this upgrade path apparently caused visual studio 2013 to fail to load the sql server object explorer menu item because i assume there were versioning conflicts or something with the sql-related applications that visual studio 2012 or 2013 pro had installed

21862252
jar	war
if all your service packages are in just one deployable war ear you don t need to create a separate jar to contain this single soaphandler implemenation

21863136
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
if you need to load from a well-defined filesystems fat or ntfs this is more tricky you have only 450 bytes of space because 60 of the 512 bytes are used by the filesystems internally for code that interprets the data of the filesystems finds the file containing the code and loads it into memory

21863175
google-chrome	firefox
it works just fine on google-chrome and firefox but on ie it does not work at all

var1 is an int and var2 is a datetime and then i have this error conversion failed when converting date and or tiem from chars string

21863340
fileoutputstream	filewriter
creating a new filewriter or fileoutputstream already creates the file if it doesn t exist so your createfile method is pointless unless you really need to check whether or not the file previously exists

21863358
oodbms	db4o
while studying i came across a project called db4o which is an approach implemented of using oodbms for java and .net only so this could be another reason of lack of generality for all types of platforms and languages

21863381

if i could i d use apache cxf to generate the beans for me but the problem is that the wadl is under an invalid https certificate + basic authentication and getting wadl2java to work under these conditions are taking more time than i d like to spend too bad it isn t wsdl so i could just create the stubs from inside eclipse fast and easy

21863504
put	get
i am trying to get data from html form via php and put it through loop x times for each input

21863524
post	get
2 when you open a page in the browser excluding form submit with post method it makes a get request instead of post so if in the server side it is checked _get then your post request will not be considered

21863524
submit	submission
4 if you are submission a form be sure to set the submit button with its name and value as well because similar to hidden fields this can be checked as well

21863534
sudo	passwd
you can also allow various commands to be run via sudo without a passwd by particular users by using the nopasswd option in etc suoders

21863534
sudo	passwd
however now that you are aware of the risks it is possible to use sudo -ks to have sudo read the passwd from stdin

21863544
printf	strlen
my approach was to parse the format string to find the various s d f p args creating a running sum of strlen s itoa s and strlen format_string to get something guaranteed to be big enough to allocate a proper buffer for printf

21863602
folder	directory
add a blank file called fan.props to the root directory of your project folder

21863607
subtraction	addition
computer hardware can detect a borrow in subtraction by looking at whether a carry occurred in the corresponding addition

21863607
subtraction	addition
if there is no carry in the addition then there is a borrow in the subtraction

21863607
subtraction	addition
if there is a carry in the addition then there is no borrow in the subtraction

21863607
subtract	addition
this addition has a carry so there is no borrow in the corresponding subtract

21863607
subtraction	addition
i know you know if one occurred by whether a carry happened in the addition but doing raw subtraction what is really a borrow

21863608

after conversion they should accept number or maybe string if is array of strings as an argument and return jquery collection with created checkbox button

21863691
int	double
since ypos is declared as an int the double value is being truncated to 409 which is the defined behavior when casting from double to int

21863691
int	double
but i would still store the result in a double instead of an int to avoid truncating

21863732
post	put
what you could try is using the feed dialog with the to parameter â if you are willing to put a dialog of your own in front of it that lets the user chose a post target

21863747

tokudb	myisam	prepare	execute	innodb	tokudb	innodb	myisam
i have prepare the following sql statements to compare the performance behavior of myisam innodb and tokudb insert is execute for 100000 times

21863823
tokudb	myisam	innodb	tokudb	innodb	myisam
at the beginning the insert performance of innodb is almost 50 times slower than myisam and tokudb is 40 times slower than myisam

21863823
innodb	myisam
then i figure out the setting of innodb-flush-log-at-trx-commit 2 on innodb to make its insert behavior similar with myisam

21863823
tokudb	myisam	innodb	tokudb	innodb	myisam
upon a million dataset each 10k select statments cost 10 and 15 seconds by myisam and innodb individually but tokudb requires about 40 seconds

21863840
children	parent
i ve been told to create some children processes of a same parent process and send them seeds by using pipes so they can produce some random numbers all for their own

21863840
children	parent
when i go with this code parent creates num_players children but i can t seem to use them in another for-loop since they had terminated at the end of the case 0

21863843

express	node.js
i have an application with node.js express and html

21863875
children	parent	min	max
either the keys of parent nodes are always greater than or equal to those of the children and the highest key is in the root node this kind of heap is called max heap or the keys of parent nodes are less than or equal to those of the children and the lowest key is in the root node min heap

21863883
int	double
to keep your code stable so your opengl output behaves nicely you should probably do all or as much as possible of your calculations using double so that truncation effects do not accumulate and at the end where i assume you need an int pixel number either always round to generate an int value or truncate but not mix the two

21863894
subtract	add
we dont actually subtract we add the negative number a - b a + -b and we know that for twos complement the negative of a number you invert and add one

21863894
subtract	add
so to subtract 7 - 5 we want to add 0111 + 0101 + 1

21863894
subtract	add
so in general subtract means use the add operation but ones complement invert the second operand on the way into the adder

21863927
int	double
i found this only with string neither int nor int nor double nor double nor own classes implementing comparable

21863938
width	height
so just make sure the topview has some small dimensions like x 0 y 0 width 320 height 43 and bottomview like x 0 y 40 width 320 height 528

21863943
getter	setter
for clean code the least that would be required is that the variable be private and have getter and setter functions

21863954
children	parent
you ll need the parent to wait on the children in a later loop

ubuntu	linux
it always worked fine on windows but now i have to execute this on linux fedora and ubuntu for now and it s just don t work

21864117
try-catch	exception-handling
so if you swallow the exception-handling in try-catch blocks inside your methods then they will not be handled by the error filters

21864117
try-catch	exception-handling
you need to decide when you want to manually handle the exception-handling inside your code using try-catch blocks and in that case manually log the exception-handling with the aid of a base controller class or a helper class or let the exception-handling bubble and be handled by your filters

21864140
for-loop	loops
you ll have to replace your call with an actual for-loop and then inside your loops create the td tags for index and index+1

21864148

objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
the constructor of objectinputstream reads a stream header that is written by the constructor of objectoutputstream

21864408

from the compute engine side we offer supported images for several linux distributions including debian and centos

i think you are going to have to make the extra keyboard act as a different type of hid device maybe a different type of device altogether

21864831
uiview	subviews
it is not possible to add just a uilabel and have the swipe act on that it has to be on a uiview with the label as a subviews to it

21864842

for handling the cron jobs better you might consider using the whenever gem that helps a lot and keeps the cron setup in your app

if the data will always be in the format of int int double fname lname just read in the data and do not store it

21864953

your iife is aware of the var module on line 1 because its show and hide methods are referencing module.loader.fade

21865016
jobs	cron
i have done in the past as you have and written a service to manage these sorts of cron jobs but to be honest i ended up writing the required task not in php but in c or c++ as it worked out faster in the actual service itself.

21865045

mkmapview	mkoverlay
a common flaw i ve seen is that the mkoverlay is holding a strong reference to the mkoverlayview mkoverlayrender and the mkmapview

21865329
mkmapview	mkoverlay
this causes a retain cycle because the mkmapview holds a strong reference to the mkoverlay instances as well

21865352

21865545
division	modulo
the modulo divides value by 0.5 and returns the remainder from the division

21865562
onchange	onkeyup
since onchange needs a blur to trigger use onkeyup for immediate change

21865585
pull	push
a local repository can have more than one remotes but it can only have a single branch section for each branch in the config file mapping the branch to a specific remote it would not make sense to map the branch to more remotes anyway since the branch section is only used to simplify the push and pull commands allowing you to omit the remote and branch arguments

21866266
comparator	comparable
comparable comparator seems to be the wrong approach entirely

21866269

as you pointed out your state is localised and the put 7 doesn t thread through to either get so we haven t managed to get rid of the or combinator

21866436
lisp	scheme
with lisp in the question i guess you meant common lisp and it is definitely not functional but a multi paradigm language and since it s not guaranteed to do tco you need to use loop where you in scheme would use tail recursion

21866437
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
the background cover property of css3 is working fine in other mobile browsers google-chrome firefox uc opera etc but on the iphone it doesn t show the images at all

it means get the element at a 0 1 0 and a 0 1 2 and put it into the same array

21866528
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
it works beautifully in firefox but of course does not work in google-chrome or safari

21866530
postgresql	mysql
mysql and postgresql on the other hand use separate files to represent each table so they can drop a table simply by deleting a file which is much faster

21866535
google-chrome	safari
note that as of version 26 google-chrome is no longer a webkit browser either however safari still is and you should keep the prefixed version for that reason + old google-chrome version compatibility

21866584
margin	font-size
wrap your image s in a paragraph tag with margin font-size and line-height set to 0

21866596

so firefox and google-chrome only have 32bit versions out there of course there are test develop versions out there but nothing official

21866658
wordpress	vbulletin
i have a wamp web server running two instances of vbulletin and two instances of wordpress

21866824
width	height
basically your line height padding left width and height come in to play

21866942

21866954
put	get
i have put this dependency in the pom.xml but still get the error

21867029
vsto	add-in
globals.thisaddin.application can be only used in vsto add-in

21867035
google-chrome	firefox
however google-chrome distorts text during transitions and there isn t much i can do about that so when actually presenting i d like to use something like firefox or even ie because they always anti-alias text nicely

21867035
google-chrome	firefox
it s true that they were started apart when i logged a date.now during the start of each animation there was roughly a 4ms difference in google-chrome and a 3ms difference in firefox though some of that overhead can be attributed to the creation of the date object and there is still a lot of optimisation to go on this

21867035
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome has a bigger time difference yet firefox is the one with the gap in the animation

21867050
folder	directory
in this setup path to deployment is a regular directory without a .git folder

21867129
keydown	keyup
this could also be done with keyup or keypress however keydown makes it happen much quicker and allows you to easily get the previous value

21867141
implements	extends
if the use case from your go app server is straight forward enough you may want to implements access by using an api call to your gae service perhaps extends the service to receive the api calls

21867196
titlebar	window
you can actually change the window styles to un-maximized it and give it a titlebar etc

i ve got a preview tool that - when the user selects an orientation re-lays out the screen to have a wider landscape or higher portrait preview window containing a generated image

21867353

i ve looked into pattern matching and regex s but those seem to require specific chars and i m not sure how to parse by the int i want

21867362
rss	feed
i used apache abdera in a servlet in the past to parse an xml rss feed and convert it to json

21867368

21867766
width	height
so this script does what i m after only that it doesn t work width a fixed height

21867769
onclick	onmousedown
i suggest you to try to avoid writing unobtrusive code such inline event handlers like onclick onmousedown etc because different browser work differently

21867779
oncreate	setcontentview
your oncreate method does not use setcontentview to set the contents of your activity so it will be left blank and that s probably what s leading you to believing that the application is hung

21867790
inherited	subclassing
a subclassing does not inherited the private members of its parent class

21867790
superclass	subclassing	public	protected
however if the superclass has public or protected methods for accessing its private fields these can also be used by the subclassing

21867792
for-loop	loops
if you switch to a regular for-loop then you will also have to use an iife immediately executing function expression to capture a unique value for d for each iteration of loops like here

21867799
post	get
i want to achieve the same as accessing post or get parameters in custom authorization mvc4 web api but it only works in the case of a get request

21867799
post	get
so i m trying to post an image and a string to the web api but the actioncontext.actionarguments in the actionfilter is empty when doing a post request but is working when doing a get request

21867826
google-chrome	safari
it doesn t work in google-chrome or safari

21867829

21867889
min	max
i am searching the form that mask values 998 and that point is transparency to matplotlib and masking when calc max and min

21867926
put	get
i advocate producing qa tasks first during planning to encourage a test driven mentality - the qa may have to literally put themselves forward to get this adopted

21867952
jobs	cron
i don t mean cron jobs

21867952
jobs	cron
sometimes this que could be 4000 items long other times it could be empty for a long period of time - therefore i don t foresee cron jobs working and calling it from the original file would cause long load times for the user executing the original script

21868002
spaces	delimiter
cut will cut lines by a delimiter given with -d in this case a spaces and you can then use -f to select a field in this case the first one

21868025
int	chars
a switch statement is useful when you need to select one of several alternatives based on the value of an int a chars or a string variable

21868042
post	get
in fact i am not sure it sends the post in the right way and what i get from that return res is system.threading.tasks.task 1 system.string

21868170
width	height
i have a screen with say 500 width and 400 height and i have a vector with a bunch of shapes

21868174
dictionary	map
as it stands your facebookfeedstorytag would need to map the entire array and the dictionary it contains into a transformable attribute

21868251
put	get
but the log will no longer get generated and when i put dispaly_errors on as well nothing happens

21868261
width	height
my image class stores a pointer to an array of pixels on the heap and has member variables for width and height

21868261
width	height
i can rotate the image by creating a new image instance where width and height are swapped and the new instance s pixel array is filled in using data from the previous image s array applying the right rotation math of course however instead of returning the new instance i d like the previous instance to reassign its this pointer to the new instance

21868261
width	height
i m trying to find better ways to do the rotation that doesn t need to replace the instance such as creating a new pixel array and redirecting the pointer but for some reason swapping the width and height is interfering is the save function when i go to write the data to the file so i still have work to do there

21868266
google-chrome	firefox
i m trying to create a radial gradient using compass and it renders fine in google-chrome but when i view it in firefox or ie the gradient squishes back down to a circle instead of elongated ellipse

21868458
int	chars
i need help figuring out how to turn the numbers in a chars array into int

21868463
iad	interstitial
the sample iad code for interstitials uses the main viewcontroller to present the full-screen interstitial ad

21868482
bitarray	bitset
so far i ve seen gmpy2 and bitarray libraries as well as std bitset in the c++ stdlib which i can use with cython

21868482
bitarray	bitset
finally i wonder if the memory-overhead of gmpy or bitarray objects in python is worth it when i can just use std bitset which probably uses the least memory of all

21868511
lxml	beautifulsoup
i d recommend lxml over beautifulsoup when you start scraping alot of pages the speed advantage of lxml is hard to ignore

21868534
put	get
for query 2 domain and method put get ... as composite key timestamp as clustering column you might need to add uuid or request id as clustering id to make your compound primary key unique

21868547
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
this is supported by firefox 3.6+ ie 10+ google-chrome 2+ safari 5+ opera 19+ ie mobile 10+ ios 5+ and android 3+

21868561
put	get
i would say less is more- if you can get rid of code do it- i would suggest you remove this in your controller unless you are doing something you are not showing and put it in your directive in step one

21868620
int	chars
you are also going to need to have an array counters for sake of argument of 256 int all initialized to zero and your loop will increment the entry in counters corresponding to the chars just read

21868663
int	double
with a custom comparator but i cannot use the compareto method for double int

21868697
width	height
i realize that this would work if i have the div othervids a height and width but if i do this the website won t be responsive anymore

21868755
folder	directory
i m trying to open a .txt file from a program in my bin directory but i m not sure what search path it uses to find folder

21868779
post	get
probably a simple question but i m just learning rails and tryin to get comments to post to my database

21868789
width	height
as the window is resized smaller it continually checks the window width and once it hits 480 px the code adds a class called iframe-class-resize and sets the width and height to that class

21868789
width	height
the problem is that setting the width and height attributes adds them directly to the element and not the class itself

21868789
width	height
therefore removing the class does not remove the new width and height

21868789
width	height
ideally the parent div should have the width and height explicitly defined but the way this site is currently setup that won t always be possible

21868789
width	height
instead the content is retaining the resized width and height since the .css function applies css changes directly to elements rather than to the classes

21868800
debian	linux
my advice would be download debian linux and install it to a computer you don t use

21868826
pycrypto	m2crypto
it appears that only a private application needs pycrypto or m2crypto neither of which i can install

21868830
boost	stl
i know that a lot of the new stl features are inspired or pulled from boost libs and sometimes the equivalents can quickly be switched out

21868959
versioning	upgrade
now for my problem in my class i have a simple function to add a column in a table if it doesn t exist in case there s a versioning upgrade

save for introducing margin padding or text-indent

21869007
opera	safari

21869019
width	height
this will reset the width height you applied to the element

21869060
ng-switch	ng-include
i feel there must be a better way to compile a template than with ng-include or ng-switch

21869084
onmousemove	mouseevent	mouseevent	onmousedown	onmousedown	onmousemove
from the mouse events onmousedown onmousemove etc. you get a mouseevent

21869128

21869181
min	max
max and min value that is supported for a double-precision floating-point number

21869216
uimanageddocument	nspersistentdocument
unfortunately the sample apps are not based on uimanageddocument or nspersistentdocument but if you look at the way they handle backup files you could probably use that approach to create a document based app with less hassle than using uimanageddocument

21869234
prepare	execute
and then loop through an array to execute the prepare statement over and over

21869237
min	max
otherwise you could initialize both the current min and max to the initial element of the collection

21869238
folder	directory
in the project s properties dialog look for linker | general | additional library directory it must indicate the folder where your lua dll is located and the folder where the geoip dll is located

21869252
listener	eventhandler
i think it should be a good idea to avoid all entry-breakpoints in any kind of listener eventhandler

21869283
ng-show	ng-hide
i understand that ng-show and ng-hide affect the class set on an element and that ng-if controls whether an element is rendered as part of the dom

21869289
chunked	transfer-encoding
transfer-encoding chunked

21869292
keydown	mousedown

21869293
fgets	atoi
use fgets as above and then call atoi to convert the entered string to an int

21869294

post	get
how do i post above form data to a get method inside my commentcontroller

21890515
vb.net	vb6
also i m not sure if i m using vb6 or vb.net

21890525
for-loop	arrays
so i created an arrays with the prefixes in then a for-loop like so

21890550
width	height
using js and or css you can find the width and height of the viewport screen and the pixel density using media queries

21890562
for-loop	loops
i tried something along the line with another for-loop and a while loops but the while loops seems to never terminate

21890586
post	get
i have tried many different suggestions and post and i cannot get anything to work

21890586
google-chrome	firefox
i need it to be the same in ie8+ google-chrome and firefox

21890631
setinterval	settimeout
as mentioned by others you may do polling through setinterval preferred or settimeout methods using ajax

21890644
hide	show
so that is render all the data in your grid and hide each item until you need it or dynamically load it from an array and show it when the user expands

21890644
hide	show
plenty of expandable html grid results on the net depend show you want to hide show it

21890649
flask	django
if you are having a cgi base back en framework this implies wcgi fastcgi etc like django php flask etc

21890654
superclass	subclassing
what it suggests is that if a bunch of subclassing have common functionality you should extract that functionality to a new superclass

21890656
post	put
for some reason no matter what i do nothing seems to work to put these post by alphabetical order

21890681
width	height
add same width and height in both #logo and #logo hover like this

21890760
google-chrome	firefox
if it works in google-chrome and firefox it will work in ie11

21890813
google-chrome	safari
edit forgot to add i can see them fine in the developer consoles in safari google-chrome not checked anything else..

21890825
int	chars
a chars is already an int just cast it

21890849
innodb	myisam
also all mysql tables were switched back from innodb to myisam since the mysql version 5.6 full text search in innodb is only supported from 5.6 and up

21890891
cstring	bstr
one wonders why the designer of this com interface chose to use cstring rather than the com bstr

21890927
implements	extends
i have implements a doubly-linked list and created an iterator which extends std iterator

21890958
google-chrome	firefox
a simple solution tested in google-chrome and firefox would be to embed the pdf in an iframe and listen for the iframe s load event shown inline for simplicity

21891002
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in google-chrome and firefox

21891026
vb6	vba
i suggest to search the msdn on an ado.net walkthrough because the data access code is substantially different from the ado model used in vb6 and vba

the audio tag supports mp3 ogg and wav audio files

the database has myisam and innodb engine and both are being written

21891107
cpu	affinity

21891118
hide	show
which the timer event can simply turn on or off the boolean s which will ultimately show or hide images as needed

21891126
postgresql	mysql
all of the major databases ms sql server oracle mysql postgresql etc. have a way to increment numbers without creating duplicates

21891131
width	height
the images width and height are unknown variables i am not experienced enough with js to handle it so i wanted to do it with pure css

21891131
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
margin just won t work and the formula with negative margin won t either as i do not know the width and height variables of these images

21891145
put	get	post	get	post	put
and backbone model uses this route for get post and put requests

21891162
put	get
put all those integers into an array and use one get set with an index

21891241
hash	hmac
i may be using the term acronym hmac too loosely but what i mean is that each request to my api should include a header that includes a hash that was calculated by the client by hashing parts of the request including a timestamp with a shared secret

21891241
hash	hmac
the nature of hmac requires that each request calculates the hash to verify the user is who they are but the actual response that is returned is the same - so the meat of the api call is very much cacheable

21891308
getter	setter
if it s hard to write getter setter don t do this

21891365
background-position	background-size
you can then use background-size and background-position

21891374
nsnull	nsstring
the serialization process would not only generate a valid container nsarray nsdictionary for you but it would also assign the contained values according to the types as in the json itself for example quoted values would be contained as nsstring numbers would be contained as nsnumber null values would be contained as nsnull instance etc

21891395
post	get
when you apply filters to the content you get the post as it is displayed to the user while post- post_content displays the raw content for the post

21891410
xcodebuild	xcrun
i don t know if there is an easily-automatible way to have xcode bring the modified file back to its original format but it should be fine to invoke xcodebuild or xcrun while the file is in xml format

21891422
chown	sudo
so i sudo chowned the files sudo chown _r myuser myuser at the base of my project refreshed in eclipse f5 and the annoying repeated failure of my build was a thing of the past

21891468
put	get
now the thing is that if we put different stock tickers we get different number of lines printed on the immediate window

21891489
subclass	abstract-class
your subclass is an abstract-class because of this line

21891500

uigesturerecognizer	uitouch
bool gesturerecognizer uigesturerecognizer gesturerecognizer shouldreceivetouch uitouch touch

21891520
uiview	subviews
so in this container view is another uiview subviews and in that subviews is a button

21891522
junit	jbehave
i ve got a runner class as part of some jbehave testing work and for whatever reason eclipse won t allow junit for the run as...

21891536
int	chars
change case 1 to case 1 and so on you clearly don t want to switch on chars values when you pass in an int

21891540
width	height
then using jquery once we know the image is loaded we can determine its width and height and shove it left and up by half those values

21891554
apache	nginx
apache nginx

21891624
post	get
then using the snippet below i do get the fast-switch-to-facebook-ios-app but the share dialog disappears quickly and the top-right post button is disabled similar to this question

21891625
width	height
in my code the w h ratio of my div is kept based on the height of my div could be width but picked height however due to the width being the size of my div is based on the height and width of the window it open in

21891625
width	height
what i d like to do is being able to keep the ratio based on height but to not have the width distorted depending on the size of the window

21891839
puts	gets
currently my code onclick â done button gets the value of both edit texts and puts them into the single textview

21891839
pop-up	dialog
i understand that i may have to store the string from each edittext into variables and then i can use the variables to show the strings combined in the textview and the edittext â when i open the pop-up dialog again

21891854
put	get
if you get that as a flat file that you load then at a minimum put an iden pk on the table so you can reproduce the order

although dosomething is overriden in superclass subclassing has no idea about existance of superclass

21892084
min	max
note i assume that you do it this way rather than requesting both min and max in a single row because you plan to add more columns to the select list which this query lets you do

21892093
superclass	subclassing
it will return the subclassing even though the code is in the superclass

21893636
apache	nginx
i m using apache for rendering python pages and nginx to serve my static files

21893672
maven	pom.xml
then when you run your maven build the demarcated property values will be replaced with the values that are defined in the pom.xml entries

21893684
put	get
if i put my method inside the loop it will get run 100 times

21893684

21893713
ggplot2	lattice
like here lattice and ggplot2 from the ggplot manual i couldn t find the code

21893726

21893910
puts	gets
currently my code onclick â done button gets the value of both edit texts and puts them into the single textview

21893929
for-loop	loops
use the implicit cursor of a for-loop instead of unwieldy explicit cursors coupled with redundant counts and loops

21893980
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
the client creates objectoutputstream and objectinputstream objects to send the request and to receive the reply

21894002

i have small script which creates a summary for each directory in a given folder

21894004

like the title says i have a script that is working in google-chrome and firefox but not ie

21894060
implements	extends
you re generally better off having classes implements runnable rather than extends thread

21894066

one way to locate another peer in a local area network is to broadcast a specifically constructed packets to the whole ipv4 subnet using the broadcast address

21894095
super	extends
i want to be able to add any object which extends the super class mob to this list like this

21894110
folder	directory
website.com in this directory you should have - index.html - contactus.html - aboutus.html and so on with all of the relative folder such as contact us folder about us and so on with files needed for that page in each folder directory

21894117
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
so if you try to create the objectinputstream the constructor waits until the corresponding objectoutputstream s flush method is called

21894128
maven	pom.xml
i have the maven dependency and maven repository included in my pom.xml file as described in this link

21894137
postgresql	mysql
also you should escape any database parameters from your input or they will break your query - mysqli_real_escape_string for mysql or pg_escape_string for postgresql

21894142
hide	show
for performance you would need to toggle a css class otherwise you will need to traverse your dom a few times to show hide elements

21894225
folder	directory
add this to your app.config only works for application base directory s sub folder

21894316
filtering	grouping
note a grouping intersects the crossfilter s current filtering except for the associated dimension s filtering

21894316
filtering	grouping
thus grouping methods consider only records that satisfy every filtering except this dimension s filtering

21894350
ssl	https
i had a similar issue when i was creating an application that communicated with a server over https using two-way ssl

21894398

i needed to release a new versioning of the app but i needed a new open graph action for this so the earlier versioning still worked until users upgrade to the new versioning

21894423
put	get
i had a look at how to put get values into from nested hashmap but i m still not understanding it

21894469

because both glsl hlsl uses column major order

21894473
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
perfectly safe and supported on google-chrome firefox gecko internet explorer opera and safari

21894541
acrobat	indesign
last time i checked the only way to achieve this within a pdf was by using acrobat pro or indesign and using page transitions

21894549
hash	md5
my theory is that you can only know the md5 sum or other hash if you know the file s content or if the hash is given to you

21894578
bluetooth	usb
i ve obtained a zebra ql420+ for evaluation which has wifi and bluetooth connectivity as well as usb

21894578

the star printer s margin got even bigger when i decreased the page width to what it should be

21894607
width	height
i m struggling to guess how can i get any object loaded covering almost the full width and height of the canvas

21894675
google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari
the font loads well on google-chrome safari and opera

21894727
put	get
from this function i want to put where transit 8 when i do this now i get the error transit is not valid in the context where it is used

21894749
width	height
at this point we re going to skip the input of width and height as you already have the code for that and assume that you ve captured them as follows

21894749
width	height
so now we know what the width and height of the table is going to be we can look at how to put them together

21894750
post	get
you can use get or post function which is a shorthand of ajax function as stated in jquery documentation

21894761
versioning	upgrade
i m trying to remove all of my keys from versioning control and i ve upgrade to rails 4.1 to give this new secrets.yml a shot

21894763

21894819
post	get
i can get with this but post or get throws a 501 not implemented error

21894819
post	get
not sure what to call this thing possibilities include allow cross-domain data access add a header to a json file w e that means or easily get and post to a data file

21894823
int	double
the reason you can say 20 double is that in haskell an int literal has type num a a meaning it can be any numeric type you like

21894823
int	double
however lower down the type hierarchy you have the real typeclass which has instances for all the more straightforward numerical types you probably want to work with like floats double and the various types of int

21894827
width	height
there some changes from your code but the solution fits for variable header and footer height responsive width and can be change for fixed header

21894831
folder	directory
i don t know how set folder permissions and secure users to not access other folder outsite their home directory

21894901
versioning	upgrade
upgrade the jdeveloper to adf versioning deployed on weblogic 10.3.6

21894948

21895015
revmob	iad
along with prioritizing iad followed by admob i would like to also have revmob as well

21895043
inherited	subclassing
at no point does subclassing inherited or provide an implementation of dosomething so you can t call as you desire

21895043
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
you could inherited subclassing from superclass and subinterface and just implement dosomething as a kind of proxy superclass dosomething

21895090
union	distinct
the union statement just glues the two queries together and the distinct statement simple combines the rows that are identical

21895102
loops	if-statement
it s like saying execute nothing x amount of times and it also has the effect that the following if-statement will only be executed after that loops is over resulting in your highest number staying as the first element of the array

21895102
loops	if-statement
the other if-statement to find the lowest number should probably be inside that loops too

integer	unsigned
the x in the output is a very large integer 4294967295 i know that negative integer convert to unsigned will behave like this

21896103
integer	unsigned
-1 is represented as all ones which when interpreted as an unsigned integer will be the largest integer that can be represented 4294967295 when dealing with 32 bits

21896103
subtraction	addition
one of the great things about using two complement to represent signed numbers is that you can perform addition and subtraction in the exact same way as with unsigned numbers and it will work out correctly so long as the number does not exceed the bounds that can be represented

21896128
rational-numbers	base
the take-away is that even though you can convert any number to any base all rational-numbers have exact finite representations in some base but not in others

21896130
flot	graphael	jqplot	flot	jqplot	graphael
i found jqplot easier to use with more options and better documentation than flot or graphael

21896151
width	height
body below header with dynamic width and height with vertically scrollable content

21896151
width	height
a sidebar to the right with a fixed width dynamic height and no scroll

21896151
width	height
dynamic height and or width means it will resize with the window not that it resizes with content

21896208
width	height
this works for setting the height of horizontally merged cells you need to temporarily unmerge the cells increase the width of the first cell to the total width of the merged cells use the autofit for the row then finally reset the width of the first cell and merge the cells again

21896287

21896320
asihttprequest	cfnetwork
completely remove afnetworking and nsurl session|connection entirely and replace it with something based on the lower-level cfnetwork framework the long-abandoned asihttprequest library may be your best bet.

21896325

min	max
it should reflect compositors all choice sequence min and max occurrences and derivation restriction extension

21896605
integer	unsigned
section 4.7 paragraph 2 of the standard says if the destination type is unsigned the resulting value is the least unsigned integer congruent to the source integer modulo 2 n where n is the number of bits used to represent the unsigned type . this dictates that -1 is equal to the largest possible unsigned int modulo 2 n

21896605
integer	unsigned
section 3.9.1 paragraph 4 says unsigned integers declared unsigned shall obey the laws of arithmetic modulo 2 n where n is the number of bits in the value representation of that particular size of integer. to make it clear what this means the footnote to this clause says this implies that unsigned arithmetic does not overflow because a result that cannot be represented by the resulting unsigned integer type is reduced modulo the number that is one greater than the largest value that can be represented by the resulting unsigned integer type.

for-loop	arrays
problem you have declared your arrays variable arraytemp inside the for-loop and it is not available outside of it

21896932
for-loop	arrays
looks like you arrays is out of scope because it s declared inside the for-loop and you are trying to access it outside the for-loop

i know this is definitely wrong but i cannot seem to get sub menu links to work on mobile devices and other post suggest edditing the bootstrap.min.js file

21896951
floating-point	integer
the operation number 10 uses regular division which converts each number to a floating-point value divides and then coerces rounds the result back into an integer so it can be stored in number again

21896978
int	chars
the value of num which is of type int is converted to type chars

21897007
inherited	properties
those controls inherited from contentcontrol or itemscontrol and use the properties contenttemplate or itemstemplate for datatemplate purposes

21897007
inherited	properties
now to answer your question if you want datatemplates you would need to have sort of a new class that inherited from frameworkcontentelement and that provides properties for defining custom datatemplates

21897035
rspec	capybara
i m using rspec 2.14.1 and capybara 2.1.0

21897095
floating-point	fractions
on the other hand floating-point numbers can have a fractions part 0 1 -32.1 42.7 and 123.456788 are all valid floating-point numbers

21897095
floating-point	integer
the reason the first conversion is possible is that converting the integer number int to a floating-point number float does not change the number

21897095
floating-point	fractions	floating-point	integer	integer	fractions
the reason the second conversion is not allowed is that converting the floating-point number which may have a fractions part to an integer number that never has a fractions part must drop the fractions part of the number it becomes a different number

21897095
floating-point	fractions
note that the fractions part of the floating-point number was dropped

21897107
post	get
i often refer to this post when i get confused

21897127
stdout	stderr
you need to redirect stderr to stdout

21897302
margin	height
edit your content wrapper needs to have a negative margin set to the same height as the footer

21897302
margin	height
by setting the wrapper to fill the screen then applying a negative margin the same height as the footer it pushes the footer off-screen then brings it back to the bottom of the page with the negative margin

21897302
margin	height
be careful with top and bottom padding you ll need to add it to the negative margin of the wrapper as it will contribute to the overall height

21897448

accessor	ivar	accessor	properties
you cannot add data to an instance of a class if the class does not have an ivar + accessor or a properties for it

21897641
for-loop	loops
for a for-loop you can check to see if all loops have completed by checking if the terminating condition has been reached

21897641
goto	break
if the terminating condition has not yet been reached then there must have been a jump out of the loop early either with break or goto

21897686
goto	break
i personally don t like using break statements in loops because similar to goto you want to avoid introducing sudden break from the normal flow of execution

21897766
superclass	subclassing

after zooming so that your picture fills almost my entire 22 screen i can make out that the cpu flags show ht which means hyperthreading so you actually only have two genuine cores that are shared between two hyperthreads

free	malloc
i checked what malloc free calls and those are also heapalloc and heapfree

21903408
free	malloc
but the point is that there is no magic here should be paired with malloc with free because you never know how those are implemented on given platform

21903421
free	malloc
use free to free memory allocated with malloc delete for single objects allocations with new and when using new on arrays

21903421
free	malloc
mixing and matching may appear to work it s undefined behaviour and undefined included works fine and sort of works fine most of the time but crashes on thursdays in months starting with m on days that are divisible with 3 or 7 and the operator has shirt with stripes - and may indeed work on some types of systems but fail on others depending on exactly how malloc and new and their respective free and delete functions are implemented

21904924
pascal	delphi
i even tried an optimized 32-bit assembler version of my routine that ended up looking almost identical to the one that delphi provided from the pascal source but with a few tweaks and that one came out a few ms faster most of the time but in some cases very much slower than the other ones - again implying that the timing will be much dependent on what other things your pc is doing

21904986

getter	setter
synthesize informs the compiler to go ahead and provide a default implementation for the setter and the getter

21905947
getter	setter
said default setter getter rely on the existence of some kind of storage inside the object

21905947
getter	setter
categories do not offer any extra storage so default setter getter would have no place to store into or read from

if you are using a smart-ui pattern then there is no problem having logic residing within getter and setter

21905962

int	double
losing precision means that not all int values above a certain size can be represented - and they will be rounded to a nearby value that can be represented by a double

21909615

21910452
postgresql	mysql
in both mysql with innodb and postgresql using read committed or serializable isolation mode the balance will be the same at step 2 and step 3

21910452
postgresql	mysql
neither mysql nor postgresql will do a for share or for update unless you specifically request it

21910452
postgresql	mysql
both postgresql and mysql innodb should behave similarly in read committed mode

21910503

my html looks like this deliberately no width and height specified as i want the video to resize with the browser rather than remain fixed

21910508
google-chrome	safari
however when viewing this in either google-chrome or safari in ios7 iphone 5s and ipad mini the poster image has black bars to the left and right

21910508
width	height
if i specifically set a width and height for the video element then this problem goes away

21910508
width	height
also worth noting that this works fine in chrome on my desktop i have no width or height specified in the html and a width of 100 in the css and the poster image correctly sizes to the full width of the viewport

starttls	smtps
starttls is a command which is used to upgrade the connection from clear text to tls encrypted in some protocols such as smtps or ldap

21910812
fgets	atoi
you can use fgets and atoi to handle non-integer input better than scanf does preventing an infinite loop on an input of something like aa

21910847
for-loop	loops
one for-loop and one while loops

21910863
width	height
a button with width and height of wrap_content for example will become bigger if the content is bigger not if the screen is bigger

21910891
for-loop	arrays
therefore you cannot use luku.length in nested for-loop to iterate all elements in two dimensional arrays

21910896

however when i push changes from my developing computer then go to pull them to the live server i get an error saying that i cannot pull changes because that file is different now and would be overwritten by the merge

21911409
profiling	debugging
-when building the project for release i have the debugging set to the team profiling development and the release set to the distribution profiling

21911416
getter	setter
i have thought the same in the past but usually end up making variables private and using getter and setter so that later on i ll still have the option of making changes to the implementation while keeping the same interface

21911416
getter	setter
so based on what i understood from the discussion in clean code which is more than just the two quotes i gave the purpose of the class is to expose data not functionality and having getter and setter probably does not do much good

21911416
getter	setter
again in my experience i have usually gone ahead and used the bean approach of private data with getter and setter

21911418
ubuntu	linux
you need to explore ubuntu rhel or some other flavour of linux if you need x

21911421
atexit	main

21911534
backgrounding	multitasking
according to apple s documentation on multitasking and execution in the backgrounding the following types of apps are supported but have to be explicitly declared

21911541
ssl	https
first of all apache mod_spdy supports encrypted connection https only therefore you have to create a virtualhost for the 443 port and add your ssl certificate

21911541
http	spdy
mod_spdy will automatically fallback to http 1.1 if the browser does not support spdy

21911551

21911588
min	max
mask is array masked inside only the 10 min element and 10 max inside with a mask true

21911595
hex	binary
you are aware that you are sending a single byte over the line which can be represented as 0xff in hex and 255 in decimal and 11111111 in binary

21911615
primefaces	richfaces
in primefaces 4.x there is an attribute ignoreautoupdate which is equivalent of limittolist or limitrender in richfaces

21911758
mouse	keyboard
use actions class to perform mouse keyboard actions on webelements using webdriver

21911766
public	protected
where it made sense i also declared a member as protected rather than public

21911766
inherited	properties
once i set that properties to true then i can then create new reports and inherited from myreportsbase instead of directly from activereports

21911780
width	height
problems could occur because you re using scrollpane.scrolltocenter float x float y float width float height with zero parameters

21911804
gridview	sqldatasource
at first i tried the gridview s rowcommand which was fired but then i just ended up specifying the deletecommand and updatecommand on the sqldatasource and that solved the problem

21911834
error-handling	exception-handling
what is happening is that your error-handling code is throwing an unhandled exception-handling which is then caught by the default aspnet handler

21911844
hash	salt
the way this file is used is when user is trying to authenticate salt is read from db or in your case xml added to entered password same way as when password was set in your code it is appended to password bytes and then resulting hash is compared to stored hash

21911844
hash	salt
now if no salt or weak salt is used it may be possible to reverse hash back using rainbow tables but this is more of a hacking technique and not practical for your purposes

21911854
screens	tablet
this solution works fine for handsets but in the tablet where we have a big screens size the same space between buttons is not working

21911899
equals	tostring
i would still recommend some differentiation between the two items but if you really want them to be the same i think you ll have to create an object that has a tostring value of weapon but for which an equals returns false

21911903
decoder	encoder
another option is to modify the current recordvideo utility to read a frame data and create a decoder instead of the encoder

21911906
for-loop	arrays
i would like to get the number of s as well as do for-loop in the arrays to access each column

21911934
qtreewidget	qtoolbutton
it works fine on elements such as qtreewidget qtoolbar qtoolbutton etc

21912009
octal	hex
watch out octal constants are limited to at most 3 digits after the backslash but hex constants are not limited to two or three hexadecimal digits so x0300000100001 is all a single character

21912052
submit	submission
we have it setup so users submit submission to the dynamic data list and than if we want to approve and publish it we have to manually copy over all of the information

21912152
super	extends
hi i want extends my super route class something like this

21912153
min	max
you can output the default values in a csv which i am already doing so surely there must be a way to do the same with the average min max and so on

21912161
post	get
however the servlet post method does not seem to get called

21912166
swing	windowbuilder
windowbuilder is drag and drop swing ui component plugin

21912211
stateless	stateful
other thing to keep in mind is if an ejb stateless or stateful throws an ejbexception or its interceptors automatically the instance gets discarded because of that there is a note in the spec that says

21912234
post	get
the reason that filter is not working might have been because you are sending a get not a post which is an even worse idea for security purposes than using the filter in the first place but i don t see the flag being set anywhere that switches on post-only validation in the filter although i recommend you set it if you use this thing in anger anywhere

21912244
copying	overwrite
it might be relative to your c library but in common sprintf is operating with your memory not copying string before edit so at begin it overwrite beginning of your string woth and then adds your string already overwrited to itself

21912341
put	get
this would also allow you to get rid of green red kind with a little work just put all the logic into the enum

21912355
move	drag
you ll find you get different effect when try to reposition items depending where you drag from for example double tap an item and nudge it with arrow keys or grab the middle to move it resizing via the corners

21912497
int	chars
this should move all chars from your original string into stringname unless an int value comes along which will be save in stringint

21912511
post	get
maybe a solution could be to post the data in a hidden input field but still i m struggling to get that one working

21912526
dlsym	dlopen
present and instead use dlopen foo.so and dlsym

21912625
folder	directory
apparently cordova phonegap projects create their directory structures like this the common folder beneath the parent is the www which houses all html javascript etc files then those are also used under the platforms ios or platforms android folder in my example i just called it folder1

21912711
hide	show
you can also use the show and hide method s for the kml layer

21912715
decoder	encoder
this is also true if you developed your own encoder or decoder

21912715
decoder	encoder
this is because writing an own encoder or decoder frees you only from copyright issues and software licenses because you hold the copyright but it doesn t free you from requirements imposed on you by patents

21912716
decoder	encoder
providing an encoder and or decoder is what requires the

21912716

21913448
post	get
it works exactly the same for both post and get with the difference that you can also send a request body with post

21913452
min	max
a safer way to resolve it besides completely refactoring this database design is to apply a top 1 or an aggregate max min to the subqueries

21913525
min	max
you should add a min max check

int	double
i don t know what you have 7000 of but 7000 of a small type like a double or int may fit in the fastest l1 cache of a single processor and certainly fits in the next bigger cache meaning that you re parallelizing a code that s already enjoying close to best-case performance in the serial case

21914117
put	get
i know about promises but i can t get how to put it in sintax

21914134

getter	setter
remember that jackson by default determines the property name from either the getter or setter the first that matches

21919092
mutators	setter	mutators	getter	getter	setter
jackson depends on java bean naming conventions with their accessors getter and mutators setter

21919092
getter	setter
the appropriate setter getter names are

21919092
getter	setter
change your getter setter as shown above or annotate your field with jsonproperty so that jackson uses the field name to determine the property name

21919119
division	modulo
you can do this with modulo division and the row_number function

21919121
int	boolean
in your case you have an array of boolean which is an int anyway

21919155
uilabel	uitapgesturerecognizer
i have tried setting up a simple uitapgesturerecognizer on a uilabel but it is not working

21919184

i installed it navigated to the created directory and the bin folder in which is the openssl.exe command

21919225
poisson	dirichlet
i am trying to develop a code that solve a dirichlet boundary value problem poisson s equation

21919241
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
to copy original case-insensitive windows paths on a system which has case-sensitive file system you can rely that windows disallows the user to create a second file differing only in case that allows to compare paths using normalized case to create a mapping

21919252
post	put
backbone s model decides whether to post or put based on the newness of the model determined by presence of id as i recall

21919269
button	checkbox
the way you have it now would only work if parsecomment was the entered text for the input element or the value from a checkbox radio button or select i don t know what you have as a form element

21919302
hide	show
after checking out your html the absolutely easiest and the most ideal solution is to hide the unneeded divs and show the needed one.

21919407
geocoding	geocode
because geocoding is asynchronous geocode will return almost immediately and will submit what is available and that will be wrong old or undefined data

21919414
google-chrome	firefox
as you can see a scrollbar appears tested on google-chrome and firefox

21919422
post	get
my current thinking would be to create a serializer that only exposes the followers field then create an apiview using that serializer with login in the get and post patch methods to add or remove the specific user

21919432
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i have a uinavigationcontroller which creates an instance of uiviewcontroller and sets another uiviewcontroller as it s root

21919526
disk	ram
ram is several orders of magnitude faster than disk

21919554
cout	ofstream
i m changing between two formats. if i use std cout to give out the numbers to the console right before or after i use ofstream to write them in a file

21919576
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
since the utf8mb4_bin collation is case-sensitive you will also need to modify the query if you want case-insensitive but accent-aware searching

21919605
for-loop	loops
if you log the value of x.length inside your for-loop you ll see it s value increasing with each iteration of loops - so you ve created an infinite loops

21919655
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome seem to work fine haven t tested in ie

21919672
pthreads	fork
i m also guessing that it will actually work on pthreads systems where multiprocessing uses fork which might preserve interpreter stateâ it seems to be the case on my system

21919682
mutators	setter	mutators	getter	getter	setter
using accessors and mutators getter and setter doesn t make it any better

21919765
stdout	stderr
the tells it to pipe both stdout and stderr to the file instead of just stdout

21919796
folder	directory
so i would have say 75 .cbz s ill unarchive in a directory then i d run said script from within a folder containing the sub folder which contain the images that make up each comic to rename every image

21919812
for-loop	loops
the absence of an explicit python-level for-loop should make this significantly faster than a solution based on for loops or list comprehensions

21919817
textinput	textfield
i m trying to make an application that reads text from a qml textinput textfield and writes the data to a text area

21919859
getter	setter
edit for this to work you d also need to define someclassofyours and put the corresponding fields constructor getter and setter in there

21919862
for-loop	loops
the debug.print you have inside the for-loop is just going to loops through the parameters for that sp showing the name and value

21919884
children	parent
i have an self referencing entity with children and parent

21919989
google-chrome	firefox
on firefox it works fine when ever i load the site the new content shows up but in google-chrome it shows the old content

21920034
intersect	contains
by using intersect you compare two lists and return the items that are contains in both of them

21920056
client-side	server-side
you can either handle it server-side with php decided as page is rendered or client-side with javascript user can toggle between layouts without refreshing page

21920063
jtextfield	jlabel
num is a jtextfield where a user would enter the amount of jlabel and jtextfields they want

21920070
spaces	delimiter
it works for simple cases where the words are delimiter by special characters or white spaces but there will come a time where you want to split something like this into three tokens

21920084
width	height
if you just want the uilabel to be the size of the uiview then make sure uilabel has constraints for the height and width to be the same as the uiview

21920084
width	height
the view should have some constraint for what it s height width are

21920084
width	height
from the look of things what you want is the uilabel to be constrained to be the same height width as the uiview and to have an iboutlet for a height constraint on the uiview

21920096
getter	setter
if you want to use pojo then you ll need at minimum a getter and setter ie

21920112
width	height
also i am confused on where to put the formula for a rectangle - width x height

21920178
for-loop	arrays
o write a for-loop that will retrieve each room in the arrays and add its details room name room type and room price to the list variable

21920230
superclass	subclassing
i have a superclass order which has a subclassing orderbook

21920241
getter	setter
when applications get larger more complex and harder to test you might not want to expose the entire object from the factory this way but instead give limited access for example via getter and setter

21920247
getter	setter
better encapsulate the fields make them private and write getter setter

21920275
hash	md5
using java script generate a md5 hash of the file and send it in your form

21920275
hash	md5
on the server side use php to generate the md5 hash

then when i try to convert it to an int via a cast it fails because it is apparently a double and not an object

21920453
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
its the same on google-chrome firefox and safari

21920466
width	height
as others have suggested first make sure the height and width of both images match

21920501
versioning	upgrade
i m using loadrunner 9.50 for licensing reasons cannot upgrade to latest versioning

21920564

the version of powermockito being used is 1.5.4 and we are using it in conjunction with mockito though such isn t relevant in this code sample and junit 4.11

21920718
int	boolean
assuming domainmax implies a set of int from 0 domainmax do define a boolean array with domainmax+1 elements don t bother with a dmax variable you can get that info by checking set.length

21920753
children	parent
it turns out that if you add a parent and any children ef can handle the fact that the parent and children are all being added together

21920753
children	parent
you run into problems when you update the parent and insert two children at the same time

21920753
children	parent
if you attach the parent ef will automatically pick up those two children and attach them whether you want it to or not

21920753
children	parent
however ef cannot handle items with the same primary key when the parent is an update and blows up since both have the same pk of 0 for both children

21920789
hide	show
my show hide functions look like these now

21920832
median	max	min	median	min	max
i m using microsoft visual studio 2008 and i m trying to build a report that displays the max min mean and median of my dataset

21920832
median	max	min	median	min	max
i ve done the max min and mean via expressions but i can t seem to figure out the median

21920855
subtract	add
if you add some random value to one delays then subtract the same amount from delays interval

21920872
hide	show
visibility classes let you show or hide elements based on screen size or device orientation

21920896
stdout	stderr
there is a crazy redirection sequence that swaps stdout and stderr so that the menu can be displayed on the screen but the answer can be captured with command substitution

21920910
width	height
also no binding for width and height

21920932
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome everything is ok but in firefox there is no background

21920934
box-sizing	border-box
you might also want to look into using the box-sizing border-box style for interior divs since this can get rid of problems of padding and borders poking outside of parent divs

21920959
portrait	landscape
the picture can be landscape or portrait oriented but i want the thumbnail to be 250x250 and not stretched crop the sides or the top bottom but keep most of the image intact in the new size cropped to square - kinda like wordpress s thumbnails

21921082
jobs	cron
we store the details of all active cron jobs in a mysql table

21921125
tabcontrol	tabitem
we declare datatemplate s that define how our data should be rendered in the ui so to add a new tabitem in a tabcontrol you add a new data item into a data collection that is data bound to the itemssource property of the tabcontrol

21921135
width	height
however as part of the task i need to use the java toolkit to getscreensize width and height and using calculations to work out the boundaries of the screen and send north to setlocation like above

21921140
width	height
if you re using a texture you can get the height and width pretty easily and adjust the scale of the tooltip accordingly

21921165
put	get
2 if you re going to be using this same color in a lot of places put the color where you can get at it from anywhere such as your .pch file or some other header that everyone can import

21921195
listview	gridview
it has a gridview and a listview

21921195
listview	gridview	hide	show
when the devices is snapped hide the gridview and show the listview via a visualstate

21921245
ssl	https
you can t in iis7 - each https binding requires a unique ip port combination because the host header cannot be used to differentiate sites using ssl

21921289
getter	setter
try to remove class attribute and getter setter method then update schema

21921334
post	get
acf fields and everything else is working fine on the individual post but i just don t know what to do to get the acf field data to show on the archive page

21921365
sorting	grouping
the premise is to pull out the urls and counts from the database grouping and sorting them by url

21921366
width	height
rect int left int top int width int height

21921370
width	height
in general i d recommend going to the image itself not its css to grab the height and width

21921386
ubuntu	linux
so yeah guys i was developing a dart project in windows and for some reasons i chosen to switch to linux ubuntu but when i imported my projects i got some problems like importing files ex

i don t know if there is a better way of verifying if a text reached its min max size but this way i m doing it doesn t work bigger button is getting disabled the second time the text reached 66.6667pt smaller button never gets disabled

21921466
prepare	execute
prepare statements need to be prepare with odbc_prepare and then execute with odbc_execute

21921517
memset	malloc
if you want to see it run out try doing a memset on the memory after each successful malloc

21921524
jar	war
this is actually not the case maven compiles the two projects into two separate jars if the projects are of jar type or copies project1.jar into web-inf lib of project2 if project 2 is of type war

21921527
width	height
draw rectangle over entire font image 0 0 width height

21921536
width	height
this causes a problem if your cell is to change its height based on say the amount of text in the textlabel since you do not know its width

21921536
portrait	landscape
this is a bad approach since tables can be plain or grouped use ios 7 or ios 6 styling be displayed on an iphone or ipad in landscape or portrait mode etc

21921546
versioning	upgrade
pretty ancient thread but i can say i was suffering from a smaller versioning of the same thing and i upgrade to visual studio 2012 and the problems seems to have finally been fixed

21921674
public	protected
if you need to expose any of your private fields to other classes you ll want to generate a property with the appropriate access modifier public protected internal or protected internal

21921753
for-loop	arrays
and by using for-loop .i am trying to access each image one by one but its not working what is correct syntax for arrays of mat objects

21921763

as part of an autograder for a class i m teaching i would like to be able to test whether a student wrote a method whose return type was a numeric type int double int double etc.

21921763
int	double
this code will work correctly if the return type of the method is int or double but not if it s int or double

21921763
int	double	int	chars
aside from hardcoding tests to see if the result is int long chars double etc. what can i do to test if the method returns a result of numeric type

21921766
tolower	toupper
search the web for c++ string transform tolower toupper

21921768
hide	show
5 there is not any sort of show block on specific pages or otherwise that would conditionally hide it

21921778
margin	height
the problem is that you set a height of 100 to the body and in your #main-wrapper you set a margin of 20px top and bottom with that in mind since your body tag is the parent of the main-wrapper it now has a top margin of 20px so the final height is 100 + 20px and that s causing the scrollbar

21921778
margin	height
to solve that just remove the 100 height or replace the margin 20px auto with margin 0 auto

21921787
ksort	asort
ps ive tried all the various sorts asort asort ksort krsort but its always the same results see above print_r

21921978
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
i used elastic beanstalk to get my django app running on amazon-web-services

21921984
opendj	openam
what you would have to do is to set up synchronization between the openidm data store and an ldap server could be opendj so that you can provision users and entitlements to the ldap server and use that as openam s user base repository

21921999
int	double
the problem you have is that int long double are primitives and not objects at all and do not inherit from number

21922004
post	get
if you still cannot get it working post a short self contained correct compilable example and links to the two images so people can really help you

post	get
it s a basic form that i want to use post but for some reason it is using get and i can see all the info in the url on the action page

21922188
for-loop	arrays
since you have so many jbutton that are all similar i suggest that you declare an arrays and use a for-loop to create each individual button and set their attributes

21922205
button	checkbox
take a look at how to use actions and how to use button checkbox and radio button for more details.

21922237
width	height
ok the bug was with setting the wrong width and height for the rotation functions

21922247
getter	setter
if you don t want the object itself being exposed everywhere you can encapsulate the functionality in a service with getter setter type functionality and then inject that where needed

21922259
keydown	keyup
if you catch the keycode keydown or keyup instead of keypress

21922263
google-chrome	firefox
the following svg renders well in firefox and google-chrome on both windows and linux

agile	sprint
well it should be in the jira agile documentation since sprint come with jira agile

21922398
express	node.js
i m starting up on a new project here at work that uses node.js with express and jade

21922407
rbac	acl
its possible to combine rbac hasrole with acl haspermission #forum update but since we will already use acls it s better to use only acls in order to push the permission access to the data only

21922473
width	height
then i test if the rectangle from 1 1 with 10 width and 10 height is inside the area which it is forcibly

21922475
for-loop	arrays
i have a for-loop to cycle through and arrays and a switch statement to match values

21922527
width	height
you have swapped width and height so you unless the image is a perfect square you will get the error you posted

21922537
submit	submission
i m using jquery to ajax submit a comment and append it after the submission form when the ajax status is successful

21922798
hide	show
when show is called display picture number i + hide previous if any

21922800
width	height
if you change the width of an image and do not change the height in exactly the same proportion as you have the width the image is always going to get distorted

21922800
width	height
so if you know you always want an image that is 250 height change the calulation to calulate the proportionate new width rather than passing it in as a parameter

21922840
rss	feed
if anyone has a better xml rss feed for sports odds i would be ecstatic for that as well

stdout	stderr
all its standard i o stdin stdout stderr operations will be redirected to the parent process where they can be accessed via the streams obtained using the methods getoutputstream getinputstream and geterrorstream

21922853
stdout	stderr
maybe your process is creating stdout or stderr output

21922864
rss	feed
i ve basically been running around all day trying to accomplish one goal getting the rss feed from two separate sites to display using javascript

21922864
rss	feed

21922914
put	get
put na in the date field so it doesn t get picked up by aggregations

21922946
for-loop	arrays
in the appropriate code spots - just a note here that if it s not possible to keep this count you can achieve the same thing by running an initial for-loop over your arrays and counting the number of true elements

21922950
implements	extends
public class controllertab extends activity implements onitemclicklistener

21922953
try-catch	exception-handling

something funky i gathered from the zsh man pages is how you can redirect stdout and stderr to somewhere else a file

21923111
stdout	stderr
# now redirect everything to stdout and stderr to the logfile

21923188
rtp	rtsp
...but the problem i am having is that the first method will save everything i need but for some reason it will add extra data more than just the rtp payload and rtsp interleaved frame contents in strange places.

width	height
but if i view the image properties the width and the height are switched see link example

for-loop	arrays
the for-loop iterates through an arrays and matches the user input us history with a string in an arrays list

fadein	fadeout
after changing this to jquery fadein and fadeout everything works like a charm

21924053
children	parent
actually the program exits right away â in fact the parent process exits before the children run which is why there s a shell prompt before test.c

21924263
std	ostream
the cast is unfortunately needed because the overloads handle stringstream s via references to their ostream base class returning an so you need to cast back to the stringstream type manually so you can then invoke the std stringstream move constructor.

21924263
ostringstream	std
c++03 lacked move constructors so it was necessary to use the std ostringstream str member function on the temporary to get a std string with which to construct the named stringsteam .

21924276

what i have which would work if i would get the exact height and width of the image halved which uses a second div inside the first with which shifts the image more to where i need it but disallows the scrolling of the image left and up any further than the initial screen

if this is a function that is suppose to be called by user then create an ajax call to the function from your view and iterate it every minute using the javascript setinterval method else if this is suppose to be a backend service then you need to look into cron jobs

21926688
width	height
i think you are getting height and width in oncreate method that s why you getting always 0 values because at that time your view still not created

21926688
width	height
try to get height and width on some button click or else

21926714
width	height
so depending on when are you trying to get the width height you might not see what you expect to see for example if you are doing it during oncreate the view might not even been measured by that time on the other hand if you do so during onclick method of a button chances are that by far that view has been attached measured layout and drawn so you will see the expected value you should implement a viewtreeobserver to make sure you are getting the values at the proper moment

the easiest way out other than fixing replacing the existing dhcp server may be to create a new subnet such that packets broadcast on the new subnet don t make it to the existing network but other traffic does

21934060
navigationcontroller	pushviewcontroller
our temporary solution was to override pushviewcontroller of the navigationcontroller to have a custom behavior so that such monkey scenarios are avoided

21934877
bash	zsh
i bash zsh i know of a variation of

21934908
folder	directory
also if you paste a lot of files to the directory it will overfill the buffer and you might not get events for every file that is added to the folder

you re working with strings you must convert them to a numeric type int float double etc.

21935389
width	height
the complex method seems like a last resort because it s a ton of work and code declaring each frame in the imagesheet individually by x y width and height

21935411
lodash	underscore.js
asgoth pointed out that lodash and backbone are amd-compliant so you should not have a shim for underscore.js or backbone

21935411
lodash	underscore.js
you use lodash for underscore.js

21935411
versioning	upgrade
so if you were to upgrade to this versioning you would not need the shim

21935414

writing queries a sql file that can run both in mysql and postgresql everything is ok so far except the following

21935979
postgresql	mysql
it works fine in mysql but when i run the query in postgresql it gives the following error message for both month and year

21935979
postgresql	mysql
after researching a little bit i came along some other functions that will do the job in postgresql but i am afraid those might not work in mysql

21936030
keydown	keyup
this plugin similar to numeric hooks into keydown and keyup to allow certain characters prevent the event under certain conditions

21936080
centos	linux
building cocos2d-x on rhel fedora centos linux

21936130
versioning	upgrade
you can upgrade versioning though to

well if you use an alias on the front of your field and use extract instead the same query will work for both postgresql and mysql

21936203

i would suggest you the same as these answers to use either json jackson instead of xml or use a different xml parsing java dom xpath simplexml binding xstream library in your client

21936255

21936360
google-chrome	firefox
i found this problem in browser firefox google-chrome

21936377
integer	unsigned
integer multiplication has the possibility to overflow and lose information an example which overflows when performing 32-bit unsigned arithmetic

21936397

however if that is not feasible then you could upgrade the access database engine but not the entire access application to the 2010 versioning by downloading and running the installer available here

21936456
serializable	deserialization
the general thing you are looking for is serializable deserialization

21936465
versioning	upgrade
however considering that my java versioning is very old and that the cacerts file gets updated with ca root certificates only when the jre is upgrade which is quite rare depending on the dev priorities what i understand is that my java app would be affected when some external 3rd party introduces new 3rd party certificates which are not present in my cacerts file

21936500
for-loop	loops
now with my understanding my first thought would be less than o n 2 because the nested loops isn t running the full n times and still the j variable is incrementing by 2 each loops rather than iterating like a normal for-loop

21936527
uiview	subviews
you should do one uiview and only one that you add as subviews of your uiscrollview

21936527
uiview	subviews
once this is done you can add all of your subviews to this uiview

21936543
pull	push
in general you only want to git revert if you are on a branch as in git checkout master or git checkout develop or some other branch name and you discover that someone committed incorrect code to that branch and need to reverse apply their previous change and make that a new commit which you would then probably publish either git push or make a pull request

google-chrome	firefox
in ie and some older versions of firefox and google-chrome for example this was used to add a dotted border around the last clicked link

21937224
children	parent
this ensures that the parent lays out its children before calling the

21937281
folder	directory
no built-in method for directory exists as far as i know but you can do easily mimic that behaviour by creating a disposable class and the using construct which ensures that the folder will be deleted even if the app terminates unexpectedly

21937349

i have created a folder bower_component in my root directory

21937364

parsing chars back to string and then to int is too expensive since you already have a chars

21939333
typeerror	attributeerror
why you get typeerror instead of attributeerror here is a mystery to me

21940319
pull	push
i want to do a single pull or commit push with git outside the firewall but i don t want to delete the proxy setting from the configuration because an hour from now i will just have to add it back again

21940324

but my question is how a superclass get the properties of a subclassing

21940408
inherited	properties
inherited does not work in the opposite direction child just inherited the properties of the parent not in the opposite direction

21940451
sorting	grouping
i was thinking to solve the problem by first applying .groupby uid then iterating through the grouping object selecting rows then ts is in a given range then concatenating dataframes into resulting dataframe sorting

21940461
hide	show
i need to call show hide frequently it seems everytime i call show it requests ad again and can not show quickly

21940511
google-chrome	firefox
i tried this expression in both my firefox and google-chrome console

21940583
button	checkbox
you can subsequently put this into your check box event function so that every time it s checked it zooms to the extent if that s how you want it to behave another option might be to have the checkbox click event just toggle the layers visibility but then have a goto button next to it that zooms to it

21940594
post	get
here i get my server startup time not the time when i post thats what i need

21940627
pull	push
say you use a git workflow that involves working with a core official repository that you pull and push your changes from and into

21940682
post	put
so the way i test this is that i put 10 seconds sleep in my controller and try to click the button again and it makes a post request who is waiting because my server can server one request at a time

21940702
for-loop	loops
your inner loops runs just once as ccount is incremented to 10 the first time the for-loop iterates

21940702
for-loop	loops
if you wanted the while loops to run again for each iteration of the for-loop reset ccount in the for-loop

21940720
sudo	passwd
i am attempting to run a local script on a remote aix server as root but it doesn t pause to let me enter the sudo passwd

21940740
children	parent
in this case you could trap the parent object instead and iterate its children to do your stuff

21940758
put	get
becouse if i put it in the title for row method i m will probably get the control may reach non-void error message

21940760

1st time when i select any state from f-2 then f-2 show exact states but when i select another state then f-2 hide all things.

21940833
width	height
it will adjust his width to maintain constant proportions so that his width would be allays equal to 3 5 of his height for an instance

21940833
width	height
there are some examples here which do opposite thing - maintain width at some fixed value of browser window size and adjust height accordingly but its not what i need

21940931
getter	setter
the fields variable contains the field and function relationship in your model for a getter and setter to work

21940931
getter	setter
if you set all your models and their related metadata in the array you will avoid the typo issue you described since an exception will be thrown as soon as a getter setter does not exist

21940943
rdf	owl
if this is related to your earlier question uml composition relationships to rdf and owl which seems likely and you re trying to say that the range of a property is a union class

21940943
rdf	owl
we can take a look at the rdf serialization of this owl ontology

21940976
width	font-size	width	height
i ended up having a javascript function that took each div and an inner paragraph with a predetermined font-size and reduced its font size until the paragraph had less width and height than its parent div

21940997
google-chrome	firefox
it works good in google-chrome firefox but doesn t work in ie8

21941064
division	modulo
the modulo yields the remainder from the division of the first argument by the second

21941071
width	height
what you could do is get the height of the browser window with jquery and set the width of the div accordingly

21941073
hide	show
what you want is to use the show and hide methods

21941076
division	modulo
the modulo returns the remainder of the division of b per 2 in your case

21941082
width	height
go sure you place this script after the element you want to fix the height width

21941082
width	height
if you now change the innerhtml with another function the height and width will not change

21941082
width	height
if you want to make the height width larger dont forget to use brackets avoid the automatic type conversion

21941106
post	get
this post helped me but just to get started

21941120
google-chrome	firefox
the functionality works fine in firefox 26.0 in linux but doesn t work in google-chrome 31.0.1650.63 in linux or ie

21941124
for-loop	loops
if your for is breaking at some point i suggest using debug mode and putting a break point in the middle of loops the execution of the code will stop each time it reaches the breakpoint and you can look at all the variables in the for-loop at that state

21941132
sum	floor
for your algorithm i think your are trying to pick floor n 2 items and find it s maximum sum of value as array1 sum... if this is not your original thought then please ignore the following lines

21941168
gorp	sqlx
if you need to use an orm sqlx or gorp are good go options

21941218
min	max
to counteract this i m using jquery and running the following code to remove min max and step

21941218
range	max	range	min	min	max
without removing them since min max and step are attributes of the range input the validator thinks this is a range input and tries calculating it as a number.

21941232
width	height
create a uibezierpath that uses a rounded rectangle who s corner radius is 1 2 the height width

21941265
getter	setter
i use getter and setter to encapsulate the state and internal representation

21941270
hide	show
and then as soon as you get the tableview didselectrowatindexpath update the data structure and force the reload of the table in order to show hide selection checkmarks

21941273
client-side	server-side
your problem is that you re mixing server-side and client-side code

21941278
ubuntu	linux

21941422
width	height
i need to get width and height of image with given path

21941440
int	boolean
i am having a problem because not all of the values returned by the javascript for the map are simple single value type like strings int or boolean and return custom types like latlng and i don t know how to preserve the returned value as separate parts of the custom type

21941473
bash	subshell
or if you run a subshell via the environment is also preserved because bash forks preserving its complete state rather than reinitialising using the process environment

21941488

the best way of getting data into hdinsight is to upload it to azure blob storage using either the standard .net clients or something third-party like azure management studio or azcopy

21941499
min	max
enclosed the case clauses in max min and sum

21941524

21941550
for-loop	arrays
i have a for-loop to go through an arrays i get from a web service that are paths to images that i want to insert into and tags and print as much as there are in the arrays

21941558
folder	directory
you can just download the respective directory in desire folder ex

21941559
inherited	properties
if they are displaying data inherited from the controller then you don t want your controller calling into the directive rather the directive will simply redraw itself whenever the properties in the controller change

21941581
children	parent
i cannot animate the parent div as it has other children i tried using the new css3 vw unit but i need to set the value to negative units for it to move left at all

21941679

21941761
gruntjs	grunt-contrib-connect
i have been building a site with gruntjs and grunt-contrib-connect

21941791
fadein	fadeout
fadein fadeout checks the actual type of the parameter

21941796

to be more specific to ioannis-karadimas you could remove the outline on hover assuming mouse input but leave it for focus assuming keyboard input

21941846
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
those pictures look fine in google-chrome but in firefox and opera their edges look pixelated

21941944
spaces	delimiter
i would suggest treating this as a csv file using csv.dictreader you would specify delimiter t if the text file shown has tabs as delimiter and not spaces

21941963
google-chrome	firefox
on google-chrome and firefox it works fine and is vertical center

21941998
width	height
size in bytes width height and file path and return those to a text view

21942025
metaclass	setattr
you can either override __new__ in the metaclass and then populate the attribute dictionary or override __init__ and then override the attribute dictionary or set the attribute on class object itself using setattr

21942039
pull	push
i am using pull queues to feed back-end workers tasks that send push notifications

21942075
or-operator	and-operator
instead you want the if to check whether they both don t satisfy thus replacing your current or-operator with an and-operator

21942081
inline	inlining
attempting to force operator inline fails probably ignored by clang executable even larger while gcc reports recursive inlining

21942122
int	chars
generally it relies on int or chars with 1 as true and 0 as false but it is not a standard.

21942176
implements	extends
it is defining a class which extends implements localconfig without giving it a name instantiating that class and assigning it to a variable called conf

21942178
udp	tcp
apart from that tcp packets by themselves are not slower than udp packets and data transfer with a simple tcp connection can be faster than with a simple udp connection because flow control and reliable transfer is already integrated and you don t have to reinvent everything again and often worse

21942179
post	get
b use an httpservlet and make the usual http file upload this will require an http support in the client environment and use some post attributes in order to get the additional data

21942234
move	drag
the common approach is to take a snapshot of the view during the drag then add it to the superview and move it around with the drag from one collection to another

21942247
width	height
from a bitmap you can get size in bytes width height but not the path of the file because the bitmap its not a file but an image loaded in the memory

textview	imageview
in my android application project i m trying to show two views imageview and textview with using animation project

21942383

i try to create input controls dynamically works fine apart from the positioning for some reason i cant put the elements under the previous one because i m unable to get style.top property

21942386
button	checkbox
now if we want some button s visibility to only be visible when enum is stateone and the checkbox is checked

21942386
button	checkbox
with this button one will become visible when the checkbox is checked however button two will not as the converterparameter passed in for button two is statetwo

21942456
udp	tcp
kryonet is a very good java library which provides a clean and simple api for efficient tcp and udp client server network communication using nio

21942460
shadowing	named
that is happening because the method named g declared in your class is shadowing the method named g that is statically-imported on demand

21942532
qplaintextedit	qtextedit
both qtextedit and qplaintextedit are quite slow and unsuitable for anything but the most minor logging

21942552

then here you can call default address put it online if you want other users to use it to get your xml file

21942666
inherited	properties
clearing no floats used to override inherited properties left or right floats or both floats

21942666
width	height
also because of the default behaviour you don t need to set the width and height on auto

21942666

21942878
width	height
it depends on how you have declared the height and width

21942886
int	chars
in this case b is 00110110 0x36 because you are declaring a chars not an int

21942897
int	chars
you solved this on paper for int 10 and 6 not for chars s interpretation of multi-character constant is compiler dependent and

21942906

for-loop	loops
it seems like at least in all the languages i m used to a while loops can do all the things that a for-loop can and more

21943194

this is however a very very hacky solution since ive positioned the needle by trial and error and the whole thing breaks if height and width are assigned percentage values

21943224
post	get
similarly you can use to get a 500px wide url to that image in a photo post

21943226
children	parent
second thing i tried is since on first select i m only selecting categories with and then making a union with all categories where parent_id matches id s of those from the first select i could just add to only the first select where and then the parent category that has status 0 would not get selected and thus when union is made it s children would also not get selected

21943226
children	parent
since all parent have parent_id 0 they would be listed first however ordered by position and then all children would be ordered together by parent_id first and then by position

21943251
for-loop	loops
the only difference is that the for-loop includes an initialize and state-change options whereas a while loops requires you to do those separately

21943252
int	double
since sqrt expects some floating type a type that is an instance of the typeclass floating we can convert from an int to a double using fromintegral

21943252
int	double
int is an instance of integral so the input type is okay and double is an instance of num so the output type is okay

21943252
floor	sqrt
note that since the output type of fromintegral is polymorphic as is the input type of sqrt and floor we have to specify the type of the conversion as double otherwise the compiler won t know which num floating realfrac instance to convert to

21943253
integer	unsigned
in the most common format the intensity of each channel sample is defined by 8 bits and are arranged in memory in such manner that a single 32-bit unsigned integer has the alpha sample in the highest 8 bits followed by the red sample green sample and the blue sample in the lowest 8 bits

21943253

21943727
floor	sqrt
you clearly want to take the square root of an int by using the floating point sqrt and floor functions

21943727
floor	sqrt
floor requires a realfrac argument but sqrt produces only a floating

21943727
int	double
for example if you want to use this approach to take the int square-root of an int you want to pass through an abritrary precision real type like a data.number.bigfloat instead of a double

21943735
express	node.js
is possible to do this i am using node.js and express and mongoose

21943781

rdf	owl
the reason you need these types to be specified is due to the mapping from rdf graphs to owl 2 ontologies

rdf	owl
to ensure this constraint is addressed in all rdf serialisation of an owl ontology one must explicitly type all resources introduced by the ontology including these blank nodes associated with restrictions intersections and so on

21955043
rdf	owl
most owl processors will interpret many non compliant rdf graphs as valid owl ontologies but you have to be careful as surprises could happen

21955043
rdf	owl
finally to wrap this answer up i noticed that if you discard the owl restriction type completely ontologies in rdf are still recognised as valid owl 2 dl ontologies by the manchester owl 2 validator

21955565
int	chars
you could use a hashmap and then you can store pairs of int with their corresponding chars

in wan not necessary for example 192.168.1.1 can ping 72.1.1.1 but 72.1.1.1 can t ping 192.168.1.1 because this ip is private and when it leaves the lan it becomes real ip because of nat network address translation

21958062
width	height
note that you will have to change width and height if you set it to 0 in xml like in the following example

21958062
width	height
now you could set the width to like 50 of the screenwidth and the height to...lets say 40 of the screen height

21958062
width	height
if you want to keep the original size of a image in your drawables you can get its width and height like this

however i just came across something i have not experienced before that seems completely incorrect--yet firefox 27 and google-chrome 33 and ie 11 all render it the same

21958242
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
i expected it would have had its positioning properties override the width and height and margin positioning from the straight div call

21958242
width	height
as you can see by the referenced fiddle above it in fact retains its width and height and seems to essentially ignore its positioning values all together

21958242
width	height
i suppose i have never noticed it before because normally my sizing of a wrapping div is done by a class and thus applies only to that div while my positioning of the absolute child is done likewise and i don t bother to set a width and height on it

21958242
width	height
my question is seeking quote s and link s from the w3c documentation or a highly respected source such as from one of the major browser developers that discusses why or that the width or height settings should override a setting of top right bottom left etc

21958242
width	height
from the main page discussing absolute positioning all i found was that either can be used to set the width height but the crux of my issue is that i would expect the more specific last in cascade to take precedence no matter which way was defining the sizing

21958242
width	height
1 a higher specificity or equal specificity but following in cascade order setting of width and height whether explicitly by those properties or by the positioning properites to take precedence

21958503
margin	height
the vertical margin and padding was too much for the limited vertical row height of 70dp

21958983
unix	bsd
to convert a unix epoch time with bsd date use

21959145

when you select fields under show in view in settings you can check hide empty fields option

21959200

for-loop	loops
the for-loop starts from and increments i by one ++i as long as so loops body gets executed for values of i from 0 to 9 inclusive

21959419
int	chars
0 and 9 are chars literals that have int values of the corresponding chars in the chars set â this way the programmer does not have to know and write their values and the code works on incompatible chars sets as long as the digit chars have contiguous values

21959479
for-loop	loops
the for-loop is usually used when you know how many times you want to loops

21959479

21959529
oncreate	ondestroy
no matter which approach you use you ll probably need to make sure your oncreate and ondestroy methods actually come from your presenter and not the exact events from the activity

21959529
oncreate	ondestroy
if you are only using the sdk on a single view the activity s oncreate has been called long before your view is instantiated probably and the ondestroy for the activity will be called after your view is destroyed

21959529

i purposely didn t include oncreate and ondestroy as you presenter s wouldn t be able to get access to those events as they wouldn t be created or they would already be destroyed

multiplying	division
there are a number of solutions and the best one here is to simply not multiplying an int by a floating point fraction to do division

21962890
int	double
the other ok solution is to use double instead of float because double can represent all values in an int exactly

21962908

21962955
int	double
in other words java thinks that something like int or double has not value

21962996
getter	setter
it seems like you have a background in c# or another language with a similar concept of attributes - where you provide a getter setter but syntactically you still refer to it directly by the attribute name calls fish.setweight 3 automatically

21962996
getter	setter
you can write getter setter as member methods and you call them and that s all you get

21962996
getter	setter
there is no automatic calling of getter setter on direct field access

21962999

the first thing i did was wrap debug-print-macros around all of the library s calls to malloc calloc realloc and free so that i see printf output whenever memory is allocated reallocated free by the library

21963425
free	malloc
so presumably what must be happening is that somewhere after the call to malloc and before the call to free the heap must be getting corrupted in such a way that free no longer thinks that that pointer is valid

in ruby exists several methods that creates getter and setter like in java

21963798
getter	setter
and of course you can modify your getter or setter to your convenience

21963831
put	get
the only thing left was to put new events into the collection i get new events from a message queue but it matters not

21963919
getter	setter
as my getter and setter methods in the menuitem pojo already take care of the conversion of enum to string and string to enum

21963987
getter	setter
next we ll need some way to access x and y from outside the class so we ll make some getter and setter functions that access the two values

21964012
getter	setter
the problem is that hibernate is using your getter setter to access your property so when it wants to get the value of the itemtype field to save it it will call getitemtype expecting it to return a string what is in the mapping and will get an itemtype instead thus the exception

there are a couple algorithms for regular expression matching dfa nfa and backtracking and to support them within the trie search you would effectively have to implement one modified to support iteration over sub-tries and backtracking within the trie for the collection of states matches the regular expression can match

21964284
protractor	intern
i m trying to decide whether to use intern or protractor for my e2e test with saucelabs and i find really helpful these by s that protractor provides by.model by.binding by.repeater and i was wondering if such locator strategies are also possible to use in intern

21965979
fragmenttransaction	onbackpressed
there is no need to override onbackpressed to reverse a fragmenttransaction

strlen	strcpy
strlen doesn t count the null byte in a string so you have to allocate one extra byte for it to be copied by strcpy from the source string

21965993
free	malloc
if it is mapped then the most probably this memory contains values required for correct working of malloc and free so you may expect crash on the next malloc or free

mouseleave	mouseenter
there is a brief moment where the mouseleave from the handle and the mouseenter from the menu fire

21966402
division	modulo
aside from that in terms of best programming practices i would recommend some range-checking and in terms of code efficiency i would recommend using a shift operator i 5 instead of division i 32 and using a mask operation i 0x1f instead of modulo i 32

21966431
width	height
if your image is like the bubble below or almost similar then the nine-patch should have the top edge specifying the width that should expand the left edge to present the height

21966846
content-length	content-type
for instance the content-length header implies we need to know the size of the actual resource and so head may require to get the resource to determine the actual size in bytes of the corresponding get request but it will not burden the network with actually sending the resource back although it may have burdened the server with the retrieval of the resource in order to determine which headers to send back content-length content-type content-language etc.

width	height
as far as i know you can t just change the width and height of a hubtile that easily just by setting the properties

21969747
width	height
you need to dig into the style of the control and not only change the width and height but also make sure that all the animations are properly changed too

21969747
width	height
now the hubtile uses enum of tile sizes and two converters width and height to do the conversion to exact width and height values

21970833
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
it s hard to answer your question as to why safari behaves differently from firefox and google-chrome in these examples because the reason is very implementation-dependent and i m not familiar with the source codes of either of these browsers

21970833
google-chrome	firefox
concerning your second example i can only say that in google-chrome and firefox boolean creation is less expensive than a one-level scope look-up

21970907
range	minimum
many properties are integers and i want to define minimum maximum range of concrete property in the class definition

21970917
getter	setter
in most cases its not necessary to test 100 of the code because you should not test for example setter and getter

21971014

i think rcurl is faithfully forwarding the values from libcurl as documented on curl_set_easyopt under curlopt_progressfunction missing values are returned as 0

21971504
width	height
you have to use these css rules because you can not specify in the canvas width height attributes

21971504
width	height
to fix this make sure you also specify a width and height for the canvas element either in the html or in javascript with setattribute

21971506
public	protected
however you would need separate map for each type of attribute int bool string and each visibility private protected public

apparently this is not directly to do with my code it looks as if code of android-browssers with display in firefox and in google-chrome is different than those for desktop computers concerning display of homepages

21972029
disk	ram
think of ram as a high level cache to your hard-disk we only take the small parts of the currently running programs from disk into ram when we need to use them

21972029

apache	nginx
i d like to password protect an entire codeigniter site but not with http basic authentication .htaccess in apache i m using nginx anyway

21972503
hide	show
in particular note that the show and hide methods are given directly as parameters to the .on event function method of the rectangle selection

21972503
hide	show
d3 will pass the data to your anonymous function but you do not pass it on to the show hide functions

21972522
int	double
if you re able to narrow it down to a number which is the super class for int and double as you mentioned the following will work

21972525

21972965
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
the pseudo before works on firefox safari but not in google-chrome

21972974
for-loop	arrays
the point is that i can t get to evaluate this arrays against all the numbers between 1 and 43 the for-loop since the if inside the for-loop never evaluates true

21973019
google-chrome	safari
the site loads fine on google-chrome and safari but does not load at all on ie tested on 8 9 and 10

21973031
multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract	subtract	add
you need to encrypt the variable add subtract multiplying etc the score and add false numbers that are the same as the real number

21973031
division	multiplication
cheat engine and other flash cheat engines example buy something or change their score any var that changes at the time the cheater changes the var he will have a list of variables that changed that instance so you need to prevent this by having multiple vars acting as the score or having a timer counting up or down and even both make sure to have multiplication and division in the encrypted variable you need it

21973122
fgets	strtok
without any fancy requirements or other tools you can get your input with fgets from stdin or the like then use functions like strtok to tokenize your string into what you need names surnames etc

google-chrome	firefox
this simple table with one absolutely-positioned column renders differently in firefox and ie than in google-chrome and other webkit-based browsers

21973309
google-chrome	firefox
i don t need any ie hacks since the site will only be used with the latest google-chrome firefox versions

21973322
width	height
and you should not provide the public square int width int height that makes no sense

21973328
post	put
thanks to the post i read i learned that i can make regex faster if i put this in the constructor so that it d be executed once only instead of including them in my loop thereby being executed everytime

21973349
post	get
when symbolicating the 4th line as described above in the post you will get the exact line in your code where this happens

21973352
for-loop	arrays
then change your for-loop to this make sure you ve initialized the arrays somewhere

21973378
udp	tcp
usually there is a way to specify the timeout for every operation that you are performing cia tcp udp connections

21973405
public	protected
i was only able to find the usual what s a public private protected question

21973422
put	get
what is not as easy is to understand for me is why the order i get is different from the order i put the pair objects in the nsdictionary

21973462
post	put
since asking the original post i ve moved away from using an ioc container to make choices like this choosing instead to programmatically put in code a switch for picking an implementation with a default implementation selected for any unhandled outlier cases

21973473
joomla	smarty
i can say that if you know what you are doing with civicrm you can customize anything as much as you want but it s not exactly standard joomla since they use smarty templating

21973730
folder	directory
loop over the root directory and for each directory in that folder start a process so something like this

21973733
width	height
assuming that part of this question is to maximize the height of the widget given the number of cells it occupies per the fill_parent in the linearlayout and given youâ re open to cropping the width

21973736
int	chars
it does not have the affect that casting a chars to an int does

21973736
int	chars
in other words int x 33 when casted to a chars produces a printed value of

21973736
int	chars
to int x 33333333 even though chars z casted to an int produces a 32

21973912
qtableview	qheaderview
naturally i tried to installeventfilter on qheaderview or qtableview but mousebuttonpress event is not being passed unless you installeventfilter on qapplication

21973925
filtering	grouping
i can also access and filtering different grouping into separate lists like

21973937
folder	directory
to distinguish between a file and a folder you would need to instantiate an nsurl object with the pasteboard data and find out if it is a directory by querying its attributes

21973976
google-chrome	firefox
tested on google-chrome and firefox

21974013
for-loop	arrays
i use a for-loop to create 3 objects give each object its own values and then add them to the arrays list

21974021
ubuntu	linux
there only seems to be a problem in linux ubuntu 13.10 with wx 2.8.12.1

21974036
int	chars
you re probably after .substring int start int end which applied to your code would be something like the code below however when you say you would like to copy 10 string only you should say 10 chars from said string

21974071
post	get
but if we want to have comments on different types of entities like pages blog post images videos and etc things get a little bit tricky

21974075
int	chars
as written fprintf output c you pass an int where the function expects a chars pointer

21974197
fast-forward	merge
git does this as a fast-forward merge since you have no commits of your own and you get this

21974226
postgresql	mysql
my models work correctly with mysql but i must deploy it in postgresql

21974249
dlsym	dlopen
if you look up the functionality you use dynamically instead of letting the compiler do it via dlopen dlsym nsclassfromstring nsselectorfromstring etc... then you can use linked code without importing its header

21974284
post	get
basically i m trying to get the same effect as shown on this post jsfiddle here however i m having some trouble implementing it - being as i want to check for multiple div s toggle status rather than simply switching in between two divs

21974312
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
it s pretty simple the listbox ui xaml updating is all based on a few interfaces such as inotifypropertychanged inotifycollectionchanged and few more

21974312
ienumerable	icollection
a list does not implement these interfaces it implements things such as ienumerable icollection ...

21974312
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
as for your wrapper idea sure you can build your own custom collection that say implements ienumerable inotifycollectionchanged inotifypropertychanged and internally hold a list or whatever but your listbox.itemsource should be of this type wrapper to get the updating behavior

21974321
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox does not display the image encoded

21974321
google-chrome	firefox
still google-chrome and firefox does not display image

21974346
google-chrome	firefox
with google-chrome and firefox you can read the contents of a text file like this

21974397
strlen	strncpy
however if strlen source is greater than n then strncpy will simply copy the first n bytes and will not terminate the string dest with a null byte because there is no space for it

21974424
int	chars
the chartouchingfallingblock function checks if the chars is touching any ground by taking an int as one of the parameters it looks like

21974438
memcpy	memmove
if there is an overlap use memmove in place of memcpy

21974474
memcpy	memmove
this can be done with memmove but not with memcpy

21974533
uitableview	uisearchbar
i made a simple test project with two views one view contains a uitableview and a uisearchbar when you select an row from the table view the new view shows a label with the name of the row

21974546
calloc	malloc
it s quite obvious in the header file - it s the attribute malloc in the declaration of calloc

21974546
free	malloc
if the compiler finds the matching free call then the compiler can sometimes allocate the data on the stack and eliminate both the malloc and free calls

21974584
width	height
if you re using positon absolute for absolutely everything when you adjust your browser size you re gonna find it starts dancing all over the page just use simple height and width elements at 100 to make it more flexible

21974594
bower	npm
this means that npm will create a symlink to the bower binary in your node.js binaries folder which is in your path

21974594
bash	zsh
this allows your shell be it bash zsh csh etc. to find the command

21974594

however the required width and height of each oval is different

21974844
put	get
you could put in there for an additional albeit small speed improvement nb if you do an in your original code you do get a significant speedup

21974849
put	get
one of my errors is that there isn t a matching function call in the embedded get function that i put inside my second function i thought that i matched up the variables correctly with my first get function n c a and x

21974852
int	chars
that information i will next put in a map that maps pairs of chars to int but i m wondering whether it s written correctly so far and whether you have any suggestions for me

21974880
math.h	sqrt
when it tries to compile do.cpp it doesn t find the definition of cout because iostream is not included and neither math.h for sqrt as part of do.cpp

21974883

21975570
innodb	myisam
you seem to be concerned that you ll get a transactional race condition around activation and you won t be able to prevent it because you must use myisam instead of innodb

21975570

21975824
put	get
i m not exactly sure how to describe this problem i m pretty sure it s not exactly an infinite loop though it keeps running without exiting because it seems like the program doesn t ever even start execution i put a cout hello right at the beginning of my main function and it doesn t get sent to the output

21975828
mouseup	mousedown
keep in mind that requesting fullscreen needs to be done via a user-triggered event such as a click event - mousedown mouseup etc

children	parent
try getting an array of the parent s children instead

21975968
range	minimum
however if your keep your time range to minimum quantity amount of unions will not be as big

i also recommend using a tool like firebug for firefox free download or developer tools in google-chrome hit f12 to inspect the suspect elements and see what if any css classes are applied to them

21976020
erd	diagram
i think your erd diagram looks pretty good but i noticed a couple things

21976043
glfw	sdl
it is not clear that there is any short-term intent to rectify this so if you need to use core forward compatible you should probably switch to glfw or sdl

21976887
google-chrome	firefox
note that google-chrome firefox and ie all use different font rendering engines so they ll always look a bit different

21976900
int	chars
an interesting possiblity would be to complete the above set up to 256 with whatever unicode glyphs which would allow to encode your binary data with the same number of uri-compliant chars thus replacing a painful and slow bunch of long int divisions with a lightning fast table lookup

21976928
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
all of my uiviewcontroller s show up fine inside of my uinavigationcontroller except for one

i m also unsure if the passing of json needs to be a post request i have trouble getting it to work at all with get

21977088
hide	show
better yet this approach also eliminates the need to have all kinds of code that attempts to hide or show the developer surfaces in access â in fact you find that many settings are rather elusive or difficult to set in code anyway such as autoexec macro or even the application wide custom ribbon

21977094
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
i m trying to figure out what expression to use in order to get the index of the current interation of loops variable when looping through a string arrays in a for-loop

21977094
for-loop	arrays
specifically i m trying to store some information acquired in the for-loop in a different arrays i think there s a more efficient way to do this but we haven t covered more than single-dimensional arrays in class yet so no matter at a parallel index as the current interation

21977094
int	chars
unfortunately it s telling me that since it s a string it can t convert it to an int or something and in eclipse the dialogues that pop up only reference how to access the index of a chars within that string and not the index of the string within the array being looped over

21977108
versioning	upgrade
after i released the first versioning of the app i upgrade to maverick os and xcode 5.0.2

21977114
inherited	subclassing
i would exercise caution here in your example you re storing your objects as object strictly on the stack since that would only allocate enough space for something of type object should you insert something that inherited from the type it would have the part that describes the subclassing sliced

21977171
uiview	subviews
i think you should create a view contain two subviews then just transition them uiview transitionfromview toview duration options completion

the best option here is to create your own adapter creating a class extending baseadapter and creating your own logic inside it requerying the database and notifying the change to the listview or gridview

21977591
for-loop	arrays
basically every time the mouse is clicked and dragged its location is stored in an arrays where its then drawn in a for-loop in graphics

21978503
screens	tablet
i don t really anticipate having both fragments displayed in a single screens on a tablet but i don t see how i can use one activity for each because of the limitations of the tabbed interface when i created the activity in eclipse i was prompted to select what kind of layout i chose tabbed layout and automatically code for fragments within an activity corresponding to several tabs was generated

imperative	declarative
in contrast mathematics is generally declarative but writing a proof tends to be more imperative

21979216
imperative	declarative
of course nothing is 100 imperative or declarative

21979216
imperative	declarative
because we are dealing with computers a declarative compiler interpreter must be smart enough to make time vs memory tradeoffs whereas in an imperative language it is up to the programmer to make those decisions more explicitly

21979224
superclass	subclassing
additionally the jvm runs through the entire superclass before doing anything with the subclassing which is why the super call in a subclassing s constructor needs to be the first instruction in the constructor .

21979224
superclass	subclassing
so a subclassing starts to instantiate only after the superclass has been fully instantiated and the superclass s is constructor has returned

21979224
subclass	abstract-class
and this is why you can t have abstract fields an abstract field would not exist in the abstract-class but only in the subclass and so is seriously

21979224

apache	nginx
apache is a process-based server while nginx is an event-based web server

21981740

when no i m able to show and hide the status bar but not change the color

post	put
this post by pete bacon darwin put me on the right track

21981955
int	double
this was already answered somewhere else how to check if a string is numeric in java but to discuss the possibilities either you assume that you have numeric strings parse the string is int or double and catch the number format exception or you use a regex

21981956
onresume	onpause
currently i found a solution where a receiver for screen on off and the methods onpause and onresume are used

21982037
keydown	keyup
on keydown event ctrl is pressed - so it returns keycode 17 and true on keyup ctrl is not pressed so the result is 17 and false

21982049
put	get
if i don s put sleep method then all data will not get

21982097

references min max avg count

21982109
min	max
i am working on adding search panel..here i have to populate the items based on the min and max price..my page front view is

21982109
min	max
here if i selecting the min price value is 100 000 means max price must show the 150 000 it has to show only 150 000 200 000

21982109
min	max
and if i selecting the min price value is 150 000 means max price must show the 200 000 it has to show only 200 000 ..etc

21982115
keydown	keyup
the keyup and keydown events are fired after the key has been pressed released

21982115
keydown	keyup
so the state of ctrlkey is correctly down for the keydown event and up for the keyup event

21982115
keydown	keyup
the latter is for checking key combinations for example if you want ctrl + s you would check for a keyup keydown event of

21982147
addclass	removeclass
you need to use addclass and removeclass instead

21982161

even though post event 1 was done like one second before post event 2 event 2 could get saved a few milliseconds before event 1 either that or my client code is bad

21982270
octal	binary	octal	decimal	octal	hex	hex	binary
other bases such as octal base 8 hex base 16 and decimal base 10 exist but these are just way of representing numbers similar to the way binary just represents a number

21982270
octal	binary	octal	decimal	octal	hex	hex	binary
octal decimal and hex in verilog are just representations of a binary format a way of viewing the data

21982270
octal	hex
the interesting thing about octal and hex is that they have a power of 2 values so they use an exact number of bits so an 9 o123 is the same as treating each octal place separately and concatenating them together

21982270
octal	binary
this does allow octal ports to be created which are just 3 bit binary ports

21982286
rss	feed
this model is not inherent to feed rss or atom but to http itself where a client queries a server to get data

21982324

21982497
getter	setter
i m working on some code where the getter and setter of a class are created using a macro

21982497
getter	setter
where member is a macro that creates a setter and getter for the members which are defined in the mystructbase

21982497
getter	setter
so that in addition to creating setter and getter the member macro also does something like calling m_myregistry.register member1 for each member

21982547

the bug is the mouseup event is fired for both mouseup and mousedown on the #bar element

21982821
picasso	android-query
see picasso or android-query for instance there are other libraries too

21982865
mouseout	mouseleave
then change mouseout to mouseleave

21982908
dlsym	dlopen
the solution is to use a lower value and not use those newer apis or to write code that decides at runtime whether to call the new apis or not and probably use dlopen dlsym

21982908
dlsym	dlopen
it seems like in general it doesn t make sense to use an app_platform value newer than android minsdkversion unless you re doing some special like being careful not to call new apis by checking the version at runtime plus making sure not to link to new apis and instead using dlopen dlsym

21982926
for-loop	loops
for-loop cycles also use combined fragment but of loops type

21983060
post	put

21983426
exponent	modulo
one is that whilst the private key need only contain the modulo and private exponent these are the only parameters required to decrypt it also contains the public exponent so that given the private key the public key can always be recreated as well as the original primes values p and q and a number of other derived parameters dp dq inverseq

21983426
exponent	modulo
it is possible to create a private key containing only the required parameters modulo and private exponent however even in this case the private key will be larger due to the sizes of the public and private exponent - the public exponent is generally small and usually one of a set of predefined values - 65537 however the corresponding private exponent is a much larger value

21983447

21986746
getter	setter
until recently i thought that there was no point in writing setter and getter for a class which fields are set only once

21986746
getter	setter
instead of the setter getter i used public constant fields or final in java and set fields via a constructor

21986755
accessor	properties
for simple properties the accessor type signatures are

21986772
onresume	onpause
why don t you try to override onunload method in your cordovaplugin class.i tried finding but the docs are mentioning the existence of onpause and onresume methods.if you got onunload in the cordovaplugin class then remove the view you are making in your view class runonuithread method

21986784

margin	height
it sounds like you have padding margin border or line height styles applying to your hidden elements only when they are displayed accounting for the difference before and after they are displayed

21986867

change height to outerheight to include this margin

21986888

put	get
seems like i cannot put a positioned psuedo element inside a contenteditable and yet have the caret to be in the correct place when clicking to get focus on the div element

21987023
getter	setter
the point of using setter and getter are to encapsulate the access to these values

21987023
getter	setter
but while the getter and setter offer a small protection against change they still reflect very much the data structure beneath so you are still likely to get in trouble

21987023
getter	setter
the best solution is to try to avoid getter and setter and instead provide the services that the clients of the class actually need

21987033
getter	setter
if you have noticed even if the field name or variable name is different you can access it through the setter getter

21987033
getter	setter
so basing that the jsf uses setter getter to get the field

21987052
width	height
the shape properties x y width height were not right

21987064
hide	show
this will show hide the following

21987084

width	height
i assume that you need to do some calculation involving your height and width values or some other constants and that you d need to return the result

21987595
client-side	server-side
php is a server-side language and javascript is client-side

getter	setter
the dot separator is just shorthand for getting setting properties instead of having to invoke the appropriate setter getter method

21987890
submit	submission
to intercept a form submission you could intercept the click on the submit button or intercept the form submission itself

21987890
submit	submission
if your objective is to intercept the form submission then do that not the click event on the submit button as forms can be submitted by other events such as hitting enter on a textfield

21987890
submit	submission
if you intercept the form via jquery with and then go on to pass off the submit handling to another function as in the question where a call to a geocoding api is made then that function will need to trigger the form submission via acting on the dom form element directly document.getelementbyid myform submit which will submit the form without triggering the onsubmit event so that the initial intercept isn t triggered again creating an infinite loop as it would be if you used jquery to trigger the submit

21987917
post	get
in my opinion no you won t get any benefit from spinning off a task thread to do the work as described in your post

21987932
folder	directory
if both of your modules are located in the same source directory define the same source folder for both and exclude the unwanted packages with sonar.exclusions

21987977
put	get
yes is fine but if this values are the application configuration you can put this in the web.config file and use configurationmanager to get this values

21988026
post	get
you could use cgi.pm param method to fetch the value from post or get parameters

21988045
hide	show
now once you applied filter so all those rows need not to be show remove class show and and add class hide now your style is filtering only tr.show so it will count even and odd only on tr.show which are visible and you will get what you want

21988085

min	max
and for example the values it takes to shown in the label are from series1 min 1 to series1 max 5 that it s the max from serie1

21988189
min	max
so the labels i must show will be from min 5 to max 15

21988220
jar	manifest.mf
maven-assembly-plugin is configured to copy the shiro bundle jar to lib dw-shiro-bundle-0.0.1-snapshot.jar but in the final jar s manifest.mf the dependency is listed as io.ifar.dw-shiro-bundle-0.0.1-20130412.232035-4.jar and hence i get a classdefnotfounderror at runtime

cells	tablecell
edit for future readers do not mess with tablecell objects except in cells factory

what they recommend you do is let the user make local edits against entities resolved from your sandbox entitymanager then somehow perhaps by importing as you are doing replicate the change back to the master entitymanager

21988671

tried downloading the theme charcoal black and put it in library preferences aquamacs emacs customize.el

21989004
hide	show
my idea was to have a controller per page using a menucontroller to show hide the controllers so only one is ever visible at a time

21989004
hide	show
it uses a service to maintain page show hide state and the observer pattern to push notifications to a variable in each page controller to change a show bool

21989005

21989014
dictionary	map
i could also have a a dictionary somewhere to store the templates and map them to the form elements

21989038

21990045

add the poster image to the containing element and set its width to 100 and height to auto

21990445
strlen	memmove
i get segmentation fault core dumped for the above program and if i modify the memmove instruction with strlen p+i+2 then it doesnt give segmentation fault but gets stuck in some sort of infinite loop.please tell me where i am going wrong

21990447
implements	extends	setcontentview	findviewbyid	oncreate	findviewbyid	oncreate	setcontentview
the problem is that your adapter is extends activity and not implements setcontentview inside the oncreate method so it fails when calling findviewbyid r.id.list_view

21990585
width	height
i have tried changing xml layout parameters width and height to match_parent wrap_content and fill_parent but still same thing

margin	height
a pure css solution would be to set the inside div a height and add margin -height 2 px for it

21990687
width	height
i ve combined translateanimation and scaleanimation according to the screen width and height you can pass any view button imageview linarlayout... as parameter and your root layout must have rootlayout id

21990721
phpmyadmin	heidisql
you then might even paste the query s textinto a standalone mysql client phpmyadmin or maybe heidisql or something to see what you get

21990764
width	height
you can also skip the layoutparams constructor completely and just pass a width and height directly to the parent with a simpler call

and why dplyr reverses sorting of the grouping

21991178

in that case use maven or add in ivy into your current build system and use a jar repository like nexus or artifactory to store these jars

21991201
width	height
to clarify the height of all 3 imageviews should become equal to the width of 1 imageview

21991358
tiff	png
the people that want this update on the site had used a aspx page that received a request param to search for the tiff image convert it to a png and stream the file to the client by using response.outputstream.write now this process of converting the file and streaming it is taking somewhere between 500ms to a full minute and this are files that are 100kb at the most

21991358
google-chrome	firefox
the above method only worked on firefox tho as apparently there is a limitation as to how big the strings can be apparently 32kb for ie and google-chrome firefox seems to have this limitation as well but it seems like it allows for bigger sized strings

21991383
mouse	keyboard
the bios only has code to communicate with a limited subset of devices required to boot the system storage controllers ethernet usb keyboard mouse usb mass storage

21991385

this is because we can think of format as a two-way pipe that allows us to put in a jsvalue and get out some a or to put in that a and get out a jsvalue

21991408
rss	feed
your rss feed parser would return a hash but you use

21991429
maven	pom.xml
but when i try to find the dependencies to add the same jars into my pom.xml for a maven project i was not able to look it up online

21991437
put	get
if you are going to change the db it would only really make sense to put in the effort if you were also going to change the app and then you should be really get some input from users on what features are still useful and what is broken before you get too involved in a back-end refresh

21991523
width	height
the only standart way to do this is to set exact width height some_value

21991638
indesign	framemaker
2 use an xml-aware desktop publishing tool such as adobe indesign or framemaker

21991783
stdout	stderr
which will redirect stderr to dev null while leaving stdout unchanged

21991838
uiviewcontroller	uipageviewcontroller
the way i ve set this up is through a uipageviewcontroller where each page of the user profile is its own uiviewcontroller with a uiscrollview since each page can get long so that the user can smoothly swipe between pages as they walk through it

21991838
uitableview	uipageviewcontroller
unfortunately the pan gesture which activates the swipe-to-delete in a uitableview is being picked up by the uipageviewcontroller and scrolls to the next page instead of showing the delete button

21991838
uitableview	uipageviewcontroller
ideally i would access the pan gesture recognizer of the uipageviewcontroller and try to set up some dependency between it and the uitableview s pan gesture recognizer or have some logic for the uipageviewcontroller s gesture recognizer not to fire within the area of the uitableviewcontroller or something

21991861

21992006
principalcontext	userprincipal
both userprincipal and principalcontext are disposable classes which would suggest that their disposal is somewhat independent

21992006
principalcontext	userprincipal
but what i find in practice is that disposing of the principalcontext apparently does have some affect on the userprincipal

21992006
principalcontext	userprincipal
although i am still able to access properties of the userprincipal after the principalcontext is disposed if i try to call a method like getgroups on the userprincipal after the principalcontext is disposed i get an error about trying to access a disposed object

21992006
principalcontext	userprincipal
there s no telling what separate resources userprincipal might need to clean up independently of the principalcontext

21992032
stdout	stderr
as len jaffe said you probably want to throw away stderr output rather than displaying it to your screen or wherever your stderr is going but not stdout that contains the message you want to capture

21992033
post	get
i m currenlty putting each post in a but this just stacks all of the divs and i get a large space between post which are bigger

21992166
build.gradle	gradlew
since you are using gradlew you could simple add your own task in build.gradle

21992183
principalcontext	userprincipal
since userprincipal requires an instance of principalcontext i wouldn t do that

21992290
setinterval	settimeout
you should use setinterval instead of settimeout

21992290
setinterval	clearinterval
setinterval will cause the stepcode function to run every milliseconds until you call clearinterval timeout

21992316
setinterval	settimeout
in addition to suggested setinterval use that will call stepcode at 1 second intervals until cleared or until the page is reloaded and correction of removing after stepcode that results in immediate stepcode executon you can still use settimeout if they are chained as shown below

21992327
min	max
i have a report with total max min avg at the bottom of it

21992338
elasticsearch	kibana
i had a similar problem today after upgrading to elasticsearch 1.0 on friday thought kibana was still working fine page loaded and the graphs + data still displayed until i tried adding a filter at which point it started spitting out error messages

i upgrade kibana to versioning 3 milestone 5 the current latest versioning and the problem went away

highcharts	highstock
i m sure this is possible given the never-ending plethora of options highcharts highstock has but i am out of options on where to look

21992358
highcharts	highstock
whether there s an easy way to this with highcharts highstock options using the original time-stamps alone or whether i need to convert every time-stamp to a date compare months while adding values together then re-converting back into a time-stamp and finding a chart option which omits all but the month and year i have to get this done

21992409

21992441
getter	setter
also don t use _ball but self.ball this ensures the corresponding getter setter are called

21992441
accessor	properties
in general you should use accessor methods or dot syntax for properties access even if youâ re accessing an objectâ s properties from within its own implementation in which case you should use self

21992442
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i have a form that has required fields and it will not submit the form unless you fill in the required items it works in google-chrome and firefox but it does not work in safari

21992458
width	height
to keep it short the ratio of the container div s width and padding should always be equal to the ratio of the image s width and height

21992458
width	height
this way the browser will automatically assume that the image height is the same as it s width and preoccupy the place

21992517
sorting	filtering
in this case since you re sorting you can get away with just using filtering after which a subsequent request will be plenty fast if the filtering is cached

21992529
min	max
the min and max contain the left and right most x-axis inclusive values

21992593
pecl	pear
here are two examples of libraries pecl and pear

21992656
ssl	https
if you try using with the https instead you may avoid this problem since ssl cannot be altered by proxies

21992656
ssl	https
if you want you could add the force-ssl package to make everyone use ssl and avoid this problem - if the https works

21992687
sorting	filtering
i would like to be able to add this filtering and sorting on attrb2 too

21992697
google-chrome	firefox
internet explorer uses activex plugins while google-chrome firefox and others use npapi plugins

21992697
google-chrome	firefox
you could easily implement a function to check if your app is installed and deploy a firebreah plugin compatible with ie google-chrome firefox etc

21992748

21992989

21993157
public	protected
parent of that class has a public constructor calling one of its own protected methods

21993218
centos	linux
update i ve found something called upstart which apparently is used by quite a few linux distros now including centos 6.4 to manage processes

21993246

tried both setinterval and settimeout

21993246
setinterval	settimeout
i sort of understand the difference between setinterval settimeout

21993257
int	double
without having all the values it s hard to be sure but the problem here might be that you re using a non precise number type double to hold what could be precisely stored in an int column

21993367
action-filter	onactionexecuting
it is possible to do so by creating an action-filter and overriding onactionexecuting but the difficulty is gaining a reference to the isession or your iunitofwork implementation in the filter

21993468
google-chrome	safari	webkit	blink
note that is the webkit bug the safari one - the blink google-chrome bug is at

if possible use ajax jquery get or post

21993726
width	height
there are maxx and maxy values which is the width and height of the container

21993750

the reason the locations are jumping around is that autolocator which is the default locator tries to put the ticks at nice locations integers even multiples etc so you don t get tick labels that look like 1.52547841082

21993781
versioning	upgrade
the plugin is upgrade if you change the versioning number in version.php

21993961
min	max
if we have chosen the side we need to choose whether to move the min or max edge

21998822
super	implements
under arc you can ignore the mrc overrides and you can add the use of gcd as you have done to ensure concurrent correctness and that will leave you with one trick apple implements allocwithzone by calling sharedmanager your sharedinstance and having that in turn call allocwithzone on super

int	double
one thing that you can do is changing the datatype of suma to int but remember to cast it back to double in avg computation

21999786
setinterval	clearinterval
this is essentially down to two issues firstly that the implementations of setinterval and clearinterval are different on the client at least in chrome and in node and secondly that you can t serialise functions in bson which means that all your methods and properties containing methods are being dropped from the object when you try to insert it as a document on the server

21999786
put	get	setinterval	clearinterval
if you log the return value of setinterval in the client you ll notice that it s just an integer which can of course be serialised and so you get exactly the same thing out of the mongodb as you put in and clearinterval works fine

children	parent
if a ruby script could somehow pipe pages of text into...oh wait....the xml structure wouldn t allow it due to the fact that it wouldn t have the closing delimeters from the end of the undigested text file......so what you would have to do is some custom work on the front end cut out those first couple parent brackets so that you can pluck out the xml children one by one and have the last closing parent brackets break the script because the parser will think it is finished and come across another closing bracket i guess

getter	setter
unfortunatly the documentation for model property setter and getter is somewhat deficient and i m having trouble getting my little setter to work

22002703
min	max
isn t there a 10 min max for the above type of approach

22002732
width	height
when configuring the height and width constraints pass nil for the toitem parameter and 0 for the 2nd attribute

22002732
width	height
also the height and width constraints should be added to the gradientview not the main view

22002738
uiview	cagradientlayer
best bet is subclass uiview and use to return a cagradientlayer then it will automatically match the size of the view under auto layout otherwise you ll need to position your layers manually using something like layoutsubviews

22002744
apache	nginx
i will consider this but when possible i d like to do this with apache as nginx would make other things more complicated and cost me a lot of time

22002754
hide	show
2 hide my sub-sub nav and show it inline as well

22002761
express	node.js
each div also has a form field with a hidden value for returning the doc _id to then use in express node.js to find and delete the correct doc this does work in another app..

22002792
inherited	properties
in your example when you do not override the default properties of the span your element behaves like text and thus has also an font-size shadow-property which is set to inherited

22002802
projectile	angle
the user will enter the initial positions and speed and an angle of projection and matlab will create the projectile motion

22002843
versioning	upgrade
webpages assembly versioning did not change it was only a nuget package versioning upgrade

22002871
for-loop	loops
you are incrementing n in the for-loop but testing its contraint in the outer while loops

22002899
scrypt	pbkdf2
then you can look for a php pbkdf2 bcrypt or scrypt implementation to use

22002899
hex	binary
- adnan s answer in particular includes php functions though if you use bin2hex you ll need a char 32 column for 32 hex characters the same as 16 binary bytes

22002899
pbkdf2	hash
never use an output size for pbkdf2 greater than the native hash size listed above or it s a free bonus to the defender

22002899
versioning	upgrade
optional a column for the versioning of password securing you re using so you can upgrade to another versioning later with easy

22002900
folder	directory
make sure you have a writable db-cache folder in your app directory as well

22002965
ubuntu	debian
install dependencies on debian ubuntu

22003001
pull	push
you can run heroku config pull --overwrite --interactive to generate an initial .env file that includes your service secrets etc and heroku config push to save it remotely

22003007
boost	allocator
use allocator from boost which potentially do the same like the previous point

22003028
for-loop	loops
it s because you re using a for-loop and inside loops you get new data and discard all data obtained from the previous iteration of loops so most of the data is discarded and wasted

22003028
for-loop	arrays
consider creating either a 2d arrays or probably better a list of list so you can hold all the results returned in the for-loop

22003046
onresume	onpause
you want to start your timer in onstart onresume and stop it in onstop onpause

22003046
onresume	onpause
note that you need to choose a consistent pair onstart onstop or onresume onpause to get a consistent behaviour

22003081
laravel	codeigniter
quick question i am studying laravel 4 as i am coming from codeigniter i noticed that some laravel tutorials have their queries in the controller and some have their queries in the model

22003097
restrict	shared
i run on a restrict shared hosting godaddy

22003257
explode	substr
i am looking for some methods like explode substr but as i mentioned at the beginning i cannot handle this nested sentence

22003262
128bit	64bit
with your 128bit key type you should be able to combine the two 64bit words to generate a hash with fewer operations

22003287
queue	fifo
this is assuming of course that we only have your basic fifo queue and lifo stack available no access to deques or other linked lists

22003296
tostring	charat
you can work this by using the charat method for string an putting appropriate characters into a stringbuffer and then running tostring on the stringbuffer

22003321
portrait	landscape
my uiscrollview with an embedded uiimageview works perfect in portrait but when i switch to landscape it s incredibly messed up

22003400
client-side	server-side
i have created a custom validation attribute which works server-side after form is posted but i cannot get the validation to work client-side

22003402
tablet	galaxy
for the record my two devices that i test on are a galaxy s4 phone and a nexus 7 tablet

22003450
interbase	firebird
interestingly if you lookup the history of interbase you ll see borland actually made interbase open source back in july 2000 at which point it was forked off into an open source database called firebird -

22003450
interbase	firebird
now the cool thing here is that the drivers that work with the old firebird v2.1 and prior will also work with interbase 6.0 all the way up to interbase xe 64-bit probably because the open source fork had not yet deviated from its interbase roots

22003450
interbase	firebird
the newer firebird drivers for .net 2.0+ however do not work with interbase

22003474
curb	libcurl
this is my code using the curb gem which implements some of the libcurl bindings for ruby

22003476
udp	tcp
this means that we only enable the encryption protocols after the tcp udp etc

22003482
width	height
i want the camera to be positioned at a z index which will result in the cube being shown at exactly the same pixel width and height no matter what the size or aspect ratio of the window is

22003482
width	height
so when the user sees the screen display the user should see the cube having the exact same pixel width and height on their screen

22003482
width	height
now i guess that the camera z position must be a function of the window width height aspect ratio and a constant

22003482
width	height
perhaps i need to add the constraint that the object should have exactly the same width and height in pixels matching 100 pixels wide and 100 pixels high

22003482
width	height
i don t understand the geometry of this or the maths of this but what i did was i noticed that the objects size was dependant on the height of the window and not dependant on the width of the window

22003482
width	height
again i don t know why but when i resized the height the object became bigger or smaller but when i resized the width the object stayed the same

22003486
comparator	comparable
this can be done by implementing the interface comparable in faculty class and defining the function comparator as follows

22003514
put	get
get its absolute path and add a separator then put the file name of the file you want to read

22003618
width	height
to keep this example really simple i have one section tag that has its position fixed and a height and width of 100

22003642
onresume	onpause	onstart	ondestroy
if you re pressing the back button in activity b without overriding it s functionality the system will kill the current activity b -- onpause onstop ondestroy and return to the last one a -- onrestart onstart onresume

22003664
pbkdf2	salt	pbkdf2	hash	hash	salt
you should use pbkdf2 for openssl that s pkcs5_pbkdf2_hmac with evp_sha512 as the hash function - you ll need evp.h and sha.h to derive an encryption key of the required size from your master password and salt and then use say openssl to actually do the encryption using something other than ecb mode

22003698
onchange	onkeyup
what i need is connect the onkeyup event to my to my current code that have onchange event of dropdown

22003790
bluetooth	usb
tried with pc to nxt both in winxp and win7 i even bought a standalone bluetooth usb key similar once input the pin in pc same as the one in nxt set the nxt quickly to say line is busy then the pc always take couple minutes to finish the driver installation seems like mapping to some com port then pc state paired successfully but it never did in nxt

google-chrome	firefox
i ve got this filter that works in google-chrome and firefox but i can t get it working in ie

22003885
japplet	jdialog
if instead you concentrate on creating jpanels instead then you have the freedom to use these jpanels anywhere needed -- in a jframe or jdialog or japplet or inside of another jpanel or swapped with other jpanels via a cardlayout

22003893
for-loop	loops
however your while loops will empty the result set so that on the second and subsequent iterations of your for-loop there are no rows to fetch

22003931
navigationcontroller	pushviewcontroller
if you have a navigationcontroller for rootviewcontroller you can try pushviewcontroller animated before do dismiss authentication controller and push animated can be no

22003960
hide	show
hide your form first then show the admin form

22003972

to do this i am pulling the screen size and then setting the center of the image to the screen width and height minus a certain amount

22003990
spaces	delimiter
i m trying to read a large textfile into a singly linked list separate out each word using a spaces as a delimiter and then have a user find any word that may be in the textfile

22004002
min	max
and from what i can tell they implement max and min as non-const static functions

22004017
clang	llvm
i know very little about clang llvm internals so i m not sure how much effort this would require

22004020
vbscript	vba
the only problem is that it is a vba and not vbscript

22004034
execl	fork
i m asking because i m trying to write a c program that fork a child and uses execl to call xargs but my program hangs so before i try to continue coding the program i want to at least be able to call xargs just right from the command line

22004046
np-hard	np-complete
i know that if a is np-complete and it is polynomial time reducible to b then b is np-hard

22004046
np-hard	np-complete
however in order to be np-complete it must meet 1 it s in np and 2 it s np-hard

22004070
hide	show
hi guys i would just like to ask some help regarding my problem i have this form that i put the textboxes and labels with and i set them to false if i click the button and i also put labels and textboxes to be set to true so that they will be visible but when i run the program it only hide the textboxes and labels that i specified and it does not show the labels and textboxes that i set to true

22004096
for-loop	arrays
note i would use a for-loop to iterate through each char after it is an arrays of characters

22004101
setinterval	settimeout
the necessary conditions seem to be a setinterval or repeating settimeout an expensive computation in the body of the interval a call to a new object passing data that contains a string and a string comparison

22004123
put	get
put media in the printer to get rid of the error then you can set the wireless settings

google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
but i never get any names when in any of the browsers like google-chrome firefox or safari

22004187
gson	jackson
or consider using a different json parsing library like jackson or gson that mostly does this for you based on some pojo class

22004193
dlsym	dlopen
even the dlsym function cannot be confused since you pass the handle returned by the dlopen function so it would not by any mean become ambiguous

22004257
oncreate	onstart
i understand the oncreate method creates the activity and then once it s finished then calls onstart automatically

22004293
gtk	pygobject
i m creating a gtk gstreamer application c gstreamer for audio and pygobject gtk for gui which waits for midi input and responds to it

google-chrome	firefox
in practice however it does not appear that mainstream browsers firefox does the same thing as google-chrome as does ie honor the fractional component of the tabindex value

22004400
folder	directory
i need to get all the files from folder and subfolders of a directory with filter condition received from drop down

22004425
min	max
you are recursively calling it with the min and max indexes of the list itself rather than basing the new parameters on the parameters passed to the method

22004485
pbkdf2	hash	scrypt	pbkdf2
the best way which you ve ruled out purely within the .net framework is to change everything over to have the passwords hash by pbkdf2 bcrypt or scrypt

22004485
pbkdf2	salt	pbkdf2	hash	hash	salt
you take your current nasty old hash and pbkdf2 them with a new random salt and a high number of iterations and store the result

22004485
versioning	upgrade
versioning 2 which users who have versioning 1 hashes are upgrade to

22004485

returns jquery xmlhttprequest jqxhr object

22004789
google-chrome	firefox
works fine with google-chrome and firefox

22004822
loops	while-loop
the main class would then just create the tictactoe instance and run a main loops the while-loop i posted above which modifies it accordingly

22004858
16-bit	64bit
these are actual low-level byte arrays and you can use them with 8-bit 16-bit 32-bit and 32 64bit float values signed and unsigned latter not for float

22004862
accessor	properties
be called by set accessor of each properties that needs notification

22004872
implements	extends
ok after looking around into the gwt source code of textbox and some other classes it extends implements here is what i came up with

22004898
int	chars
the relevant parts are that â œwhen invoked the steps must be followed in the order given aborting at the first step that returns a value.â and â œif the chars indicated by position is not an ascii digit then return an error.â the decimal place is not an ascii digit so an error will be returned and the digit before the decimal place will be used as the int

22004921
int	chars
if i test it by entering a chars value in place of the int it actually catches the error once and then prints my you did not..... statement

22005017
width	height
image resolution is 4648 3504 width 8 height and file size is 563kb

22005017

so as per the instructions in the developer.android.com i scaled the image according to available screen width and height images loading with out any problem

22005039
hide	show
basically the drop down menu needs to also show and hide the correct divs

22005039
hide	show
update i added the show hide class function to my jsfiddle s function e and now the drop down show the correct div but doesn t hide the previous

22005119
int	double
or primitive int double ... equality

22005137
width	height
set the autoresizingmask property of the webview to flexible width and height

22005200
google-chrome	safari
in kitchen sink they gave support to browsers like google-chrome safari

22005210
marionette	underscore.js
i m jumping head first into marionette underscore.js and require for this project

22005218
children	parent
i think you re trying to do the opposite - a single parent with multiple types of children

22005230
put	get
you see i m making a database where the user types in 3 numbers and in return will get a file read as out put

22005230
put	get
the error says that it should be an else if but when i put the if next to it i automatically get 100 errors

22005307
int	double
you may need a cast in there to convert the double that math.exp spits out to int or whatever you prefer

22005308
min	max
try playing with the different values none mid min max and see what works for you

22005313
post	get
i am trying to get a custom single page to spit out the title and content of the post the title works fine the content of the post doesn t seem to want to come through

22005368

tested on ie firefox google-chrome

22005444
inherited	properties
the font tag by default inherited it s text-decoration properties from it s parent

22005444
fontfamily	font-size
alternatively you could apply the pluslink class to your a tag and edit your css code to include the font-size and fontfamily

22005456
getter	setter
adding getter and setter is pointless for basic data containers

22005485
fieldset	formpanel
in my mobile app i have a formpanel with a fieldset with textfields that could have been filled from some desktop application by a skilled secretary with well beyond 300 keystrokes per minute

22005498
hash	salt
it is not that you simply need to do hash sha512 salt + hash - it s more complex than that

22005498
scrypt	pbkdf2
and note that pbkdf2 bcrypt and scrypt are all means of doing so

22005498
pbkdf2	hash
pbkdf2 also known as pkcs#5v2 and rfc2898 is in fact reasonably close to what you re doing multiple iterations of a normal hash function particular in the form of pbkdf2-hmac-sha-512 in particular section 5.2 lists

22005498
hash	md5
sha-512 was a good choice of hash primitive - sha-512 and sha-384 are also superior to md5 sha-1 and even sha-224 and sha-256 because sha-384 and up use 64-bit operations which current gpu s early 2014 do not have as much of an advantage over current cpu s with as they do 32-bit operations thus reducing the margin of superiority attackers have for offline attacks

22005508
hide	show
now i need to have a text on the same page so that i can put some event handling to it.like show hide a division on click

22005526
boost	allocator
i m trying to use boost fast_pool_allocator in place of the standard allocator and it won t work ironically with another boost library because fast_pool_allocator has more than one template parameter even though it claims to be compatible with std allocator and everything except the first has a default value

22005579
width	height
i m having a really weird problem with haml and scss...i want to loop through div.star and apply a random width height and position

22005627
rsa	dsa
but in contrast to rsa dsa can be used only for digital signatures

22005637
hide	show
i need to show hide remove delete icon based on condition.for ex var a 2 var b 2

22005657
ubuntu	linux
i am trying to access sql window server from linux ubuntu 12.04 server by php pdo extension but showing me the connection was reset from the browser

22005661
portrait	landscape
when user press the done button or close button simply pop the viewcontroller and as the previous screen don t support landscape mode so the screen will automatically shows in portrait mode

22005681
getter	setter
now accessing objects with getter and setter via works fine but method invocation via throws the following error

22005699
stdout	stderr
then the command s stdout and stderr will be stored in the stdout and stderr variables respectively

22005709
qscrollarea	qwidget
manually create a qwidget innerwidget and assign it to scrollarea via qscrollarea setwidget qwidget try different size policy to innerwidget such as preferred

22005710
google-chrome	firefox
but when i tried to browse it using firefox or google-chrome the pop-up calendar is not working

22005722
min	max
for that we need to find the min and max values and apply it in the equation v1

22005722
min	max
my new maxa and new mina is 0.1 0.0 respectively and i also have each columns max and min

22005722
min	max
apply eqn for each attribute and emit the entire row min and max value is known in reducer itself

22005822
scrypt	pbkdf2
pbkdf2 rfc2898 pkcs#5v2 bcrypt and scrypt are the current good ways to store passwords

22005822
hex	binary	hash	salt
store the password hash the plaintext binary or hex string or base64 string salt and the number of iterations in the database

22005822
versioning	upgrade
if possible also store a versioning so that you can easily upgrade to a new algorithm later

22005920
rtp	sip
in a normal sip call the media rtp gets send directly between the clients

22005920
sip	sdp
in the sip invite dialog the body of the invite message is normally in sdp format

22005920
sip	sdp
you can see that s it s sdp format because the sip message should include something like

22005949
width	height
if you ve already created the plot then you can use the bokeh.plotting.curplot function to return the current plot and then set its height and width attributes

22005964
int	double
pyside appears to differentiate int float which it refers to as double str unicode which both become unicode and bool but all other python types are parsed as pyobject for the purpose of signal signatures

22005974
hex	binary
generally hex values are preferred over decimal values as the conversion to binary from hex involves less computation than the conversion from decimal

22005994
vb.net	vb6
you re looking for vb.net or vb6

22005995
vb.net	vb6
you re looking for vb.net or vb6

22006044
jtree	jtable
the models of of jtree and jtable are responsible for telling the view that they should be updated

22006046
button	checkbox
if you are implementing the tableview programatically then the better way is to create a custom cell which will have button and obviously other ui components that you need to show in the table view cell which will work as a checkbox and assign button.tag as indexpath.row which will help you to select multiple rows

22006059
button	checkbox
just add button like checkbox and multiple choose like checkbox

22006061
int	chars
the possible solution is that you need to take out the first 2 chars out of your column value and then do the sorting on the int value

22006118
outputstream	inputstream
both writevalue and readvalue has many overloaded methods to support different type of inputstream and outputstream

22006221
button	checkbox	checkbox	dropdownlistfor
field 2 dropdownlistfor values 1 2 3 4 5 or radio button or checkbox or text-box

22006230
portrait	landscape
the main view always loads in portrait even if the current device orientation is landscape and even if the only orientation supported by the app is landscape

22006294
for-loop	arrays
am trying to rebuild the json arrays using a for-loop to iterate over the elements but

22006309
asterisk	freeswitch
like freeswitch or asterisk

22006362
getter	setter
you are experiencing this issue because getter and setter are currently only support synchronous actions

22006372
viewdidload	viewwillappear
in your controllers when internet connection appears or periodically or in - void viewdidload or - void viewwillappear methods

22006379
put	get
however i ve managed to put this code to use on both the front page and in a custom tab cms block but i can t work out how to get the featured image to show along with the excerpt

22006445
children	parent
with the tree model you may also want to implement certain methods in a node data class so that your tree nodes can provide information about themselves their parent and children

22006483
width	height
but the height and width are fixed i wanna the height can be auto adjust by the content

22006505
velocity	thymeleaf
afaik it would be difficult to do that simply because returned view name is logical name and the underlying view technology can be drastically different for jsp velocity thymeleaf etc

22006511
inherited	subclassing
you forgot to have your subclassing inherited from geometricobject

22006511
inherited	properties
additional note you should probably call geometricobject.__init__ to set the properties triangle and circle inherited from geometricobject instead of assigning them directly

22006511
superclass	subclassing
if geometricobject.__init__ did something more complex with its arguments the subclassing constructors would either not handle it properly or become too tied to the superclass s implementation details

22006553
hide	show
then you just show or hide the date div and it will always stay on top

22006553
pop-up	dialog
and if you want a modal dialog pop-up div this is a start for that

22006570
next	except
if you want to discard all next except the latest .

22006654
width	height
but i am confused about how to determine appropriate height and width of image to be displayed in any device

22006654

the first parameter specifies a field width and the second a chars or string int etc. to write out in that width of field

22007576
salt	md5
my opinion is no because it is more vulnerable to man in middle attacks by stealing session id also md5 is outdated now you can use sha-256 or 512 for hashing and salt password hashing will improve the security

22007748
box-sizing	border-box
we also need box-sizing border-box on the cells so that the cell sizes are inclusive of the border size otherwise the cells would not fit in next to each other as the border widths would be added to the cell widths and exceed 100 in the normal content-box layout

getter	setter
i have the following conclusion in getter and setter from the clean code book

22008228

somewhat evil getter and setter where they re not required

22008228
getter	setter
good getter and setter only where they re really required - make

22008243
width	height
i m trying to dynamically change chart height and width into 100 from action script

22008277
division	modulo
obviously that is just equivalent of x 16 - modulo from division to 16 since is will leave the corresponding bits

22008277
division	modulo
so as you can see if r is derived from division of perfect square then modulo must be same as modulo of r 2 16 - thus it can be only 0 1 4 and 9

22008300
post	get
check out two post i wrote several years back that may be helpful while they don t cover session handling they do cover the multiple song-and-dance routines i had to follow to get proper 500 and 404 handling in various versions of asp.net

getter setter helps in maintaining the software entropy of a system

22008421
getter	setter
do not create getter setter where it is not required as its leads to boilerplate code

width	margin
you can then give extra width to the top border to make up for the margin

22008498
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
doing a reset on your objectoutputstream also resets the objectinputstream state

22008501
getter	setter
this is possible in browsers with proper support for es5 s getter and setter which is all modern browsers not ie8 and earlier

22008516
getter	setter
now remember that the setter for a place is found at compile time and that the setter operation of a place is different from the getter

22008516
getter	setter
a place is an abstract idea which combines a setter with a given getter

casting	autoboxing
so finally the rational is that you only reference bufferedimage with the abstract image and if ever your image object isn t a bufferedimage one yet then you can just make an image out of this related-but-non-bufferedimage-instance without having to worry about any conversion casting autoboxing or whatever

first of all you might want to choose for a one-to-many many-to-one relationship using an intermediate entity instead of a many-to-many relationship

22010971
many-to-many	many-to-one	many-to-many	one-to-many	many-to-one	one-to-many
consequently the direct many-to-many association disappears and is replaced by one-to-many many-to-one associations between the 3 participating classes

if you re going to use java2d features such as transforms constructing shape s or path2d s then it s not likely to improve performance and may even reduce it due to frequent conversion between int and double

22017870
floating-point	integer
if you re only going to use it with your own code and only intend to perform integer arithmetic and that in tight loops with many iterations then you re likely to see some performance improvements as you re now doing integer arithmetic which is faster than floating-point arithmetic on any cpu that i ve ever heard of

22018800
getter	setter
my approach for doing this is right now by first creating a header which declares setter and getter for my struct

22018800
getter	setter
i will then make a cpp file where i include the struct somestruct and implement the getter setter

22018800
getter	setter
i have structs with 50-100 attributes and its kind of time consuming to first write setter getter and then make a property in the managed class for each attribute

to start with to get start and end time you can use min and max like so

22019128
for-loop	arrays
while others pointed out your mistake you increased counter before you used it to read character at position described by it i would suggest to use enhanced for-loop it can iterate over arrays or instances of classes which implements iterable interface something like

22019237
heapsort	shellsort	quicksort	heapsort	quicksort	shellsort
you can look up insertion sort also o n 2 but more efficient than bubble sort or selection sort also quadratic or shellsort very roughly o n 3 2 or heapsort o nlgn or quicksort o nlgn on average but o n 2 in the worst case or intro sort

22019239
protractor	intern
protractor uses the webdriverjs library not the wd.js library so it is not likely to be directly compatible but the idea behind how protractor works would be possible just as well in intern by writing the same kinds of helper functions that protractor provides

width	height
anyway as long as i know you don t need 2x version of your images as long as you don t support old displays but remember that your images as to be double width and height then if you have a 100x100px uiimageview you need to load a 200x200px image to meet retina resolution

22020171
rss	feed
using php to generate a xml rss feed

22020172
button	checkbox
this would make sense since you are changing from checkbox multiple values can be selected at a time array to radio button only a single value can be selected at a time string

22020172
button	checkbox
if you truly want to change from checkbox to radio button then you ll need to update your build_role_ids method logic to expect a single value instead of an array of values

22020174
mouseup	mousedown
found a funny solution using mousedown and mouseup events

22020357
int	boolean
of course this is a general concept that applies to any dynamically instantiated class not just nsstring - but doesn t apply to primitive data type int boolean float etc. because variables of those types hold the actual value not a pointer to the area in memory where the value is

hide	show
however this takes about 5 seconds so i want to show and hide a loading screen while this process gets completed

22020388
versioning	upgrade
features and or upgrade which were released in one versioning of worklight may not be compatible in older environment versioning

22020388
versioning	upgrade
both the server and studio versioning must be the same in order to utilize all upgrade and features across both environments.

22020388
versioning	upgrade
it is possible to upgrade an instance of worklight server to versioning 6.1.0 without upgrading your existing applications to worklight studio versioning 6.1.0

22020388
versioning	upgrade
in my opinion you should upgrade your server to match your studio versioning

the non-intuitive solution is to remove the height and width attributes from the element use the viewbox attribute to establish the aspect ratio and use css to specify min and max height and width

22022113
free	malloc
if you allocate memory dynamically using malloc for both struct pointers fomresult fomresult you should use separate two free functions to free there memory along with freeing mresult

22022121
prepare	execute
i would recommend using prepare and execute call

22022135
cgsize	cgrect	cgpoint	cgrect	cgpoint	cgsize

22022477
getter	setter
you may ask yourself why i want a derived iterator with this additonal getter and setter as above examples suggest that t_vector is initialised with the underling tuple of the zip_iterator anyway

22022482
google-chrome	firefox
i have tried in google-chrome firefox ie and same thing total is 0 no matter what options i check

22022552
cgpoint	cgrect	getter	setter
when a cgpoint or any other struct - cgrect etc. is a property of an objective-c object the mechanics of getter setter methods and the value semantics of c structs means that there is some level of protection against indirectly modifying the value of a cgpoint property of an object

width	height
personally i feel like the scrollviewer should not allow its children to determine its width height when the scroll mode is disabled in a particular direction as it breaks nested scrollviewer s

22022881

i ve tested in google-chrome 33.0.1750.117 and firefox 27.0.1 with the same result

22023411
getter	setter
that way you can declare all of your data points within and use getter and setter functions to modify and print them

22023411
getter	setter
use the getter if you choose to print the value to the screen and the setter if you want to set the data

22023436
children	parent
also since the events aren t children of the days there is no way to rely on them as a parent for spacing and sizing

22023476
children	parent
often the posts are the children of the filtered categories so their classes contain the parent s category name in the name of the class but not equal to this name

22023484
terminate	timeout
there can be timeout elsewhere on webserver and user s patience which may result in the connection being terminate - in the absence of transactions this can cause data integrity issues

22023491

if the message is â žunable to open fileâ make sure that the working directory which is the directory any file path will be interpreted relatively to is what you think it is when you run the application from the explorer the working directory is the executable folder but when you launch your program from your ide visual studio code blocks ... the working directory is sometimes set to the project directory instead

22024025
firefox	safari
tested in chomre firefox and safari

i believe it to be valid json and each one of the above fields exists in my database however when i post to the correct url i get that 422 error

22024251
clojure.test	midje
i am using clojure maven plugin and i have written tests using both clojure.test and midje

22024251
clojure.test	midje
clojure.test integrates well with maven and mvn test runs all tests where as midje tests are evaluated but not reported from mvn test

22024293
webclient	webrequest
if you want to see the full response i suggest you use webrequest webresponse instead of webclient

22024313
cifs	smb
or possibly depending on the version of cifs smb you re using

22024313

by using a configuration like the one above you can control what owner and group are assigned to the shared folder since logging into the vm and trying to use chgrp and chown does not work

22024339
width	height
i think you need to adjust the image width and height

22024399
background-position	background-size
use background-position -10px center to account for the 10px border and make the background-size 110

22024412

since i know the width and height of the crop as that s the width and height of the smaller image i really only need to know the crop origin

22024555
multiplying	add
if those doesn t yield a dispositive result one more multiplying and test will yield a final answer using in the worst case eight comparisons a shift and two multiplies if the rank of x and y is not known add another comparison to rank them

22024606
put	get
also you can override the list and retrieve methods on the viewset but i would prefer to use class based views since drf has a lot of additional functionalities attached to the request functions like get put etc. or list detail and it is better not to override them

22024631
hide	show
like so for visual reference -- grey hide tasks whose tags contains this tag blue show tasks whose tags contain this tag

22024729
hash	md5
if sha1 hash are out of question i think a pull request to add md5 hashing support would be a great idea

22024760
children	parent
any immediate children of those commits have to acquire new parent ids so those commits are also changed and those changes propagate down to the ultimate branch-tips

22024789
bower	npm
but even on a quite simple tests set i see significant delays related to the npm bower dependencies installation steps

22024795
width	height
for instance a span which is an inline element can span from the end of one line to the beginning of the other so it has no well defined width or height

22024818
teamcity	nant
i had a similar issue when using nant with teamcity as it will work fine running it from teamcity but if you do the build via command line it will fail because nant does not know what those teamcity variables are

22024847
hide	show
when you click to show the slider the click event propagates up to the body which hide the slider

22024899
width	height

22024931
debian	linux
i just installed tomcat apache 7.0.52 on my debian linux

22024943
innodb	myisam
your idea to use myisam and low priority is okay and will probably not have this problem but if you want to go with innodb would recommend an approach like the following

22025007
google-chrome	firefox
researching that error code i found that it apparently means either a required impersonation level was not provided or the provided impersonation level is invalid. i m guessing that there is something about the way firefox handles authentication that is different than the way internet explorer and google-chrome but i ve no idea yet how to fix that

22025095
post	get
i need to be able to get the user s selection at runtime because the options are obtained from a server using a post request

22025172
children	parent
since your parent element typically stays in the dom as its children change this doesn t happen

22025232
put	get
then you can get rid of the sub-loops i have shown above and just put it within the first loop

22025234
svg	vml
features gfx can render using svg vml canvas and even silverlight

22025234
nvd3.js	d3plus
gfx is used by dojo charting d3 is used by many including nvd3.js d3plus and vega to name a few

22025251
width	height
it is not enough to set height i need to set width as well

22025299
versioning	upgrade
i asked a similar question about adjusting column widths in the envionment pane on rstudio support because this has been bothering me since i upgrade to the new versioning too

22025311
serializable	deserialization
so whereas jsonvalue works fine for enums with respect to deserialization it does not yet work for serializable

22025445
width	height
the other main difference is that my way doesn t assume to know the width and height of the image - so it will work dynamically with any image

22025505
srp	principles
also your controller simply does to many things violates srp principles - it gets user input makes database queries and prepares model for view

22025510
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
this script is working fine in firefox but doesn t work as well in google-chrome or safari

22025510
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
again the below does work in firefox but only partially works in google-chrome and safari

22025525
put	get
i don t understand why i don t get the data or data1 because the doc says that i should get an object for each object i put in the array

22025550
versioning	upgrade
maybe you should upgrade to the latest psexec versioning

22025584
client-side	server-side
note i can only do things client-side i m just making a user script and i can t see the server-side code

22025675
width	height
the first two bytes are the width the second two are the height and then the rest of the file is the pixel data

22025675
width	height
printing width and height gives me the values i am expecting

22025675
width	height
playing around with this i noticed that if i just type in 640 480 instead of width height it works well i know that my dimensions should be 640 480

22025675
width	height
so it seems that passing the width and height as they are is causing the error because they are not integers but shorts

22025697
google-chrome	firefox
we also support firefox and ie and have no concrete evidence that any browser but google-chrome is throwing this error

22025726
int	chars
all c data is represented as binary so unsigned chars values are really just int

22025752
bridj	jnaerator
since you need c++ look then at bridj nativelibs4java and jnaerator

22025780
elasticsearch	kibana
i have 2 elasticsearch nodes in an aws ec2 environment and i d like to use logstash + kibana on a separate logging server

22025780
elasticsearch	kibana
the kibana config for .91 has elasticsearch which i know is not recommended but if i change it to the ip it does not load

22025780
elasticsearch	kibana
kibana config for .93 is elasticsearch

22025813
width	height
note the at the end -- but there is a simpler way which unpacks both width and height with one call to struct.unpack

22025833
slideup	slidedown
and it works fine the issue i have is that the slideup slidedown animation is simply growing the ul element back and forth

22025899

sqlhelper	sqlparameter
i have a sqlhelper class that includes an overloaded executenonquery one with just one parameter commandtext and another one with two parameters commandtext sqlparameter

22025955

22026161
versioning	upgrade
you must upgrade to the google play versioning of the mobile

22026206

22026292
for-loop	loops
else on a for-loop will only execute if you did not break out of loops

22026292
for-loop	loops
since you know the max number of times to run loops is 3 you can just use a for-loop instead of a while loops

22026327
vsto	add-in
a vsto task pane or add-in express form region could give you some alternatives

22026335

when we set the layout params of the edittext we are telling the parent layout rendering the edittext to set the specified height and width for the view

22027034
pop-up	dialog
as my prompt dialog pop-up it posts the form before waiting for my ui response

22027087
width	height
to prevent flicker when changing images the #1 thing you need to do is make sure that the browser is never in a state where it does not know the height and width of the image

22027087
width	height
your simplest fix is to probably just make sure that any image tag you supply has a height and width attribute on it that matches the image size and that whenever you replace that image tag it also has the same height and width as the one you are replacing

22027087
width	height
make sure your image tag has both a height and width attribute to ensure the browser knows exactly how much space to reserve for the image even before the browser has loaded that image

22027087
width	height
if the height and width attributes are specified this change in size does not happen

22027090

22027839
min	max
what i want to do is find the max and min in each pair

22027868
width	height
rather than use sizetofit look at using sizethatfits with a size that is constrained to the available width in the cell and with a large height the maximum reasonable height you expect

22027873
division	modulo
one way is to access parts of the integer by division and modulo

22027873
division	modulo
so by using division and modulo we can extract the first two numbers hours and second two numbers minutes separately

22027882
gruntjs	yeoman
maybe i m stating the obvious but yeoman does some magic work and helps you managing gruntjs and bower this magic only happens when you fully understand how this 2 work

22027882
gruntjs	yeoman
so i would recommend that first you dive into some code and fully understand how gruntjs and bower work and then you may use yeoman magic

22027882
gruntjs	yeoman
assemble static site generator for node.js gruntjs and yeoman

22027883

22028010
stdout	stderr
i also have a bash script as follows it s main purpose being to prefix stdout with success and stderr with error

22028010
stdout	stderr
as you can see the strings sent to stderr all appear before the strings sent to stdout

22028029
stdout	stderr
e.g. executing yields all the stdout messages before the stderr messages

22028042
int	double
declare your num_grades constant to be an int not a double

22028056
int	double
for the cannot convert from double to int error you can force a conversion by casting to int but this amounts to chopping off the decimal places from the double and you end up with an int that is basically rounded down if that makes sense

22028058
fastboot	adb
go to the adb install folder which for me was c program files x86 minimal adb and fastboot

22028058
fastboot	adb
open a text editor and copy in c program files x86 minimal adb and fastboot adb devices

22028073
int	double
error type mismatch cannot convert from double to int - you are initializing an array using double as the size which is not allowed change num_grades type to int

22028073
for-loop	arrays	int	double
error type mismatch cannot convert from double to int - you are using double to index an arrays in for-loop change it to int

22028104
hide	show
don t throw away the html just hide the container and show another

22028145
onresume	onpause
i guess it will stick to the lifecycle of your main activity hence handling onpause and onresume properly

22028168
folder	directory
because there you are comparing the length of the entire directory string not the number of folder in the directory

22028174
width	height
viewbox is on canvas and has just a few property canvas.left canvas.top height and width

22028174

22028249
equals	tostring
include a constructor the assessors and mutators and methods tostring and equals

22028259
folder	directory
therefore i ve tried to find out how to store images in a directory server folder and store references to the images in the database

22028270
stdout	stderr
vary their output buffering mode based on where stdout and stderr are redirected

22028270
stdout	stderr
main.out s stdout and stderr are fully buffered when you add the and redirections

22028306
ready	each
if you did do it this way what you would need is a semaphore this can be unlocked every time a packet is received and locked by each thread which starts a job to allow dynamically more threads in if more packets are ready that would have far less overhead then a homebrew solution with mutexes

22028314
int	chars
i have been working on a switch for int for the last hour and a half now i know how to do switch with chars but this seems much hard for me.any advice will be appreciated.the problem i have is that i cant accept grades over 100 which this switch currently does

22028334
multiplying	add
so for something like an alu design you may want all the operations add sub multiplying divide etc. to always happen and then select the desired output depending on the opcode

22028347
width	height
to also make it so they only fit into their bounding box by messing with overflow or width and height

22028415

width	height
i am positioning a number of images with the same width and height in a 2-column grid view

22028494
hide	show
oh and obviously it s only the current element you want to hide or show so you can call this.hide or this.show

22028522
postgresql	mysql
so what we did is to use a db view or a free-form query option sqoop that in turn uses a replace function or its equivalent that s available in the source db typically mysql but less often postgresql

22028522
hash	md5
in addition some of the other imported fields will no longer make sense - for instance imagine that you have a md5 or sha1 hash on a field but the field has been modified to replace some characters so we have to compute md5 or sha1 to be consistent instead of importing the one from the source db

22028522
int	chars
towards that end i add one more section to the above pig script that generates null and empty strings for chars type and null for int type

22028563
children	parent
as mentioned by backs parent node queries can perform badly so you can avoid it by cross applying from the parent to the children then you can refer to either part as needed

22028582
onresume	onpause
make sure you ve defined the onresume and onpause methods

22028598
freeglut	glew
i am using the most recent version of glew on their website though codeblocks and freeglut were downloaded back in october november

22028651
redhat	fedora
i maintain a cross-platform c codebase and on a few platforms xcode 4 redhat derived distros like fedora and mageia i get the following compiler error

22028753
min	max
i can set the color fine but the min and max attributes seem to have no effect

22028754
memcached	apc
you could try running memcached locally or using apc instead of memcached if you really only have 1 server

22028756
multiplying	transpose	multiplying	division
now i need to form new 2d arrays with previous like inverse transpose multiplying left division and maybe even more

22028765

22028768
mockito	jmock
i would suggest that you use a java mocking tool such as jmock or mockito which will save you some time by not letting you write the mockup tool yourself and instead writing good mockups

22028790
min	max
it could be a version issue but nothing i tried with options min max worked

22028815
getter	setter	accessor	properties
i thought it might be because using properties as shown with optionb would ensure that i get the accessor setter and getter but i see that optiona apparently has a setter

22028830
min	rank
if the matrix has rank min numofrows numofcolumns its said to be rank deficient and its impossible to compute inverse of such a matrix

22028894
getter	setter
firstly i use getter and setter methods

22028894
getter	setter
although i am still unsure why i need the getter and setter since it seems i could just directly use the input from the user this is what was asked for so i have included it

22028899

22029018
put	get
the get method does class casting in an unsafe way return type.cast container.get type but as long as it is assured that the container is modified only via put it can not fail

22029111
put	get
note that now you don t need to get the strings out of input that you just put into them because you have an array of myaddress instead of an array of strings

22029151
oncreate	setcontentview
the call to getactionbar throws a nullpointerexception because the activity s window has not been built yet - you should call getactionbar after setcontentview has been called in oncreate

22029516
floating-point	square-root
finally you only need to check up to the square root of testnumber but don t use a floating-point operation and then truncate the result or you might miss an exact square-root factor

right now the issue i face is that my images get fully stretched to the height and width i want but then my textview also get stretched and get off aligned and now sits on the top corner right beside the image

22029605
width	height
the code in jobjorn s answer and fiddl depends on cell width to calculate header height which leads to erroneous height when any cell is wide

width	height
under that area i want another div to fill the remaining space width and height all across the screen and to the bottom of the screen

22029636
onkeyup	onkeydown

google-chrome	firefox
this works fine on firefox but doesnt on google-chrome

22029782
setinterval	clearinterval
setinterval returns an id with that id you can use clearinterval to stop it

22029805
range	median
for example for normally distributed data you would expect about 4.55 to fall outside the range median â 2 x mad

22029825
put	get
unfortunately the stack queue combo has now put the items on the stack in the reverse order so you need to do another transfer but without swapping this time to get them back to the correct order

22029838
sudoers	passwd
and i added this line in sudoers file to prevent asking for passwd

22029848

hide	show
i m wondering if this is because hide is not in the dom initially because it s being added on the show method

22030124
width	height
by default in html if you specify either height or width but not both for an image the other attribute will be scaled automatically to keep the same aspect ratio

22030129
floating-point	integer
the second problem is that you re going to run into integer division - simply because all four of your values are going to be ints you won t get any floating-point values or a true average

22030132
floating-point	integer
i m creating a function that breaks up a 64-bit integer into its ieee 754 floating-point parts biased exponent significand etc.

22030154
inline	inlining
for gdb to support inline functions the compiler must record information about inlining in the debug information â gcc using the dwarf 2 format does this and several other compilers do also

22030230
versioning	upgrade
i was able to access xero using pyzero however there were a couple of gotchas the most significant being the need to upgrade the versioning of urllib3 that comes packaged as part of the requests library

22030245
syntastic	youcompleteme
if your using youcompleteme in addition to syntastic you need to change your .ycm_extra_conf.py file

22030305
postgresql	mysql
not sure is the .net version of opennlp will support doccat so you could also take a more basic machine learning approach using vectorization along with something like cosine similarity or you might just be able to index the descriptions and use something like lucene or solr or some database like mysql postgresql mssql oracle to return a rank.

22030309
google-chrome	firefox

22030410
nfa	dfa
showing me one of these ways to prove it creating a nfa dfa regular expression or regular grammar would be helpful

22030420
google-chrome	firefox
as a result most modern browsers google-chrome and also firefox i believe will try to fix your markup to be valid by moving the tag outside of the table

22030421
integer	unsigned
but then if you want to print as a binary you need to cast the number from floating point to unsigned integer - a bit shifting operation is not well defined for a floating point number

22030486
maven	pom.xml
i tried adding a pom.xml file but it doesn t seem like it has identified the file as a maven pom.xml file as the icon hasn t changed

22030492

22030525
plink	prompt
i then log into the slave using the above plink command and at the resulting bash prompt running the string that r displayed

22030579
int	double
if you opt for the second suggestion above you d probably be better off modeling your distance and velocities using double variables but just translate to int when displaying

22030645
submit	submission
the submit buttons default behaviour is still executed when it is clicked submission the page aka refreshing

22030650
children	parent
you d better put these common dependencies and build config in your parent pom so that all children can inherit from parent

22030656
onclick	onsubmit
you need to add return false in your showavailable function and update the onclick to onsubmit

22030667
factors	matrix
the reason you are having trouble with clustering is that kmeans expects a numeric matrix but you re providing the function a data frame with factors variables

22030676
pbkdf2	hash
you should use pbkdf2 as your hash - see this question on security.stackexchange.com

22030681
vagrantfile	hosts
it is a vagrant plugin and basically will edit your hosts for you all you do is your vagrantfile config and you are good to go after that

22030693
integer	fractions
level is an integer type so when you assign the floating point numbers to it the fractions parts are dropped

22030693
integer	fractions
the first line is all integer math so the dividing by 1000 discards any fractions parts

22030695
int	chars
chars variable and then i wanna change it to int or float

22030715
button	checkbox
do the same with other radio button so selectedtool always represents the currently checked checkbox

22030752
atoi	atof
the cstdlib stdlib.h header provides functions like atof and atoi which can do basic conversions make sure you convert any c++ strings to character arrays using mystring.c_str before passing them

22030752
int	chars
you can simply assign a chars to an int

22030752
int	chars
the chars is being cast to an int

22030763
width	height
setgeometry also works but you also end up referencing the width and height a lot

22030785
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i ve tried latest firefox google-chrome safari i m on osx

22030798
equals	compareto
as i see the other question and the answers i m wondering if java has some kind of interning automatically for example cashing some value upon initialization of the string or on the first call to compareto or equals to allow almost all calls to be o 1

22030802
for-loop	arrays
you can use a for-loop to check through the the arrays of object

opera	google-chrome
an interesting fact that i ve found is that google-chrome and opera chrommium will generate about one mousemove event per second even if the mouse doesn t move

22030839
quicksort	heapsort
heapsort is different from bubble sort and quicksort the best and worst cases wouldn t happen when the input elements are ordered in a descending ascending manner

22030879

i ve got a superclass called game that has a function pickplayers and an that contains the ones that are chosen and a subclassing consolegame that extends it

22031067
google-chrome	firefox
open same page on firefox again since page is cached for google-chrome this will identify as a change and it will cache again for firefox but in this case i want have cached page for firefox in step one instead of caching again

22031070
google-chrome	firefox
it works perfectly in firefox but not in google-chrome

22031070
google-chrome	firefox
try running the same code on google-chrome and firefox and you will notice the difference

22031109

your sprite will be rendered twice as big because the destination width and height are twice as large as the source

22031150
for-loop	loops
your for-loop is completing instantaneously well however long it takes to loops from 1 to 100 which is almost instantaneously

22031154
nsmanagedobject	uimanageddocument
performance is likely to come down to how the rest of your code is implemented and not necessarily the difference between a uimanageddocument or a nsmanagedobject

22031154
nsoperationqueue	uimanageddocument
if you re new to coredata or gcd and nsoperationqueue then you ll likely save a ton of developer time by leveraging uimanageddocument instead of rolling your own

22031163
width	height
i am scaling images to fit within a div and i want to center them with letterboxes by using positions but when i try to get the width of the element with .width immediately after setting the height .width returns 0

width	height
i ve been playing around with setting the x y width height on the boxes but i can t seem to get the calculation right

22031256
quad	shading
the final render pass then only renders a single quad on the whole screen on which it does the postprocessing and shading

22031263
nsmanagedobject	uimanageddocument
also whether you use a uimanageddocument or not you will be using nsmanagedobject instances

22031298
nsjsonserialization	nserror
also you should create an nserror reference to pass in instead of nil so nsjsonserialization can vend you an error object

22031324
java.util.date	simpledateformat
the java.util.date .calendar simpledateformat classes bundled with java are notoriously troublesome

22031324
java.util.date	zoneddatetime
note one big difference while java.util.date objects have no time zone effectively utc gmt in both joda-time datetime and java.time zoneddatetime the date-time object knows its own assigned time zone and offset

22031382
google-chrome	firefox
both google-chrome and firefox now have built-in emulators

22031382
google-chrome	firefox
the best part is if you like the browser s developer tools google-chrome firefox you can use them while emulating

22031387
width	height
the height and width of the pattern will be the height and width of the plotting area

22031387

22031668
filtering	grouping
groupby a filtering declaring how to grouping rows formatted as an sql grouping by clause excluding the grouping by itself

22031668
filtering	grouping
having a filtering declare which row grouping to include in the cursor if row grouping is being used formatted as an sql having clause excluding the having itself

22031678
screens	mdpi
because if you just replaced the drawable-hdi images but not the drawable-mdpi ones than if the emulator or device has a mdpi screens it will load the mdpi images from the drawable-mdpi folder thus showing the older images

22031744
google-chrome	firefox
what this means is that for the first time when a page is cached for google-chrome it doesn t destroys the cached version of firefox or any other browsers if they exists

22031744
google-chrome	firefox
so when users make requests from google-chrome a separate cached copy is created for google-chrome browser only if it doesn t exists already and the cached version for firefox will still be there

22031757
ubuntu	debian
try installing libpq-dev for debian ubuntu or postgresql-devel for rhel systems

i wan t to make my pi have a 100 uptime in the way that if it crashes it will reboot automatically and fix it s errors

22031943
abstract-class	superclass	superclass	subclassing
when you make a subclassing of a class when do you want to make the superclass abstract because by my knowledge a superclass can do anything that a abstract-class can

22031943
abstract-class	superclass	superclass	subclassing
for example you want to use abstract-class in such a case that each of the subclassing is a more specific type of its abstract superclass fruit apple orange banana grape strawberries etc. and you want to use non-abstract superclass in a relationship such as dad and son

22031967

22032310
viewdidload	viewdidappear
also try commenting out each viewdidload and viewdidappear contents and see where the issue is being caused

22032328
nsurlconnection	nsurlsession
this is much easier with the block based completion handlers available in the ios 7 flavored nsurlsession and only slightly harder with nsurlconnection which listens for responses on the main thread but can be thrown into the background once you catch the response

22032376
google-chrome	firefox
unfortunately because this is a rounding issue it s not possible to work around this using pure css unless through inconceivably elaborate hackery and very difficult to do so using a script as browsers tend to be inconsistent when reporting decimal fractional offset values as well in particular firefox ie and google-chrome all report wildly different values for offsettop of your table-cell and its next sibling

22032399

22032486
min	max
this way the max and min numbers should not be the same

22032513
multiplying	division
if you need the actual values for calculation of other physical data then i would suggest normalizing the value as the datasheet suggests however i think i would multiplying by 1.0 16 or divide by 16.0 because this will implicitly cast your values to a floating point type and avoid the loss of information that is inevitable if you use pure integer division

22032588
goto	break
break is really only a restricted form of goto anyway

rtp	rtcp
the more viewers the more of the total internet bandwidth is spent on those rtcp reports to the point that you could run out of bandwidth for the rtp audio video data itself

22051356
for-loop	arrays
iterate over the shorter arrays in for-loop body and use index to access the longer arrays - of course this is not ideal as you won t be using all elements of the longer arrays

google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
it works great in ie 10 and firefox and google-chrome and avant and opera

22052527
implements	extends
i wouldn t recommend inheritance creating a single class common code is really good for reusability however take on count that each class extends from your base class will be allocating duplicated memory for things with the same purpose google do not recommend it unless really necessary and the advantages you are getting out of it are really clear you should take a look at the singleton design patterns this seems like a good example of when to implements it basically you will have 1 single instance that does the job among different components without having to allocate new objects every time just reusing the one already created

22052570
for-loop	loops
however in trying to index into each of the cells with a for-loop to loops through the states and then loops through the sets of data i run into exceed index issues since some of the third dimensions are small while others are larger

it works fine in ie and firefox but for some reason when it s loaded in google-chrome the elements don t line up when the page is refreshed it corrects itself

22052991
int	chars
here are a few tips how to detect what the user wants if the string length is 1 and it isn t a digit 0 - 9 then you could treat it as a chars and you could use the first chars of the string as an int or you could exit your loop in some other cases - for example if it is a chars otherwise you could treat it as the string representation of an int and you could actually convert it to an int with the std stoi standard library function

22052993

superclass	subclassing
within the subclassing the field in the superclass cannot be referenced by its simple name

22053582
int	chars
if the string can contain any chars codes all 65 536 unicode chars then you are best off using a hash table of int counts indexed keyed by chars codes

22053582
int	chars
on the other hand if you know that the string will only contain a fairly small subset of chars say the iso 8859-1 latin-1 codes from u0000 to u00ff then you can use a small int array to hold the counters

22053623
httprequest	httpresponse
i ve learnt i cannot send to isolates and back following objects httprequest and httpresponse objects i cannot send streams

22053667

i have some icons that i want to show for some elements but hide for others

22053675
opera	google-chrome

ubuntu	linux
i used ubuntu linux

22053792
put	get	post	get	post	put

the show hide functions simply do just that

22054501
hide	show
they show or hide an element by setting their visibility to hidden and their display to none

22054516
width	margin
also notice that the computed dimensions of an element are the sum of width margin border and padding

give the current height and width to the treemap layout and recalculate the treemap every time the height and width change

22062644
width	height
calculate the treemap layout with the default size the maximum height and width will be 1 everything else a proportion thereof and use the current height and width as a scaling factor when you draw the rectangles

22062644
width	height
then when the height or width changes you only need to redraw not recalculate the layout

22062644

you can just grab the current height and width from within your redraw function which will of course have access to the svg node and the layout component doesn t need to know anything about the dimensions

technically ralpha - our unknown - depends on angle alpha only but since the dependence is non linear we can use a linear multiplication by a matrix with 2 entries s sin alpha and c cos alpha alpha - angle for rotation around x axis

22062805
bmp	png
for example if you get the type as type_int_argb from your bufferedimage object which represents a png with a alpha component you wont have success using imageio.write bi bmp new file d test.bmp and the method would return false even though you can see bmp bmp in the list of entries obtained using imageio.getwriterformatnames

22063036
width	margin
each table has a width of 40 i ve already tried changing the left and right margin to auto using css but with no success

22063069

i m not a python expert but it appears as if the interpreter mutates height from an arrays or dict to a normal variable after the first iteration of the for-loop

22063197
width	margin
in order to align the items horizontally you could set a proper width on .pricing-table then use margin 0 auto

22063197
width	margin
you have to include the margin of elements for calculating the width of the .pricing-table element

22063197
width	text-align
however to get rid of specifying an explicit width for .pricing-table you could change the display type of the ul elements to inline-block and align the inline elements by using text-align center

when you use a child selector it will search only the direct children of the target parent in your case the input element is coming at the 3rd level means it is an descendant element not a child

22063341

it won t be opened during second and any further attempt in firefox and google-chrome

22074071
textview	imageview
i have a relativelayout activity type where are 3 textview 3 buttons and a imageview

22074103
width	height
setting an explicit height and width tag on the images in the slider fixed this issue for me with sliders containing 2-5 images

22074112
mongodb	bson
also a cast to the basicdbobject class may be necessary if you want to have a mongodb specific bson object

22074117
versioning	upgrade
i am currently using 3.0.5 and would like to know if i should upgrade to a newer versioning

22074117
versioning	upgrade
unfortunately there is not a single word on the website about what is different between versioning and whether it is recommended to upgrade and if upgrade to what versioning

22074130
uilabel	nsstring
to get the uilabel displaying properly i first passed the description property of the exhibitordetailmodal object to an nsstring

22074130
uilabel	nsstring
then set the text of the uilabel to be that of the nsstring above

22074130
uiview	subviews
then added the uilabel as a subviews of uiview

22074133
google-chrome	firefox
i couldn t get it to work in current versions of ie google-chrome or firefox

22074149
int	chars
you could convert the int to a chars

22074187
uiview	calayer
to make view layer gradient by default this method return calayer that not have colors property see uiview class reference

22074198
google-chrome	firefox
you could implement a google-chrome or firefox extension or a standalone application that saves all the required data into a cache and then -- when loading the saved version -- forces it to pull from the cache or uses a faked xmlhttprequest object to prevent querying the remote server

22074198
google-chrome	firefox
the way i would handle this is to take an existing customizable renderer eg google-chrome firefox and implement an extension as described above

22074202
range	min
another formula approach would be to use small rather than min - small will return an error if there are no dates in the range rather than zero so you can clean the error up with iferror

22074244
textview	imageview
create a list item layout which contains buttons imageview and textview and use it in custom adapter

22074251
melt	reshape
you can use melt from the reshape2 package to reshape the data this

22074261
google-chrome	firefox
all i care is for the solution to work on google-chrome and nice to have on firefox

22074276
portrait	landscape	screens	tablet
now i have to make the tablet ui and i d like to show both views on one screens i ve already managed to show them but the tablet in landscape mode is picking up the fragments from layout-land instead of the portrait layout and i need it to pick the portrait ones to show side by side

22074289
super	implements
however implements -theprotocolmethod in the category would replace the super class implementation so you have to be careful here

22074314
folder	directory
now i have such a situation in directory structure this is only for one user but there are many other users folder in users catalog

22074350
onresume	onpause
if you have one activity managing multiple fragments the onpause and onresume of that activity will handle registering and unregistering that receiver nicely without the complication of child activities

22074363
put	get
put in a timeout in case character s get lost

22074389
hk2	guice
context driven frameworks like guice hk2 or cdi tend to use proxies when they inject services whose lifecycles differ from the lifecycle of the service they are being injected into

22074400
fiddlercore	wininet
if you don t want to add a reference to fiddlercore you can disassemble the dll and it shows the correct way to call all of these horribly documented wininet functions but i think posting it here would be a disservice to telerik plagarism

22074412
erlang	elixir
i m very interested in the syntax and such of elixir but being built on erlang i m not sure if it would hurt to jump straight into it

22074414
width	height
if you know the width and height of your table

22074414
width	height
but if you don t know the width and height of your table

22074447
int	double
in other words you can call the same method with an array of string s int s double s and any of your own classes that implement interface

22074465
int	chars
e audioflinger 54 int android load_audio_interface const chars

22074468
zoo	xts
try the xts package which works together with zoo

22074482
keystore	jks
firstly you generally don t need to convert your pkcs#12 .p12 file into a jks store you can use the pkcs12 keystore type directly

22074497
implements	extends
if this were a regular class the answer is simple implements tostring then have all my classes that need that implementation extends that class but enums can t extends anything not even another enum

22074523
loops	if-statement
i just need to figure out what my if-statement should be for outputting the following at the end of my input tag in the correct loops

22074548
button	checkbox
it validate s elements except checkbox radio button on blur

22074561
int	double
it doesn t know whether 5 is an int or an int or even a double

22074581
put	get
using script class mediator i can get it from system properties and put it in message context

22074598
fiddlercore	wininet
if you don t want to add a reference to fiddlercore you can disassemble the dll and it shows the correct way to call all of these horribly documented wininet functions but i think posting it here would be a disservice to telerik plagarism

22074619
fiddlercore	wininet
if you don t want to add a reference to fiddlercore you can disassemble the dll and it shows the correct way to call all of these horribly documented wininet functions but i think posting it here would be a disservice to telerik plagarism

22074667
integer	unsigned
one promoted type is a signed integer type the other promoted type is the corresponding unsigned integer type and the value is

22074694
hide	show
note that this will also mean that clicking the i-icon element whilst the bubble is show will not hide the element as it will not trigger the body s click event

22074763
debian	linux
linux lin45 3.2.0-4-amd64 #1 smp debian 3.2.54-2 x86_64 gnu linux

22074791
put	get
i also tried this to put the login call on a different thread so it does not get locked

22074828
pop-up	dialog
i am required to update an existing pop-up dialog box so that for those users who require a screen reader it will be interpreted and understood correctly

22074860
lodash	underscore.js
you can use something like throttle in underscore.js lodash if you have have methods with the potential to run many times

22074894
width	height
a margin-top would allow the width to be responsive but would assume static height on the left which is i m assuming also not a good solution since the fact that you put text in the left column implies you want a dynamic height

22074902
width	height
this sets the a element to display block and gives it the same height and width of the parent td with the image as its background

22074915
for-loop	loops
in any case the solution with collapse table and strsplit is both more concise and computationally efficient than a for-loop or a pair of nested for loops which is what you would need

22074938
wildfly	jboss
i tried with jboss 5 jboss 7 and wildfly 8

22074938
jboss	glassfish
edit i created a github project showing code that works with glassfish 4.0 and does not work with jboss 5

22074938
jboss	glassfish
running the code which i tried on jboss 5 on glassfish 4.0 gives

22074953
width	height
because the percentage value for width and height is related to containing block dimensions and the anchor tag the container doesn t have any explicit width height

22074953
width	height
you d need to display the anchor tag as block then apply then set its width height to 100 as well

22074955
boost	stl
it involves replacing a deprecated library with the stl and boost whilst keeping the interface as similar as humanly possible

22074959
fragmentpageradapter	fragmenttransaction
this guy here fragmenttransaction in 1 tab of a fragmentpageradapter has had the same problem but it wasn t satisfyingly answered so i thought i can make a valid question here

22074963
put	get
but knowing that you probably need to get these two pieces separately at some point i would put a separator-character in the middle so that you can explode the string out

22074970
lapply	strsplit
here i ll use the lapply function to transform the 1-row data frames using strsplit to break up the variable v3 into its appropriate parts

22074983
versioning	upgrade
before having this nasty mixup between dll frameworks versioning i d follow upgrade guidelines taking into account that some of the code i implemented with the previous versioning might not work properly with the new one

22075033
submit	submission
to manage this i override the submit functionality and run the below code that uses ajax and the sharepoint rest api to handle inserts and updates on the child list before submission the form

22075045
post	get
but when i try change the query to display that post i get this and exactly this for oscar page

22075047
namenode	hdfs
similar to the design decision of not assigning too much work for namenode in hdfs

22075058
division	logarithm
the only method i know involves logarithm and division and i really don t want to use logarithm or division in an embedded system

22075104
oncreate	findviewbyid
in oncreate you find the listview using findviewbyid r.id.xxx and you create a new arrayadapter and set it for that listview

22075177
width	height
i have picture s such as 33 120 height width

22075177
width	height
i would like to adjust imageview size to 10 height and width should keep the same ratio as original image size

22075220
post	get
as the viewmodel is passed in the get request the fruitid on the viewmodel is null and it only actually gets set in the post

22075261
google-chrome	firefox
now the problem i am having is that the result of all of this is that both in google-chrome and in firefox the history is updated in a way that is mostly correct the url in the history s state object is correct as is this the content

22075265
google-chrome	firefox
i m not seeing this in firefox or google-chrome though

22075274
sorting	filtering
if after actions sorting scrolling filtering window resize etc. you might need to trap these via events and call fnadjustcolumnsizing to correct the header row

22075281
width	height
similarly for north and south but height instead of width

22075284
packets	multicast
a third possibility would be to send out some form of discovery packets either by broadcast or better by multicast udp

22075307
put	get
always get put behind the top row in the repeater

22075311
postgresql	greenplum
i am getting this error when i call this function in postgresql greenplum

22075317
post	get
i insert a test post with mongo console and can retrieve it with mongo console but in the browser i get

22075320
put	get
but as far as i can tell the positioning gets updated from jquery ui after the code i put in the drag function so it is overriding my css i can t even get the thing to change background colour

22075327
for-loop	loops
you can enclose the while loops in a block or use a for-loop instead

22075337
rspec	capybara
yep you can definitely use capybara poltergeist without cucumber or rspec

22075343
cout	cin
that way you don t have to write std cout or std cin etc

22075395
google-chrome	firefox
it looks like there is a way to do this in google-chrome and firefox but i m not finding any information about how to do this in internet explorer which needs this more than all as it s a constant problem child for us

22075418
stdout	stderr
so far i am using this code which works reliably and returns stdout stderr and returncode once the process finishes

22075418
stdout	stderr
my problem is that i would like to display some kind of progress-bar such as a simple line counter or display stdout and stderr to the user while the process is still running

22075422
debian	linux
i m running linux debian 6 64-bit gcc 4.4

22075501
width	height
height width and raw

22075563
integer	unsigned
the standard library function ntohl changes the byte order of an unsigned integer l from network byte order n to host byte order h

22075566
umask	chmod
but you can try to set 777 or 775 permission to the folder you wish to upload to either with your ftp software ssh or within php with chmod or umask search them on php docs to see how to use

22075610
gridbaglayout	boxlayout
consider using a different layoutmanager such as boxlayout or gridbaglayout

22075626
width	height
you only specify either width or height to retain the aspect ratio

22075637
gson	jackson
anyway so far i ve tried gson and jackson to get the object from json but no joy

22075637
gson	jackson
i m not precious about which library i use gson jackson etc

22075658
google-chrome	firefox
i am trying to run programs like google-chrome firefox minecraft and other programs off my usb and store application data for it on my usb in the folder data

22075683
width	height
you create a new jpanel with dimension based on the height and width from the previous two points

22075726
int	chars
if i make a sizeof x and a sizeof y i get 4 and 1 the size of types int and chars

22075804
treemap	treeset
you can do it faster than o n log n but that will require for you to merge the arrays add them all together into a treeset or a treemap with dummy values

22075804
treemap	treeset
then extracting the element will have complexity o 1 - this is only if you use a treeset or treemap or similar data structure

22075815
uitableview	reloaddata
you make changes to your uitableview data source within the beginupdates endupdates block so that you don t have to call reloaddata

22075829
folder	directory
when you write images it means images folder is coming from the root directory of the website

22075830
mouseover	mouseout
the problem is that the mouseover range seems too precise and there is no timeout on mouseout

22075864
dictionary	map
i m new to scala so was wondering if anyone can help me with a function that would take an arbitrary list of labels a delimted text string and return something like a map or dictionary

22075894
scrollable	panels
my question here use a4j edit so that contents of the row in scrollable table is rerendered as read only text in the next panels for respective fields

22075910
min	max
edit i understand that most people expect max and min of an array to be an element of the array but this is because max min of two elements is always one of them

22075910
min	max
on the other hand if one regards max min just as commutative binary operations returning the identity element makes more sense

22075929
google-chrome	firefox
i also tried in google-chrome and firefox non of them works..

22075939
int	chars
unfortunately this won t handle the chars case directly but you could first convert to an int then check the range manually

22075961
put	get
essentially you need to implement the sftpprogressmonitor interface in a class and then pass that as a parameter to your channelsftp put or get call

22075961
put	get
this interface has 3 methods which the put and get methods will call during the course of the file being transferred to allow you to implement a progress bar

22075980
mouseup	mousedown
1- create your regular mousedown and mouseup event listeners

22076036
min	max
i agree that for product or sum it makes more sense to return the respective identity but not max min

22076036
min	max
i also prefer the property that max min s be an element of s

22076037
hide	show
and then when i view my websites source even though right now it is after 9 am which i ve set the time to in php just so i could test if it hide we actually close at 6 it show up in the header as

22076053
versioning	upgrade
you ll need to upgrade the versioning of your embed plugin

22076088
fiddler	charles
you might also want to use a debugging proxy like charles or fiddler to figure out what your .net framework is actually sending to the server

22076129
int	chars
perhaps the compiler decided to place the int in an area of memory with other types of the same alignment and stuck the chars among some strings which do not need to be aligned

22076131
folder	directory
this will be different if you use a local install of full iis since it creates a virtual directory that runs your dlls directly from the bin folder

22076148
button	checkbox
so i m trying to create a series of radio button and checkbox that are displayed as follows

22076172
for-loop	arrays
instead of doing a for-loop just count how many words are there and display the length of the arrays

22076185
free	memset
yet i can declare symbols like memset free etc

22076218
width	height
area is a property of a rectangle but it is derived from the width and height and setting it doesn t really make any sense

22076236
division	multiplication
here s a post that might help explain some more java precision during division and multiplication alterneting process

22076237
grouplayout	cardlayout
in order to fix your problem you need a different layout manager like grouplayout or cardlayout

22076242
portrait	landscape	screens	tablet
i m developing an app and i need that the screens is in portrait for smartphones and portrait landscape for tablet

22076305
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
see uinavigationcontroller can see it is a subclass of uiviewcontroller then that is in him there are listed in the above the rotation of the processing method

22076307
hide	show
to show and to hide it use the functions

22076311
hide	show
i want to add an image with an expand collapse option and initially when the report is show hide the table and when the image is clicked show and continue to toggle everytime it is clicked

22076320
shadowing	named
shadowing warnings are targeted at situations when 1 the named hiding occurs one named is hidden by another named declared later or in a more local scope 2 the code is still well-formed

22076357
folder	directory
click on the folder settings in the ribbon of the home directory or directory user is trying to reach

22076396
children	parent
i am trying to use a select tag to save multiple nested children in a parent

22076402
public	protected
a public getter function is conceptually different from a protected function that lets code with knowledge of internals modify the object s internal state

22076414
width	height
totally i used 150 images from drawable folder.all images are png format with width and height is nearly each one 240 into 210 like that

22076435
range	max	range	min	min	max
hence it s independent of range min and max

22076458
for-loop	arrays
you could create the int arrays in the for-loop

22076470
rtp	sip
you can google sip xmpp and rtp

22076535
folder	directory
unfortunately this also keeps the project folder inside of the plugin sdk directory

22076553
ubuntu	centos
i searched all over stackoverflow and only saw solutions for ubuntu which did not transfer over to centos

22076598
accessor	properties
resources mdn on properties accessor

22076611
spaces	delimiter
if all of your fields are delimiter by multiple spaces none of the fields can contain two or more spaces in a row i would recommend using split instead of a regex

22076637
short	base
it is exactly the same as providing private class to implement public interface - whoever uses that object outside will not be able short of reflection to obtain details that are not exposed via public interface base class

22076641
super	self
because super required the superclass name dog and the instance self

22076641
super	self
because super was given extra behavior that allows it to figure out dog and self for you

22076643
cpu	processors
but when i deploy the application on an ubuntu machine cpu load is spiking around 70 per core altough it is a dual core atom processors so let s say this is normal and memory usage increases continually while finally killing the jvm and the device itself under like 1 5-2 hours

22076657
hash	salt
in database in table users i d store username hash password and salt

22076669
django	web2py
the two main python web frameworks are django and web2py

22076672
jtextfield	jtextpane
like i said before i m making a cmd copy where user enters a command in a jtextfield and output comes onto a jscrollpane jtextpane

22076693
textview	imageview
you are adding your textview first and then you are adding imageview

22076693
textview	imageview	width	height
both these are set to match parents width and height but since you are adding imageview later its z-index is greater than that of textview

22076704
zoo	xts
i have added the highfrequency package along with zoo package and xts package

22076715
subtract	add
shift and add subtract sequence was slower than the lea method above

22076716
hide	show
you can configure the tooltip directive from angular ui to show hide based on custom events

22076730
children	parent
have all of the children which in this case with the way your data is stored also includes what you refer to as level 1 relate to a parent

22076774
post	put
in other words how do i use ember-data to send a put or post request preferably put with all the models where isselected is true

22076785
erlang	elixir
i don t think learning erlang would be directly useful for learning elixir

22076785
erlang	elixir
learning what an atom looks like in erlang isn t going to affect how you learn about atoms in elixir for example

22076785
erlang	elixir
now there s no inherent reason that you can t learn otp within the confines of elixir but erlang s had years to accumulate documentation tutorials books etc on the whole erlang ecosystem which is available to elixir

22076785
erlang	elixir
if you know both erlang and elixir it d be a lot easier to apply what you ve learned from the book to elixir

22076785
erlang	elixir
these are useable by elixir but the documentation is very likely going to assume you re using erlang so again knowing erlang will help you apply what you learn to elixir

22076785
erlang	elixir
i think you are wrong in your 1st paragraph as everything you would learn in erlang is directly applicable to elixir

22076785
erlang	elixir
so an elixir atom and an erlang atom are the same and are used in exactly the same way even if the syntax is slightly different

22076818
udp	tcp
if you want to create services that can use fast transport channels when available such as tcp named pipes or maybe even udp in wcf

22076840
google-chrome	firefox
animation works very fluid in google-chrome but when i test it in firefox it becomes choppy after 1 time and consumes a lot of cpu power

22076863
nsstring	nsdata
if i convert the nsdata to an nsstring then it does work but it just pastes the string into the body of the email

22076863
nsurl	nsdata
i ve used the debugger to verify that the nsdata object has the correct data and that the nsurl object has the right file path

22076868
int	boolean
a boolean is a subclass of int and

22076868
ssl	https
thus if the request was secure used ssl encryption over https the protocol will be set to https too

22076881
int	boolean
note the boolean constants true and false resolve to the int 1 and 0 respectively because bool is a sub-class of int

22076886
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
the issue is that in ie google-chrome safari my padding for search_refinement_filters is looking fine but in firefox they are being pushed about 350 px to the right

prepare	execute
you need a prepare statement to prepare and execute such statements

22077048
post	get
i assume app.init does not get fired without a post back

22077095
gtk	gio
beyond making this a lot easier it will also allow you to integrate with other main loop based code such as gtk the asynchronous functions in gio and other libraries

22077130
post	get
i m not trying to sort the other two arrays but i want the elements to continue to match post sorting rather than get mixed up

22077198
arraylist	treeset
you re right you can use arraylist instead of treeset since it won t remove items that are duplicates according to the comparator that you pass it

22077247
jboss	glassfish
i can forget about producers and simply inject the local bean cdiproducer as on jboss as7 but not on glassfish

22077249
express	node.js
i ve started a new project with node.js + express on unbuntu ec2 at amazon

22077252
hash	salt
phpseclib uses pss by default for signature verification and uses a salt length of -1 by default as well well it uses a salt length equal to the hash length which is what the -1 means i think

22077313
width	height
width 276px height 45px

saas	iaas
usually cloud hosting companies provide different levels of services namely infrastructure as a service iaas platform as a service paas and software as a service saas

22077401
for-loop	loops
instead you can just loops through each of the characters in the string with a for-loop

22077403
width	height
you can use css3 s calc function to set the second div s height and width to be the same as the first one s minus the left and top offsets

22077404
width	height
i have a form wich i want to customize because the default input textearea width and height are not enought

22077415
console.readline	console.writeline
the issue i am having and cannot seem to figure out is once infilepath is updated from console.readline it only will show up in the console.writeline statement that concatenates it

22077424
width	height
you can use the java math package s trig functions to get the angle from the triangle s center and the destination point and use that to calculate the three points of the triangle based on the desired width and height

22077428
width	height
i made a small example for you with hard coded width and height for the writableimage maybe this will help you
