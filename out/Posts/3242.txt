comparator	comparable
the simpler way is to implement comparable with your existing objects although you could instead create a comparator and pass it to the sortedmap

1440035
comparator	comparable
note that comparable and comparator are two different things

1440035
comparator	comparable
a class implementing comparable compares this to another object while a class implementing comparator compares two other objects

1440036
comparator	comparable
you can either implement comparable directly on your class or pass a separate comparator to the constructor

1440038
treemap	treeset
edit2 if you only have a bunch of objects that you re throwing into the collection and it s not a map it s not a mapping from one set of objects to another then you want a treeset not a treemap

1440063
post	get
since flash has all the capabilities of a web browser page requests get post and even some goodies cross domain page requests sockets i m assuming this shouldn t be too hard

1440128
stdout	stderr
it s worth noting that any applications which use stdout stderr should get those records written both to the piped stdout strerr streams as well as to the log4j log files

1440134
comparator	comparable
i have seen classes which implement both comparable and comparator

1440156
comparator	comparable
the text below comes from comparator vs comparable

vsto	add-in
try it out with vba and build a stand-alone add-in with vsto or whatever if the prototype works

1440251
vsto	add-in
this effectively does what you are looking for - you just need to change it to work with an existing message and if you don t want to depend on redemption port it to vsto vba com add-in whatever

1440454
hide	show
for example if you need to just hide show a couple controls i d include controls into the view that would be empty in some cases and contain data in others

1440454
hide	show
if it s more than a couple controls are show hidden at once and your framework supports a concept of panels reusable parts of the view i d separate that group of controls into a panel and show hide that panel depending on the conditional

tinyint	boolean
if all you are storing in the db are boolean values then i think a tinyint would be overkill

1440504
unsigned	short
unsigned short

1440506
ienumerable	ilist
i ran into the same problem except i had ilist in place of the ienumerable above.

1440506
ienumerable	iqueryable
turns out that subsonic returns an iqueryable so that s why you have to use the ienumerable in the view

1440545
unsigned	short	integer	unsigned
a unsigned short in c++ is usually a 16-bit unsigned integer uint16 or ushort in c#

1440556
unsigned	short
ushort assuming unsigned short produced by your c compiler is 16 bits

1440558
int	chars
remember in c++ chars is actually a pointer to memory usually represented by a 4 byte int

1440559
getter	setter
on the other hand if you would see a getter setter method call there then you would know right away that it is not a public variable access and that there is a function handling the call and it can even return error code or exception if so chosen

1440592
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
if you have the data in an arrays for you can replace the while loops with a for-loop

what i would do is create a base class with a protected version the properties then create two classes that inherited the base class that have the readonly and the non-readonly bits

1440956
hide	show
this is quite a bit of work in the first place but it gives you the possibility to dynamically return a property name and description helpful for localization dynamically mark properties as read-only dynamiclly show and hide properties and do a lot of other usefull things

libcurl	typhoeus
i m currently building a client which will communicate with my rails app through json using paul dix s typhoeus gem which uses libcurl

filtering	grouping
i have tried various ways of filtering the data to eliminate false-positives and have been using neural networks to a limited degree of success to grouping cracks together

1441322
stdout	stderr
my guess is that stdin stdout and stderr are pretty much connected to dev tty anyway unless redirected

1441322
stdout	stderr
and since the most common redirections for for stdin and or stdout via piping or but less often for stderr odds on are that using stderr would be most likely to still be connect to the keyboard

1441330
cpython	ironpython
my understanding was it was written in vanilla python cpython but if you are more comfortable with ironpython it shouldn t be hard to translate

versioning	upgrade
if the conversion tool is actually broken i ve had mixed success using it in the past with the success rate being inversely proportional to the overall complexity of the project then one reason to include it anyway is to convince developers to start new projects using the latest versioning of visual studio and not to start them with an older versioning and hope that the upgrade process will be seamless

i m reasonably familiar with c++ although haven t touched it since the nineties work on a daily basis and 100 confident with c# would consider myself advanced to expert with java and have developed a reasonable amount of stuff in lisp and prolog back in the day

1443744
int	chars	int	boolean
i would say i m pretty new to this but could someone explain the basics about data types more specifically int chars boolean string and floating-point numbers

1443746
int	double
the int literal 0 is converted to a double with a widening primitive conversion see 5.1.2 widening primitive conversion in the java language specification

1443761
int	boolean
one downside is that you can define only boolean floats strings or int no complex data structures

1443800
codeigniter	kohana
codeigniter or it s successor kohana

1443846
ilist	iqueryable
i am not so great with iqueryable ienumarable ilist etc

1443863
wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe
i had no problems consuming this service with .net both svcutil.exe and wsdl.exe work fine regardless of serializer used but looks like i m totally missing something obvious about serialization in java

1443866
profiler	yourkit
for analyzing heap memory you could use a profiler like yourkit and see whether the heap limit -xmx is obeyed or not

1443892
public	protected
changing the private to protected or internal or public depends on what you need should help

1443894
put	get
i think this approach worked well for me because the mac os is the bigger picture and the iphone is a subset - it helped me get context on how things had been put together

1443925
getter	setter
and then override it in class b but throw an exception in getter and setter

1443942
post	get
whether you have a get or post depends on your scenario - in a get you won t have request data going out

1443954
width	height
first you have to make sure the silverlight control in your html page has a width and height of 100

1443954
width	height
remove the default width and height from the control header part where the xmlns are defined

1444016
put	get
so you need to get the image data with getimagedata and put it back with putimagedata

1444018
libxml2	libxslt
nokogiri wraps libxml2 and libxslt with a clean rubyish api that supports namespaces xpath and css3 queries

1444027
isnull	nvl
i think you are looking for left outer join and isnull nvl functions but without knowing the dialect of sql and the tables cannot be exact

1444028
switching	screens
the application requires a lot of switching between the various screens and is also graphic intensive

1444041
min	max
if you really want one either you put other constraints or use max or min

1444041
min	max
if you want just a value for text you can use max or min

1444060
inline	inlining
the compiler can inline whatever it wants in case inlining doesn t violate the code semantics and it can reach the function code

1444162
width	height
when an html element has the height and width set to zero jquery does not find the object when using a selector and specifying visible although the object is visible

1444162
width	height
the above will ignore children of #test where the width and height is zero

1444163
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
i have used svn git and bazaar quite extensively on various different projects

1444177
yourkit	jprofiler
i also looked into yourkit and jprofiler

1444213
jdom	dom4j
i prefer dom4j personally but i don t mind other apis such as jdom or even xpp3 which has xpath support

1444224
silverstripe	kohana
i got the following error warning while tring to install kohana silverstripe

1444260
post	get
the data was retrieved when using get method but it is not when im using post method

1444298
integer	unsigned
this is less hackish since it operates on an unsigned 64-bit integer first and then extract the bytes

1444341
nullreferenceexception	argumentnullexception
in .net i would throw an argumentnullexception rather than a nullreferenceexception

1444368
wordpress	joomla
using wordpress or joomla or any other framework will require enormous emounts of custimization of the framework to meet your ends

1444379
pop-up	dialog
secondly you can use jquery to unobtrusively insert a javascript print this page link which will pop-up the browser s print dialog on the user s screen when activated

1444456
uptime	reboot
so no internet time no user time setup in settings and no bsd uptime time since last reboot

1444495
asp.net-mvc	html.actionlink
i m building an asp.net asp.net-mvc application using vb.net and i m trying to apply a css class to a html.actionlink using the code

1444499
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
it s free very very easy to set up and use doesn t require a server because it can just access the local filesystem and you can find loads and loads of documentation and help if you get stuck because i think there are far more people who use svn than bazaar or git for example..

1444505
put	get
what would be nice is if i could put it in the deploy directory of the jboss server and could somehow get a reference to it

1444528
min	max
so i have this function used to calculate statistics min max std mean

1444549
illegalargumentexception	runtimeexception	nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception	nullpointerexception	runtimeexception
if you write your own exception you can force it to be caught whereas both nullpointerexception and illegalargumentexception are runtimeexception which are frowned on in some circles

1444549
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
as others have said illegalargumentexception is an option but i think nullpointerexception is more communicative

1444566
hide	show
now i managed only to show hide the control

1444567
min	max
you should calculate the sum of values min max and count in the first loop

1444612
for-loop	loops
if your matrix is stored as a vector of vectors then in the outer for-loop you should directly retrieve the i-th vector and then operate on that in the inner loops

1444625
centos	linux
i have now moved this functionality to a linux box running centos and on which i have installed imagemagick libxml2-devel

1444662
onclick	onmousedown
another alternative solution using onmousedown instead of onclick is provided by darwin below

1444673
mouse	keyboard
the ui user interface thread is the main thread in your application responsible for processing windows messages such as mouse clicks keyboard input repainting the screen etc

1444827
jobs	cron
we we re operating a soup-to-nuts kind of operation -- windows services cron jobs database backups web site updates etc

1444829
mvp	presenter
recently i had a task to migrate a windows application built on mvp to asp.net 1 view 1 presenter rule of thumb

1444898
daemons	systemd
then have the systemd start this daemons at startup

1444916
profiling	instrumentation
instrumentation in xcode 3.2 also now has a nice time profiling instrumentation although that s mac-only

1444916
profiling	instrumentation
i ve found that instrumentation works well for profiling but it can drop samples if the system is under heavy load

1444918
disk	ram
if yes then faulty ram hard disk page file is very possible

1444919
toolchain	binutils
during this initiation period i came across some terminologies stuff that i am not acquainted with like configure toolchain binutils etc

1444950
toolchain	binutils
your examples toolchain and binutils are not complex concepts and a simple wiki article should suffice

1444952
actionscript	mxml
yes you can use any text editor to write mxml and actionscript code and then use the command line to compile the code into a swf flash movie

1444954
ant	maven
you ll have to be able to build usually ant often maven

1444975
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i need to support ie6+ as well as modern browsers firefox google-chrome opera safari

1444991
udp	tcp
client send some messages to server using udp or tcp

1444991
udp	tcp
server must be able to support both udp and tcp

1444991
udp	tcp
in my program user client is given choice in the start to select what he want to use udp or tcp

1444991
udp	tcp
so my main problem is how can i know or differentiate in the server side if the client is sending message using tcp or udp

1445000
rss	feed
i m using rome to read and combine rss feed caching is done with ehcache in a java environment

1445005
udp	tcp
just let the tcp socket listen on port x and do the udp connections through port y

1445027
udp	tcp
before the packet reaches you you don t know whether it s udp or tcp

1445027
udp	tcp
so you want to bind to both udp and tcp sockets if you expect requests both ways

1445049
udp	tcp
when you create the socket you pass a type - sock_stream tcp or sock_dgram udp

1445064
actionscript	mxml
mxml is an xml language that acts as a shortcut for actionscript

1445064
actionscript	mxml
you can code in mxml instead of actionscript and the compiler will convert your mxml into actionscript before compiling

1445064
actionscript	mxml
the compiler converts the mxml into actionscript classes and then compiles the actionscript classes the ones created as mxml and the ones coded natively in actionscript into bytecode

1445064
actionscript	mxml
currently you can code both actionscript and mxml -- and then compile using flex builder flash builder or the mxmlc compiler which is free

1445064
actionscript	mxml
flash csx can does not understand mxml so you it can only compile straight-forward actionscript

1445064
actionscript	mxml
note there are third-party tools such as fdt that can also be used to write and compile actionscript and mxml

1445064
actionscript	mxml
you can even use mxml to auto-generate actionscript that s not part of the flex framework your own custom classes

1445083
awt	swing
the event dispatch thread belongs to awt not swing

1445135
filtering	grouping	sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping
since it will contain everything for both filtering on field_two sorting on field_three field_four field_five useful for grouping by and making sure that field_one is not null

1445139
setinterval	settimeout
that might require falling back on setinterval or settimeout but i m uncertain of the syntax to do that

1445141
public	protected
for example technically the standard allows for shuffling the layout of members that belong to different access specifiers public protected etc.

1445182
datatrigger	eventtrigger
triggers i still get confused sometimes about where i should use datatrigger s trigger s or eventtrigger s.

1445228
keydown	keyup
do not try to get character codes for keyup and keydown events

1445228
keydown	keyup
secondly you get different sets of values in a keypress event to what you get in a keyup or keydown event

1445274
int	double
it seems that in the original example the return value from foo operator double is cast to an int and then back to a double

1445295
hash	md5
it could be anything but i would try md5 or hmac-md5 first because they are most popular 16-byte hash algorithms

1445298
kde	gnome
i d suggest something like kde gnome firefox or eclipse

1445327
int	double
is not ambiguous the conversion from foo to int is used using your conversion function that converts to double that works because after applying the conversion function a standard conversion that converts the double to int truncation follows

1445339
antialiasing	transparent
and it seems working fine antialiasing is much better however this beats the idea of a transparent background in the process

1445390
folder	directory
try the public folder in the user profiles directory

1445407
int	double
it cannot convert item to int but it can convert item to double which it then converts to int

1445421
post	get
i ve disabled site search don t need it anyway outside this recipe area and i think i can build a simple block to get or post i always forget form data to the view

1445443
pop-up	dialog
the only drawback i see is that whenever the session is extracte notes pop-up a password dialog box

1445454
int	double
we can convert a foo since we can implicitly convert a foo to a double and thence to an int

1445512
fadein	fadeout
if i use fadeout and fadein here the .overlay disappears completely and the script thinks i ve moved my mouse out even though i m still hovering over the .overlay

1445549
firefox	safari
additionally it will be limited to only mac users with safari or firefox

1445590
stateless	stateful
put another way if this were an non-web application the stateless servlets would be objects i would delegate a task to and the stateful object would maintain the results

1445618
int	boolean
if you have registered a parameter as pdo_int but the variable holds a boolean pdo converts the bool to an int long

1445627
stdout	stderr
i have a program that writes to stdout and possibly stderr

1445627
stdout	stderr
i want to run it from python capturing the stdout and stderr

1445647
stdout	stderr
to a stdout or stderr pipe such that

1445655
put	get
this will put it in with the already defined ccharacter group so it ll get whatever highlighting that gets - in this case character

1445657
width	height
if all you re doing is changing it s offsets and adjusting it s width and height without needing to fundamentally change the structure of the shape such as rounding the corners of a rectangle of some such you should be able to just maintain a reference to the shape and adjust it s x y scalex scaley properties to effect the changes

1445688
versioning	upgrade
i have an asp.net application that i ve upgrade from versioning 1.1 visual studio 2003 to visual studio 2008 .net framework 3.5 asp.net 2.0

1445694
many-to-one	one-to-many
many-to-one associations and one-to-many obviously do not suffer from this issue

1445714
jruby	mri
for mri i always use ruby-prof but i don t think this works on jruby

1445718
mvp	presenter
i have applied the mvp pattern to my tool so that view and presenter are seperating the ui and logic

1445778
versioning	upgrade
in investigating this further and testing more options i think the best answer is to modify the product code in addition to the product versioning and author it as a major upgrade which removes the previous versioning first and then installs the new files

1445781
jobs	cron
before going to the extreme of having separate tables and running cron jobs i would make sure the simple approach is a problem when tuned correctly

1445821
executable	upx
you ll also probably want to upx your executable before you append them

1445823
mouseleave	mouseenter
in fact your solution depends on this because you can t trigger the mouseenter and mouseleave events on the overlay and still have the elements beneath clickable

1445823
mouseleave	mouseenter
the container should have the mouseenter and mouseleave actions bound to it and when the overlay fades out completely it should be hidden as well

1445827
lisp	scheme
a classic programming exercise is to write a lisp scheme interpreter in lisp scheme

1445865
libpcap	wireshark
i am stuck in converting a datetime object to a timestamp for the libpcap capture file format is also used by wireshark file format definitiom in c#

1445982
qstring	qchar
since you have mentioned qt you can try to create a qstring from the wstring and verify what chars are spaces with qchar isspace

1445987
memcpy	strcpy
of course you could always extend that to incorporate a function call to do the operation so supporting memcpy or strcpy or similar would be trivial

1445992
vim	textmate
i m trying really hard to learn vim after using textmate for the last few years

1446038
subtraction	addition
edit for a range of hours you want a timespan object which is automatically the result of addition subtraction of datetime objects

1446042
width	height
changing the x and y or height and width property of the shape

1446061
mamp	wamp
a local installation of magento through mamp wamp prepackaged lamp desktop environment for mac and windows with php 5.2.6 mysql 5 and apache 2.0.59

1446061
mamp	wamp
on my local mamp wamp i am able to create a blog without a problem

1446063
int	boolean
2. when you re performing boolean math with int

1446066
octree	quadtree
dividing the world up into a grid quadtree octree and rejecting any object that you know is within a zone that you have already determined is currently invisible or more commonly a combination of both

1446070
vim	textmate
not sure if you were referring to vim s own tabs there or pining for textmate s

1446071
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works perfectly in firefox but doesn t seem to do anything in ie google-chrome and safari the only other browsers i tested

1446077
lisp	scheme
lisp and or scheme

1446084
brainfuck	lolcode
lolcode and brainfuck are both small and fairly simple-esque

1446149
dmz	was
i don t remember if layer 3 and 2 were physically separated been a while but essentially layer one was fairly thin and just threw the requests over the dmz to the inside service

1446177
ocamllex	ocamlyacc
i have a parser and lexer written in ocamlyacc and ocamllex

1446206
uiview	subviews
it s useful to have the rects you want as final targets set up as subviews as a larger uiview or subclass where you expect all these related hits to occur

1446206
uiview	subviews
for example you could add the subviews as uicontrol objects which is a subclass of uiview that adds some useful methods for catching user touch events and call addtarget action forcontrolevents to specify some method to be triggered when the user does something in the rect of that uicontrol

1446308
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works in google-chrome firefox safari and ie8 no-compatibility

1446317
folder	directory
i want to write one of these files for each folder or some way of executing all of the folder in a directory

1446353
min	max
as toaomalkster suggested choosing the min max slope is naive

1446361
jdom	xerces
you can use jdom which requires xerces saxparser

1446393
octree	quadtree
couple that with an octree or quadtree depending on whether your game is 3d 2d so you dont need to check every single game object against the frustum

1446438
for-loop	loops
i seem to recall that for-loop index variables stay in scope after loops ends

1446524
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i tested the result in ie 6 7 8 firefox 2 3 3.5 opera 9.6 10 safari for windows 3 4 and google-chrome

1446530
regasm	regsvr32
i ve really never used regsvr32 with .net assemblies rather i use the regasm with the codebase option

1446556
ready	each
be responsible for an orderly call methods of each module and all are called in one event ready

1446559
google-chrome	firefox
i have gone through all sorts of ideas i could come up with to make this look exactly the same in ie6-8 firefox 3.5 and google-chrome but all ideas result in the text being one or two pixels off at best

1446575
httphandler	httpmodule
the httphandler msdn will tell you a lot about httphandler and httpmodule

1446597
freebsd	linux
for example at my freebsd box i got einval and erange values and under linux the same happens where the standard referrers only to the erange errno value

1446607
post	get
that get request is not a post and it ll be missing the payload

1446652
folder	directory
i was really looking for builtin users to have access for the directory and all of it s child folder and objects

1446684
ubuntu	linux
i experienced this same problem on ubuntu linux

1446712
pop-up	dialog
customize the look of dialog and pop-up screens

1446720
addclass	removeclass
i did some testing with ie ff and discovered that including the element s id in your stylesheet ul#menucnt prevents jquery from overriding that style - at least with the methods i employed toggleclass addclass removeclass etc.

1446750
versioning	upgrade
as someone who s been stuck at the older versioning of delphi and upgrade to d2010 lately i figure i still use the language rtl and vcl features from the d5 era and refrain from using these new features as the documents on those are somewhat decentralized around the blogosphere

1446793
g++	gcc
most of my gcc g++ use has been a while but i also recall using a macro to take advantage of the fact that gdb knew the members of some opaque data i had the library was compiled with debug

1446813
cpu	processors
cpu in linux use proc cpuinfo file windows check registery hkey_local_machine system currentcontrolset enum acpi search for the one with class processors

1446815
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome if i change the value to enable the next input then press tab the focus jumps like in firefox

1446832
firefox	safari
it works in safari broken in firefox 3.5.3 osx

1446849
post	get
currently dataurl generates a get but if one pulls the code from github the get can be changes to a post with no apparent side effects

1446891
ubuntu	linux
server ubuntu 7 to 9 damn small linux xp - protocol cifs samba various versions of smbclient - client same as server with no luck

1446983
firefox	safari
none of the above did the trick but here s a simple workaround to automatically focus the target element tested in firefox safari

1447055
converter	multibinding
this code fails at at startup because the values array in the converter that is called by the multibinding is not filled with booleans but have a value of dependencyproperty.unsetvalue

1447081
uiview	calayer
if all you are worried about is caching your drawing that is done for you by the calayer that backs your uiview on the iphone

1447082
put	get
projects get to control when they want to bring in new versions of libraries - the developers get to choose when they want to put in the effort of testing their code with the new version and when to take the pain of fixing any build issues the new library introduces

1447129
post	get
it s retrieving the variable from get post parameters

1447140
tunnel	vpn
if you do then you will need ssh access and a tunnel or some other sort of vpn solution

1447150
post	get
it retrieves either the submited form values post or the submitted querystring values get

1447155
post	get
to have things more explicitly you normally use for getting values from the querystring so when a get request has been done and when a post request is done

1447174
post	get
write a new method in your web framework that reads get or post

1447192
serializable	deserialization
of serializable deserialization can

1447208
yslow	pagespeed
last if you haven t looked at it one of the best tools out there is firebug and some plug-ins for it pagespeed and yslow

1447208
yslow	pagespeed
firebug s net panel can quickly give you a quick breakdown of your page load-time and pagespeed yslow can offer some good suggestions to help

1447221
post	get
so you should probably have one url greeter which looks for information sent in get or post requests from your form and displays a greeting

1447229
jobs	cron
you can easily create cron jobs every 2 days with the second creating row

1447232
vim	emacs
plugins for vim and emacs

1447242
fixed-point	rational-numbers	rational-numbers	floating-point	rational-numbers	base	floating-point	fixed-point
by the way decimal and binary are number base while fixed-point and floating-point are mechanisms for approximating rational-numbers

1447242
floating-point	fixed-point
the two are completely orthogonal you can have floating-point decimal numbers .net s system.decimal is implemented this way and fixed-point binary numbers normal integers are just a special case of this

1447270
children	parent
for example abc001 is the parent while abc001-small and abc001-large are the simple children

1447274
bash	zsh
grails bash completion and or autocomplete grails script names in bash zsh

1447387
keydown	keyup
there are 4 events fired keydown keyup keypress and change

1447468
tabcontrol	tabitem
the converter simply creates a new collection from the tabcontrol s items collection that contains the string-ized header object from each tabitem

1447470
sequence	permutation
permutation of the initial sequence

1447487
spaces	delimiter
i found this class to take a spaces delimiter file and if there are multiple spaces they will be treated as a single separator

1447487
typeerror	traceback
typeerror traceback most recent call last

1447489
draggable	droppable
if you drop the draggable div into the droppable div this code will work

1447496
width	height
also i think you need to give the cells a width and height in the css

1447497
mvp	presenter
the way i did this was to use the mvp pattern to separate out the model view and presenter

1447518
nsurl	nsstring
weâ ve used elsewhere in this assignment to populate the array nsstring nsurl nsprocessinfo

1447532
converter	multibinding
the problem has nothing to do with a multibinding or your converter

1447533
spaces	delimiter
the class expects a spaces delimiter contents in the file

1447537
microchip	avr
avr is just an integrated circuit microchip made by atmel

1447544
decoder	encoder
aspose has a pdf417 encoder decoder for both .net and java but it is not open source

1447545
xsl-fo	xslt
i have an xml document that i am transforming with xslt into an xsl-fo document

1447598
uiview	calayer
coreanimation works just fine on my uiview based objects without having to use calayer

1447651
filesystems	ntfs
ntfs filesystems has junction points i think you may use them instead you can use python win32 api module for that

1447700
udp	tcp
if you don t have a special reason to use udp you could also use tcp by specifying socket.sock_stream instead of socket.sock_dgram

1447729
free	malloc
the problem that arises then is when you have to pass allocated pointers between the dll and its hosting app since most of the trouble with mixed runtimes comes from having more than one implementation of malloc and free in a process

1447729
perl	tcl
given the recent rise in popularity of dynamic languages such as lua perl tcl and python that often can be easily bound to libraries implemented in c it can also be greatly appreciated by those user communities if you can supply bindings to those languages along with binaries compiled against the local custom for choice of crt

1447733
spaces	delimiter
you are running into inadvertant use of the default spaces delimiter

1447742
children	parent
parent.objects.all i get both the parent and the children

1447796
free	realloc
if realloc fails you asked for way too much memory and it couldn t allocate that much then the original memory is not free

1447805
versioning	upgrade
running pear -v gives me versioning 1.7.2 when i run pear upgrade pear it says my versioning is newer than the current noe which is 1.9.0 if ran pear upgrade -f pear to force an upgrade it downloads the files and installs successfully but i still have versioning 1.7.2 and cannot install phpunit

1447884
stdout	stderr
you php can read and write to stdin stdout stderr

setinterval	settimeout
the difference between setinterval and settimeout is that settimeout triggers expression only once whereas setinterval keeps triggering expression again and again unless you tell it to stop

1447930
hide	show
then after you add the segment control you can hide or show the tableview based on the state of the segment

1447933
firefox	safari
from the cursory tests it seems that some browsers firefox 3.5 and safari 4 actually put these elements into head when creating a document tree

1447993
integer	fractions
you have to first see if the integer fits in your x.y type make the equivalent fractions type and proceed

1448012
setinterval	settimeout
also the first parameter to settimeout setinterval is expected to be a function which suffers from the same problem here as your window.onload did it calls settimeout undefined 10000

1448012
setinterval	settimeout
a side note - setinterval and settimeout both allow passing strings that get eval ed at runtime but i would suggest against using that method which looks like this

1448061
post	get
to retrieve each of the key value elements of the post or get associative array and create variables with those names and values

1448085
portrait	landscape
first time then i run scene with this view this view orientation is landscape but next times is portrait i can t resolve this problem

1448102
dictionary	map
java actually uses the term map as well as dictionary -- map was added later when they realized dictionary should have been an interface but since the name was already used they had to come up with a new name.

1448108
pop-up	dialog
customize the look of dialog and pop-up screens

this function determines if you ve scrolled past the max number of slides too far down or below the minimum too far up it then sets the number appropriately to equal the maximum or minimum position

1448210
division	multiplication
at least for for the x86 platform multiplication is slow division triply so and floating point may take ages

1448254

1448446
fink	macports
in general macports or fink help when there are complex libraries etc that need to be installed

1448489
getter	setter
you don t need attr_accessor as getter setter are already defined for model attributes

1448495
post	get
to make it short you do not really know about the encoding character set used on the variables that are passed to your php script via get or post especially get is a problem here

1448597
lisp	smalltalk
but smalltalk isn t a modern language in many ways it s a dialect of lisp so its heritage is 1950s even though it only arrived in the 1970s and the improvement is made to the implementation not the language

1448597

google-chrome	safari
my ajaxform request is not working properly in safari and google-chrome

1448622
opera	firefox
works fine in firefox ie opera

1448645
min	max
if you get the loop overhead low enough it might make sense to do it in separate passes one to get the sum which you divide to get the mean one to get the sum of squares which you combine with the sum to get the variance and one to get the min and or max

1448673
spaces	delimiter
the following operators delimiter by spaces can be overloaded as non-member functions

1448699
button	checkbox
for instance tab button are actually checkbox

1448699
button	checkbox
however i require four modes of a list item simple text only with icon with a checkbox and with a radio button a radio button is derived from a checkbox and iradiobutton interface

1448700
submit	submission
try using an ajax based submission process that s triggered by clicking a normal button not a submit button it s really easy with jquery

1448781
versioning	upgrade
one way to go would be to develop a single module each system would install it locally and decide which versioning they wanted to use and when they would upgrade

1448782
button	checkbox
i.e. you re saying that a list item is-a checkbox while the natural state of affair is that a list item has-a checkbox and similarly for radio button

1448782
inherited	subclassing
if you re forced to operate this way by the design of the widget engine then it s not surprising that you end up with the need for multiple inherited -- but that can add its own complications and in any case subclassing leads to strong coupling and low flexibility while containment and composition are better in these regards

1448822
windows	wow64
your delphi programs will run on a 32 bit layer wow64 - windows on windows 64 of windows 64 bit which is close enough to the real 32 bit os that you do not need to care about it unless you work very closely with the lower system level

1448856
rpm	yum
i m the one who answered the other question on systems that use rpm packages you normally use yum to install things the package is named sqlite3-devel

1448859
pugixml	rapidxml
the nicest thing about pugixml is the xpath support which tinyxml and rapidxml lack

1448859
pugixml	rapidxml
quoting rapidxml s author i would like to thank arseny kapoulkine for his work on pugixml which was an inspiration for this project and 5 - 30 faster than pugixml the fastest xml parser i know of he had tested against version 0.3 of pugixml which has reached recently version 0.42

1448859
tinyxml	xerces
low memory consumption and fragmentation the win over pugxml is 1.3 times tinyxml - 2.5 times xerces dom - 4.3 times 1

1448865

1448986
jar	manifest.mf
either by modifying the manifest.mf in place or by wrapping that in another jar and specify bundle-classpath metaball.jar in the manifest

1449139
width	height
this object s shape is 3 by 3 which correspondingly 3 pixel height by 3 pixel width

1449145
opera	safari
so far only safari 4 and opera 10 seem to support it

1449154
width	height
the silverlight object tag or javascript is using a 100 height and width div which doesn t work in firefox unless all the parents have height and width set

1449154
width	height
if so you can either specify a pixel height and width or you can make sure height and width are set for all the parent elements for the silverlight object

1449154
width	height
you may be setting the height and width before they re available

1449169

1449341
min	max
if you do this then you can shift the wave to center on the x-axis by subtracting or adding the average value and determine 1 min max values which provides an amplitude and 2 x-intercepts which provides the period

1449363
gridview	onclientclick
in the rendered html for the code below the btnedit in the gridview has the correct javascript in the onclientclick parameter onclientclick javascript webform_dopostback...

virtualenv	setuptools
this should install the newest version of setuptools on your virtualenv

1449465
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
in ie 7 8 opera the 100 height of the tags is interpreted as 100 of the page where as in firefox google-chrome safari the entire table takes up the entire height of the page and instead the table rows fill in the remaining space that they are given

1449467
msg	eml
aspose.network supports accessing emails from exchange server inbox and save to file in eml or msg format

1449504
hash	md5
to clarify confusion created by my naivety consistent with the comments made below md5 like most useful hash by their nature are not injective so their output is not guaranteed to be unique for all inputs

1449504
hash-collision	key
if hash-collision are an issue in this case they are using this technique will require checking after hashing whether an identical key has already been generated

1449511
memcpy	strcpy
the only way you can fill arrays is by using strcpy memcpy or similar manual copy

1449549
cgpoint	cgrect

1449575
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
the following markup renders similarly against internet explorer 7 firefox 3.5.3 google-chrome 3.0.195.21 and opera 10 and last but not least safari 4.0.3

1449620
int	boolean
in particular i m unsure how best to convert an nsdictionary which might hold int strings boolean or all of the above into a format that i can then pass on to python as keyword arguments

1449622
serializable	deserialization
i ve used it on a couple of projects and it makes json serializable and deserialization a lot easier

1449642
lisp	scheme
i came from a heavy java background with lighter amounts of c++ and also some lisp scheme as you have - i ve been doing iphone application development full time since the sdk release

1449648
google-chrome	firefox
to see what i mean look at in both firefox and google-chrome

1449648
google-chrome	firefox
the difficult panel in question is title system construction area - the teal colored border in firefox sprays itself everywhere whereas in google-chrome it displays properly

1449660
google-chrome	safari
things work fine in google-chrome or safari there is no space with no some space with 1 more space with 2 etc..

1449670
maven	m2e
on newer versions of m2e you can also automatically download sources by going to window- preferences...- maven then selecting the download artifact sources option

1449702
accessor	properties
the properties and synthesize directives simply setup accessor for you instance variables so you can set them by doing self.ivar somevar

1449702
accessor	properties
to setup accessor methods on that same properties you need to do both properties and synthesize

1449740
build-helper-maven-plugin	pom.xml
if you go for pom.xml packaging you can use define the war war execution in a profile to allow you to package it but you ll need to use the build-helper-maven-plugin attach-artifact goal to attach the war to the pom.xml

1449740
jar	war
the lifecycle bindings for war packaging are listed in the introduction to the build lifecycle see the default lifecycle bindings - packaging ejb ejb3 jar par rar war section

1449750
width	height
for a 2-d array of width w and height h you can represent it as a 1-d array of length w h where each index

1449765
maven	pom.xml
in this case the dependency does exist on the central maven repository you can simply search for artifacts using the sonatype public repository btw so you can simply add this dependency to your pom.xml

1449771
getter	setter
property is the way of telling that you are going to write getter and setter kind of enforcing it but you can write getter setter without setting them property

1449771
getter	setter
synthesis will in actual implement getter and setter if you dont synthesis but you have set them property you have to implement those getter and setter by your hand

1449773
rss	feed
multiple google searches tell me how to bind a yahoo rss feed to a gridview or provide various obscure details on using directives

1449812
decimal	ieee
the latest revision of the ieee 754 2008 standard does indeed define hardware decimal floating point numbers using the representations shown in the software referenced in the question

1449812
decimal	ieee
the previous version of the standard ieee 754 1985 did not provide decimal floating point numbers

1449840
post	get
sadly when i search the web for something like libcmtd i just get post on forums from people having problems with their code

1449863
post	get
change the method of your ajax call to post instead of get

1449897
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i have a method in a uiviewcontroller of my iphone application inside a uinavigationcontroller that is called whenever a row is selected in the table in the viewcontroller s view

1449910
nsmutablestring	nsstring
it s legal to retain an nsstring as in this example but it is often considered good practice to use copy instead of retain since an might actually point to an nsmutablestring object which may later change when your code expects it to stay the same.

1449910
getter	setter
declaring a setter and getter method in the class s interface and

1449910
getter	setter
indicating how the setter and getter behave

1449910
iboutlet	ibaction
what iboutlet and ibaction do

1449910
iboutlet	ibaction
iboutlet literally becomes an empty string when the compiler looks at it and ibaction becomes the void return value

1449910
getter	setter
with the dot notation you re calling the setter or getter if there s no afterwards and these two lines are the same

1449910
getter	setter
they can still use the getter and setter to access it if you declare a property for it

1449910
getter	setter
now when you get around to actually implementing your class synthesize says something like make sure the getter and setter get implemented for this property. it does not say implement both of these for me because the compiler is polite enough to check for your own implementation first and only fill in the pieces you ve missed

1449910
getter	setter
you don t have to use synthesize at all even if you use property out the wazoo -- you could always just provide your implementations for your setter and getter if you re into that sort of thing

1449910
getter	setter
the point here is to understand that a property declaration is really just about declaring a setter and getter method which usually corresponds to an actual instance variable -- but not always

1449975
button	checkbox
i had previously thought the implementation was for the add button to function almost as a checkbox with on and off

1449982
getter	setter
as you are using the shortcut for properties you can only access the properties through their setter and getter

1450038
activemq	rabbitmq
i ve looked into rabbitmq and activemq but i m thinking that there is a better solution for my use case

hide	show
jquery tells the browser to show hide the loading div

1450254
hide	show
jquery tells the browser to show hide the loading div

1450254
hide	show
if i tell it to hide one element and the show it again it will simply ignore the command because the final result will be the same as do nothing.

1450257
stdout	fflush
after your final print statement you could probably call fflush stdout

1450257
stdout	fflush
to fflush stdout to the screen

1450258
stdout	fflush
you need to fflush stdout

1450258
stdout	fflush
fflush stdout should do it added after the print

1450259
stdout	fflush
try flushing fflush stdout after each print input

1450281
stdout	fflush
fflush stdout causes the buffered data to be fflush to output stream which in this case is stdout

1450318
multiplying	add
for example in scala you can replace the operators so now it can add or multiplying your matrix

1450355
pull	push
you get into the neat stuff when you want to merge your changes with other people s work with git pull and git push and related commands

1450368
perforce	cvs
version control systems like cvs subversion mercurial git perforce etc

1450368
robocopy	xcopy
examples include rsync robocopy and xcopy mir on windows

1450373
width	height
wouldn t it be nice if you could say that some text fields should be one width and height and some should be another combination

1450400
onchange	onkeyup
assign the function onkeyup and onchange to the textareas you want to reflect each other

1450416
accessor	properties
for a properties you can either provide accessor implementations yourself or ask it to synthesize accessor for an instance variable

1450417
postgresql	mysql
in rails model the object id represents the unique id from database which never can be 0 i speak for mysql maybe there are exceptions with sequences and serials in postgresql

1450420
gitignore	hgignore
hg hgignore syntax glob is the same behaviour as git s gitignore

1450425

i need to make a down down list in the item add page but i can not find a good way to get all of the values from another table into an array to put into the page

1450532
folder	directory
if you have directory level security set perhaps only certain roles can access a specific folder in the web application that will work etc

1450579
onresume	onpause
you could save all the values you need into the preferences inside the onpause of each of the activities then restore it in the onresume

1450608
google-chrome	firefox
the traditional square-and-multiply method is much slower it uses maximum 4096 modular multiplications. doing so speeds up the modular exponentiation by a factor of 6 in firefox 3.0 and by a factor of 4 in google-chrome

1450692
libjpeg	libpng
images libjpeg libpng libgif

1450692

ftp	telnet
the first one is about policy files and the second is an example of a telnet so no ftp here client

1450777
ready	each
instead of using a selector in the usual way where for each ready channel a message can be determined and sent i d like to choose whichever connection is currently ready and send a message there

1450822
innodb	myisam
the only reason that myisam innodb might be different is that the order the rows come back could affect how sorted the data are already - myisam could give the data back in more sorted order in some cases and vice versa

1450839
versioning	upgrade
it then can manage the database and upgrade it to any versioning from any versioning

1450846
post	get

i would like to create a colour scale that range from min

1450890
unicode	ucs
i generally use 8-bit ucs unicode transformation format which works perfect for any well most languages

1450896
allocator	stl
so my question is has anybody used this kind of allocator scheme in combination with stl would it just completely blow stl apart as i suspect

1450896
allocator	stl
i can see std list intrusive_ptr working at the intrusive_ptr level but what about the allocator of the stl list nodes themselves is there anyway to override the next prev pointers to be intrusive_ptr s themselves or am i just going to have to have a standard heap allocator along side this more dynamic one

1450976
allocator	stl
for stl containers you can customize the allocator but it still needs to return fixed raw memory pointers

1450998
rational-numbers	fractions	rational-numbers	integer	integer	fractions
the reason for the exception is that an integer does not hold rational-numbers basically fractions

1450998
int	double
the way java casts a double to an int is done by removing the part after the decimal separator by rounding towards zero

1451033
stdout	fflush
with the n in the format you don t need to fflush stdout

1451062

1451388
post	get
this query almost works as it will get all of information for topics that have post

1451388
post	get
i m sure that the query is inefficient and wrong since it makes two sub-selects to the post table but it was the only way i could get to the point i m at

1451399
multiplying	add
to add numbers use itertools.chain to multiplying use itertools.product

1451423
post	get
to ensure you get results for topics without post you ll need to use left join instead of join for the first join between topics and the next table

1451434
isnull	nvl
other databases have other functions for that isnull in sql server nvl in oracle etc. etc.

1451452

first get the most recent post per topic with associated user information

1451452
post	get
then get the counts of post per topic in a separate simpler query

folder	directory
i would like to set up a subdomain where the file folder is just another one in the main directory that is able to use the img folder but it doesn t work

1451576
jstl	taglib
struts provides taglib for i18n bean message but you can also use jstl fmt message

1452382
fadein	hide	fadein	fadeout	hide	fadeout	hide	show
would i replace the hide and show with fadein fadeout

lisp	scheme
in scheme functions are not tied to symbols like they are in common lisp

1454882
google-chrome	safari
at the moment i would say that google-chrome and safari seem to be the fastest browser for our app but at some point it comes down to a lot more than pure js speed

1454923
versioning	upgrade
on windows you can t build phonon with a stock versioning of mingw - you need to upgrade to gcc 4.4 and apply some patches

1454926
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
obviously if your application relies on javascript to be fast for your end users you must test it on all platforms and make sure you meet rational performance targets- but a fast javascript browser eg google-chrome opera firefox 3.5 makes life a much more pleasant experience while in heavy development

1456114
appendto	each
if that s the case pushing string construction and appendto logic to a different method may be a little better since those objects would get freed up after each calling and only the memory of the returned value in this case either the string markup or nothing if the new method did the appendto would remain in memory

1456141

i am using a very large image and i am trying to put it inside my jlayeredpane that s inside the jscrollpane

1456174
dataoutputstream	bufferedoutputstream
dataoutputstream is buffered bufferedoutputstream too but the second one does it much better

1456200
jscrollpane	jviewport	jscrollpane	jlayeredpane	jlayeredpane	jviewport
well this is pretty much a guess because you haven t provided much information but it sounds to me like the jlayeredpane s preferred size is 0 0 and the white you re seeing is the background of the jscrollpane s jviewport child

1456262
maven	pom.xml
of the dependencies you list the following are defined as optional in the activemq-core pom.xml also see the relevant section from the maven book

there used to be a sax parser in php i think it has now been moved to pear or pecl

1456295
setinterval	settimeout
and fwiw javascript can do basic sleep wait operations using setinterval and settimeout

1456386
ilist	icollection
but as a return type for a typical data access tier a count property is often useful and i would prefer to return an icollection t with a count property or possibly ilist t if i think typical consumers will want to use an indexer

1456394
versioning	upgrade
what is your process when you decide to upgrade to the newest versioning

1456440
os.path	shutil
therefore i d say the modules os and os.path are probably the most important and also mention glob fnmatch and shutil

1456547
yacc	bison
nowadays you d use bison instead of yacc

1456550
put	get
put -1 -1 in for the xpos ypos to get it centred on the screen

1456610
spaces	delimiter
then make sure you have double-quotes around line so that a parameter isn t delimiter by spaces

1456633
portrait	landscape
the screen shows up with a landscape status bar but all the controls are still in portrait mode

1456695

cassini	iis
i ve already tried deleting temporary asp.net file but without success i m using cassini as web server did not tried iis yet

1456733
distance	polygons
assuming you have your polygons stored in some format like a list of adjacent vertices do a o n check to calculate the perimeter by iterating through them and computing the distance between each point

1456743
disk	ram
beyond a certain point all the database cares about is mapping and copying pages of data from disk to ram and back again

1456785
ironruby	ironpython
but others such as ironpython ironruby delphi prism etc are also relevant

1456891
websphere	ibm
this was the case but ibm has since release websphere application server tools edition and has donated a server adapter to the eclipse market place

1456901
ant	maven	ant	pom.xml	maven	pom.xml	maven-antrun-plugin	pom.xml
i know how to call ant targets from maven using the maven-antrun-plugin but i m not sure how to setup the pom.xml in this instance

1456901
ant	maven
i don t want maven to actually generate an artifact but i do want it to pull the artifact that was built by ant when the maven deploy goal is run

1456901
ant	pom.xml	maven-antrun-plugin	pom.xml
the pom.xml will use the maven-antrun-plugin in the package goal to call the ant target at the appropriate time to build the .war artifact

1456901
ant	maven	ant	pom.xml	maven	pom.xml
a i am creating a .war file but it is created via ant not maven so having a war packaging type in the pom.xml doesn t make sense

1456906
ienumerable	iqueryable
if you use iqueryable as your return instead of ienumerable than there is no cost of doing

1456918
inherited	properties
if you are inheriting from one of these controls you should see the inherited events in the properties window

1456927
unicode	ucs
usepackage ucs unicode functionality

1456976
ant	maven	ant	pom.xml	maven	pom.xml

1456986
nsbuttoncell	nsmatrix
create an nsmatrix instance set its cell prototype to an nsbuttoncell set

1457005
button	checkbox
clicking the push me button causes the checkbox to gain focus

1457005
button	checkbox
i know this because the checkbox becomes checked if you hit the spacebar after clicking the button

1457040
gcov	lcov
if you take an instrumented build of your app for a spin in the simulator then run gcov on it you can see what code was executed by using a tool like coverstory a fairly simplistic gui or lcov perl scripts to create html reports

1457040
gcov	lcov
i use gcov and lcov for chdatastructures.framework and auto-generate coverage reports after each svn commit

1457045
hash	md5
the problem is following there are two sets with elements identified by some relatively compact value uuid or md5 sha1 whatever hash sitting on different machines

1457085
button	checkbox
if i first tab-selected any element on the page not necessarily the checkbox and then clicked the button the focus highlight worked as expected

1457128
kerberos	ldap
i have a tomcat configuration that uses kerberos 5 to authenticate the user against ad server and then uses ldap to obtain roles for authorization against a security-constraint

1457128
kerberos	ldap
perhaps there is a way to access ldap to obtain roles using the kerberos ticket instead of the serviceuser servicecredential info

1457142
spaces	delimiter
this will use spaces as the delimiter and select the complement of the second field

1457153
spaces	delimiter
this takes a file considers fields delimiter by spaces and outputs the first third and following fields

1457154
nstextstorage	nstextattachment	nstextview	nstextstorage
you will need to create a custom nstextattachment for each token and insert it into the nstextstorage for your nstextview

1457167
post	get
you shouldnâ t use them because you cannot distinguish the source of that variable values since they can come from any source of the egpcs variables environment get post cookie server

1457168

but i have no idea what conditions to put to get correct date

1457213
min	max
maybe some max or min functions can be put there but i have no idea

1457237
width	height
you should be able to use skin code like this skinwidth and skinheight are exposed inside the graphicborderskin so you don t need to override updatedisplaylist and specify additional local variables for width and height

1457237
width	height
and for the canvas you need to specify a width and height setting for it to draw

1457254
fadein	fadeout	slideup	slidedown
if i change slideup slidedown to fadein fadeout everything works fine and i don t get extra pixels

1457281

then for reading i find textscan to be more powerful than fread fscanf the differences between them all are summarized here

1457306
set	bag
i have a set of documents that are each basically a small bag of arbitrary words

1457319
postgresql	mysql
it seems that each server implementation postgresql mysql etc. offers api libraries for various languages my code is in c and c++ though solutions for java and python would also interest me

1457326
ant	maven
ant if you use maven it s arguably

1457347
solaris	aix
according to those tests only aix and solaris completely passed a thread-stress-test

1457360

1457393
rss	feed
it sounds like you are saying that you will be getting a bunch of links from somewhere rss feed content or something

1457393

the company i work for is looking for an ivr implementation that is highly compatible with any potential pbx ivr or pbx combo or to provide our own hosting solution

1457500
msdn	wfp
in earlier versions of windows you need to use filter drivers the linked to msdn page mentions what technologies wfp replaces.

1457515
cassini	iis
you can always create a website or webapplication that runs through cassini instead and provide a folder path vs a iis path

1457530
libpcap	wireshark
not sure if it s before the o s but have a look at wireshark and the library it uses libpcap

i use a combination of nerdtree directory sidebar fuzzyfinder textmate go-to-file like textmate s cmd+t and sessions h sessions to help me deal with large projects

1457607
rss	feed
i m parsing an rss feed and each entry has a timestamp such as this 2009-09-21t21 24 43+04 00

1457634
folder	directory
it says that you have to create a folder with your test-case m-files in it then make that your working directory using cd

1457692
mouseover	mouseout
it ll give you greater control of the behaviour of the mouseover mouseout events by configuration

1457717
subtract	add
to do it around a point you have to subtract the center value first making that reference point the center origin then apply the matrix and add the original center position back

1457766
hide	show
the best way to accomplish the effect that you are looking for would be to arrange hide show any objects that you don t want to be visible in a fullscreenevent.full_screen event handler

1457766
width	height
if the scalemode property is set to noscale while the application transitions to full-screen mode the stage width and height properties are updated and the stage the resize event

1457813
onchange	onblur
i am curious how i bind an onchange or onblur event to the input box that this combobox uses

1457849
google-chrome	safari
when an html element is focused currently selected tabbed in to many browsers at least safari and google-chrome will put a blue border around it

1457893
sorting	filtering
fwiw i find that code more difficult to understand than a simple call to datatable.select which also allows filtering as well as sorting by parent or child tables if needed

1457894
rss	feed
libxml since rss feed are just xml

1457900
subtract	addition
instead i had to subtract the lower value from the initial addition to compensate

1457930
cout	cin
however i don t understand why you still want the cout to go ahead - if the cin call didn t succeed you will only be printing the old contents of the string - you do not clear it anywhere unless you do so in other code which you haven t posted here

1457935
yacc	bison
the problem with grouping them like that is that you lose the precedences on the rules -- you only have one rule that has different precedence depending on which mathop it is which bison yacc cannot handle

1457958
ant	maven
you can actually wrap an ant project with maven by using multiple ant run goals as i wrote in a different question

1457958
ant	maven
assuming your existing ant project has clean and build tasks this might be a useful way of wrapping the project so you can use maven goals and have it map to existing ant code

1457959
folder	dir
i have a number of gifs in a folder on my web server dir subdir bla.gif etc

1457998
boost	stl
sometimes sticking with the stl or boost libraries if you re coding in c++ is a much better solution

1458088
put	get
i know that i can put them in a cell array and get 90 of what i need

1458166
mp4	h.264
iam writing an application which will do conversion from avi to mpeg wmv to avi wmv to mpeg or h.264 avc video avi to mp4 rmvb to 3gp etc

1458223
formview	detailsview
if you are really after binding a single record and you don t want to go the simple route of just using 2 methods that set get values from the controls you can use a formview full control or a detailsview table layout yet you can have custom html

1458223
formview	detailsview
i used formview and detailsview for some time in some projects

1458225
rss	feed
i m writing an app that retrieves rss feed on a scheduled daily basis and saves the contents of each feed as xml data in a sql server 2005 database

1458236
rss	feed
personally i m a lot more comfortable in c# than in t-sql so i d do it in linq to xml and indeed i ve done exactly that for an rss feed before now

1458240
komodo	notepad++
i ve heard people reference komodo intellij idea as good solutions but i ve always just used notepad++

1458249
post	get
then when the user taps on a row get the array of post associated with the selected category and pass that to a new view controller

1458277
superclass	subclassing
you could set the subclassing to be superior to the superclass see discussion above such that concatenating objects of the two classes will always cause the superclass objects to be converted to the subclassing

1458300
mbunit	mstest
i like it but it seems that unlike mstest or mbunit etc.

1458339
width	height
i want to know how to control all property of gridview from the css.......like column width height

1458384
width	height
you can specify height and width in settings to set the textbox to specific height and width

1458403
httphandler	httpmodule
generally i would say an httphandler and turning off the httpmodule you don t need should be a very effective solution

1458417
division	subtract
the clever parts seems to be that they are only using the division operation for the first digit a1 and avoid having to use the other a x s in the same way by applying them in the next step by subtract their product against the partial quotient from the interim remainder

1458417
division	subtraction
this allows greater flexibility in the timing of the application of each digit to the operation like for instance deferring the application of the secondary digits of the divisor a x 1 until after a partial quotient is created from the prior step s division by a 1 which in turn allows them to be applied as a product subtraction rather than a division operation

1458423
post	get
please note i dont have any design page aspx page where i can use form tag and get post method

1458452
worldwind	jogl
there is a large and active jogl community in nasa worldwind - a very neat jogl based app

1458525
actionscript	mxml
i have written a blog entry on how to setup eclipse + axdt + flex sdk to prepare your mxml actionscript as3 development environment on linux

1458526
int	chars
given that you could use the hexadecimal representation of an int which gives you a 8 chars string

1458549
cvs	svn
that means branches are emulated through tags for cvs directory copies for svn

1458551
min	max
i ve read a number of posts recommending the use of min and max so i tried

1458575
imagemagick	magick++
some people in our office are using magick++ an imagemagick library to make screenshots

1458579
hide	show
basically i was changing a class on a parent element to hide some elements and show others

1458593
subtraction	addition
with 16 byte alignment it can be used directly with simd load instructions where you d load it up into a 128 bit registers that allows addition subtraction dot products and all manner of vector operations

1458611
nexus	artifactory
both artifactory and nexus have more or less similar feature set but artifactory s ldap support makes it more attractive over nexus

1458627
hide	show
it seems that the simplest way to do that is to create two uitableviews for each purpose and show hide them according to segmented control value

1458670
centos	linux
i have linux centos 5.3

1458676
int	chars
value types are things such as int byte chars struct float etc

1458716
decoder	encoder
write your own encoder and decoder which can be very simple like return __dict__

1458750
jvisualvm	jstat
the tooling provided with the jdk jstat jconsole jvisualvm is much more reliable

1458761
postgresql	mysql
among the paid generic alternatives i ve liked ems tools which has a version for sql server mysql postgresql and firebird and dezign which supports 12 databases

1458767
post	get
the page correctly redirects but instead of the response having a get as the request.httpmethod it has a post instead

1458884
implements	extends
back2dos has mentioned the approach you should use what i did was extends the movieclip class and implements all kinds of functions that i use on daily basis but are not part of the movieclip class

1458896
freebsd	linux
linux and freebsd would have been much more popular if it wasn t for all those pirated windows versions that are roaming around

1458906
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is that in firefox and google-chrome it orders the first column when clicked by url not the content of the link

1458963
bazaar	git
maybe it helps but bazaar and mercurial are both using dulwich for their git interoperability

1459006
hex	binary
i m searching for a python compatible method in c# to convert hex to binary

1459013
width	height
an example in the api can be found at css height and width height val

1459048
pop-up	dialog
the code is very simple below and i find when file.copy throws exception path not valid no permission etc. the service will crash and pop-up a dialog to let me debug

1459050
hex	binary
but it s very easy to convert hex to binary byte by byte well nibble by nibble actually

1459135
int	boolean
but i also need to send int boolean and floats with json and can not find a way to do this in the same way

1459145
post	get
if i get time i ll edit this post so that it works but that will have to wait until this evening

1459155
treemap	treeset
for a start the treeset and treemap in the runtime are red-black-tree implementations

1459241
post	get
to answer your first point no get and post are independent of synchronous asynchronous

1459321
opera	firefox
i use this code below but it isn t works on firefox and opera browser

1459339
width	height
but that gave problems with certain images in the content that have no set height and width

1459351
pull	push
anyway the obvious way to do this assuming you haven t tried to force the push is to pull first

1459354
exif	xmp
the xmp block is in a 0xffe1 jpeg section the same as exif

1459354
exif	xmp
i did an experiment with one image saving it in two different color profiles and besides the changes in xmp and exif i noticed that there is probably a whole new jpeg section

1459354
exif	xmp
i would say that the information in exif and xmp are just metadata and that the important thing is the presence of the icc_profile section

1459374
rss	feed
the easiest way is to consume your wordpress rss feed

1459389
min	max
each pool is configured with min max open connections fact is that it will usually use 99 of the time 50 of the min number 2-3 in case of 5 min if it is using more that that this pool is mis-configured since it is opening and closing connections all the time expensive .

1459439
cck	ubercart
you can use cck to add fields to ubercart products as per florianh s solution but you also get things like a shopping cart and checkout for free

1459446
width	height
as a side note i find it a bit strange that your bitmap is being set to a constant height of 200 -- the normal thing would be to make the height of the bitmap equal to the height of the window as is done for the width

1459492
windows	wow64
it can run on a 64bit windows though through wow64 just as any other 32-bit process can use

1459492
mouse	keyboard
the project has a windows hook dll as well to hook keyboard mouse and other windows messages on the host

1459531
disk	ram
i d look at it from the hardware perspective ram and hard disk

1459535
opera	firefox
firefox 2+ opera 9+ msie 7

1459702
pull	push
what i would like to do is when there is a push to github i would ping my application using a webhook and i want my application to run git pull to retrieve changes

1459783
salt	md5
then calculate the passwords md5 with salt

1459783
kerberos	ldap
other topics which you might look at are kerberos ldap services but those are hard topics

1459889
translation	localization
so i created a folder named localization under content and then i create resources resx files for each language i want to translation

1459902
hash	md5
i played it safe by storing the user passwords as md5 hash

1459902
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
i should have salt the md5 hash - because it s currently possible to decode unsalted md5 hash using rainbow tables

1459923
salt	md5
decode the passwords yourself and re-encode them with a salt i recommend something a little more fancy than md5

1459923
hash	md5
although md5 is a hash and should not be decodable it can be broken using rainbow tables with probability almost one you can find a unique here s the probability string of at most say 20 characters with a given hash especially if your character set is limited say to alphanumeric

1459930
hash	salt
this will create an undecryptable hash thats salt with unique informations

1459930
hash	salt
note the userid was only picked so a unique salt for each double hash exists.

1459937
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
add a piece of code so that when someone logs in it does the normal process computes the md5 sum of the password and checks it against the stored hash and if that succeeds recompute a salt version of the hash from the clear-text password they entered and store it in the password file

1459937
salt	md5
the only wrinkle is that you ll need to add an indicator for whether each md5 is salt or not since you ll have a mix of both for a while

1459940
hash	salt
just calculate another hash from the current hash together with a salt

1459944
ant	maven
if you can t do that you could use the maven 1 ant plugin to copy the war to tomcat s webapps directory after it has been packaged

1460005
ant	maven
the point is you generally want to clean the work directory and the webapps directory and the maven 1 ant plugin does not do this as far as i know if and read from the link provided

1460010
rtp	rtsp
i m looking for a rtp rtsp library in c++

1460068
hash	salt
salt the original hash as mentioned by others

1460068
hash	salt
if someone already has a copy of your db and you rehash the same passwords with salt the rehash the old hash with salt will not work

1460085
google-chrome	firefox
when i click on the file to be downloaded in firefox or google-chrome it works fine and saves the file on to disk

1460117
vbscript	jscript
this works on jscript and vbscript activescripting host but some others scripting host does not return anything on codeobject so this is not very portable

1460122
dictionary	map
the list of built-in types in c# is quite short and not very likely to change so i think having a dictionary or a big switch statement to map these shouldn t be difficult to maintain

1460130
subtraction	addition
various subtraction -and addition methods

1460151
subtraction	addition
there are some interesting datetime extension methods especially for addition subtraction in this post post your extension goodies for c# .net

1460193
folder	directory
i see the bom in the library reciepts boms directory but there is no app folder with the app bundle

1460206
wav	riff
also reading wav file headers is a relatively complicated task you have to search for riff chunks and so on but writing them is cake you just fill out a header structure and write it at the beginning of the file

1460215
post	put
when i come in with a post the values i put in my form are properly mapped to these parameters

1460215
post	get
as soon as i change the method of the form from get to post everything works out fine

1460248
free	malloc
my definition of free memory is that malloc starts failing when this hits zero

1460330
stdout	stderr
i m not a java person but rather a unix one and one thing seems obvious the buffer on either stdout or stderr is filling up and then curl is blocking

1460375
mouse	keyboard
perhaps not the intended use but provides a javascript site analytics tools that can record all user mouse keyboard activity that you could correlate to the web app logs

1460443
folder	directory
the following regexp will copy all jars in the jars directory to jars_out mapping folder file .jar to folder _ file .jar

1460545
innodb	myisam
this is much more of a concern if it s a myisam table where an insert locks the table than if it s an innodb table

1460588
inherited	properties
put a constraint on your generic type define that t should inherited some kind of interface in which those properties are defined

1460614
put	get
this wouldn t normally be a get but a put

1460649
google-chrome	firefox
it worked in internet explorer but failed in firefox and google-chrome

1460694
opera	firefox
in firefox and opera the drop down menu works fine

button	checkbox
i don t need to show the eula checkbox during update and i also need to replace the create my account submit button text to something more appropriate when doing an update

1460820
subtract	add
the slowest thing you can do in math operations for as3 is repetitive casting feeding ints to a function that returns a number or performing basic operations like add and subtract on number instead of int

1460924
jboss	glassfish
tomcat jboss glassfish

1460925
stdout	stderr
stdout stderr operations will be

1460982
put	get
i got a simple answer i juste put my records that i wanted to insert in a dataset without any pk id and outside my dataflow i do a foreach loop that get foreach record a new pk id and insert it one by one

1461020
tcpdf	fpdf
however outputting to excel and pdf complicate things and require the use of fpdf or tcpdf and phpexcel

1461020
tcpdf	fpdf
pdf - fpdf tcpdf

1461044
put	get
in this case just try to put the generation into the msbuild script to get rid of the dependency thing unless visual studio accepts a reference to a solution-internal non-.net-com project

1461062
firefox	safari
i need to support ie7+ firefox and safari

1461099
int	chars
using int for ip addresses instead of chars 15 is a common optimization

put	get
under this scenario the put would succeed on the server return a 200 but the client would get an application json representation

1461156
put	get
before you hire your first qa person the product manager should put on the qa hat and be able to define the requirements and get things going with an initial test framework

1461284
post	get
these actions generally respond to http get and post requests

1461325
put	get
a restful or at least http-embracing client will know not to update its current page and that it will have to do a get in order to refresh its view of the just- put resource

1461329
hide	show
in your rowdatabound event you can hide or show the button in it

1461334
ant	maven
note that there are multiple places where you can find ant in maven s public repository

1461340
width	height
i m required to write a function to overload the operator to compare width height and colour

1461355
charindex	substr
a combination of charindex and substr should work for you

1461376
vsto	add-in
i m working on an excel add-in vsto in .net that connects to an oracle 10g database

1461376
x86	64bit
i m running on vista x64 and have figured out that i need both the x86 and x64 oracle clients installed on my machine so that both 32 bit processes like pl sql developer and 64bit processes like an example .net console app compiled for any cpu can connect to oracle

1461387
int	chars
unicode a mapping of chars to int code points in the range 0 through 1 114 111

1461387
int	chars
codepages a system in dos and windows whereby chars are assigned to int and an associated encoding

1461387
int	chars
ascii a very common assignment of chars to int and the direct encoding into bytes all high bit clear

1461403
spaces	delimiter
classic issue - call powershell functions just like you call powershell cmdlets - with spaces delimiter and no parens

1461446
next	except
create a tempwork table with the same exact structure as the final destination table except make the pk an identity n 1 where n is the next value based on the final destination table s pk

1461451
bash	zsh	bash	tcsh	zsh	tcsh
you could also download source code for virtually any shell such as bash tcsh zsh etc

1461460
put	get
after a big of googling my working theory is that the soap issue caused my users to get errors which caused them to make more requests which put an increased load on the application

1461535
post	get
then you ll need to create a new httpwebrequest this time a regular get request not a post for that url

1461560
min	max
there we have two columns min and max

1461560
min	max
the rule is min can t be greater or equal to max

1461584
getdate	dateadd
dateadd d datediff d 0 getdate 0

1461598
getter	setter
please forgive the length but here are two programs both the exact same but one with and one without setter getter and constructors

1461598
getter	setter
and now for the one without setter and getter

1461637
getter	setter
getter and setter is to provide encapsulation aka information hiding

1461662
getter	setter
the point of getter and setter regardless of language is to hide the underlying variable

1461662
getter	setter
this cannot be enforced if the field is publicly accessible and modifyable - you need the getter and setter

1461662
getter	setter
writing the getter and setter now means the interface is kept consistent so existing code won t break when you change it

1461671
getter	setter
consider how you would access public data without getter and setter

1461671
getter	setter
if you just use getter and setter from the start only where they are needed you can avoid that effort and only change your code in one place

1461675
int	chars
i believe it was one of the early pdp machines in which a chars was larger than an int

1461675
int	chars
so the system would pack multiple 9bit chars into a single int so a chars contained the address in the format of int offset inside the int

1461677
getter	setter
without the getter setter you d have to change every code everywhere that acccesses a

1461677
getter	setter
milage with the getter setter you pretty much in a perfect world atleast just have to change the creation of a milage type

1461695
cos	sin
d acos sin x1 sin x2 +cos x1 cos x2 cos y2-y1 r

1461708
getter	setter
using getter and setter gives you the flexibility to change the implementation later

1461710
vim	bbedit
i don t use bbedit but in vim you can do this

1461710
vim	bbedit	post	get
if you post this to the google group vim_use and ask for a vim solution and the corresponding perl version of it you would probably get a bunch of suggestions and something that works in bbedit and then also outside any editor in perl

1461793
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
in opera firefox google-chrome safari everything is fine but ie6 doesn t show images

1461872
packets	multicast
it seems that if i set any of the upper 16 bits of the 112-bit group id field then macos x will no longer accept those multicast packets

1461872
packets	multicast
in the doesn t work cases wireshark running on the mac shows that the mac has received the multicast packets but those packets are never passed on to the receiving application s on the mac

1461945
mp3	wav
i m interested in learning about and writing a system that will extract features from audio files mp3 wav etc which can later be used for whatever purpose

1461973
rss	feed
i m not sure about this but rss atom feed readers would use head over get to ascertain if the contents of the feed have changed

1461992
integer	unsigned
when stored as an unsigned integer a number can be expressed as the sum of powers of 2 2 0 + 2 1 +2 2 + 2 4 etc

1461992
integer	unsigned
the binary version of the unsigned integer looks like a truth map of sorts for every place there s a 1 in the binary number add that power of two to the number

1461992
integer	unsigned
so if you start at the right most digit in the binary representation of the unsigned integer and move left each digit represents a power of two

1461992
integer	unsigned
therefore to determine if a number of this format unsigned integer is odd you need only see if the right most bit is 1

1461992
integer	unsigned
the operation performed on the unsigned integer is a logical and operation

1461992
integer	unsigned
so the operation will cause all binary digits in the unsigned integer representation to be 0 except for the binary digit representing 2 0 which is 1

1461992
integer	unsigned
so the unsigned integer binary representation will boil down to 0x00000001 if it s odd and 0x00000000 if it s even

1461992
integer	unsigned
written out in binary the resulting possible unsigned integer binary representations after and ing the unsigned integer are

1462018
int	chars
it seems nhibernate is convering my chars to an int somewhere along the way

1462030
button	checkbox
i am dynamically inserting controls textboxes checkbox expression validators and button on to my page

1462037
profiling	benchmarking
use as many placeholders as you feel you need go benchmarking profiling the page code then finally optimise accordingly using whatever technique is most suitable

1462056
trie	tree
a patricia trie is like a regular tree except that branches in a patricia trie occur only when there are at least two different keys sharing a prefix that haven t been separated by a previous branch

1462056
children	parent
all children of a node share the parent s prefix

1462115
post	get
javascript disabled i get access to the following post variables

1462157
gridview	linqdatasource
i m using a gridview and a linqdatasource to view the categories table

1462222
post	get
naturally you can t make a post request using a script element the browser would fetch the result using get

1462254
required	placeholder
first of all placeholder themselves are an extremely lightweight control that generate no additional markup and required very little processing by asp.net

1462291
gif	bmp
bmp and gif formats

1462330
disk	ram
i thought of using a ram disk to keep the file but there must be some better solution

1462340
datamapper	activerecord
i want to use the ruby-way of data access that i ve come to love from products such as activerecord datamapper and sequel

1462354
django-haystack	django-sphinx
there are projects for both search frameworks that integrate them with django django-haystack and django-sphinx respectively

1462375
pem	pkcs#12
pkcs#12 certificate is stored in binary format while pem certificate is an ascii file which can be opened and viewed in a text editor

1462395
sys.path	argparse
as kevin horn pointed out you can use argparse installable via easy_install argparse or just grab argparse.py and put it anywhere in your sys.path

1462424
getter	setter
accessor methods setter and getter attempt to hide the details about how the data in an object is stored

1462424
tiff	png
it is time consuming to abstract the type from the specific png jpeg tiff eps to the general image document spreadsheet

1462443
int	boolean
you can use bitvector32 to manipulate bits in a 32 bit int and bitarray to have an array of bits representing a set of boolean variables

1462451
google-chrome	firefox
this worked for me in firefox and google-chrome and ie8.

1462455
getter	setter
yes all those getter and setter bloat the code and add no value in that case

1462455
getter	setter
characteristics of useful sensible uses of getter and setter

1462455
getter	setter
getter and setter only for fields for which they re actually needed - as few as possible most fields should be private and used only within their class

1462455
getter	setter
getter and setter that actually do something besides accessing a fied setter that throw exceptions for invalid values or update a last modified timestamp or a getter that computes a value on the fly rather than relying on an underlying field

1462494
post	get
sounds like you are looking to do a post redirect get

1462494
post	get
the two main advantages of redirecting a post to a get request are

1462496
maven	cargo
the maven cargo plugin can be used to deploy the applications

1462533
portrait	landscape
i ve used this page layout successfully for iphone landscape and portrait

1462572
inherited	properties
one way to do this is to create a new class that inherited treenode and that features an enabled properties

1462577
pecl	pear
the difference being that pear packages a sets of classes written in php while pecl extensions are generally written in c and loaded as.

1462581
put	get
i m not sure why but whenever i put that line in my script i get blank screen

1462618
client-side	server-side
use unique security token for each connection with client save security token on server-side session and compare with client-side stored value

1462624
ubuntu	debian
debian ubuntu

1462733
octree	quadtree
this visibility culling can be accelerated using a variety of data structures octree quadtree sphere trees bsp trees generally more suited to less open environments rather than landscapes etc

1462733
children	parent
some hierarchical organization of your scene will again help with occlusion culling as if a parent object is occluded you can skip tests for it s children

1462735
getter	setter
the other answers generally give a good idea of some reasons for using getter and setter but i want to give a somewhat complete example of why they are useful

1462735
getter	setter
initially you decide to store it as a string with no getter and setter

1462735
getter	setter
here are some issues with not using getter and setter

1462735
getter	setter
how getter and setter solve this

1462739
put	get
if you re committed to making it work then put some serious thought into the root of the problems you re having and get him on board with helping you solve them

1462774
move	drag
since i haven t added a handle i want the hole content of the div to drag it when you use de scroll bar the div move draggs..

1462782
postgresql	mysql
mysql does not support create domain or create type as for example postgresql does

1462788
explode	implode
implode is explode s counterpart to go from array back to string

1462797
accessor	ivar
also if you have an nsmutablearray ivar somemutablearray and you return in a kvc accessor method it can mess up kvo

1462805
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
add a div inside your div width height 100 no margin no padding and put your content there

1462811
hide	show
if you hide reshow the window after calling setwindowlong it then show in the taskbar

1462837
int	chars
the key is that chars is an int type which is why you can switch on a chars so you can use numeric comparison operators

1462887
nullreferenceexception	argumentnullexception
so nullreferenceexception argumentnullexception and the like shouldn t be caught unless they re due to a nasty api which sometimes throws exceptions which you can handle but which shouldn t really be being thrown in the first place

1462919
google-chrome	firefox
in case this matters i tried the form in various browsers ie8 ie7 ie6 firefox 3.5 google-chrome with similar results each time

1462974
bash	zsh
to delete them with some bash zsh magic

1462986
folder	directory
unfortunately itunes won t tell you where its download folder is so i ve written a function that grabs the filepath of a few podcast tracks and climbs back up the directory tree until it finds the downloads directory

1463018
ubuntu	linux
i have a large several gb berkeley db that i am thinking of migrating from windows 2k to linux either redhat or ubuntu

1463023
disk	ram
more ram will help as will using solid state disk

1463028
equals	compareto
you need to be rather careful with caching results of methods like compareto and equals

1463028
equals	compareto
if i was doing this i d first profile the application to determine if the compareto and equals methods are really bottlenecks

1463080
min	max
for example sum min max count last etc .

1463101
width	height
i wrapped both within another div and gave it a set width and height

1463184
width	height
d3dxcreatetexturefromfileex allows you to specify flags that prevent any internal conversions happening d3dx_default_nonpow2 for image width and height if your hardware supports non power of two textures d3dfmt_from_file to prevent mipmap generation or format conversion d3dx_filter_none to prevent any filtering or scaling

1463254
clang	llvm
clang llvm has much better separation between the parser and the other parts of the compiler chain

1463267
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this only works in firefox safari google-chrome but not ie - please help

1463293
nginx	lighttpd	apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx
i m curious to know what are the performance impacts of using http basic auth on a webserver like apache or lighttpd or nginx

1463310
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the page works perfectly fine in firefox google-chrome and safari with not speed issues sluggishness whatsoever

1463339
comparator	comparable
if the set contains custom classes you have to implement hashcode to use hashset although effective java shows how but if you use a treeset you have to make it comparable or supply a comparator

1463339
treemap	treeset
i have sometimes used treeset or actually treemap for very small sets maps 10 items although i have not checked to see if there is any real gain in doing so

1463401
interpolation	splines
you can also use splines to interpolation - just search in wikipedia

1463416
jsf	seam
if you just go for bookmarkable you still have to carefully design how you link things together in your jsf pages and flows although seam 2.2 added some features to make this easier

1463423
submit	submission
i m using this jquery validation script to submit my form s but i need some help tweaking it to display the message and to show the form again after submission

1463425
getter	setter
and the habit of making the getter and setter the same function is confusing and here results in the bug.

1463468
post	get
please see my blog post to learn what it s about and where to get it

1463487
int	chars
in cobol you had to declare variables such that you actually had to say how many digits there were in a number year 99 declared the variable year such that it could only hold two decimal digits so yes it was an easier to make that mistake than in c were you would have int or short or chars as the year and still have plenty of room for years greater than 99

1463532
hide	show
can you not simply show it and then hide the original

1463550
min	max
you can use functions like max min and sum on fields to get a merged view when using group by

1463556
client-side	server-side
this could be performed either client-side less advantageous or server-side a better pick

1463566
versioning	upgrade
it may require a versioning upgrade though

1463637
stateless	stateful
our project uses the wicket web framework which allows stateful or stateless interaction

1463637
stateless	stateful
anything that s possible in a stateful application could also be implemented as stateless - you simply have to store the state on the client and submit all relevant state information on every request

1463639
post	get
if anyone finds a way to get this working without resorting to exdate please post and i ll be sure to check back periodically and mark the correct answer

1463696
cvs	svn
i ve got ide 6.7 installed and it comes with subversion svn cvs and mercurial

1463700
post	get
method get or post

1463714
hash	md5
if it matters the cached file is an md5 hash off a key value in the links table

1463746
post	put
that snippet of code apart from customizations i put in for my own app came from this post on ruby-forum.com

1463756
lapply	tapply
i m really surprised no one has posted about apply tapply lapply and sapply

1463756
lapply	tapply	do.call	tapply	do.call	lapply
remember use apply sapply lapply tapply and do.call

1463776
folder	directory
each application has to have their own folder and virtual directory and a web.config specific to only that application

1463778
width	height
resizing to a particular height and or width maintaining aspect ratio is far more common and expected by users

1463778
width	height
the ratio needs to be the square root of the file size ratios as you re applying it twice once to height once to width

1463793
post	get
you could use the post redirect get approach depending on how your application works to ensure users always land on a get after submitting their form so you always have a valid state to go back to

1463812
mvp	presenter
it s mvp wherein the presenter is a mediator

1463945
swt	swing
i ve personally ended up using swing swt + jruby

1464018
post	get
since the screens would have a get and post action with post returning a view if there was a validation error we d be duplicating code and making viewmodels larger than they probably should be

1464110
webrat	cucumber
i am learning cucumber and webrat with rails and would like some advice on the best way to test an edit form

1464118
folder	directory
i created an extensions folder in my eclipse directory and dropped it in there

1464168
vim	emacs
better integration wrt the motley collection of plugins for powerful-but-not-ide editors such as vim and emacs

1464168
vim	emacs
- and i stand in awe of my emacs er colleagues have to ack that no matter how incredibly powerful vim is emacs is a notch above

1464188
pull	push
and i want to be able to update them via git push or git pull

1464198
unsigned	short
for example even though unsigned short and wchar_t are the same size on windows i think using wchar_t instead of unsigned short shows the intention that you will use it to store a wide character rather than just some arbitrary number

1464216
post	get
you would probably get better mileage by getting a good working set of instructions on how to configure https w a self signed certs and then create your own internal post test pages

1464230
128bit	64bit
perhaps 128bit distributed-system internet-wide pointers but no more than 64bit in a system call or perhaps even a legacy 32-bit limit

1464238
daemons	systemd
this number is liable to increase and decrease depending on the virtual memory demands of the systemd services daemons and applications running on the machine

1464267
hash	md5
in the old days the last time i wrote code for this i could just store previous md5 hash and compare new ones to that list

1464267
hash	salt
well now that i am using salt hash where the salt is unique each time those comparisons are no longer possible as the previous salt are no longer known

1464267
hash	salt
to make that system work i have two choices store a history of the salt in addition to the final hash or reuse the same salt for any one given user with each password update

1464274
hash	salt
reusing the same salt means that if a user is explicitly targeted by a hacker they could produce a password to hash dictionary using the user s salt - so that even if the user changes their password the hacker will still immediately know the new password without any extra work

1464274
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
as for storing the md5 hash plus salt - presumably you re already storing the salt + hash in order to validate the user s current password

1464274
hash	salt
if you don t know the salt ahead of time when preparing a dictionary attack then in order to prepare a dictionary for all 8 character human passwords you need to hash 62 12 concatenated passwords

1464279
short	base
short of that you could still configure your tomcat server to pick up your web applications from wherever you want by specifying appropriate document base in either server.xml or your webapp s context.xml

1464294
hash	salt
another reason for using salt in password hash is to hide the fact that two users use the same password not unusual

1464299
hash	md5
firstly stop using md5 if you are using it and use sha-2 md5 sha-0 and sha-1 are all dead hash

1464356
post	get
in contrast to classic asp.net it is harder to get the value with every post

1464356
put	get	post	put	post	get
you have to put the textbox into a every form to get the value in every post - no solution

1464357
ant	maven
you can try using ant or maven

1464374
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
my asp.net application only comes out properly if i am previewing it in internet explorer but its the ugliest thing ever if i view in firefox google-chrome or safari

1464402
google-chrome	firefox
i d advise using firefox as your development browser while testing in ie and google-chrome as well

1464412
uicontrol	uibutton
if you want to do it without uibutton say either with uicontrol or as a view then you could take a shot of your button create a suitable glow in a graphic editing app like photoshop and then add that image to your nib

1464430
hash	salt
i might be being incredibly dim here but where would you store the salt that would be inaccessable to someone with enough access to get the hash password

1464476
free	malloc
most likely malloc allocates more memory and puts so-called guard values that happen to contain null bytes or it puts some metadata to be used by free later and this metadata happens to contain a null byte right at that position

1464483
super	self
self super init

1464500
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
as dove suggests it s best to use a relatively standards compliant browser to do your development work firefox opera google-chrome or safari and then tweak to make it work in ie 6 7 8 afterwards

1464529
serializable	deserialization
from serializable api however it is strongly recommended that all serializable classes explicitly declare serialversionuid values since the default serialversionuid computation is highly sensitive to class details that may vary depending on compiler implementations and can thus result in unexpected invalidclassexceptions during deserialization

1464543
rss	feed
just wondering if someone could suggest a php library that would allow me to read the data of an rss feed and write it to a mysql database

1464564
hide	show
for eg consider a situation where you have a show hide div and when you click on the div it should opne and if you click anywhere else in the document it should close

1464581
rss	feed
once you ve used magpie to grab an rss feed you can store it in a string a save to a db as you would with any other string

1464637
pull	push
from the client end i d constantly pull from the repository make changes and push back

1464640
boost	stl
not in the stl i think the boost versions may let you do it but i am not sure

1464648
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
this is how i manually call viewwillappear viewdidappear viewwilldisappear viewdiddisappear here

1464648
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
and one of the view controllers i load this way has the following viewwillappear note that this is viewwillappear since at the point that viewdidappear is called your view is viewable by the user

1464651
hash	md5
a more secure aproach is to store some kind of hash value usualy an md5 hash of your password

1464673
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
it looks normally with firefox opera safari ..

1464737
equals	gethashcode	equals	tostring	tostring	gethashcode
however at each step after a dot intellisense pops up showing the four standard methods from the object class gethashcode equals gettype and tostring

1464749
hide	show
dpm is a function that devel has defined it creates a nice visual representation of the variable where you click to show hide the values inside arrays and class objects

1464754
luabind	tolua++
such tools already exist tolua++ luabind and possibly many others

1464767
mouseup	mouseleave
ok you want to ensure that whenever your mouseleave those images then your mouseup event fires

1464788
inherited	properties
the host app defines an attribute called descriptionattribute which inherited from exportattribute and has a simple name properties

1464789
put	get
don t put them into a list but write them into the file as you get them from the db

1464806
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
for some reason the beforesubmitfn works in firefox however in internet explorer safari and google-chrome it doesn t work at all

1464831
put	get
which is a lot more concise plus you don t get into the dilemma of whether to put the delegate in the .cs file for the class that contains the event or the eventargs derived class

1464850
superclass	subclassing
if you have a superclass a with subclassing b c etc. that all have similar functionality you want to do the following

1464865
vbscript	vb6
one of my guys had a problem when instantiating internetexplorer.application from vb6 and vbscript

1464902
int	chars
this is because to_string will run on each element of the list and then the list will be concatenated with spaces as_a will however convert int to chars and concatenate them giving you the hello word

1464944
fastcgi	scgi
many newer interfaces like fastcgi and scgi inherit the way that cgi passes http headers and other variables to the web application and back

1465010
google-chrome	firefox
if i click on them in firefox or google-chrome nothing happens - it doesn t even try to open them

1465066

each build file imports the parent build file and each child inherited and overrides parent tasks properties

1469799
int	chars
that because you re assigning a chars pointer to your int

1469806
int	chars
since the chars data type is treated similar to an int data type in c and c++ you could go with some thing like

1469813
apache	lighttpd
i don t have thorough benchmarks but i m personally convinced that just like lighttpd can outperform apache on simpler tasks mod_wsgi gives apache the laurel when it comes to serving python web apps

1469813
apache	nginx
nginx with its own mod_wsgi seems to perform even better than apache but hey you didn t ask about that

only happens here and there and so far i haven t noticed anything wrong in how the page is rendered on ie7 ie8 firefox 3.5 and google-chrome 3

1469926
onmousedown	onmousemove
to prevent selection of elements in page just return false from your functions onmousedown onmousemove

1469938

1469966
bison	lemon
i ve done several flex bison systems myself but now i d replace both with lemon from sqlite since it s one tool re-entrant and thread safe as well as having a streaming pull-based model

1470013
mouse	keyboard
i don t like listening to either keyboard or mouse events explicitly because there s more than one way to change a selection if someone is holding down shift and hitting a down-arrow you won t get a mouse event

1470063
cvs	svn
we are moving to svn and need to prevent commits to specific directories modules within the cvs repository

1470105
integer	fractions
if both are int and the result comes to be a fractions you will only see integer part of it

1470108
disk	ram
ah but even if i build a system to quickly move chunks of data to from disk ram and do some caching -to replace the db- that won t do because i still need transactions so that the rest of the server functionality can work in parallel

1470198
pull	push
i think this is just a generic argue about what is better push or pull model

1470234
dundas	componentart
nevron chart has at least as many features as dundas chart and the image quality of componentart - but is much faster

1470275
aggregate-functions	sum
you should learn how to use aggregate-functions in sql like sum and group by any book on sql should include this and also techniques of storing hierarchical relationships of entities

1470296
hide	show
when the read more link is clicked have your script show the whole string and hide the read more link

1470337
pull	push
pushing into main master repository would then via hook either push into those two slave repositories where their hooks would do git reset --hard or equivalent or go to those two slave repositories and do a git pull from master there

1470502
children	parent
now we session.delete parent and all the children are cascade removed from the database but humans.myallhumans collection s cache is not updated

1470547
onclick	onsubmit
if i understand you correctly all you need is to add your own caching functions into onsubmit of all forms and onclick of all links smth like

1470574
subtract	add
i have a javascript function changetotal referer value which should determine if the product was just selected and add subtract the product price from a total

getter	setter
step 4 in the action make the getter and setter of object names of the left and right sides take strings and not string arrays

1470646
for-loop	loops
i is reset at every iteration of loops as it s not declared locally in the for-loop but globally eventually resulting in infinite loops

1470652
gridview	rowdatabound
and in the code-behind i catch on to the rowdatabound event in which i handle some links and properties inside the gridview cells

1470744
pull	push
the juniors can periodically push to their respective branches which the leads will pull and review

1470744
squash	branch
instead of including all the trivial screw ups in the history of the project the leads can choose to squash several commits together and then integrate the branch into the mainline

1470753
width	height
i have used a resizable custom component inside griditem and now the griditem sets its width and height same as custom component

1470756

i ve actually inherited the timer class to give it an index properties the eventargs as well

1470767
fast-forward	merge
after the merge should be fast-forward

1470788

so the answer to your question is that your compareto method or your comparator are defined so that the two objects in question are considered equals

1470798
equals	compareto
it explains the equals contract and how to properly override equals hashcode and compareto

1470802
firefox	safari
this works well within firefox ie7 8 safari but it crashes ie6

1470814
put	get
for a simple property with get and set you can just put this in the class definition on its own

1470820
filtering	grouping
your where clause filtering these rows out returns null and they don t get into the grouping by

1470829
ready	each
you can combine all of them into one there is not much reason for you to be wrapping each of those calls in its own document ready event handler

1470833
folder	directory
more precisely you define your output directory say bin as a linked folder then you set that directory as the official output one of your project

1470836
firefox	safari
unfortunately unless you re happy with supporting only specific browsers ie7 win safari firefox 3.5 there s no pure css solution to your problem

1470836
client-side	server-side
if you re able to alter the text either server-side php asp or possibly client-side javascript you could write a small function that inserts shy hyphens shy

1470875
button	checkbox
i am having a uiwebview showing and html page that has some checkbox radio button

1470880
try-catch	exception-handling
my guess is that they didn t because db2sqlca.getmessage can throw nasty exception-handling so you must wrap it in try-catch

opml	feed
we currently have some c# code that runs and imports data from a number of opml feed and stores it in several sql server tables

1471015
pop-up	dialog
those cms are probably just calling the javascript method window.print to pop-up the print dialog

1471083
width	height
i d like the flowlayoutpanel to automatically adjust its width or height depending on number of controls inside of it

1471090
clang	llvm
for c c++ etc gcc 4.5 will allow plugins for people to write their own extensions and clang from llvm is designed for this too

1471093
vb6	vba
for the time being office products are stuck with the old vba visual basic for applications which is based on the old vb6 and earlier versions of visual basic which are based upon com rather than the .net framework

1471093
vb6	vba
because of all of this you will either need to call out to the win32 api to access the csp functions or you will have to roll-your-own encryption method in pure vb6 vba code although this is likely to be less secure

1471108
stdout	stderr
when running in daemon mode twistd will close stdin stdout and stderr

1471143
disk	ram
the cache ram hard disk is abstracted as virtual memory

1471167
min	max
min and max are special cases since they don t require scanning the whole group only the first and the last value of the aggregated column within the group

1471167
min	max
while simple max and min without group by clause use a top method if the index on the aggregated column is present min and max with group by use same methods as other aggregate functions do

1471174
pull	push
once the tcp connection is established it s a 2-way channel you can pull or push as long as your protocol allows it

put the image inside a div in the table cell and make the width and height of the div to be 100 of the td and style it to overflow auto

1471255
codeigniter	cakephp
in a full stack framework like cakephp i don t reallt know codeigniter you are locked inside

1471268
getter	setter
the only workaround i can think of is to mark the char field with xmltransient and then write getter and setter which get and set the value as a string

1471285
int	chars
when comparing int to chars mysql converts the latter to the former not vice versa

1471285
int	chars
compare chars with chars not int

1471326
codeigniter	cakephp
it beats the pants off of pretty much any other framework i ve used - zend symfony cakephp and codeigniter

1471378
unsigned	short	int	chars	int	double
well i don t know about uint32_t but for the fundamental types bool chars signed chars unsigned chars wchar_t short unsigned short int unsigned int long unsigned long float double and long double you should use the numeric_limits templates via

1471387
multiplying	subtract
subtract 0.5 giving you a new range of 0 - 0.5 then multiplying by 2

1471396
ssl	https
if your fear is that a man-in-the-middle attack between you and the user is going to leak the contents of the documents the only solution is to use https ssl

1471420
post	get
this awesome blog post explains how to get it set up quickly basically you let vpc set up a com port as a named pipe enable kernel debug mode on the virtualized os and connect to it while it is booting

1471467
actualheight	actualwidth
of course i m using a little bit of pseudo code here for actualwidth and actualheight .

1471472
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
here s another that focuses on window.name only which actually works in opera 9+ ie6+ firefox 1.5+ safari 3 i think

then select the top x of the population and use those as the parents of the next generation where offspring are created via mutation which you have or genetic crossover swap rows or columns between two brains

1471570
integer	unsigned
declare selectedid integer unsigned

1471654
hash	md5
i have passwords stored in a database using md5 and was wondering if there was a way to reverse the hash to email the user s password to him in case they forget it

1471660
hash	md5
this means that if someone manages to get the list of md5 hash they still can t get your password

1471663
hash	md5
md5 is a hashing algorithm you can not revert the hash value

1471668
hash	md5
you don t want to reverse an md5 hash

1471668
hash	md5
reversing md5 is actually considered malicious - a few websites offer the ability to crack and bruteforce md5 hash - but all they are are massive databases containing dictionary words previously submitted passwords and other words

1471668
hash	md5
there is a very small chance that it will have the md5 hash you need reversed

1471668
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
and if you ve salt the md5 hash - this won t work either

1471668
hash	md5
user creates password - password is hash using md5 - hash stored in database

1471668
hash	md5
user enters username and password - username checked password is hash using md5 - hash is compared with stored hash in database

1471720
hash	salt
also this will not work for salt hash

1471755
for-loop	loops
you ll want to have the outer loops of your nested for-loop allocate each of the n sub-arrays

1471775
hide	show
this means you don t have to wait for postbacks and you just hide a div and show the next one

1471809
hash	md5
md5 has its weaknesses see wikipedia so there are some projects which try to precompute hash

1471822
subtract	add
subtract the time from your timestamps before putting them into the database and add the time to the timestamps when you get them back out

1471935
super	self
it is also important that each initializer assigns the the result from the super initializer to self

1471982
trojan	virus
summary malicious users can buy a few dozen flash drives load them with an auto-run virus or trojan then sprinkle said flash drives in a company s parking lot late at night

1471998
expression-blend	silverlight
much like the way wp-coda works but i wan to do this in expression-blend which uses silverlight

1472013
put	get
that means that anything you put into there you can get to

1472037
int	chars
chars seemingly requires three int for representation 226 128 147

1472110
post	get
if they can post from different pcs you should make sure that the server says what the current time is user pcs can quickly get out of sync

1472169
coldfusion	railo
there s enough free engines railo smith openbluedragon that you can load into tomcat instances or use something like stax to put a coldfusion app into the cloud

1472173
post	get
you can get the auto_increment_id the same way as you d do to get the value for username and title of post

1472176
hide	show
in particular i want to hide the main top navigation bar the search functionality and the label that show up in the upper-left-hand corner that tells you the name of the site you are on

1472193
width	height
the july 09 source code shows the default width and height to be 8 so i m not sure setting them to 10 would make them smaller

1472241
accessor	properties
we use it to inject our own aspects persistent properties accessor construction notifiers session transaction activators etc. in dataobjects.net

1472264
width	height
i have the original image the x and y co-ordinates of where on that image i want the cropping to being and the width and height of the new cropped image

1472264
width	height
but when the image is acutally saved it s a small image of the correct height and width but is completely empty

1472271
pthreads	fork
on pthreads one of the steps involved in daemonization is fork and having the parent exit

1472340
client-side	server-side
you ll want to use the comparevalidator for that and since .nets drag drop validators provide both client-side and server-side validation you re covered

1472383
profiling	debugging
the pb call blocks until the profiling browser is exited note just closing the window with the wm destroy button doesn t seem to cause it to return - only the exit menu item seems to so your server is hung until you dismiss the window but for debugging purposes that seems like it may be fine

1472446
disk	ram
oh disk activity was pure writing as everything is cached in ram

1472481
mouse	keyboard
if you are in a web browser you can t fake real input events like keyboard and mouse events for security reasons

1472526
metaclass	superclass
every object has a class in a variable named isa as in â œthis instance is a snowtireâ and every class has a superclass and a metaclass

1472527
hash	md5
connect.registerusers uses i believe merely the normal md5 hash as implemented in the .net runtime

1472614
perforce	svn
you could use your source control to help you a little if it does branching easily git svn or perforce would work great

1472619
int	chars
the c is the format string for a single chars and d for a digit int

1472619
int	chars
by casting the chars to an int you ll get the ascii value

1472633
rss	feed
the idea is that it periodically fetches an rss feed and creates a toaster-popup when there are new feed

1472661
ant	maven
i think git has the ability to define pre-checkin hooks but there are also ant targets maven plug-ins and ide functions plugins that will do the automatic formatting in an out-of-your-way manner

1472683
maven	pom.xml
now you ll need to create a pom.xml which will tell maven how to build your project

1472690
rss	feed
perfect for displaying an rss feed i am using it for a similar purpose

1472703
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
this works in firefox 3 internet explorer 8 internet explorer 8 compatibility mode opera and safari

1472767
rss	feed
i m trying to parse a rss feed using c# and i need to transform it with xslt

1472794
slideup	slidedown
thanks for these application of slideup and slidedown

1472794
hide	show
an important remark it doesn t work under ie7 and ie8 if you don t set a width for the div you want to show or hide

1472803
folder	directory
basically as part of our build process we copy over a set of directory that contain a bunch of other nested directory containing various xml and data and when we move the location for that data our copy and checkin build process doesn t really work and because we are checking into another source control svn wiping out the directory and copying over isn t really an option either we d be blowing away the .svn folder

1472842
google-chrome	safari
but in google-chrome and safari the reported offsettop seems well incorrect

1472842
google-chrome	firefox
and loaded it in firefox and google-chrome

1472842
google-chrome	firefox
both browser report the wrapper span as its offsetparent but for firefox the offsettop is -8 and for google-chrome it is 2

1472850
post	get
the project is sponsored by sun and may soon get orphaned in the post oracle days

1472862
perl	tcl
expect either with the tcl or perl implementation s would be my first attempt

1472876
int	double
the server receives the pickled int unpickles it double it then pickles it and sends it back to the client

1472878
width	height
i have a uiscrollview that s around 600 pixels in height and 320 in width

1472908
public	protected
in the case of the static method php has to check wether the method can or cannot be called from the calling context public protected private

1472915
isnull	nvl	coalesce	isnull	coalesce	nvl
i already tried isnull coalesce nvl nz

1472920
floating-point	integer
i don t know why it s lowercase for long integer types and uppercase for floating-point

1472942
int	boolean
the idea that is an operation just like + except that it returns a boolean rather than an int is one of those simple but powerful ideas that have great ramifications .

1472970
decoder	encoder
mochiweb has a json encoder decoder and php has native json support

1472983
gridview	linqdatasource
i have a gridview that is using a linqdatasource which is tied to a table in my database

1472983
hide	show
in my presentation layer using templatefield in gridview i hide the foreign key value and make another call to the database to show the name of it s associated name so it s more readable for the user

1473026
clang	llvm
try using the llvm clang static analyser for details see this link

1473033
folder	directory
if it is not sufficient to completely clear the target location use defaultexcludes false to ensure the .svn folder are deleted you could try writing a custom ant task to traverse the file system below the target deleting empty directory as you move back up from each leaf

1473036
nsbutton	nspopupbutton
it s all entirely custom view code involving nspopupbutton s and nsbutton s and nstextfield s

1473049
jquery	scriptaculous
scriptaculous got it right with queue and scope where jquery on the other hand has .queue and .animate that are basically useless combined

1473049
jquery	scriptaculous
the only thing jquery is good for out of the box is pushing some style attributes around on the dom whereas scriptaculous covers the whole spectrum of what s possible with effects

1473107
sorting	filtering
i have a qstandarditemmodel with several 100 000 records of data and a qsortfilterproxymodel on top of it for filtering and sorting capabilities

1473140
std	ostream
in mingw the simplest solution is to use c++ s std ostream since that uses the gnu library and does support long double

1473168
width	height
you shouldn t need the explicit auto width height that s the default

1473265
post	get
it s getting url encoded because your request formed with httpclient may be a get request instead of a post and is missing this header

1473265
post	get
look for the httpclient setting to set the content-type header correctly and make sure your request is a post not a get and you should be golden

1473288
rss	feed
private rss feed support for security in aggregators

1473288
rss	feed
he offers summaries of various rss feed clients they may be a bit dated by now

1473297
google-chrome	safari
so the problem is browsers safari google-chrome do not show spaces in ajax-loaded html content after tags like strong em etc

1473324
pbkdf2	salt	pbkdf2	hash	hash	salt
a pbkdf2 password hash should contain the salt the number of iterations and the hash itself so it s possible to verify later

1473324
pbkdf2	salt
that s the number of iterations in lowercase hexadecimal the urlsafe_base64 encoded salt and the urlsafe_base64 encoded pbkdf2 output

1473324
pbkdf2	salt
the salt should be 64 bits the number of iterations should be at least 1000 and the pbkdf2 with hmac-sha1 output can be any length

1473394
filesystems	fat
in particular usb mass-storage devices are generally formatted as with fat filesystems which do not support links

1473402
pbkdf2	salt	pbkdf2	hash	hash	salt
there is a specification for the parameters salt and iterations of pbkdf2 but it doesn t include the hash

1473402
pbkdf2	hash
since pbkdf2 is really a key derivation function it doesn t make sense for it to specify a way to bundle the hash which is the really a derived key together with the derivation parameters mdash

1473414
hide	show
is it possible to show and hide 2 different datepickers

1473440
integer	unsigned
the code gets to the point where it does the read of the response and it takes what should be a 4 bytes and converts it to a 32 bit unsigned integer so it can be converted to unix time

1473452
jsf	wicket
tomcat jetty etc are basically web servers that contain servlets and therefore jsp jsf wicket etc etc processors for dynamically generating content

1473457
min	max
once extracted all the neighbors for that pixel we set the output image pixel to the maximum of that list max intensity for dilation and min for erosion of course this only work for grayscale images and binary mask

1473486
google-chrome	firefox
this only occurs on https pages and only in firefox and google-chrome

1473486
google-chrome	firefox
why does it only occur on https pages and only in firefox and google-chrome

1473496
google-chrome	firefox
similarly when i try to take over the key for my own purposes it works splendidly in firefox but my event doesn t fire in google-chrome or ie8 and the default action for the tab fires instead

1473584
width	height
using yui 2 on page load i found all elements of that given classname that were either set to display none or whose height and width was 0 that s one way of measuring whether an element exists or a parent is set to display none

1473610
hide	show
use z-index to hide element under non-transparent element show it and get height

1473613
put	get
i strongly recommend that you try to get this working in a console app which will be much easier to debug than a servlet then put it into a servlet environment

1473641
innodb	myisam
does innodb support the type of query i have for myisam

1473657
hide	show
to overcome that you can create a special moss page that hide all those elements and show just the element you want to expose

1473700
getter	setter
note that there is both a getter and a setter for your compositdict object

1473700
getter	setter
this is why i also changed your registered method to get_shared instead of get_comp as you will want access to the setter as well as the getter within your consumer class

1473727
stdout	stderr
you need to consume the output streams concurrently otherwise either your stdout or stderr buffer will fill up and your child process will block

1473745
haskell	ocaml
besides java there s groovy scala clojure a lisp dialect on the jvm jruby ruby on the jvm jython python on the jvm jaskell haskell on the jvm fan runs on the jvm as well as the .net clr and lots more and there s also an ocaml-java ocaml that runs on the jvm

1473769
hex	binary
save the binary in a format you are capable or willing to write a program to read intel hex perhaps or elf if they support that

1473773
svg	vml
just wondering if anybody has come across a tool or anything to make the process easier of converting vml to svg or some other modern format silverlight flash

1473773
svg	vml
would also be helpful if there was a chart to map vml markup to svg in table format as a cheat sheet or something

1473778
svg	vml
vector converter claims to convert between svg and vml among other formats

1473782
junit	jmock	scalatest	jmock
scalatest specs and scalacheck are top quality frameworks compatible between themselves and compatible with other java frameworks and libraries such as junit and jmock

1473791
perl	tcl
i tis the camel book to steal a perl idiom of tcl tk

1473813
client-side	server-side
this client-side meta-language will later be translated to an server-side sql query

1473824
maven	pom.xml
you might also try running the help effective-pom plugin to see if there are any differences in the pom.xml that maven resolves

1473900
pop-up	dialog
i have to use click_no_wait due to a dialog box that ie pop-up on a certain page so that another ruby thread can close it

1473910
distutils	buildout
to learn more about buildout you can watch videos from pycon 2009 on setuptools distutils and buildout

1473925
ilist	icollection	ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	idictionary	ienumerable	icollection	idictionary	ilist	idictionary	icollection
judging by the source code it seems that it will bind to a model that is a generic type of ienumerable icollection ilist or idictionary but it won t bind on a model s property that is of a generic type

webclient	httpwebrequest
the webclient is a very dumbed down wrapper for httpwebrequest

1473931
width	height
not exactly sure what i did but i think the containing div wasn t auto sizing to the size of the silverlight content when viewing in ie7 my content was visible so i set manual height width to the div and now i can view in firefox ie8

1473961
int	double
a problem would be that i think the function expects the second argument distguess to be a double precision instead of an int

1474045
webrat	cucumber
but i can t easily access link_to from my cucumber step and i can t figure out any reasonable way of pointing webrat at the right checkbox short of kludging up a whole bunch of hyperlink code in my step which makes it very brittle

1474052
mp3	flac
a modified version of a shell script converts an audio file from flac to mp3 format

1474052

this converts the flac files in the flac directory no spaces in file names to mp3 files in the mp3 directory at the same level as flac

1474054
gif	png
thanks to beta for pointing out the mess with gif png extensions

1474059
profiler	gprof
it s worth noting this is definitely not as clear as the callers profile you may get from gprof or another profiler as the numbers it reports is the number of times oprofile collected a sample in which x is the caller for a given function not the number of times x called a given function

1474066
inherited	subclassing
update 2016 as per stan s answer below modern versions of django let you set on the genericstackedinline subclassing as it inherited from inlinemodeladmin

1474105
post	get
s he is redirected to login post his credentials is redirected back as get to the original page products 0332425

1474127
post	get
i would suggest unobtrusive js so if someone doesn t have js on then it will work as a link doing a get submission but if they have js then it would change the behavior to be post with no ugly url change

1474129
gcov	gprof	profiler	gprof
in addition to the aforementioned gprof profiler you may also try the gcov code-coverage tool

1474136

1474225
microchip	dspic
16-bit pic microcontrollers microchip pic24 and dspic are examples of harvard architecture devices with different data and code space pointer sizes

1474263

other than getting the actual logic worked out correctly stã phane s suggestions all good you might also want to fflush stderr after fprintf-ing to ensure your error messages make it out right away instead of being buffered

1474267
bazaar	git
you ll definitely need to start using a version control system if you aren t already - some good options are git exceptionally fast and full featured or bazaar much slower but easier to use

1474272
rss	feed
i have a model for representing rss feed that is being loaded from a url

1474286
sorting	grouping
one example i m commonly seeing is the discussion of what should the database do joins sorting grouping vs

1474289
min	max
when we use sql server this is relatively straight forward - a call to dbcc freeproccache clears all of the counters before a suite begins then at test end we run a query against sys.dm_exec_query_stats which gives us access to the execution counts and min max total time s of each cached query plan with hooks available to retrieve the parameterized sql statement we use forced parametrization in our mssql instances and the query plan

1474319
cvs	svn
i recommend either svn subversion or cvs

if the class foo is serializable as a root element things behave fine and as expected - the jeznamespace xmlns is applied to the root foo element and deserialization occurs fine

1474507
post	get
the post controller has an authorize attribute and the get part of the action checks to see if the post was made by the user

since you only get to the view on if you are allowed to edit the post at this point i would think all you need to do is check to see if the post came from your site

1474544
packets	multicast
as an example when i join the multicast group on sb i start receiving data on that socket from sa s multicast packets

1474631

it s slighty less verbose because it uses a parent bean definition to configure common properties inherited by child beans

1474670
vsto	add-in
although your vsto add-in is technically a dll that is being loaded into excel it operates more like a top-level exe rather than as a dll library exposed to other callers

1474670
vsto	add-in
the process is discussed in detail in the article vsto add-in comaddins and requestcomaddinautomationservice by andrew whitechapel

1474756
groupbox	panel
anyhow you should just use the control that fits the job in this case a panel or a groupbox

1474758
listview	gridview
my suggestion would be to switch to a listview instead of a gridview

1474782
jar	war
the whole process of creating a jar and or war files for a single jsp seems like overkill as does setting up a whole ant build deployment task

however the built-in webclient has a major drawback you have almost no control over the webrequest that is used behind the scene cookies authentication custom headers...

1474881
for-loop	loops
as glenn maynard pointed out in the comment if you need to do a very large jumps such as i + 100000000 then you should use explicit while loops instead of just skipping steps in a for-loop

1474885
wordpress	phpbb
i ve seen some great frameworks for forums like phpbb and for blogs like wordpress

1474990
int	chars

note i took the liberty of removing superfluous parenthesis on your code maybe you came from delphi pascal language

1475164
django	web2py
having looked several ones like django pylos web2py wt

1475218
inherited	subclassing
it s a subclassing of db.model so your classes can inherited from rotmodel instead and take advantage of it s retries

1475222
int	chars
and use stream.writebuffer anodevariable sizeof tnode but you said that strings get go over 255 chars in this case if a string goes over 65535 chars then change word to int

1475246
trac	bugzilla
you could additionally use a nice bug tracker like bugzilla or use an integrated solution like launchpad or trac

1475514
inherited	properties
then make sure your inherited properties in your master s aspx page is correct

1475574
width	height
you may be able to just set the longest dimension and skip the ratio if the width and height are not otherwise set in attributes properties or css but i haven t done browser testing to be sure if it works across the board

1475607
stdout	stderr
alternatively you can createprocess api or system.diagnostics.process and provide your own stdin stdout stderr streams and bypass the windows console for these streams but again unless the target application explicitly works via stdin stdout stderr it may not help

1475673
perl	tcl
swig simplified wrapper and interface generator is a software development tool that connects programs written in c and c++ with a variety of high-level scripting languages including perl php python tcl and ruby though it seems swig s origins are bindings with python

submit	submission
2 also if what you want is to intercept form submission for that for you may want to do this slightly differently if you can submit the form via 1 button

1475705
free	malloc
use malloc and free when done

1475717
dlsym	dlopen
in particular the dlopen 3 and dlsym 3 calls will load a dynamic typically elf library and look up the address of a symbol named by a string

1475717
dlsym	dlopen
an extension library for the interpreter written in the script can itself invoke the bare hooks for dlopen 3 and dlsym 3 and hook up to a new library that the interpreter never knew about

1475800
submit	submission
note since the jquery ajax function do not stop the execution of the script you ll have to stop the form from submission then submit the form in the ajax callback.

1475805
ggplot2	lattice
however graphics systems based on grid lattice and ggplot2 allow the graphics object to be saved and updated

1475995
width	height
so from this i would expect that the width height of the window when there are no other constraints set such as maxwidth minwidth width etc. is determined by the default style of a window

1476008
int	chars
here you declared the operator for int and you are trying to pass a chars

1476101
hash	md5
it helps you take the md5 hash of a stream

1476101
hash	md5
md5 isn t considered very secure these days - there are other hash sha-256 which are harder to attack

1476105
hash	md5
rather use sha256 and above nowadays though as md5 is not of much use anymore cryptographically other than doing hash checks on downloaded files

1476184
prepare	execute
part of the code which makes the prepare statement execute and closes the connection

1476194
awt	swing
this is a common pattern for awt and swing events

you can also use the +valuewithcgrect and +valuewithcgsize methods of nsvalue when you re trying to log say the frame cgrect or size cgsize properties of a uiview

1476594
post	put
if it does then you should be using a post put or delete request depending on the exact nature of the operation

1476607
put	get
i know enough to get oracle up and running and put in place it s automatic options for backup and optimisation then i leave it well alone

1476629
nsurlconnection	nsoperation
you could wrap nsurlconnection in an nsoperation and achieve the same thing however nsurlconnection has an asynchronous api which may suit your needs a bit better

1476685
getter	setter
zend studio has a feature of automatic getter setter generation

1476716
submit	submission
since #jquerysubmit is a form submit button you need to prevent the default action which is submission the form normally without ajax

1476777
google-chrome	firefox
i am looking for a similar solution to firefox or google-chrome

1476811
vb6	vba
if i recall correctly if the oledbcommand in ado.net functions similarly to the older ado library libraries used in vb6 vba etc. then the parameter collection does not define parameters by name only by position within the collection

1476870
notepad	textpad
notepad agrees with my application textpad shows something else

1476926
post	get
the above is just a get post and index handles the content loading via includes mysql etc

gridview	linqdatasource
the problem we have is that a control ultimately based on a gridview linqdatasource combination cannot sort correctly on the primaryaddress joined class ignores it

1476984
postgresql	informix	postgresql	mysql
most dbms have some kind of hashing function postgresql and mysql have md5 oracle has dbms_utility.get_hash_value but i could not find anything for informix informix ids 9

1477008
pascal	delphi
while the delphi pascal syntax is more text oriented begin end or and so the underscores look a bit strange as you don t expect them there

1477066
postgresql	mysql
finally i decided to use interface ole db and postgresql instead instead of mysql

1477070
margin	height
make a copy of the image and crop it to just the left-most 5 pixels assuming that there s some left margin to the text trim and find out the new height

1477073

note that a property name cannot be the same as any no-parameter method name of nsobject or nsmanagedobject for example you cannot give a property the name â œdescriptionâ see nspropertydescription

1477118
many-to-one	one-to-many
from what i know it is not possible to map it this way you have to switch to one-to-many and a many-to-one relationships with your b in the middle

1477144
freetype	libpng	zlib	libpng
i already installed zlib libpng and freetype independently

1477229
awt	swing
these are mostly intended to be used with the awt and or swing classes though and thus have features specific to that use case

1477250
submit	submission
however when i submit the form the url changes to where the form should be submission to which is fine but once it has been submitted it should send the user to a confirmation page

1477339
google-chrome	firefox
it can be done and is a good optimizing tip but as always pay attention as how it works in ie firefox and google-chrome while you are doing it

1477349
opera	safari
it worked for ie 6 safari opera 8+ and ff2+

1477380
post	get
this is default behaviour as you can do multiple post s to the backend and the request won t get killed when doing another one

1477388
rss	feed
i am trying to fetch data from rss feed feed location is in c# win form

1477409

based on the current implementation of myisam and innodb yes

1477612
hash	salt
don t explain hash salt or use words like plaintext

1477647
prop	each
the alternative of course is to create copies of the original data within each thread stored in an array and use this private copied data in the call to prop

1477655
free	malloc
you can use malloc free for any type of data not only null terminated strings

1477669
hash	salt
using a salt is absolutely required because otherwise an attacker can use existing precomputed tables to simply look up hash for all short or dictionary passwords your users have used

1477669
hash	salt
combining hash could have a similar effect but should not be used for that purpose without a salt because it s still possible for a precomputed table to exist for that combination

1477669
hash	md5
however the combination and repetition of hash has a value of its own by increasing the time it takes for an attacker to do a dictionary attack applying md5 ten thousand times still takes a fraction of a second and is feasible as part of the login process

1477687
maven-assembly-plugin	pom.xml
it is possible however to use the maven-assembly-plugin to construct the war in this case you have much finer grained control over the contents of the artifact and can omit the pom.xml

1477757
onfocus	onblur	onclick	onfocus
this is working on most pages but on one for some reason the onfocus and onblur aren t working at all - for example if i change it to onclick it triggers no problem

django	web2py
to answer klochner both seems quite popular but ruby is not a language that i am familiar with and django seems more heavy and complex to me than web2py

1477860
mbunit	nunit
you can use testing frameworks like nunit xunit mbunit to playback your tests

1477867
folder	directory
change your output directory to your web-inf classes folder

1477877
int	chars
you ll need to define icloneable remove a bunch of unnecessary serialization constructors for exceptions remove the last parameter on string.split chars int calls that s about it.

1477889
rss	feed
when using the rss viewer webpart in sharepoint 2007 we can hit internal rss feed without issue but if we point to an external rss feed we get the following error

1477909
put	get
as sprites get touched their z-order is being changed by me to put them on the top of zorder

1477944
hash	salt
the salt is prefixed to a password which is hash with sha and stored in the databse

1477944
hash	salt
with a per user salt however you need to get the salt before you can compare it with the stored password hash

1477944
hash	salt
so to avoid having two queries 1 to get the salt and another to validate the input credentials i decided to get the salt and the hash password in a single query based on the inputted username

1477944
hash	salt
and then in the serverside code php i concatenate the salt with the inputted password hash it and compare it with the password already taken from the database

1477995
hash	salt
yes it is reasonable to simply collect the salt and the salt hash password for the user name in a single operation and then generate the sha result of the provided password and the salt in php comparing it with the retrieved hash password value

1478004
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
edit ie firefox safari opera have all supported it for years.

1478017

1478149
prepare	execute
and there s no other way besides prepare statements to execute dynamic sql in mysql 5.x

1478151
width	height
the sensible thing would be to classify monitors by width to height proportion

1478151
width	height
if you can get the width then you can probably get the height

1478157
nexus	artifactory
i would like to have nexus or artifactory we re not decided yet store a copy of an artifact when it is downloaded from a public repository on the internet like maven central

1478447
toolbar	docking
there s a codeproject article a simple c# toolbar docking framework that looks to be a more light-weight option than dockpanel suite

1478526
jar	war	liferay	web-inf
we stuck the dependency jar files in the liferay war file in web-inf lib and it seems to be happy with that

1478526
liferay	web-inf
the answer is again in the liferay war file in web-inf classes

1478526
folder	directory
the concept of liferay home directory variable being one folder above the server home is something i m still wrestling with and it is causing me to have errors every time an http request is sent relating to opt ee license

1478599
superclass	subclassing
in oo languages i can create and extend an engine superclass to obtain pistonengine and rotaryengine subclassing

1478693
strcpy	strncpy
how safe is strcpy compared to strncpy

1478784
hash	md5
some token that only myself and the other website operator knows concatenated to something identifying the user like their user name then hash that with a checksum algorithm such as sha256 you can use md5 or sha1 which usually are more available but they are much easier to break

1478805
strcpy	strncpy
you ve added an additional question about strcpy strncpy

1478832
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
i have detailsview which has few dropdownlistfor and checkbox

1478839
for-loop	arrays
the only wasteful aspect here is that you have to generate an arrays of length n-1 for the for-loop which isn t ideal but it s probably not a giant issue

1478943
subtract	add
thus a shift is just an add subtract of that one index no modification of the data

1478982
imperative	declarative
workflows are a declarative way of writing programs by linking together pre-defined activities rather than an imperative programming model of writing lines of code

1479005
getter	setter
the getter and setter methods are actually built around the idea that you shouldn t be able to and they therefore function as a property

1479005
getter	setter
i was able to do this for the regular methods but i m trying to extend this to getter setter as well

1479005
getter	setter
since getter and setter function as a property and not a method it would make sense to test to see if it is a property and then simply assign it a value directly

1479067
rss	feed
something similar to rss feed when you click them you can select use google reader

1479073
getter	setter
the getter setter of your object would reference those two vectors to access data in your real matrix and you would have methods like horizontalshift ... and verticalshift ... that only swap values in your two vectors like you suggested

1479099
codeblocks	codelite
codeblocks and codelite are two good options if you re sticking with c++

1479099
notepad++	scite
then you can go with notepad++ or scite

1479173
getter	setter
your getter and setter will work on the attr properties only

1479222
google-chrome	firefox
ie internet explorer firefox firefox ch google-chrome

1479234
hash	salt
secure hash and salt for php passwords

1479234
hash	salt
all they would have is the hash and the salt

1479241
hash	salt
if you used a secure hash access to the hash salt and algorithm will still leave a lot of work for a would-be attacker

1479261
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
just ran into this problem myself and tested this solution in ff3.5 ie6 ie7 ie8 safari 4 opera 10 and google-chrome

1479275
button	checkbox
i have several checkbox and a fake submit button to make an ajax request

1479277
fortran	ada
build a complete c compiler and other front-ends such as c++ fortran ada whatever if you want them

1479282
hash	salt
if people have access to your database you have bigger security concerns than your hash algorithm and salt phrase

1479282
hash	salt
hash are one-way so unless they can guess the input there is no way to reverse out the original text even with the algorithm and salt

1479307
versioning	upgrade
the solution is to reinstall all ports because i upgrade to a new os versioning 10.5 - 10.6

1479316
scrypt	salt	scrypt	pbkdf2	pbkdf2	salt	pbkdf2	hash	hash	salt
as a side note from what i ve read key derivation functions pbkdf2 scrypt bcrypt are considered better more secure #1 #2 than plain salt sha-1 sha-2 hash by crypto people

1479320
versioning	upgrade
the solution is to reinstall all ports because i upgrade to a new os versioning 10.5 - 10.6

1479365
hash	salt
if you have just a hash no salt then once they know your data and algorithm they can get your password via a rainbow table lookup

1479365
hash	salt
if you have a hash and a salt they can get your password by burning a lot of cpu cycles and building a rainbow table

1479366
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	modulo	multiplying	add
i am writing a small script that allows the user to input their two number vars then they can either add subtract multiplying divide easy or modulo haven t caught this one yet

1479374
vb6	vba
vba vb6 576 chars

1479384
udp	tcp
erlang otp comes with drivers for tcp and udp sockets only

1479398
division	modulo
modulo division is for integers

1479399
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i m using jquery .load to fetch content from wordpress posts and it works in firefox safari and google-chrome but not any of the ies

1479457
pop-up	dialog
a save dialog should pop-up

1479490
for-loop	loops
the idea is that the species variable first line of the for-loop e.g species bear becomes the object bear last line of loops which in conjunction with a str method and the print bear command would give me the bears attributes

1479517
allocator	stl
its a very tiny bit of work to give it static state without violating stl allocator rules

1479552
getattr	setattr
also the rules for naming of python variables are much stricter than the possible set of animal names -- you can t include spaces in a variable name for example so while setattr will happily store the value you d have to use getattr to retrieve it

1479561
selecteditem	selectedindex
use selectedindex or selecteditem or by changing the value of the property to which those properties are bound

1479612
redmine	gitorious
depending on whether you want a feature-for-feature clone of github or just somewhere to view git repositories alongside an issue tracker wiki etc. i d recommend either using gitorious the github clone or redmine

1479651
firefox	safari
what s weird is that my front-end validation works fine on firefox ie and safari for windows

1479663
folder	dir
i have a folder with three files and want the equivalent of dir s b in powershell

1479666
cvs	svn
scm server svn git cvs - central source repository usually

1479673
accessor	properties
i could define my own custom accessor but that again requires special treatment at assignment since they need to be used like methods setx val and not properties

1479696
jar	war
one way to solve this is to have the module build a jar and then use the assembly plugin to build a war file with the jar in web-inf lib of that war

1479696
jar	war
you d be better off having a jar project and a war project with a parent project building both modules

1479719
cvs	svn
in larger projects or in organizations development tends to be done locally on a programmer s computer or with the aid of source repositories svn cvs vss etc. a copy of the work is done locally

1479756
expression-blend	silverlight
i am working on a silverlight 3 site using expression-blend 3 silverlight project + website option in expression-blend

1479757
width	height
in visual studio when dragging a control from the toolbox onto the design area vs automatic sets width and height of the control with some values

1479757
width	height
i was suspicious that there were some kind of attributes for the width and height properties or even the class itself but could not find anything from reflecting the button control

1479794
mp3	wav	mp3	aiff	wav	aiff
audio file services to read the mp3 format and write aiff or wav

1479794
wav	aiff
i was surprised the first time i found out that pcm must be little-endian in a wav big-endian in an aiff

1479827
accessor	superclass
if you access myviewcontroller.view before you call loadview then the superclass accessor is smart enough to call loadview for you and viewdidload immediately thereafter

1479836
put	get
if i ever need any arguments to the message then i use the list tool i ve put in the context to get an array from the list of arguments i ll typically create right there in the template

1479842
put	get
you can also put them in cte s or views to get the same effect

1479880
pull	push
and even if the pull worked will the heroku remote get confused about a push that originated from some new git repo

1479958
postgresql	mysql
while mysql postgresql and other open source db s are easy for us to test on since we - the developers - all use these daily testing those products is easy

1479963
squash	branch
just create a new branch and do all the squash there

1479978
firefox	safari
i know a few users have mentioned that this bug exists in safari as well but i have never seen it anywhere but firefox

1479987
debian	linux
i m working though the first steps tutorial on the poco project site and i ve successfully built the library debian linux 2.6.26 gcc 4.3.2 under my home directory

1479993
x86	64bit	int	double
however x86-64 gives you more than just a 64bit address space and 64bit int registers - it also double the number of general purpose registers which on a register-deficient architecture like x86 can result in a significant performance increase with just a recompile

1479996
iboutlet	ibaction
i mean old iboutlet and ibaction still shows up

1480014
width	height
i ve seen things like this happen when something is filling a container at 100 width and height and that container has overflow auto

1480056
punctuation	words
this will partially fix the space-stripping issue although words at the end of a string or followed by punctuation can still cause issues

1480086
width	height
namely the height width and constrain proportions parameters

1480086
width	height
in the resulting file the resolution is correct but the height and width are calculated using the pdf s original height and width multiplied by the resolution and the image is constrained to the original proportions

1480086
width	height
i thought it might be a collision with specifying the resolution and the height width in pixels so i tried omitting the resolution but then it just defaults to 300

1480096
versioning	upgrade
with the recent browser update the wii has flash lite 3.1 upgrade from flash 7 which has support for h264 adobe flash lite versioning comparison

1480148
vbscript	jscript
batch files powershell vbscript jscript ruby perl python c# whatever

1480148
vbscript	jscript
powershell and higher end stuff will give you more control but you could even do this with the windows script host with vbscript or jscript

1480148
vbscript	jscript
folder management with vbscript - this has quite a few good examples of using the wscript filesystemobject jscript is just different in syntax

1480195
hash	md5
but now i have to trasnform them to hash md5 so far so good for the hash

1480204
dreamweaver	aptana
ide can be dreamweaver aptana

1480214
imperative	declarative
while neither the declarative nor imperative approach is really better than the other both have their merits

1480222
subtract	add
just use a 1d array and add subtract the width of one line to the index to move up down a line

1480243
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
other browsers ie8 google-chrome 3 safari opera rarely used and ie6 and ie7 via virtual machines freely downloadable virtual pc images from microsoft

1480292
config	ini
etc navigation code duplication replacement tasks for changes in ui and easy config xml ini files

1480308
strsplit	substr
the strsplit string separatorregex method splits a string into substr separated by substr matching the regex

1480308
strsplit	substr
so strsplit . will split str into substr separated by a single literal . character

1480313
hash	md5
it s simple to precalculate the md5 hash of a few billion potential passwords words names the same with a- 4 i- 1 o- 0 substitutions words doubled or with a 1 tacked on the end short random strings etc. and store them indexed in a table with the passwords that generated them

1480313
hash	salt
if you re doing this for security look into the possibility of storing hash salt passwords as a start

1480346
mvp	presenter
i have seen some mvp samples that have a couple of textboxes and it demonstrates moving the code behind to a presenter class to make it testable

1480346
toolbar	tabs
right now i have all that logic in the code behind because more often than not i need to have values from other form controls and or underlying datasource to determine if switching tabs is allowed or whether i disable toolbar buttons or i display error message etc

1480376
post	get
most asp.net sites the one you referenced included will actually post their queries back to themselves using the http post verb not the get verb

1480377
inherited	subclassing
think of it as oo programming you would not put methods that are used only in subclassing b that inherited from class a to that parent class a and in the process make that method available in all classes inheriting from a while they will never be used there or even worse be misused.

1480380
openssl	m2crypto
m2crypto is a python wrapper around openssl

1480409
firefox	safari
now the above code - all works fine in firefox and safari

1480409
firefox	safari
but i read somewhere ie might not like clone very much or it handles differently to firefox and safari

1480417
put	get
and in second pass i get the values for all the data and put it in the database

1480448
ordinals	difference
re your comments and clarification okay so your difference is not simply by value but by ordinals position of the row

1480459
integer	unsigned
variable types classes there are a number of numeric classes both floating point and signed unsigned integer types that variables can use

1480459
integer	unsigned
for example converts 0 to an 8-bit unsigned integer type and stores it in a while converts the value pi into single-precision and stores it in b

1480489
int	chars
i remember that int 4 byte and chars is merely 1 byte

1480544
post	get
servlets have a java definition applications which handle http get post requests while portlets have a user interface definition.a component performing a specific function similar to the windows vista widgets or a lot of components used in stackoverflow here

1480566
comparator	comparable
the method sort list comparator in the type collections is not applicable for the arguments list new comparable myobject

1480593
comparator	comparable
you re passing in a comparable when it wants a comparator

1480598
hide	show
i have an on off switch on a view that is supposed to disable enable hide show another button on the same view but for some reason it doesn t work sometimes this is the behavior

1480599

but when i put in this url i get 404 - not found error

1480602
mvp	presenter
see mvp - how many presenter

1480616
post	get
as querystring for an ajax get post call

1480635
post	get
this document is a good guide for choosing when to use get or post

1480638
int	chars
for instance an int would take up 4 bytes a chars would take 1 byte etc

1480650
post	get
use get and post for passing larger amounts of data

1480690
gif	png
a service that manipulates images of various web formats png jpg gif etc

1480778
doc	rtf
the idea is to convert common formats pdf doc xls etc. to rtf and just show rtf since that is always available and doesn t require any software to be installed on the pc

1480836
pop-up	dialog
my apps pop-up a dialog

1480872
innodb	myisam
between the two most used engines myisam doesn t support transactions while innodb supports them

now go to â œlog filesâ tab change the log file type to either csv or tsv format

1480882
min	max
read the values from the chart min and max values are displayed at the bottom of the chart

1480906
cldc	midp
the java me specifications most relevant to mobile phones are the cldc and midp

1480912
folder	directory
add the eclipse annotation processor output directory as source folder

1480917
width	height
here images are in different height and width

1480917
width	height
i wand to set image height and width in constant size example 400 400

1480971
kde	gnome
by cross platform i mean windows osx and linux gnome kde

1480975
ispf	cobol
the ispf was a rapid application development system on ibm mainframes which used a declarative markup to define the screens then fortran or cobol code behind it to provide behaviour

1480978
tinyurl	bit.ly
hey guys i want to generate unique base62 hashes - something similar to what tinyurl and bit.ly do using c#

1480978
min	max
min chars would be 1 and max chars would be 6.

1481014
hide	show
i used to see that a program could embed a calendar right into the desktop and the calendar is interactive all show desktop operations including will not hide it

1481021
int	boolean
i am using an int field in the db to represent collection of boolean in order to save some space

1481021
int	boolean
the int is used in my business logic and transformed into collection boolean attributes

1481021
int	boolean
i v now decided to add admin section to the site using dynamic data feature and i am wondering whether there is an option to show the boolean that represent that int

1481030
width	margin
the margin has to be at least the width of the image

1481059
junit	testng
it is composed of various modules which can be used with testng or junit .

1481070
translation	localization
the __ function is a language localization function which takes an english language literal string and returns the a translation string for an application-defined locale

1481114
post	get
the get and post data is the data that my script is receiving

1481132
lisp	scheme
the reason this process is associated with lisp is because of the highly lucid paper the art of the interpreter which shows several metacircular interpreters based on scheme

1481132
lisp	prolog
this is also vastly easier to do in a homoiconic language a language whose code can be manipulated as data at runtime such as lisp prolog and forth

1481132
scheme	prolog
in scheme or prolog it s often less than a page of code

1481139
width	margin
i m setting the width of the table so that it should extend the margin of the page

1481174
int	double
because 1.0 has type double and compiler really doesn t know what type to choose between int and float so it asks you to give it a hint

1481231
folder	directory
contained the full path to the application models directory and therefore loading is faster since ci doesn t have to look in different folder global application

1481257
getdate	dateadd
e.g select dateadd hh -1 getdate

1481265
hide	show
if you mean it show intermediate packages org org.apache org.apache.junit etc. you can restore the eclipse filters to hide empty parent packages and hide

1481283
photoshop	fireworks
960 gs it s a lovely start doing web or images they have a complete template for almost any good design program photoshop ilustrator fireworks indesign etc as well a css generator and a grid overlay to help you with the website

1481312
phpunit	simpletest
i have never been able to get the simpletest eclipse plugin to work with phpunit based tests though it s theoretically possible

1481312
phpunit	simpletest
if anyone can extend the damn simpletest plugin to include phpunit i d like to hear about it

1481322
ubuntu	debian
since it doesn t happen for everybody i can only assume the ubuntu debian have added something to python to auto load modules

1481381
ienumerable	icollection
so many times we have a function that accepts an ienumerable or icollection as a parameter

1481381
ienumerable	icollection
and the compiler would create the most abstract possible collection that would satisfy the needs of ienumerable or icollection depending on which one the function accepts

1481392
ant	maven
there are also maven tasks for ant though they are not as fully featured

1481392
ant	maven
you can also use the mercury tasks to deploy to a maven repository using an ant build file

1481401
public	protected
in the most simplistic cases there is very little reason to have a public constructor rather than a public static method that returns a new object and the object only has private protected constructors

1481401
internationalization	localization
will have different results based on the localization internationalization

1481411
maven	m2e
they also mention that the developer builds of m2e are now using maven 3 and provide a link to the maven 3.x compatibility wiki

1481453
put	get
for example if i put a log statement at the beginning of responseforpid and at the end i get output like this

1481456
for-loop	arrays
instead of just iterating through an arrays with a for-loop which is damn near to instant we will gracefully handle each load by themselves

1481487
ssl	https
proxy using basic auth over https is not secure when the ssl is tunneled

1481518
gmail	hotmail
and web-based like yahoo hotmail gmail .

1481532
int	boolean
and generaldata someobject and someotherobject all have a mix of various types of parameters strings int boolean datetimes. it is very likely especially during initial development that i will build the json on the client side incorrectly

1481536
getter	setter
by default eclipse generates getter setter according to javabeans regular properties style

1481536
getter	setter
as of j2se 5.0 javabeans specification allows indexedpropertychangeevents which have a different getter setter naming scheme for arrays

1481617
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i ve got this code that works in the latest version of firefox opera and i m not sure if in ie8 but it doesn t work in google-chrome safari and ofc ie7 and 6

1481617
opera	firefox
as i wrote before the code i have looks different but i need to start a function after i click on the and it only works in firefox opera .

1481618
firefox	safari
i ve managed to hammer together the effects i want and everything s working fine on firefox safari

1481622
qsharedpointer	qscopedpointer	qsharedpointer	qshareddata	qscopedpointer	qshareddata	qobject	qsharedpointer	qobject	qscopedpointer
many qt classes are derived from qobject and while some of the built in smart pointer classes are related to qobject or qshareddata the qsharedpointer and qscopedpointer templates appear to allow pointers to anything

1481624
qabstractitemmodel	qstandarditemmodel
the more effecient approach would be implementing your own model with qabstractitemmodel interface instead of using qstandarditemmodel

1481641
xna	slimdx
you could use xna or slimdx or another direct3d wrapper

1481674
put	get
in this instance i d put a flag on the employee to signify who is the owner and sort by this column to get the right record 1st

1481696
hide	show
i have all the html code figured out using jquery to show hide divs

1481723
cldc	midp
and as well i would think they would be included in cldc 1.1 midp 2.0 so if you find them there we can conclude that their footprint is negligible plus probably implemented in an optimized built-in thus being of virtually no cost to use them

1481740
width	height
insert the image element into your page and specify the width and the height and the browser will scale the image for you

1481740
width	height
if you want to avoid this then you probably do want to use javascript load the image into your page detect its natural height and width then either use simple arithmetic to scale to something that will fit within both the width and height or scale so that at least one is and display the image inside a div with a fixed width and height and a style of overflow hidden to crop

1481762
width	height
to force layout you can give the element a width or a height or use the old zoom 1

1481839
int	chars
i really don t get it why would i want to implicitly convert chars to int

1481872
hide	show
i have a button on click of which i want to either show hide a content which is places in a div

1481889
comparator	comparable
one is as noted comparator vs comparable and don t forget equals

1481890
freebsd	linux	freebsd	netbsd	freebsd	opensolaris	opensolaris	openbsd	opensolaris	netbsd	openbsd	linux	openbsd	netbsd	openbsd	freebsd
the freedesktop group has a specification for an xdg-open command which works on all freedesktop-compliant graphical desktops be they linux freebsd netbsd openbsd dragonflybsd opensolaris or otherwise

1481898
post	get
i ve only watched the video on that page so far but it looks like you ll be able to get edit and post feeds to your google accounts

1481929
windows	wow64
i would not be surprised to see wow64 as an install option as early as windows 8 as more software migrates to 64-bit

1481945
int	chars
studing the code in schaum s c++ book i saw a lot of code using chars int etc

1481954
int	chars
a normal variable for example a chars or an int contains the value of that datatype itself - the variable can hold a chars or an int

1481958
int	chars
with a chars or int the variable value is the actual assigned value - a or 42

1481958
int	chars
with a chars or int the variable value is the location in memory where the actual assigned value is saved

1481970
int	chars
when you have chars or int or long or anything like that then memory is set aside to hold the value so a chars is 1 byte of memory for storage

1482007
versioning	upgrade
edited to add if you want to download a versioning of xcode that actually will install on the versioning of mac os x that you have if you can t upgrade for some reason you might be able to find older versioning on developer.apple.com but they re kind of hard to find

1482084
cvs	svn
svn or cvs is a must have so you should always get access to your co-workers parts and can see the existing interfaces and the description

1482131
regasm	gacutil
added it to the gac using gacutil then registered it using regasm and created a type library tlb file

1482140
nsstring	nsdata
perhaps convert an nsstring to a c string and use its nsdata representation as the post variable value

1482149
aggregate-functions	sum	min	max
use group by and aggregate-functions sum min max etc to collapse the many rows into the output row set you want

1482169
int	chars
at one point many languages did distinguish greatly between chars and int but since they always had to have conversion functions it didn t actually block very much and it did just become a big pain

1482169
ord	chr
no one really wants to go back to the days of chr n and ord c all over the place

1482169
int	chars
once c came out with chars s really being int s it rocked and we ve stayed with that even in much more strongly typed languages

1482170
int	chars
for me it does make sense - the set of all chars is included in the set of all int s and therefore applying my own guidelines for using implicits the conversion should really be implicit

1482170
int	chars
edit actually if you have a good look at the scala api chars does have an overloaded + method which takes an int argument

1482170
int	chars
also note that the example i have gave you had nothing to do with allowing adding int s to chars s

1482170
int	chars
the more subtle point is that when you add an int to a chars you get an int

1482170
int	chars
also note the more theoretical answer i have given - chars is a subset of int

1482261
for-loop	loops
loops backwards over the collection using a regular indexed for-loop which i believe is not an option in the case of a hashset

1482295
hide	show
i m specifically looking for a elegant way of letting javascript handle the hide and show after php initially loads the page

1482325
superclass	subclassing
my goal is simply to isolate a method in the superclass from overriding in subclassing which would break the other base methods

1482326
post	get
there s a great tutorial on setting up windbg here and in some of the comments on the post there are instructions on how to run your .exe from within windbg and get an immediate dump

1482367
linefeed	delimiter
the only solid delimiter is the cr linefeed

1482370
background-color	transparency
javascript - much like the coloured boxes below layer 1 place a further element layer 3 over the rounded corners image layer 2 but making the background-color transparency for those interactable boxes then referencing the javascript to move the 1st layer boxes as well as the 3rd layer boxes

1482372
crossover	mutation
next we design the crossover operator as usual one- or two-points crossover and mutation as well flip one bit at random

1482383
put	get
also i put this into my ipython and get this

1482422
rdf	owl
i m looking for a graphical browser for examining large networks of owl rdf instances

1482539
objectdatasource	formview
i have an objectdatasource that i m using with a formview and it works fine but i want to change one small thing

1482541

or if your doc is going to be used in template-like manner you could create the rtf file by hand in wordpad and save it with special strings that you invent like your_name_here

1482676
libevent	epoll
but at scale you d want to use select poll epoll libevent etc

1482677

i need no editing no selection no dynamic resizing of columns no default cell drawing behaviour no effects when the mouse moves over things no keyboard shortcuts

1482703
svnadmin	visualsvn	folder	directory
for example if you installed visualsvn you will need to use the svnadmin located in the bin folder of the installation directory

1482711
boost	allocator
also this doesn t help you with the non-crt memory allocator functions heapalloc globalalloc localalloc virtualalloc etc though boost almost certainly uses the crt functions

1482726
postgresql	mysql
i d be interested in knowing what those products offer that make them more attractive to you than the open source alternatives you listed mysql and postgresql

1482766
vbscript	jscript
another possibility beyond powershell which is a good one is to use wmi with jscript or vbscript to access the software store

1482781
int	chars
this method first writes the length of the string as a utf-7 encoded unsigned int and then writes that many chars to the stream by using the binarywriter instance s current encoding

pull	push
push the recent changes from the new git repository to heroku then switch to the old repository and pull from heroku

1482865
virtualbox	parallels	vmware	virtualbox
the harder one is to put up a linux server - perhaps as a guest under windows using virtualbox free or vmware or parallels pay and then follow one of the many sets of instructions google will lead you to

looks fine in firefox safari 4 google-chrome

1483035
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
this code works fine on its own tested in safari mac firefox mac opera mac ie7 and ie8 so you may be able to shoehorn it into your existing html

1483066
google-chrome	firefox
have you tried different browsers such as ie firefox or google-chrome

1483148
vbscript	jscript
for jscript i have tried to but i am not able to find the equivalent to the 2 methods specified in the vbscript class or the class itself at the above location and these are stringify converting javascript data structures into json text and parse to turn json text into object

1483226
realloc	malloc
realloc to extend a malloc ed array

1483294
webclient	httpwebrequest
like i was using webclient however it seems it can t handle the gzip bit need to drop back to httpwebrequest

1483302
touchesbegan	touchesended
solved it turned out that there should be also touchesbegan and touchesended implementations in my case having empty methods helped in the tile otherwise the gesture started propagating to parent views and they were intercepting the gesture somehow

1483331
post	get
feed not in the actual sense but you know like those little reports you get on facebook eg when someone post a picture you get a simple report saying in your main page that - so and so added a picture or so and so added a comment

1483344
move	drag
and each time i use mouse mouse drag c b and c will move together

1483347
puts	gets
i have made it so when the user gets a high score it puts the score they got onto the label but i would now like to know how i can save it so that when the app is opened again it will still have the high score this is my code for detecting when a high score is made

1483350
atoi	strtok
use strtok and atoi

1483354
vim	emacs
also unless you re talking about the command line editing modes vim and emacs handle their own keyboard mapping

1483368
ubuntu	linux
i am trying to port an objective-c application to run on linux ubuntu at the moment

1483403
stringstream	fstream
i think this question is applicable to all kind of stream types in c++ also like fstream and stringstream

1483441
ostringstream	std
note that although the logging class in that article uses c++ stream syntax it does this via a std ostringstream object that is created and destroyed for every logging event and so is not shared between threads

1483448
width	height
i loaded paint and found the first man starts at 16 pixels across and 0 down and has a width of 16 pixels and a height of 16 pixels there is a black space on the left of the image

1483454
entities	entitymanager
it uses standard jpa annotations to define entities but exposes a much simpler api no entitymanager or any of that attached detached entities crap

1483456
division	modulo
the ones that use modulo and division operations

1483456
post	get
now i think that you could get all the possible binary search trees of size n by permuting just the integers 1 to n but i m not entirely sure and attempting to prove that is a bit too much for this post

1483479
dictionary	map
that is if you have a route like specific edit 5646-0767-... it will map the guid into the route value dictionary with key id regardless of what the parameter on your method is named

1483515
getter	setter
scalas getter and setter may also relate to your magic

1483538
apache	lighttpd
assuming that you re building a web-browser i d suggest using your own computer as a server using apache lighttpd whether windows linux or mac

1483549
fgets	strtok
it basically uses an fgets loop to read each line in and strtok to separate that line into fields

1483554
post	get
if it s okay for the button name to be get rather than post data in your boxy callback append it to the form s action as a query parameter

1483558
instances	transient
this code throws an exception when transaction.commit is running and the exception is object references an unsaved transient instances - save the transient instances before flushing

1483562
put	get
this means that when you put something into ets it is copied into it and when you take it out you get a copy in your process

1483562
put	get
so when you look things up in it you get a reference to the exact same value you put in it

1483581
viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidappear	viewwillappear
none of the viewdidload viewwillappear viewdidappear methods of the associated view controller uitableviewcontroller are of useâ here as they all fire too early

1483581
viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidappear	viewwillappear
when restoring the scroll position using scrollrecttovisible animated i need the table view to already have sufficient data in it or else the scrollrecttovisible animated method call does nothing which is what happens if you place the call on its own in any of viewdidload viewwillappear or viewdidappear

1483598
instances	transient
your detail instances is transient which means that is has not been added to your nhibernate session

1483611
ironruby	ironpython
i would have hoped at this point in time that more work be done on creating such an environment with ironruby ironpython

1483646
int	chars
chars constants are of type int so it s equivalen to plain 0

1483669
put	get
however i want to test the call in wsf windows script i put the code below in a file called test.wsf when i run the code i get an error

1483670
min	max
i wish to get a random date time between two date times min date time and max date time

1483670
min	max
meaning all 100 items will have random date times between the min max date time period

1483698
nsstring	uifont
through trial and error you could use nsstring s method - cgsize sizewithfont uifont font to find out the maximum width allowed on a badge

1483728
mp3	wav
convert the mp3 to a wav

1483738
factors	matrix
you have to consider multiple factors so decision will be lying in a matrix and you have to feed multiple things and you will get your answer i would enlist some feature

1483744
getter	setter
getter setter related

1483788
addition	multiplication
it requires only a few decisions followed by a multiplication and addition and can approximate any curve

1483801
mxml	haxe
haxe will also compile on the server but is much less resource intensive than mxml .

1483819
pull	push
i m looking for a cross-platform tool to support performing an operation on multiple repos at the same time tag pull push commit etc... essentially i m looking for the repo script that google wrote for android but for hg instead of git

1483828
cpython	ironpython
the three that are certainly solid mature and complete enough for production use are cpython ironpython and jython

1483828
jython	pypy	cpython	pypy	cpython	ironpython
cpython ironpython jython and pypy can all run django other implementations might also be complete enough for that but i m not certain

1483845
google-chrome	firefox
i recommend playing with mozilla firefox and google-chrome if you want to see tabs at their finest. br

1483888
width	height
further proof the definitions of width and height

1483888
width	height
the width and height classes only

1483905
width	height
in your scenario element should probably not inherit from width and height but instead width and height should be data members of element

1483905
width	height
it s composition as opposed to is-a since arguably an element is-not-a width or height but is composed of a width and height and probably some other stuff too

1483915
lotus	sametime
i have been trying to develop a plugin to be executed inside lotus sametime

1483929
width	height
in your case the sentences element is a height and element is a width really doesn t make sense

1483941
integer	unsigned
this union allows me to access the unsigned integer byte or word-wise

1483947
button	checkbox
if the report header looks to be suppressed you need to check the section expert for the suppress checkbox associated with the report header section it can be set conditionally - kill the button next to the suppress checkbox to see if there s any code

1484045
serializable	deserialization
serializable and deserialization fast and small

1484071
children	parent
have the parent process create the file streams with tmpfile so that both the parent and children share the files

1484071
children	parent
there are some minor coordination issues to handle - the parent will need to seek back to the start before reading what the children wrote and it should only do that after the child has exited

1484071
children	parent
you are still faced with the problem of getting file names from children to parent

1484071
children	parent
consequently you need to ensure the parent reads all the pipes completely bearing in mind that the children won t be able to exit until all the data has been read strictly all but the last buffer full has been read

1484080
debian	linux
i m on shared server environment dreamhost.com uses linux debian

1484153
redmine	trac
i m the author of bugtracker.net which like many other bug trackers trac redmine fogbugz integrates with svn

1484153
cvs	svn
edit i ve taken a look at one attempt at github-fogbugz integration but even the author of that says it s fairly obvious that fogbugz was written for a more traditional cvs svn scm system in mind

1484228
width	height
but in my program only the high threshold image is getting copied.the low threshold valid pixels are not getting drawn.moreover this code is working for larger images not smaller images i really cant understant y because i have nowhere hardcoded the values of the width and height

1484254
superclass	subclassing
to retrieve an object from the database the superclass and subclassing tables are joined

1484254
inherited	properties
all properties including inherited are mapped to the table of the concrete class

1484343
cdr	cons
cons x cdr n

1484347
min	max
it s trivial to write a function to determine the min max value in an array such as

1484358
int	chars
it has two private helper methods one of which determines the max value in an int and the other returns the occurrences of a chars in a string

1484359
g++	gcc
consider using g++ instead of gcc which automaticaly sets the correct settings when compiling c++

1484373
dictionary	map
there also comes a point where assuming that the map is pre-built mapping types to methods with a dictionary will be faster than traversing a linear list of types which is essentially what using a bunch of if blocks gets you

1484410
subtract	add
in other words whenever you add or subtract to it then check if it s greater than 90 and set it to 90 or if it s less than -90 then set it to -90

1484447
post	get
you can get your most recent post as json so you can have a bit of javascript which would get the most recent post then apply some extra css magic

1484457
post	put
in the first post in the according type block block text block photo etc.. put custom css that overrides the default style and you re done

1484459
put	get
you get the idea that all you care about is being a and you put less emphasis on the actual implementation

1484473
postorder	inorder
the complexity for this algorithm i believe is o n o n for inorder postorder traversals the rest of the steps again being o n since they are nothing more than simple iterations in arrays

1484474
hash	salt
in this case you will hash the password with some salt and you ll store the username salt and hash password in such a way that given the username you can easily find the other two values

1484474
hash	salt
first off that means that salt and hash are not relevant

1484474
hash	salt
this is as safe as the application password which is stored in the original salt hash format

1484494
min	max
here s a utility class providing min max methods for primitive types primitives.java

1484579
debian	linux
as i commented above all your examples are working as you expect on my linux box debian lenny python2.5 processing 0.52 see test code below

1484598
sudo	passwd
you need to login as a superuser sudo su and type your passwd then try that command

1484639
post	get
as for get post request via links

1484688
post	get
you can t alter anything inside of an iframe which is not in your domain assuming you are trying to get rid of the javascript code in the yahoo iframe from your other post

1484694
post	get
if i ever get around to writing some kind of proof of concept i ll post here what i learn

1484733
realloc	malloc
since your function cannot tell ahead of time how much space is needed certainly not for the pipe or terminal inputs you have to be prepared to deal with dynamic memory allocation - malloc and realloc

1484761
accessor	properties
the data class precious which is used to hold the properties accessor and operations that affect a single member of the class

1484803
firefox	safari
tested in firefox 3.5.3 safari ie8 chrome.

1484807
spoofing	traffic
problem traffic is about 80 folks who will work to be sure they do not do work - every site that i have seen that stays up uses some sort of human-has-to-think authentication ipv4 is a constant source of spoofing intrusions and news reports which you want to stay out of ipv6 approaches the matter with engineering-grade work

1484813
sorting	filtering
the sample is very basic since it only works for paging but could be easily extended to include sorting and filtering

1484819
getter	setter
b if you do map onto properties getter and setter do not need to be public

1484887
phpunit	simpletest
i haven t worked in php before but from what i ve seen you may want to consider simpletest or phpunit

1484909
width	height
i need to edit the width height parameters in both the and tags one having a px suffix and the other not having one at all which is totally random some codes have it in all cases others do not

1484909
width	height
firstly i m trying to find out the width height of the existing video..

1484909
width	height
and then replacing the existing values with the new values width 640 and height xxx which is based on the aspect ratio of the video

1484915
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
tested in latest ie firefox opera safari google-chrome

1484934
width	height
here s how to get the width and height

1484950
cout	cin
however most of the programs we are writing make use of cin and cout for input output

1484950
cout	cin
cout works fine as output as you can see what it puts out in the application output but there is no way to provide to cin as if it were on a console like visual studio uses for its c++

1484986
accessor	properties
you ve set up your properties to retain the value but then you re not using the accessor methods but set the instance variable directly instead

1485018
stdout	stderr
you can use glib.io_add_watch to watch for output on the pipes connected to stdout and stderr in the subprocess object

1485023
uiview	calayer
and don t worry about the memory impact of a uiview that s 320x480 pixels it won t consume any significant memory because the calayer doesn t have any meaningful content

1485051
gridview	repeater	gridview	sqldatasource
here is the code from my example - nothing tricky here just bound a string array to a repeater and bound the gridview to a sqldatasource with the select and delete commands specified

1485052
google-chrome	safari
browsers like safari and google-chrome animate this without any glitches

1485073
cos	sin
i would think of a library of functions as say the set of math functions that exist in most modern languages sin cos square root and so forth

1485091
width	height
dnn5 iframe module is fairly good at resizing height not width

1485127
public	protected
public protected virtual or protected internal virtual

1485127
inherited	properties
internal exposes the properties to inherited types in other assemblies

1485133
pem	pkcs#12
now covert the pkcs#12 file to a pem file

1485136
post	get
i m having various amounts of trouble trying to get it to post an image

1485160
ant	maven
can the process be simplified with tools like ant or maven

1485181
pdfsharp	itextsharp
i have tried using certain libraries like pdfsharp itextsharp even acrobat reader ocx control

google-chrome	safari
safari 3 4 google-chrome 1+ and konqueror render it incorrectly

1485367
move	drag
i dont know how to move drag the whole triangle to new location and later delete the previous drawn triangle

1485382
hash	salt
hash and the salt

1485390
vb.net	vb6
at present the current method is to develop the usercontrol in c# and then have a vb.net usercontrol which inherits from the c# version and host the vb.net control in the vb6 form

1485437
phpunit	simpletest
one interesting idea i ve heard regarding this topic is to use test driven development tdd where you write the tests using phpunit or simpletest and then hand that off to the development team

1485446
submit	submission
i am trying to insert row into table 1 get the id-a to insert in table 2 along with the id-b that is auto-generated in table 3 when i submit each string c all in one submission to db

1485447
hide	show
i can selectively hide show each pane as i move off-screen to the next pane

1485454
memcpy	memmove
usually memcpy and memmove have been highly optimized already for your compiler s clib

1485461
return-value-optimization	nrvo
since it s returning a potentially large vector by value this depends heavily on your compiler implementing the named return-value-optimization nrvo but 1 the worst case is that it does about what you were doing before anyway and 2 virtually all reasonably current compilers do implement nrvo

1485480
mktime	strtotime
i am thinking of using the date strtotime mktime and time php functions

1485500
expander	grid
i ve extended the grid control with a simple method that fires when the expander is expanded i would call this

1485568
hash	salt
all they would have is the hash and the salt

1485568
hash	salt
the basic idea of hashing passwords is that the attacker has knowledge of the hashing algorithm and has access to both the hash and the salt

1485568
hash	salt
by selecting a cryptographic strong hash function and a suitable salt value that is different for each password the computational effort required to guess the password is so high that the cost exceeds the possible gain the attacker can get from guessing the password

1485568
hash	salt
in general this is true but when it comes to securing passwords by storing them as hash you should still assume that the attacker has full access to the hash and design your system accordingly by choosing an appropriate hash function and using salt

1485568
hash	salt
however if a unique salt is used to compute the hash for each password a precomputed table becomes useless as it is different for each salt and cannot be reused

1485581
distutils	buildout
the most useful resource that i found so far are the videos from pycon 2009 on setuptools distutils and buildout

1485585
children	parent
yet the classic tree data structure i was taught in school has a root and is implemented with single pointers from parent to children in other words a diagram of it would look like what you are calling an arborescence

1485683
folder	directory
in your library directory you should have your own library next to the zend library folder

1485712
vb.net	vb6
i ve come across a couple of issues - particularly with code converted from vb6 to vb.net where the 0 indexing of collections has meant that bugs have been introduced into code and am therefore wary of them

1485782
folder	directory
copyitematpath topath error will copy an entire folder to a new location if the atpath is a directory

1485787
vb.net	vb6
since you ve mentioned them it sounds as though you ve inherited some vb6 code that was possibly converted to a vb.net project

1485787
vb.net	vb6
otherwise if it was a new vb.net project i see no value in using the vb6 methods

1485787
vb.net	vb6
i ve been on a few vb6 to vb.net conversion projects

1487195
mockups	balsamiq
my favorite mockups tool balsamiq mockups

you could argue that the superclass is not well-designed for subclassing at least not in the way you want to

1487311
superclass	subclassing
it s even worse - this problem can happen to you even if you don t override methods in the superclass - see subtyping vs subclassing

pexpect anywhere but windows and wexpect on windows are always my recommendations when you need to defeat buffering and read a subprocess s output in near real-time as you put it

1487558
equals	gethashcode
you need to override equals and gethashcode so that your types are compared by their values rather then by their references

1487559

superclass	subclassing
the best you can do is to act at human level - make sure that the human that writes the subclassing understands the superclass

1488335
mechanize	curb
i ve used curb and mechanize for a similar project

1488345
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
so you shouldn t use argumentexception or argumentnullexception

freebsd	linux
this is basically using the unix select call although both freebsd and linux provide more optimized alternatives such as kqueue

1488435

for indexers microsoft indicates that it is acceptable for both getter and setter to throw exceptions

1488498
getter	setter
it is almost never appropriate on a getter and sometimes appropriate on a setter

1488514
int	chars
i am unsure because the prototype of er_get_type has int for the type field whereas the ei.h file defines chars the above constants

1488527
versioning	upgrade
i want to know which dependency i ve got to rebuild with the new versioning of another library that i upgrade

1488529

1488558
integer	unsigned
you can avoid checking for non-negative quantities by using an unsigned integer

1488570
put	get
but it is also generally considered to be a good idea to design your classes such that it is simply not possible to get an invalid object initially or to put it into invalid state via normal means always ensure full initialization in constructors and try make methods exception-safe with respect to state validity and class invariants

1488584
strtol	atoi
the atoi function has been deprecated by strtol and should not be

1488584

1488803
public	protected
i prefer to check for null for all reference types parameters of public protected methods

1488805

unless you re using code contracts i d say it s good practice to check arguments for any public protected member - as well as explicitly documenting whether they can or can t be null

1488806
firefox	safari
i ve seen consistent results in firefox and internet explorer that break down in safari and sometimes ie is the odd browser out

1490147
getter	setter
an operation that reads the variable increments it and then writes the incremented value back to the property might need to be locked but locking the individual getter and setter would be totally inadequate

1490151
accessor	properties
user data can be retrieved by extracting and decrypting the forms authentication ticket then using the userdata properties accessor on the decrypted ticket

1490154
cpython	ironpython
but in implementations other than cpython jython and ironpython to name two there is no guarantee just when a destructor will get called so something more proactive needs to be built into your method

getter	setter
you shouldn t write plain getter setter because they are as bad as exposing the variables them selves

1490253
getter	setter
calling virtual functions in ctors is a bad idea but setter and getter are unlikely to be virtual

1490253

getter	setter
for immutable classes of course you don t have setter and you don t need getter as const members and references can be public as no one can change reseat them

1490263
getter	setter
same with setmystring if the answer is yes you are better off with access methods since you don t have to change your code in zillion places but just modify those getter and setter methods

1490282
stdout	stderr
i m pretty certain that stdout even if it s not line buffered like stderr will autoflush if you attempt to read from stdin at least in most environments i ve used which is a few

1490294
pop-up	dialog
i have implemented the pop-up using show modal dialog javascript but i still cant get the parent value into the child form

1490305
accessor	properties
the simple fact is that most accessor and mutators are simply a formality so much so that c# now has automatic properties and are not necessary

1490330
getter	setter	mutators	getter	mutators	setter
as it s written right now with no qualification of the input or output your getter and setter accessor and mutators if you prefer are accomplishing absolutely nothing so you might as well just make the string public and be done with it

1490330
getter	setter
this gives a real improvement over using a setter and getter in a surrounding class

1490330
getter	setter
first and foremost when you put those in a surrounding class it s easy for code inside that class to bypass the getter setter losing enforcement of whatever the setter was supposed to enforce

1490330
getter	setter
using a getter and a setter forces you to write code that s just plain ugly and hard to read

1490330
getter	setter
but look what happens if that string is part of a class that forces us to go through a getter and setter

1490331
mouse	keyboard
however i m trying to use it now in another app where i have a secondary window that pops open and gets initialized with the view and while i get mouse moved evets i don t seem to get any mouse click or keyboard for that matter events whatsoever

1490331
move	drag
when i click and drag on the view the entire window move which im guessing has to do why i dont get any mouse events

1490338
postgresql	mysql
you can import or query your data into any of these programs from your db and most of these programs include routines to let you query a lot of dbs directly sql mysql postgresql and therefore enabling you to automate the process of extracting data mining and visualizing graphing your data with impunity

1490340
getter	setter
an object isn t simply a bag of setter and getter that other code does stuff to

1490340
getter	setter
if you follow this approach to oo then carrying meyers advice to the extreme as you did hurts encapsulation rather than helping it you end up exposing all of the class s internal implementation variables via getter and setter instead of hiding them so that only the class s methods the code responsible for doing stuff on behalf of the class which is the only reason you have a class to begin with can get to it

1490342
cakephp	kohana
that being said you might want to look into kohana and cakephp - they re not overly bloated imo and they will definitely save you time should you decide not to write your own

1490343
gtkmm	glibmm
i also like gtkmm s glib ustring but that only works if you re writing a gtkmm or at least glibmm application

1490364
firefox	safari
maybe firefox and safari are merely respecting this setting

1490384
filesystems	fat	filesystems	ntfs
for performance purposes i want to know if there is a stored hash checksum for each file in ntfs fat filesystems

1490441
children	parent
after you ve parsed all your lines the only children of the root will be nodes that have appeared in the parent column and not the child column

1490455
awt	swing
it s really a new generation of gui api like swing was for awt nice graphical components new easy ways to manage layouts really nice features to build dynamic interfaces bindings timers to build animations etc

1490460
int	chars
you don t specify the programming language or the language of the strings is it ascii latin1 utf8 utf16 etc. but basically your compare function would need to either sort the chars in each string and then return the result based on comparison or sum the ordinal values of the chars in each string and return the result of an int comparison between them

1490474
lxml	beautifulsoup
i am trying to learn lxml after having used beautifulsoup

1490480
pull	push
let everyone push into the staging repo and let only the buildmaster pull approved changesets from staging into auto-build when s he is happy with them

1490481
multiplication	exponent
therefore you can use the sum function to add all the logarithms of a column then take the exponent of that sum which gives the aggregate multiplication of that column

1490501
daemons	launchd
now i m writing a launchd daemons that needs to store a password and will run before any user has logged in

1490547
superclass	subclassing
while the instance initializer of the anonymous subclassing at a looks like it assigns a one to its own value instance variable that variable is actually only visible in the superclass of the anonymous class

1490547
inherited	subclassing
the instance variable value is inherited by the anonymous subclassing and it is visible to its instance initializer

1490581
min	max
this will handle the min and max number of pool objects plus object creation timeout and also will queue requests for you

1490582
fadein	hide
no fadein is done because the #message element is visible hide it add the content and fade it in

1490627
unsigned	short
if you really really need to have identical binary information you ll need to create bitfields with bitmasks - you use an unsigned short 16 bit for message and then make things like versionmask 0xe000 to represent the three topmost bits

1490630
httphandler	httpmodule
you could write an httpmodule ot httphandler that wraps the 7zip compression library and handle this in code

when the system show or hide the

1490651
hide	show
information about how to show and hide

1490673
firefox	safari
works for me i tested in ie 6 firefox 3 and safari 4

1490737
x86	64bit
some of the sysinternals tools used similar techniques to extract x64 images of the application from the x86 image and relaunch themselves as 64bit processes w o having to ship two separate exes

1490772
pop-up	dialog
so far i never came close to discover a way to open a modal dialog not a pop-up but the floating div that appears on top while blacken fading the background on top of the parents page

1490812
int	chars
if you are sorting the utf8 chars alphabetically you can convert them to 32-bit int utf8 chars are 1 to 4 8-bit values and then do a radix sort

1490812
skip-lists	tree
there are many ways to match the signatures but i would use a hash table o 1 on average or a o lg n structure such as red-black tree or skip-lists

1490818
extjs	mootools
how different is extjs from others like jquery and mootools

1490848
profiling	debugging
but they are very scenario specific enc profiling debugging and should not be used in general purpose programs

1490854
division	modulo
you may have to use the modulo which returns the remainder of the division of two numbers for example 93 20 equals 13

1490863
division	modulo
the modulo gives you back the remainder after performing the division

1490865
stdout	stderr
i want to redirect the output of both to the same file using redirection operator something like . a.out 2 output.txt but this redirects the stderr how to specify stdout also here

1491003
sorting	filtering
of filtering searching and sorting

1491028
folder	directory
the script itself works perfectly on my local apache setup and goes into each directory and downloads every single file and folder

1491054
equals	gethashcode
a base class for the class you are writing has already provided a equals and gethashcode method and has marked these so that you can provide your own implementation if needed

1491054
equals	gethashcode
this tells the compiler that whenever someone calls equals or gethashcode you want your implementation to be used instead of the one provided in the base class

1491138
nsdocument	nsapplication
i will certainly use coredata whenever i can but nsdocument and normal nsapplication work with coredata so i m not sure if this is relevant to my question

1491145

it explains how to calculate median and other percentile efficiently

1491162
folder	directory
if i understood you correctly you want to create a folder in the output directory as part of the build process

1491168
udp	tcp
udp doesn t have the setup overhead of tcp and can scale to more than 65k concurrent connections

1491197
itunes	iphoto
if you want to manage a single todo list or a single database containing several todo lists an approach similar to iphoto with images or itunes with songs then nsapplication is ok

1491217
folder	directory
otherwise a folder added to the solution has to have something in it which has build action of none or content i think and which has the copy to output directory property set

1491228
put	get
if i put an alert inbetween the ajax calls i get the expected result since the system waits

1491244
rss	feed
basically something that acts like an rss feed to the fanpage wall stream

1491255
postgresql	mysql
whatever rdbms you choose there will be at least one customer who has standardised on a different incompatable rdbms -- if you product is reasonably succesful you will end up maintaining a fork for at least mysql postgresql sqlserver oracle db2 and sybase

1491274
srp	principles
follow srp single responsibility principles

1491275
put	get
but i cannot put these things together to get what i want

1491289
post	get
caching should not be the problem since the urls are different when you send get requests post are most likely not cached at all

1491292
folder	directory
in this directory i have git - which is the folder storing my repository - however when i try

1491334
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
inotifypropertychanged seems not to be a very good fit for collections while inotifycollectionchanged is again only supported in .net 3 and higher

1491445
rss	feed
if the page has an error that you ve already considered -- like an rss feed that you can t get -- then go ahead and show the working part of the page

1491465
ready	each
to get the information using joins it will have to make separate sql queries for each user it fetches whereas if you used include this information is ready for use

1491466
firefox	safari
...but although the text turns red this is just a control the cursor doesn t seem to change in either safari or firefox

1491502
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
i need to create an asp.net application to access a url when this application is live it is able to access the feed url correctly as the clientaccesspolicy.xml and crossdomain.xml are on the server but only allow non-localhost connections so the debug version won t connect

1491502
rss	feed
can be used to pass-through to the rss feed service live url like

1491502
rss	feed
a dummy rss file is not suitable as i need to see various items from the feed

1491562
width	height
i want the images to fit into a specific area of the containing div - an area 40 of the containing div s width and 80 of its height

1491562
width	height
but i don t know ahead of time whether i should specify the width or the height and the partner attribute to auto since i don t know what the aspect ratio of the images will be ahead of time

1491566
ftp	telnet
ftp passwd telnet etc.

1491585
width	height
then set the image to be fixed in height and auto for width

1491611
jar	manifest.mf
then netbeans will not override but enhance the manifest.mf into the jar

1491659
jar	manifest.mf
add manual entries to manifest.mf for the output jar

1491660
packets	pcap
in some cases when setting the snaplen too low when opening the pcap device we might capture only parts of the packets that length will be caplen while len is the original length

1491736
versioning	upgrade
also ntext text image are deprecated and will be removed from a future sql server versioning - so if you can upgrade now

1491742
width	height
the background css is set to fixed position and 100 width and height and it is set as a droppable

1491745
put	get
don t let the scary word put you off this one s oddly satisfying once you get the hang of it

1491814
try-catch	exception-handling
try-catch with custom exception-handling handling is the way to go

1491873
.nettiers	codesmith
i used .nettiers codesmith templates long time ago years and it was proven so strong so it must be more than great now

1491970
perl	tcl
swig is used with different types of languages including common scripting languages such as perl php python tcl and ruby

1491972
jython	jacl
the reason you want to do this is that you will need to deploy the application using wsadmin jacl jython interface to was and you need the was classes on the box to make this work

1492014
jar	manifest.mf
you will need to add a manifest.mf file to the jar for your application under the meta-inf directory - if you use the jar command line tool it will make sure the file ends up in the right place

1492063
put	get
fortunately there is a simple approach to get around this put links on the page to translate it into the other languages based on a querystring parameter

1492080
google-chrome	firefox
the above code works perfectly for ie 6 7 and 8 from firefox 2.0 onwards and also in google-chrome

1492120
pull	push
it s possible to have a pull connection open that effectively allows you to push content to the browser but the polling idea is the simplest

1492142
boost	allocator
if for some technical reason dynamic allocator is out completely you might want to try using boost pool as your allocator as you know you can specify a different std library memory allocator if you don t want to use the default one

1492159
coldfusion	railo
coldfusion 9 will allow you to specify the where to search for application.cfc files just like railo

1492202
post	get
i tried sending get head and post

1492202
post	get
get always produces end begin and post produces begin read

1492219
openssl	libcrypto
you can compile libcrypto openssl for windows but i wouldn t recommend it

1492248
min	max
set the min max and normal width to 0

1492340
hide	show
then you can hide whichever image is set to visible using jquery and get the next image and show it.

1492348
decimal	ieee
which means it probably uses an ieee 754 double-precision floating point representation which only gives about 16-17 decimal digits of precision

1492370
subclass	abstract-class
you would instead use this on a method in an abstract-class in order to enforce its overriding by a subclass

1492379
int	chars
extern void call_log const chars file const chars function const int line const chars args

1492415
telerik	radcombobox
if so i suspect you may be looking at a custom set of controls the telerik controls will allow you to template a radcombobox for example but i don t think there are any standard controls that will allow this

1492444
firefox	safari
it displays in ie 6 firefox safari but not ie 7

1492444
firefox	safari
when i go to the directory page it prompts me for a username password since my account is not within the students group it kicks me to the 401 page which it does in safari ie6 firefox but ie7 it does not it just shows the default page screen shot here

1492468
versioning	upgrade
this is not my first choice and i generally try to avoid them but the problem is the client has different versioning of their middleware on different boxes and is reluctant to upgrade one of them

1492475
min	max
in this case how does the query processor know which of the multiple values in the other columns to output if you don t care then just write a group by on the distinct column with min or max on all the other ones

1492508
bash	zsh
i have a python script that is always called from a shell which can be either zsh or bash

1492549
mantis	bugzilla
so we have this project which uses mantis as bug tracker tool and in the company the corporate bug tracking tool is bugzilla

1492549
mantis	bugzilla
i searched for tools that can be used to migrate from mantis to bugzilla and i only found this m2bz tool which seems to work for mantis 0.17.5 and bugzilla 2.16.3 but seems also kind of dead since 2003.

1492549
mantis	bugzilla
the mantis version used is 1.1.8 and the bugzilla one is 3.0.1

1492601
atof	strtok	fgets	strtok
in c you might use fgets to read one line at a time and strtok or similar to process the lines and atof or sscanf to read the numbers

1492602
bash	zsh
if you have absolute control over the user s environment then put a variable in their profile check the manuals for bash and zsh for a file which is always read at startup

1492602
bash	zsh
that should evaluate to x for zsh and to something else for bash

1492606
freebsd	linux
it supports a lot of systems windows linux freebsd etc a lot of processors x86 x86-64 ia-64 powerpc and so on and compilers

1492607
rss	feed
i m having a vexing time displaying a remote rss feed on an intranet site

1492607
rss	feed
if you open it in a browser you ll see it appears to be an ordinary rss feed

1492607
rss	feed
i ve successfully parsed other rss feed outside our firewall using the same code

1492663
onmouseover	onclick
don t forget onclick onmouseover etc or javascript psuedo-urls or css orâ

1492671
jar	war
first for application servers such as websphere you can have a single ear which contains one or more wars and one or more ejb jars and each war and jar may be deployed to different servers

1492704
slideup	slidedown
with the speed callback arguments added it s a complete drop-in replacement for slideup and slidedown

1492726
int	boolean
the problem is that after saving and retrieving the data back includeinhistory returns what appears to be a standard nsnumber int not typed as boolean

1492735
typedef	struct
changing key_state to typedef struct still causes this error and actually causes a lot more

1492738
docx	xlsx
on september 28 2009 the apache poi project released version 3.5 which officially supports the ooxml formats introduced in office 2007 like docx and xlsx

1492747
typedef	struct
typedef struct key_state key_state

1492748
typedef	struct
if you do not want to write struct all the time you can use a typedef declare key_state similar to device_extension

1492774
typedef	struct
you could should typedef the struct so that you don t need the struct keyword every time you will declare a variable of that type

1492778
google-chrome	firefox
on the first day i thought all was good and well firefox google-chrome showed it precisely as desired then the users came and saw everything was wrong in their explorers center aligned headers

1492783
typedef	struct
when you use device_extension you don t have to do use struct because you are doing a struct definition and a typedef in a single compound statement

1492840
folder	directory
to sum it up without rewriting the document you can allow access to the directory that you wish either through .htaccess files in those folder and .htaccess files can be placed at any level in your directory tree

1492886
superclass	subclassing
the whole point of oop is supposed to be that a subclassing can redefine some of its superclass methods and then operations done at the superclass level will get the subclassing implementation

1492896
notepad++	scite
if instead you want a feature rich text editing component for another project then there s a java binding for the scintilla editor which is quite nice scite or notepad++ use scintilla

1492901
actionlink	redirecttoaction
i have to redirect from this page using http protocol but by default mvc generate all using https actionlink on page or redirecttoaction using

1492912
post	put
put validateinput false above your actionresult in your controller s post methods..

1492939
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
and it so happens that in iphone os 3.0 any uiviewcontroller and subclasses can work in conjunction with a uinavigationcontroller to provide a context aware toolbar

1493011
mp3	wav
when i publish a flash file that contains any sound such as a wav file i can choose the sound compression method mp3 raw adpcm etc.

1493050
voip	sip
i have been tasked with investigating the feasibility of writing an iphone app to access our internal voip sip systems

1493111
profiler	yourkit
yourkit has a .net profiler as well

1493141
public	protected
the private protected public model of c++ became popular because c++ became popular not because it was a great idea

1493141
public	protected
the problem with private protected public and the normal constraints that come along with them is that you can t plan for everyone else s future use of your code

1493186
hide	show
therefore the point is to show it to the search engines and hide it from real users

1493196
public	protected
however it seems my only option is to change setter on each individual field to either internal private protected or public

1493202
mouse	keyboard
i just bought a new keyboard and mouse microsoft natural ergonomic desktop 7000 and it has a neat little zoom lever in the middle of the keyboard

1493233
hide	show
for a more complex solution that allows the user to hide show columns as they wish check out the table column manager

1493247
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
if you are restricted to svn keep reading if not you sound like a prime candidate for dvcs like mercurial git or bazaar

1493251
ant	maven
ideally you would have a standardized build tool maven ant etc. and a build scheduler hudson cruise teamcity etc.

1493254
public	protected
in practice onloginused does exist and when the identifier is changed to public protected everything works just fine

1493262
postgresql	mysql
i m converting a db from postgresql to mysql

1493262
postgresql	mysql
since i cannot find a tool that does the trick itself i m going to convert all postgresql sequences to autoincrement ids in mysql with autoincrement value

1493267
public	protected
this is why they must be protected or public

1493273
swt	styledtext
probably your best bet is to embed other swt widgets in the styledtext

1493293
width	height
after the label text is assigned i set the toast s size to 0 width and 0 height

1493293
hide	show
next i call first show and then hide on the toast

1493382
qnetworkrequest	qnetworkaccessmanager
this ajax call in turn makes qnetworkaccessmanager used by qwebframe create and send a qnetworkrequest

1493418
children	parent
in the dao world the dao framework must somehow inject a hidden field somewhere which allows getchildren to fetch the children of the parent from the db

1493480
int	chars
but - the view has both int and chars values in the item_name column thus i get the syntax error

1493487
getter	setter
now i will be the first to say that this is not necessarily a recommended practice and many practitioners will abhor this and say that every field should have setter getter

1493487
public	protected
granted it causes pain later when i change a field from public to a getter and sometimes when i know what usage a class will have i give it set get and make the field protected or private from the start

1493526
lisp	scheme
dang near everything in lisp scheme is solved by thinking this way

1493544
width	height
you can get the pixel width and height of the output page with

1493557
onresume	onpause
save groups state in activity s onpause method and restore in onresume method

1493564
hash	md5
you can t use a hash function as hashing functions are typically meant to be one-way only given a md5 or sha1 hash you should not be able to decode it to find out what the source message was

1493589
getter	setter
another reason to use getter setter is not relying on implementation details

1493589
getter	setter
in such a case it might help to use setter getter - but that s not the general cas

1493617
google-chrome	safari
en-us applewebkit 532.0 khtml like gecko google-chrome 3.0.195.21 safari 532.0

1493680
webkit	gecko	google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
the four big ones are the one in trident in ie mozilla s gecko kde s webkit at least in safari and google-chrome and opera s presto

1493776
comparator	icomparer
no you can write your custom sorting with comparator and icomparer

1493793
hide	show	post	get
personally i would do it as a single get post and utilize some basic jquery to show hide divs containing the necessary inputs as noted in the first link

1493796
comparator	icomparer
what you will need to do is implement a custom icomparer for the class you are trying to sort and use that comparator when sorting your collection

1493797
post	get
to learn more about get and post method of form submission

1493797
post	get
like cookies get post functions db handling sessions string handling array handling global variables

1493857
fgets	fread
so just read from stdin using fgets fread etc

1493860
post	get
it isn t clunky create is get verify is post of the same url

1493860
post	get
the method that handles the get and the one that does the post use the same view just with different info sent to it

1493903
rss	feed
your page feed.aspx must read the rss feed you want silverlight to display and display it

1493903
rss	feed
use an httpwebrequest in your .aspx page codebehind to get the rss feed data

1493903
rss	feed
your silverlight app will read the data from your local page as if it was a regular rss feed

1493931
doxygen	tex
doxygen generates a library of tex files

1493963
memset	memcmp
memcmp would require you to create a buffer the same size and then use memset to set it all as 0

1494052
mp3	flv

1494511
client-side	server-side
ajax isn t simply a client-side script interacting with a server-side script though

you can try to handle onkeydown and onkeyup events but you ll have to update the bound property yourself

1494544
interbase	firebird
you can use newest version of interbase of the fork of interbase open source named firebird

read from the specific collections where you want the data from the request.form for post and request.querystring for get

1495480
for-loop	loops
i do suggest changing the while loops to the more idiomatic for-loop and handling exceptions

1495482
postgresql	mysql
in postgresql the absolute fastest way to get bulk data in is to drop all indexes and triggers use the equivalent of mysql s load data and then recreate your indexes triggers

1495486
implements	extends
the best way that i would implements this is to create a class that inherits from usercontrol maybe called draggablecontrol that is built with this code then all draggable controls should extends the draggablecontrol

getter	setter
in python you typically don t write getter and setter unless you really have a non-trivial implementation for them at which point you use property descriptors

1495697
post	get
also you could potentially use post instead of get but that s kind of ugly too depending on what exactly you re doing

1495702
centos	linux
this is gdb v6.8 on linux centos v4 32bit

1495740
getter	setter
2 if you needed to have getter and setter functions perhaps to check something in python you can declare special method functions

rss	feed
from what i understand strtotime can easily do mysql dates 2009-09-30 13 00 00 and some others generally from rss feed

1496285
rss	feed
consider looking into two feedparser-based rss aggregators planet feed aggregator and feedjack django based or at least how they solve this problem

1496320
width	height
in the animate function change the width and height to your desired one

1496328
put	get
what the static does here many programmers do not like this type of allocation is that the strings get put into the data segment of the program

1496353
free	malloc
another alternative would be to use malloc to allocate the string in the heap and then free on the correct locations of your code

1496396
google-chrome	firefox
edit2 ok i got it to work in ie but it s obvious now that the corners are made by a bunch of div s and the background doesn t match up - it looks fine in firefox and google-chrome

1496480
pull	push
we generally found it easier if you have to use pull or push to use patches instead

1496496

1496635
firefox	safari
it works fine in firefox but in safari 4 the keyboard select doesn t work

1496647

this works fine if given a single value of y but if i give it a list or a column from a dataframe then the min and max elements give me the minimum value of the whole list

1496657
pop-up	dialog
i have some jquery that pop-up a jquery dialog box when you hover over an image like so

1496695

replace the min max function by pmin pmax

1496855
jobs	cron
this approach is the best for the cron jobs

1496856
versioning	upgrade
after researching i upgrade my imagemagick versioning from 6.3.7 to 6.5.6 and now it is working great

1496865
qtabwidget	qmouseevent
i think you need to create your own class that inherits from qtabwidget and override the mousepressevent qmouseevent protected function in which you can create your context menu on right click

1496904
post	get
there s a post on blogistic reflections blog how he is using emacs ess org-mode to get the html export functionality

1496921
uploadify	swfupload
flash uploadify fanceyupload swfupload

1497002
width	height
i think it s reasonable to assume that the height and width properties would do the same

1497002
width	height
if you don t want this to happen for your window then you must explicitly set either the width and height or the sizetocontent property of the window element depending on your requirements

1497019
innodb	myisam
autoincrement will use the next available id for both innodb and myisam tables but you can manually change it s next position in the following way

1497309
int	double
i have a family of classes that contain only variables of the following types std string int double

1497328
operands	decrement
the second operands is 9 because first term caused a to be decrement

1497332
maven	cargo
if you are strictly following automated smoke tests with selenium cargo testng and maven please note that the author is not really covering the multi-modules project setup i m not saying he s not doing it i m just saying he s not covering that part but only the functional testing project setup

1497332
maven	cargo	maven	pom.xml
he always launch maven from the functest directory never as a reactor from the parent pom.xml and the webapp deployed by cargo in the step 7 is treated like an external dependency

1497355
int	double
now if you want to differentiate a string from a non-string number in this case you can prepend every packet item with a byte code say 0x00 for int 0x01 for double 0x02 for string and branch a switch off depending on what the code is

1497355
int	double
this way you can even write the int double as a byte so you won t lose precision and you ll also end up with a smaller easier to read file

1497360
for-loop	loops
loops through the column names in a cursor for-loop and add them to a string

1497445
rss	feed
rss feed news ticker-type text on a page displaying content from an external source

1497478
int	double
if that s the case then int math.log x+0.5 math.log 10 will be more stable - but realize that double s have only 53 bits of precision so around 10 the 15th double can no longer represent int exactly and this trick won t work then

1497494
maven	pom.xml
i m using maven s exec java to run jline for one of my projects current pom.xml attached below

1497498
post	get
one without parameters for get requests and one with for post

1497541
short	base
my impression is they write the url to a database then use the integer id of the new record as the short url encoded base 36 or 62 letters+digits

1497544
awt	swing
the reason it s ambiguous is people generally don t mix and match the light and heavy-weight frameworks put awt components within a swing component

1497545
filtering	grouping
for the life of me i can t figure out how to work with the values returned by the linq query to be able to then filtering all of the grouping that were returned so that i only have the grouping that have more than one item in them

1497573
range	max
map incrementing integer range to six-digit base 26 max but unpredictably

1497598

1497619
testng	jmockit
i assume the combination testng jmockit with spring 3 isn t bad so that s what i m doing right now but if i m off course selecting the tools for my fresh spring project please tell me right away

1497633
for-loop	arrays
either take the flower initialisation out of the the for-loop to only create the arrays once or do the following

1497670

no libc in ldd output

1497705
getter	setter
for obvious-purpose methods like getter and setter it will also generate good enough comments getx gets x etc.

1497705
getter	setter
what you ll need to do than is to complete the javadoc comments for the classes and methods that are more sophisticated than getter setter or default constructors

1497715
maven	pom.xml
you ve already said this doesn t meet your needs but for others who have a similar problem it is worth noting that you can use the maven scm api to invoke arbitrary scm commands against the repository configured in the scm section of your pom.xml

1497723
post	get
maybe it will help to post what error warning you get when removing sign nil

1497728
int	chars
a 13-digit int is reduced to 7 alphanumeric chars in base 62 for example

1497735
min	max
maybe have the property and other properties to describe the min max values

1497736
rss	feed
this introduces security risks the magic link attack but i ve seen it implemented in rss personalized feed etc

1497794
mouse	keyboard
what i need is the code needed to send a message to windows for it to believe the user is in front of the pc mouse or keyboard activity

1497871
int	chars
printf then truncates the int to a chars prior printing it in the second printf statement

1497881
width	height
in order to do this i need to get the initial width and height of the control to compare it to the resized dimensions

1497887
post	get
however when i set it to run whether the user is logged on or not and check the run with highest privileges option watin can t talk to the browser satisfactorily under windows server 2008 and many other oses without having admin privileges watin can t communicate with it s iexplore.exe instances satisfactorily they start but i get a timeout exception as detailed in this post

1497896
vbscript	jscript
the windowsâ scripting guide provides technical resources information and source code to help you automate the windowsâ operating system using windowsâ script host wsh and the vbscript and jscript scripting languages

1497896
move	drag
i m using a vbscript that makes the window handling work as in linux alt + drag move a window with jus a few lines of code

1497896
vbscript	jscript
you can use any language that has registered itself with windows script host by default vbscript and jscript

1497900
do-while	break
if the clients read that particular message then they will break out of their do-while loops and close the socket connections

1497902
helpers	actioncontroller
if your sidea is tied to your current actioncontroller you can render them from the actions view script and call the sideb view helpers from the layout

1497927
width	height
the type of the width height value is gridlength rather than double

1497933
ioexception	objectinputstream
you can catch which objectinputstream had throws the exception because the closing client generate a ioexception on the server-side then send to the another client a win because you opponent had disconnected

1497950
keydown	keyup
so the behavior is what i want except there is an extra search being done somewhere between the keydown and keyup events

1497993
vbscript	jscript
you can run jscript .js and vbscript .vbs scripts directly in windows

1498034
int	chars
the 51 billionth chars is the last chars of sixhundredseventysixmillionsevenhundredfortysixthousandfivehundredseventyfive and the sum of the int to that point is 413 540 008 163 475 743

1498047
jruby	mri
or ruby 1.8 or 1.9 jruby mri

1498085
int	boolean
in fact most data types string int boolean etc. in python are objects so pretty much every method works in the way you described

1498200
width	height
i have looked in the chapter about xmlui in the extending flash mx 2004 book but all the properties listed there under targetlist are id height width class and required

1498227
vbscript	jscript
it s worth taking the time to get used to creating .wsf files which use an xml-based syntax rather than just running .js jscript or .vbs vbscript files - .wsf files offer much finer control over modularity and allow for better in-file documentation and usage explanations and also allow scripts written in several different languages to be combined which is handy if you find a vbscript that does 40 of what you need and don t want the hassle of converting it to use with the 60 you re writing in jscript

1498229
mouseleave	mouseenter
mouseenter sets it to underlined and mouseleave reverts it

1498316
mousehover	mouseleave
then in my mousehover and mouseleave events i used a new method setfont to change the font

1498343
hide	show
something i ve done in the past is manually show hide the modal popup

1498360
hide	show
then attach some javascript to that attribute so that when it changes it show hide the extra type-specific fields you ve defined

1498416
postgresql	mysql
also this has to run on a number of different databases and platforms so triggers or something similar are not really an option unless they ll run on mysql postgresql sql server and sqllite

stdout	stderr
this is because ramaze and its logging mechanism are keeping references to stdout and stderr prior win32console replace them

1498623
client-side	server-side
but i try to sleep at night by thinking that the folks at ms would not allow their server-side scripts to execute anything that is intended for the client-side

1498627
getter	setter
worse you completely replace the backing store in your derived setter so your getter is checking a completely different variable than the one you set

1498627
getter	setter
as for the first question when overriding properties in vb.net you always need to override both the getter and the setter even if you just replace it with an identical implementation

1498638
inherited	properties
an overriding properties declaration must specify the exact same accessibility modifiers type and name as the inherited properties

1498638
accessor	properties	inherited	properties
if the inherited properties has only a single accessor if the inherited properties is read-only or write-only the overriding properties must include only that accessor

1498638
accessor	properties	inherited	properties
if the inherited properties includes both accessor if the inherited properties is read-write the overriding properties can include either a single accessor or both accessor

1498662
post	get
to get the ordered list of post i know you can do

1498670

post	get
i read linq in action to help me get to this solution and then this post also helped me greatly

1498704
children	parent
if the parent elements and the children elements have some common attributes you could examine the composite design pattern

1498871
getter	setter
do you have both a getter and a setter for the property

1498928
opera	firefox
i m having issues with it on opera and ie while on firefox it works

where would you put them how would you get them there and how would you use them

1498969
perl	tcl
i want to generate bindings for python java .net php perl tcl ruby and octave automatically

1498977
kde	gnome
i don t think there s a portable way to do this at all but the linux world gnome and kde adhere to the freedesktop thumbnail standard which can be read at

1499036
integer	unsigned
only is a promotion like only integer types smaller than int to int and for some exotic platforms to unsigned int are promotions

1499047
daemon	cron
cron4j is a scheduler for the java 2 platform which is very similar to the unix cron daemon

1499047
jobs	cron
oddjob s goal is to provide some order and visibility to all the batch files and cron jobs that tie an enterprise s critical business processes together

1499051
onfocus	onblur	onclick	onfocus
if you need the event to trigger but don t want to use onclick use onfocus or onblur

1499099
pull	push
if i understand your problem correctly and you control the content of all the frames and all the frame content is from the same domain you can trigger an onload event on the bottomright frame to pull the data from topright rather than trying to push it

1499099
pull	push
bottomright can even invoke a function in topright and ask it to push the data which in my mind is still a form of pull

1499101
rss	feed
iâ m very new to programming with rss feed to please forgive me if this sounds like a really general question

1499104
onclick	onchange
just to add you can force ie to trigger the onchange event using the onclick event so if you are allowed use the onclick event to trigger the change event this should do it

1499121
vb.net	vb6
it seems the only solution is to manually generate the idl and then import it back into .net as in this thread using vb.net with vb6

1499132
rss	feed
you can use the syndicationfeed class to work with rss feed in .net

1499171
puts	gets
i ve noticed that the .aspx that gets rendered puts a tag on the link itself

1499189
hide	show
my method was to really put everything in one huge index.html file and to hide or show certain content

1499267
kerberos	ntlm
it seems that java doesn t have great ntlm library support so i ve been working on the assumption that i d have to use kerberos which java seems to support much better via the gss-api

1499284
integer	unsigned
stuff the ip into a 32-bits unsigned integer do the same with the subnet s address -mask both with and compare

1499306
public	protected
declare c# code behind variable either public or protected and then us it in block

1499308
google-chrome	safari
i am working on a php script that automatically displays an image based on certain elements which don t matter for the sake of the question since that part works perfectly fine. out of the browsers i have tested it in the images are correctly displayed on google-chrome internet explorer and safari

1499308
opera	firefox
however they do not appear on firefox or opera

1499308
opera	firefox
in firefox nothing is displayed and in opera the path of the image is which should be

1499322
post	get
for example i want to get post from author ivan to show on a page

1499385
portrait	landscape
you can use different layouts for portrait and landscape mode in folders layout-port layout-land which will be auto-loaded on screen orientation change

1499385
width	height
as of now the closest thing to percentage width height is the linearlayout.layoutparams layout_weight which determines how much of the remaining space from 0 to 1 to be occupied by the given view element

1499465
apache	lighttpd
unlike a proper server like lighttpd whose cpu usage is undetectable the crummy via c7 was serving 100 http hits s and lighttpd used less than 1 cpu apache will kill your box

1499499
innodb	myisam
however you are not using myisam since this is important data you are using innodb which needs the alter table statement quoted above

1499501
children	parent
if i expose student as a resource my question is whether i should always return the parent school and the children classes along with that student or whether there should be parm that the user includes to indicate such

1499513
floating-point	fractions
when you first set up the timer calculate the interval which might have to be a floating-point value assuming that won t cripple performance and also the target time of the first timer fire again you might need fractions

1499517
atexit	main
you ll still get some crt code most notably related to startup that which calls main and shutdown atexit handling etc but otherwise the linker won t link crt functions that you do not use

1499523
folder	directory
the aforementioned file ctrl_word.h is indeed not present in any of the above-mentioned folder and yet the build system has no problem finding it by looking up the additional include directory

1499532
post	get
i can run javascript like popup a window that says please wait and show a little spinning icon but firefox refuses to send ajax post get while the main page is loading

1499555
button	checkbox
when you deselect a checkbox a button appears that allows you to delete the item from the list

1499570
folder	directory
tools - option - projects solution - vc++ directory - add your folder

1499590
width	height
you simply need to resize the width and then calculate the new height assuming width to height ratio is same as original then if the height is not equal to the preferred height you need to draw a black rectangle cover background and then centre the image

1499590
width	height
you could also do a pillarbox but then you do the exact same as above except that width becomes height and height becomes width

1499590
width	height
edit actually you resize the one that is the biggest if width is bigger you resize that and if height is bigger then you resize that

1499619
google-chrome	firefox
with multiple versions of browsers ie 6 7 8 multiple brands ie mozilla firefox google-chrome in use. whatever you try you cannot get the best in everything

1499630
google-chrome	safari
i have seen some posts of the asp menu and the browsers google-chrome and safari here but nevertheless i think the problem that i have is different than other problems

1499640
post	get
otherwise consider changing the query to use post instead of get so the parameters don t show up in the url

1499645
inotifypropertychanged	ieditableobject
let s say for arguement s sake that the above code has all the proper structure to handle the events in inotifypropertychanged and ieditableobject

1499674
unsigned	short	integer	unsigned
the short answer to your question as you found out is to use unsigned integer to avoid bringing in the sign bit and that s all fine

1499740
put	get
so far if we put all this together we get the following in fsi

1499755
sproutcore	cappuccino
maybe you should check sproutcore apple used it for mobileme or cappuccino these are javascript frameworks to make exactly that designing desktop-like interfaces that only fetch responses from the server via json or xml

1499805
ada	pascal
ada and pascal

1499808
pop-up	dialog
you can use it s spy tool to get the class name of the dialog you re interested in and use winwait or winwaitactivate to see when it pop-up and then the send command to send the enter key

1499819
apache	lighttpd
i believe both apache and lighttpd have dav extensions

1499875
rss	feed
i want to display an rss feed from feedburner on my website however i d like to be able to apply an xslt to it as well

1499892
cout	cin
finally a warning avoid stream io std cin and std cout

1499918
src	attr
if i type attr src image.jpg it works also if i alert response it gives me image.jpg but if i put attr src response it doesnt work

1499926
hash	md5
scons uses md5 hash rather than file mod times to determine if a dependency needs to be built

1499926
hash	md5
and that would force scons to build all files depending on foobar.h whereas just typing scons would do the regular build using md5 hash for dependency checking

1499933
superclass	subclassing
the superclass has a property which you can use to uniquely identify objects of that superclass and because caltask is a subclassing it too has that property

1499943
nsbutton	nsmenu
basically you create something like an nsbutton that has an nsmenu attached to it then use nstoolbaritem s setview method to embed the button in the toolbaritem

1499966
teamsite	interwoven
we own licences for interwoven teamsite and we use it to manage our content for our externally-facing internet site our main intranet and a couple of big internal knowledge exchanges

1499977
strncmp	strcmp
strcmp and strncmp to compare two strings

1499977
strstr	strcmp	strstr	substr
strstr to find a substr in a string probably easier and faster than using the strchr strcmp combination

1499996
ggplot2	lattice
for the plot you can use either lattice as in the above example or the ggplot2 package

1500006
int	chars
you will have to read the int chars by chars and roll your own implementation of bigints which is the difficulty of the problem here i surmise

1500008
folder	directory
i want to create a windows service that schedules tasks much like the windows o e but it would run c# assembles dynamically from a local folder schedule rules via a xml file for that task so i don t have to create a windows service or console application every time i want some automation code but can build an assembly upload it to a directory with a xml config for the timing and it will run be detected b a folder watcher

1500053
put	get
and if you look in the code you can see the php code hidden by firefox - which is the behaviour you get if you put php code on a plain html page

1500057
yacc	bison
technically bison . if the shell is really really simple like a homework shell yacc may be overkill

1500116
imagemagick	libtiff
tesseract seems to use libtiff for it s io imagemagick seems to use libtiff for it s tiff handling so i figured i should somehow be able to use imagemagick with tesseract without meddling in the filesystem and additional unessesary disk io

1500118
hash	md5
keep in mind though that you don t want to make the hash too obvious so that a determined attacker would easily figure it out just taking the md5 of 2134 or whatever number you had

1500135
cpu	irq
all those f tell us that the interrupt load from irq 21 is load balanced between all cpu s

1500155
actionscript	mxml
i m trying to convert an mxml component to an actionscript class

1500192
subclass	abstract-class
up until a few minutes ago i was having a similar problem with an interface abstract-class and concrete subclass

1500324
width	height
it takes the image width height bpp and the raw uncompressed data which you should be able to get from imagemagick

1500327
itunes	iphoto
it is also what apple has implemented in iphoto or itunes

1500333
post	get
i posted this post some days ago but the answer here didn t really help me because i can t even get the value from a textbox on the new page

1500348
coalesce	isnull
sticking to your logic and not using isnull or coalesce try this

1500374
mouseup	mousedown
i am dong it this way as my table view for some strange reason does not recognize mousedown or mouseup or menuforevent events

1500377
ant	maven
there are also dependency management builders maven and ant being two popular ones that can package up projects with their dependencies inside

1500377
ant	maven
this is one reason why using an ide like eclipse and build tools like maven or ant are so nice in large projects as when you have 20 dependencies for a project that can become pretty unmanageable

1500423
dokuwiki	screwturn
we re trying dokuwiki screwturn and mediawiki

1500462
pylons	turbogears
if you d rather have easy database code you want to use an orm you re better off going with a turbogears pylons plain wsgi project probably hosted using apache and mod_wsgi

1500467
next	except
the default tempdata provider uses the session so there really isn t much of a distinction except that your tempdata is cleared out at the end of the next request

1500490
maven	m2e
i recommend using maven eclipse and m2e

1500539
post	get
warning given your question i think there is a slight misconception concerning the difference better the lack of a difference between get and post requests

1500539
post	get
get and post are just two different but mostly equivalent methods of transmitting data from the client to the server

1500539
post	get
since post is better suited to transfer large amounts of data or difficult formatted data it is the established standard for submitting forms but it is in no way safer unsafer or more less secure than get requests

1500539
post	get
with a get request the token does exactly the same as with a post request - it proves to the server that the submitted data comes from the same browser on the same machine as the request he build the form for

1500551
jsf	seam
i would suggest to learn seam as it builds further on jsf an industry standard

1500584
cos	sin	cos	exp
edit for intensive i mean a lot of sin cos exp happening in tight loops

1500586
int	double
a double is not an int and d and f are not interchangeable

1500588
hex	binary
some libraries put the binary content encoded as hex characters

1500589
getter	setter
i should totally remove the setter-method for the id property and just have a getter for it and then have setter and getter for the other properties that make up the id

1500600
range	max
if the colour range are continous your example is missing 1.25-1.5 and are guaranteed to cover all possble values in the matrix file i would first have built a using the max value from the colour file as map key

1500648
hide	show
you could have a bunch of divs that all start hidden then onmouseover show the proper one and hide the others

1500672
post	get
irrespective you ll probably find that you get more answers if you do the ground work yourself and then post questions for any specific architecture design implementation issues you get stuck on

1500677
gif	png
you can find this information quite readily on the internet in each format s spec jpg bitmaps gif png whatever

1500678
post	http-get
my browser retrieves the contents of a thread by doing an http-get to forum secret-board im-going-to-kill-my-brother post

1500689
dlsym	dlopen
main.cpp - line 106 to 164 invoke dlopen dlsym dlclose

1500705
cos	sin
for the basic sin cos log functions i would not expect much difference

1500707
vim	emacs
i m not interested in solutions involving vim emacs

1500744
post	get
i gather that there basically isn t a limit to the amount of data that can be sent when using rest via a post or get

1500746
post	get
use jquery to post the type of query you want to get

1500777
put	get
no matter what protections you put in place they will find a way to get around them

1500843
serializable	deserialization
if you need to reliably serializable your components you re probably better off writing your own serializable deserialization methods

1500843
inherited	properties
the most appropriate way to do this would be by creating a base component one that inherited from uicomponent that offers these serialization methods and have each inheriting class override it with its additional properties

1500843
super	extends
finally each extends class should call the super method to get the serialized properties of the base class

1500850
hide	show
the only image you will see in the markup example above is images thumbnail-image1.jpg lightbox will automatically hide the rest of them and then show each one at the appropriate time

1500903
hide	show
create all of your drop down lists in the view and pass all the select lists through the view data and then hide or show them based on your selected product

1500933
unix	sunos
on some unix machines certainly all sunos you could link a setuid shell script to a file called -i

1500939
getter	setter
anyway your problem is easy to solve with getter setter

1500962
hide	show
the mouseenter on all the menu items hide all those same div s except it show the one that has identical text inside the menu item s link and the submenu s h2 header

1500962
mouseleave	mouseenter
to keep the submenu visible while the mouse is on it add mouseleave and mouseenter handlers for div.submenu div as well

1500973
pylons	turbogears	django	turbogears
rather the difference between django and grok - or pylons or turbogears - is really one of approach

1501070
switching	screens
press to switching to command mode - you will see the cursor at the bottom of the screens

1501075
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
which works swimmingly in firefox opera google-chrome and safari

1501105
hide	show
i m not married to this javascript solution in fact i tried a few other methods of my own using simple javascript show hide methods

1501256
hash	md5
you cannot un-hash sha1 md5 or any other one-way hash method unfortunately

1501305
vbscript	jscript
the best option i ve heard for that is apache asp although it does have limitations such as not handling vbscript or jscript without 3rd party commercial tools

1501310
sqldatasource	detailsview
when users go to a specified page i have a detailsview attached to a sqldatasource and already setup in insert mode

1501334
vb.net	vb6
here an example of custom windows messages vb.net vb6 and c# interprocess communication via window messaging

1501381
onmousedown	onmouseup
it also doesn t have a onmousedown or onmouseup event

1501389
accessor	properties	subclass	accessor
goalnavigationcontroller should be a properties or an accessor in your uiviewcontroller subclass

1501394
rss	feed
basically i need to create a php document that will read an rss feed and the write the information to a mysql document

1501406
range	max
if requestedsize bigger than preferred size but fit into max size of the range

1501406
range	max
if requestedsize bigger than max size of the range

1501417
rss	feed
that will get the rss feed into usable parts

1501453
streamingmarkupbuilder	xmlslurper
for this kind of work i tend to use xmlslurper along with the streamingmarkupbuilder

1501492
pkcs#12	pfx
the constructor you are using data password is intended to be used to get a certificate from a pkcs#12 file pfx file

1501500
hide	show
i m on the hunt for a text editor for windows that will let me enter text in either regex or grep-style syntax and automatically show hide the relevant lines

1501505
int	double
so you should be able to implicitly convert any float into a double but not the other way around just like you can convert any short int -32 768 to +32769 into a long - 2 billion to + 2 billion bit not the other way around

1501506
children	parent
i don t know whether root node and child node are the same class a child node might be a subclass of root node because both types of node have children but only child nodes have a parent node

1501586
maven	cargo
another option would be to use the cargo maven plugin

1501588
expression-blend	silverlight
for me the open in expression-blend is only available in silverlight projects for wpf projects the option does not exist

1501602
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
but if you wanted it to work on ff3 opera safari and google-chrome then you can implement it but it would have to be done by hand as i don t know of any javascript library to do something like this

1501622
vbulletin	phpbb
thus they go after popular packages like phpbb and vbulletin because getting into those will get them into a lot of sites

1501641
mp3	wav
update after reading your question again i realized that it might actually be possible to do what you re discussing in javascript even if the files are in mp3 format and not wav

1501641
mp3	wav
to locate the silent stretches you wouldn t necessarily need to convert the frequency-domain data of an mp3 file back into the time-domain of a wav file

1501642
post	get
and yes you must code your app around the webrequest.begingetrequeststream for post s with content and webrequest.begingetresponse for get s and post s

1501646
put	get
then while i was trying to wedge all those actions into a consistent url scheme i found myself wanting to put some information into the get requests that seemed a tad sensitive

1501731
for-loop	arrays
if this is a dynamic arrays have your for-loop go from 0 to high data

1501736
many-to-many	one-to-many
it simply has a one-to-many relationship with suppliers or perhaps many-to-many

1501763
hash	md5
i want users to be able to enter in variable-length passwords so i decided to hash the password with md5 and then use the hash as the key

1501771
hash	md5
md5 sha-0 sha-1 are all broken hash and you should not use them for any cryptographic purpose use sha-2

1501802
submit	submission
it is similar to what you would do after submission a form submit the form to a page that enters the data to the database then pass the browser along to a new page telling them it is complete

1501834
lisp	scheme
my own advice for a completely different language would be scheme -- basically lisp with a good housecleaning

1501842
tapestry	wicket
for example wicket tapestry and javaserver faces allow you to think in terms of components buttons labels drop-down list etc instead of http protocols

1501861
button	checkbox
unfortunately the behavior is a bit strange in ie in that for a checkbox or a radio button field the event doesn t fire when it is supposed to right when you click the option you want to choose but instead it only fires when you click elsewhere on the page form or if you explicitly call blur

1501908
folder	directory
the default is the first one which means xcode creates a yellow folder in your project but it ll ignore the directory hierarchy on disk when time comes to generate the output bundle

1501918
hide	show
although it wont show hide based on a regex textpad will allow you to search and produce a hyperlinked result file with the lines that will allow you to click into the actual log

1501963
cos	sin
it even has support for mathematical functions like sin cos tan their inverses dtor log ..

1501971
rss	feed
i am trying to configure rss feed for a pages library in moss

1501971
rss	feed
enable rss feed in site collection

1501971
rss	feed
enable and configure the rss feed on the list to display the description

1502021
versioning	upgrade
i don t know that the different versioning of the framework would process the same code differently so i would bet that the difference is code that you ve modified as part of your upgrade to 2.0

1502025
getter	setter
but this goes against oo best practices by which myitems should be private and only accessed via setter and getter

1502027
rss	feed
part of an app i m building needs to check rss feed for updates

1502027
rss	feed
and i know that a few years ago when i was maintaining a podcast rss feed manually i never changed the item

1502027
rss	feed
so i need some way to reliably check rss atom etc feed for new entries since they were lasted checked

1502069
rss	feed	rss	icalendar
i m looking at the yahoo pipe as the basis for converting rss feed into icalendar format

1502117
hide	show
command to show and hide the popup

1502187
floor	sqrt
2 set the lower bound of c to be max of b + 1 and floor sqrt a 2 + b 2 - 1

1502194
globalization	localization
localization and globalization topics in msdn are your best bet for this

1502296
ironruby	ironpython
if you implement the bulk of your dynamic code in ironpython ironruby you can easily integrate it with your c# code anyway

1502307
mouseup	mousedown
since silverlight 2 beta 2 many controls dont fire the mousedown mouseup events and i believe that slider is one of them

1502347
ubuntu	debian
it is for debian or ubuntu

1502393
children	parent
if all your selects are siblings children of one parent use previoussibling to detect prev select

1502446
versioning	upgrade
while later versioning of java will be able to execute that bytecode you can t upgrade it later versioning of the class files have a different format

1502482
post	get
a method decorator also gives you more control - eg you could allow get requests unauthenticated but still require authentication for post requests

1502500
post	get
i need to implement an application to post request to a given url and get response

1502509
gif	png
so gif jpeg png are supported

1502518
int	double
it seems that int will be returned as string you could asume that the same applies to double

1502518
vbscript	jscript
if it returns a script-based object such as an object created using jscript or vbscript s new operator it will be of type object .

1502557
google-chrome	firefox
which works perfectly well with firefox and google-chrome

we are evaluating to upgrade castle windsor container to versioning 2 which was released in may this year

1502639
ubuntu	debian
the 2 downsides are you ll need to do this for each distribution debian ubuntu suse redhat is probably a good start and you will need to maintain them as time goes on some libraries will no longer be available in a specific version and thus the user will get dependency problems

1502721
build-helper-maven-plugin	pom.xml
alternatively it is possible to attach additional artifacts to a build so they are deployed alongside the primary artifacts assuming they ve already been packaged you can use the build-helper-maven-plugin to attach an arbitrary file to your pom.xml so it will be deployed with the specified classifier

width	height
a side note - if you want to randomly position a movieclip on the stage you should use stage.stagewidth and stage.stageheight otherwise you are only getting the width and height of objects on the stage not the stage itself

1502955
memcached	apc
in my situation on a high traffic site where i need all the memory i can for memcached and apc and all the other server activities i am just curious if i should use it or not the only real reason it comes in handy for me is for redirecting pages sending headers i should say after a header has already been sent my site has header body footer file setup so sometime i need to redirect depending on what is in the body file so if the header is already shown ion screen that creates a problem using output buffering is 1 solution but there are other solutions so just curious about performance

1502961

1503420
width	height
it seems like the width and height are set to 16 pixels in the panel class createchildren method

1503452
int	chars
so implicitly converting from chars to int will work in c#

1503452
int	chars
edit as others pointed out a chars is a 16-bit number in c# so this conversion is just from a 16-bit int to a 32-bit int which is possible without data-loss. edit

1503453
int	chars
the chars is implicitly cast to it s unicode numeric value which is an int

1503460
int	double
â from int to long float double or

1503460

1503478
int	chars
here chars is 16 bit and int is 32 bit

1503516
serializable	deserialization
if you only ever want to store an array of numbers then writing your own manual serializable deserialization routine would work

1503598
for-loop	arrays
use enumerate in the for-loop instead of len .. and arrays lookups for neater code

why not define a protected virtual method that creates the excrement and keep the public property that returns the excrement non virtual

1503934
for-loop	loops
defining the logic using exceptions where a for-loop or any form of loops would suffice

1503946

implements	extends
then i d extends the textbox control to create a new spellcheckedtextbox which implements ispellcheckable

1504071
gif	png
the compression of images at least for gif and png images are based on repetition so if you make the image larger by repeating it the extra image size will add very little to the file size

1504133
width	height
update the code in the link above physically resizes and saves the image if your intention is to resize the image file in order to save space otherwise as mentioned you could just manually set the height width on the image control

1504136
width	height
if you load up an image then you can just set the width height properties

1504243

1504302
try-catch	exception-handling
the only exception-handling thrown in the try-catch are my own

1504316
udp	tcp
there are certain issues if you are dealing with a severely high traffic environment one is the choice of filesystem reiserfs performs 5-10x better than ext3 because of some internal caching of the fs tree it does not have udp support tcp keepalive is quite an overhead if you use sharedance only memcached has udp thanks to the facebook team and scaling is usually done on your aplication by sharding data across multiple instances of sharedance servers

1504359
int	chars
i tried long int short chars chars but none of them worked

1504371

however you can restore only the system catalog tablespace syscatspace a temporary tablespace like tempspace1 and the tablespace you want into a new database

1504475
post	get
the only way is to use javascript then get the javascript to post to it to your php if you really need there res server side

1504488
division	modulo
modulo returns the remainder that is left after division

1504576
put	get
be sure to keep the id s sufficiently different that internet explorer doesn t get confused it has namespace bugs around id and name it tends -- completely incorrectly -- to put them in the same namespace

1504590
scipy	scikits
the standard approach to solving this is using expectation maximization scipy svn includes a section on machine learning and em called scikits

1504608
disk	ram
i know i can measure different things like cpu usage ram usage disk io etc but is there a generic load measure for example the server is at 40 load etc

if you really want to just see how a large project works in vs grab something like ironruby or ironpython or even something like the witty twitter client

1504631
children	parent
basically a given branch of the tree may be found under more than one parent branch but wherever it is found it has the same children

1504631
children	parent
likewise there s no problem with multiple children per parent

1504631
children	parent
however given a category s id its children will be the same regardless of what parent category led you there

1504660
put	get
if you need to get a cwnd object that doesn t put its hwnd reference in the temporary handle map you can call fromhandlepermanent

1504682
getter	setter
the setter method created is named setfido and the getter method is just named fido

1504682
getter	setter
when you specify readonly i believe that simply tells the compiler not to create the setter method but only the getter

1504683
firefox	safari
this just doesnt work in firefox or safari

1504697
switching	screens
the bottom of the screens switching to

1504730
tolower	toupper
also the tolower or toupper function in might help you

1504733
cout	cin
use std cout or std cin or std cin.getline .. instead of what you are using

1504757
getter	setter
the setter and getter for the datasource is not the appropriate place for that code

1504801
keydown	keyup
note that keycode is part of the args passed for keydown and keyup but not for keypress

1504812
gridview	datalist
from what i know the datalist control does not contain a built-in paging mechanism like the gridview control however there are a few ways round it

1504820
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
the original application stores user s passwords in a md5 hash format with no salt in the database

1504838
keydown	keyup
however the noncharacter keys do raise the keydown and keyup events

1504865
salt	md5
i had a similar situation recently- an old application of mine used a salt md5 and i very much wanted to upgrade without affecting my users

1504865
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
for example my initial hash was md5 pass + salt

1504899
profiling	instrumentation
i am profiling my iphone application with the activity monitor instrumentation

1504938
next	except
the second line does something similar except when you are working with an array in php you can use the operator to automatically add another element to the array with the next available index

1504956
post	get
if you can recreate the list on the server side then all you need to do is post the index of the list that you want to get a handle on

1504956
post	get
this is using a get if you want a post you can do that and make the listindex a hidden field

1504959
int	chars
first code which has an implicit conversion from chars to int note this is not an implicit cast this is an implicit conversion is legal because the c# specification clearly states that there is an implicit conversion from chars to int and the compiler is in this respect a correct implementation of the specification

1504959
int	chars
a chars is implemented as an unsigned 16 bit int that represents a chars in a utf-16 encoding so it can be converted to a ushort without loss of precision or for that matter without change of representation

1504959
int	chars
and since chars to ushort is a good idea it seems reasonable that char-to-anything-that-ushort-goes-to is also reasonable hence chars to int

1504959
int	chars
which take chars and int which means

1504959
int	chars
when calling a method overloaded as m int and m chars when you pass it a ushort odds are good that you want to treat the ushort as a number not as a chars

1504959
int	chars
there is a long tradition in c programming of treating chars as int -- to obtain their underlying values or to do mathematics on them

1504961
integer	fractions
for example when casting a float to an int the data is actually transformed from the form used to represent floating point values usually an exponent mantissa form to a plain old integer with any fractions part lost

1504967
profiling	instrumentation
i ve seen this cause incorrect results in instrumentation memory profiling since those instances will hang around

1505008
tinymce	freetextbox
there are many text area replace editors such as fckeditor or freetextbox but my current favorite is tinymce editor

1505021
vmware	virtualbox
now an iso seems to work with virtualbox because i can tell it to mount a cd dvd drive and use the iso instead of a physical drive but the vmdk and vmx files are always listed as being for use with vmware virtualbox

1505056
public	protected
the class is not public so it can only be extended by other classes in the same package and m is protected so it can be accessed by derived classes

1505065
public	protected
alternately you could create a protected or public even get function

1505073
google-chrome	firefox
this is working fine in ie7+ firefox and google-chrome

1505115
daemons	launchd
i have my own launchd daemons starting an app launchd when the install starts

1505131
wxpython	pyqt
the different solutions that popped in my head were to use a gui library like wxpython or pyqt or maybe even a pdf generator like reportlab

1505156
vmware	virtualbox
vmdk vmx are vmware file formats but you can use it with virtualbox just create a new virtual machine and when asks for a hard disk choose use an existing hard disk and click on the button with folder and green arrow image on the combo box right which opens virtual media manager it looks like this you can open it directly pressing ctrl+d on main window or in file virtual media manager menu .

1505190
subtract	add
i d like to add some functionality where users can enter + or - to add subtract a day from the value

1505201
post	get
so #1 and #2 work great but how to get the #3 to display the single post that it is supposed to - for example from link the post titled one-post should be displayed

1505210
des	aes
closer to just strings is symmetric key cryptography aes des xdes rc4 where your application has a secret key used both to encrypt and decrypt

1505251
scrummaster	sprint
so when he she is not doing scrummaster duties they default back to burning down tasks on the sprint backlog

1505269
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
using class table inherited it is recommended that the subclassing refers to the superclass and not the other way around

1505274
children	parent
i am going over the children in a loop and call every child s clone method and then add it to the parent

1505328
comparator	comparable
the type info e is needed for methods like comparator e o which requires type info during class declaration comparable

1505356
public	protected
access rights are controlled by whether the member has been declared in the public private or protected sections of the class definition

1505365
cvs	svn
so we re gradually moving all our projects across into svn from cvs

1505383
int	boolean
a b is a boolean expression that returns a boolean and a b is a bitwise expression that returns an int if a and b are int

1505458
public	protected
other access modifiers are protected meaning they can be accessed by other class functions and in functions in classes that inherit from this class and public meaning they re fair game for everybody to use

1505476
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
that table is inherited from the superclass of a particular class and extended with regard to the new methods of a subclassing

1505491
xna	slimdx

1505532
awt	swing
generally swing components should be used from the awt event dispatch thread edt

1505549
postgresql	mysql
is there a way to do this with a single query hopefully a generic method that would work with mysql postgresql sql-server and oracle

1505597
many-to-many	many-to-one
hibernate does not support such many-to-many mappings so you ll have to decompose them into many-to-one mappings instead

1505613
uiview	uiwindow
it just so happens that uiwindow is a subclass of uiview we we can easily disable user interactions for out whole app

1505637
java.util.calendar	java.util.date
as an aside i would personally recommend that you avoid java.util.date and java.util.calendar completely and use joda time instead

1505645
inherited	properties
if your myclass extends anotherclass it inherited all the methods and properties of anotherclass except those marked private

1505667
floating-point	fixed-point
unfortunately there is no fixed-point arithmetic in javascript - all numbers are double-precision floating-point numbers

1505674
maven	pom.xml
one final alternative if you re on maven 2.1.0+ is to deactivate the profile via the command line for the parent pom.xml only this is still obviously not ideal

1505675
int	double
currently the calculations where int pow double a double b is included are wrong

1505675
g++	gcc
but here is the odd part i made my script in linux with geany and g++ gcc compiler and had just pow a b the script compiled and worked fine

1505675
int	double
in dev-c++ the script didn t compile with an error int from double

1505723
button	checkbox
you could make all the fields checkbox or add another table called #attributesgroups and group some together and use radio button

1505727
public	protected
the myclass class now has access to all the methods of anotherclass that are public or protected

1505743
int	double
instead of casting the double to an int in the int pow double a double b line try rounding the results of pow and then cast to int if necessary

1505770
ant	maven
if you have a well documented build procedure in place either using ant or custom scripts i would suggest it is less important to introduce maven than to add unit tests

1505774
mouseup	mousedown
again i ve attached preventdefault-ing mousedown mouseup and click handlers to all of the elements involved but it doesn t help

1505788
subtract	add
then you can add or subtract 1 or as much as you want and convert back into an ip address

1505794
onmouseover	onclick
i changed the onclick event to onmouseover event and it seems to work fine

1505968
folder	directory
if you need to remove a whole directory folder from the staging area use

1506012
firefox	safari
i recently designed a site in drupal and it is perfect in firefox and safari but wont display correctly in ie6 or ie7

1506023
rss	feed
in this first script of mine in which i m parsing twitter rss feed entries and inserting the results into a database there is one remaining problem that i cannot fix

1506023
rss	feed
as a bit of background i originally found a base script on halotis.com for downloading rss feed and then modified it in several ways 1 modified to account for idiosyncracies in twitter rss feed it s not separated into content title url etc.

1506023
rss	feed
rssfeeds which contains a list of twitter rss feed

1506023
rss	feed
in short the script below grabs the five test rss feed from the rss feed table downloads the 20 latest entries tweets from each feed parses the entries and puts the information into the rss entries tags and entry_tag tables

1506086
width	height
we need the ability to gracefully resize any photo image to an exact width height without skewing the image

1506086
width	height
resizing the width to 200px would proportionately put the height at 128px so that extra 28px would be cropped off of the top and bottom

1506086
width	height
resizing the width to 200px proportionately put the height at 80px so we would need to catch that and resize by height first

1506086
width	height
putting the height at 100px would proportionately put the width at 250px

1506086
width	height
resizing the width to 200px would proportionately put the height at 238px so that extra 138px would be cropped off of the top and bottom

1506189
packets	pcap
write an inputformat that reads pcap files returning something like longwritable for the key the nth packets in the file and packetwritable as the value containing the pcap data

1506212
rss	feed
data can be mails rss feed etc.

1506223
subtract	add
you have to add one because it s subtract and thus if the first of the given month is sunday you d end up with 0

1506232
cdr	cons
then customise erc-keywords which can contain regexps and cons cells where the regexp is in the car and the face in the cdr

1506235
width	height
the algorithm for fitting an image into a given rectangle isn t too tricky work out the ratios of width height for both the image and the target then resize based on either width or height

1506320
maven	pom.xml
as pointed out the maven way to launch a goal lets say mvn install on a set of modules is to organize them as a multi-module project and to launch the goal on the parent pom.xml

1506337
sequence	permutation
note that if we take our algorithm to permute a list using our index sequence and apply it to the identity permutation 0 1 2 ... n-1 we get the inverse permutation represented in the common form

1506427
public	protected
you are using a third party framework which allows you to extend by overriding protected virtual methods the path from the public methods to these virtual methods are generally treated as black box programming and will have all sorts of dependancies that the framework provides that you don t want to know about

1506429
rss	feed
data can be mails rss feed etc.

1506445
yacc	bison
so i m doing a parser where i favor flexibility over speed and i want it to be easy to write grammars for no tricky workaround rules fake rules to solve conflicts etc like you have to do in yacc bison etc.

1506464
hash	md5
string comparison will be more efficient than either crc32 or md5 or any other hash algorithm proposed

1506482
int	double
c++ standard doesn t have int pow int int it has double pow double int float .

1506505
inherited	properties
then my child class would have his own properties and should inherited from my identitybase

1506518
children	parent
for instance if you want to animate the switching from list to grid this wont help you since it will only animate to parent styles to its own new styles not its children

1506568
tabcontrol	tabitem
i m trying to style a tabcontrol and have got 75 of the way there but i m having difficulty styling the actual tabitem

1506575

further if i reverse the mappings put a ilist carriers on the company entity and try to get a filtered list of companies by a carrier it works every time but i don t know why

1506587
fflush	gets
as far as fflush current behavior i ve looked into trying to break this out but it gets very complicated - inserts which depend on deletes would have to execute after the deletes but updates which depend on inserts would have to execute beforehand

1506606
ceil	floor
you multiply the value by 16 use the floor or ceil method and divide by 16

1506628
post	get
i ve been struggling to get fluent nhibernate working and subsonic doesn t support relationships which makes doing stuff like get all comments for a single post pretty difficult

1506636
subtract	add
don t use any of the deprecated methods and don t use tostring unless you understand what it is displaying. to display format convert add subtract time etc date time always use a calendar instance or dateformat implementation and it is hard to go wrong

1506677
try-catch	exception-handling
this method has a try-catch block and the exception-handling was handled there printing the stack trace using system.err

1506753
hide	show
edit to show or hide an image the javascript looks like

1506769
stdout	stderr
you can configure the logger to print to stdout or stderr instead not to mention filter out unimportant information

1506782
codeigniter	cakephp
i keep seeing cakephp and codeigniter referred to as full stack mvc frameworks whereas zend framework is said to be non-full stack

1506801
openbsd	debian
on a debian box and an openbsd server the order is utterly random

1506801
openbsd	debian
the debian box is 5.10.0 as is the openbsd machine

1506829
multiplying	modulo
continuing left for the 3rd column we divide by 6 because the columns to the right have 3 and 2 possibilities each multiplying to make 6 and then take the remainder modulo 4 because there are 4 possible values in this column

1506829
next	except
this next bit takes the sequence of elements between indices j and j + tempj and rotates it rightward - every element moves up one index except the last one which moves back to the start

1506841

here i define formatting precision of the output and plot parameters for my matlab session for example i use a larger plot axis font size so that .fig s can be seen plainly when i put them in presentations. see a good blog post from one of the developers about it

1506874
ssl	https
now problem is that there is a known feature in ie which sets the response cachecontrol header to no-cache by default for ssl https sites

1506875
qtableview	qheaderview
you can get a pointer to a qheaderview object using qtableview s verticalheader and horizontalheader methods

i m a wordpress user and i have a php code and in that php code there is an area to put a url in well in wordpress you can call post permalinks with this code what i want to do is putting instead of above in the php code

1506906
firefox	safari
something that isn t working on firefox safari but is working on ie on itself is already pretty weird but i can t seem to figure out this problem

1506906
firefox	safari
on my site there are links to social media in the top right corner youtube facebook and flickr on ie they are linked on firefox safari they aren t

1506906
firefox	safari
if i enlarge this to say 1200px the links do work on firefox safari

1506927
subobject	instances
there s also a possibility that pointers could rather point to subobject within an instances of z and looking at pointer values themselves there s clearly no way to tell

1506942
int	chars	int	boolean
one common method is to make a memorystream out of an array of bytes and then make a binarywriter on top of that memory stream and then write int boolean chars strings whatever to the binarywriter

1507011
put	get
i could try to put all the quotes which i probably should but i don t know how to get to that variable anyway because i m doing all of this from whithin the person view etc

1507063
uiview	subviews
i have a uiview the contains many subviews that represent a path to travel along

1507063
uiview	subviews
i have implemented an imageview to represent the sprite and is attached to the main uiview as is the subviews

1507123
post	get
this should get effect 4 insert sqls one add post and three 1st tag 2nd tag all tag

1507140
onfocus	onblur
my guess is that there is something we can do with jquery that looks at everything with a class of formthingy and changes it onfocus and back onblur i m just not sure where to start

1507189
jquery	scriptaculous
i ve done some work with scriptaculous and now i m dipping my feet in to jquery to see which of the two frameworks i like working with the most

1507214
mockups	balsamiq
balsamiq mockups look no further

1507251
ant	maven
i d suggest looking into maven or if you don t want to move to maven ivy which integrates with ant - it s not really the ci server s job to handle artifact dependencies like you re talking about

1507268
x86	64bit
in .net the platform target any cpu compiler option allows a .net assembly to run as 64bit on a x64 machine and 32 bit on an x86 machine

1507334
filesystems	ntfs
it integrates the sql server database engine with an ntfs filesystems by storing varbinary max binary large object blob data as files on the filesystems

1507350
x86	64bit
so if you write a small console application and build it as x86 and another as x64 running one or the other will cause other assemblies loaded into the process to run as 32 or 64bit

1507361
int	chars
for the operators + - you can directly store it as an ascii chars since chars are one byte int

1507410
cairngorm	puremvc
i would say the puremvc framework is the most popular implementation of this pattern for as3 followed by cairngorm

1507419
uiview	subviews
and then in interface builder create a view usually by making a view xib or by dragging out a custom uiview object onto well into another uiview in the xib thus making it a subviews and then in the inspector pane set its class to be myview

1507438
google-chrome	firefox
another problem seems to be using any function other than show causes 100 cpu in linux for firefox and google-chrome and they become unresponsive until i get a warning about a slow script

1507453
post	get
i remember that there is a folder in the c windows system32 where all the http post and get request are logged

1507481
bazaar	git
that s why new version control software has come out with better merging capabilities git mercurial and bazaar come to mind

1507495
udp	tcp
this is part of the nature of udp one of the bits of reliability you give up when you switch from tcp

1507500
udp	tcp
one option is to change the network protocol use tcp or implement some acknowledgement + flow control using udp

1507503
spaces	delimiter
i need to be able to in c language loop over a few lines of text where each line has some text in it where words are delimiter by a variable number of white spaces

1507510
children	parent
more specifically it looks like its deleting parent records with no children

1507510
children	parent
so it looks like it continues to run deleting parent records without children until the number of deleted records is 0

1507510
children	parent
it probably loops like that so if a parent record has no children its deleted

1507521
spaces	delimiter
it shows how to use strtok and split lines into words by spaces delimiter

1507578
children	parent
this way when a child has no other differences it just goes away -- and so does the entry in the parent s children map that has that child as the value

1507604
udp	tcp
you should only ever be sending udp packets to those never tcp connections

1507631
x86	64bit
in other words in 64bit machine when a.exe calls it it will behave like x86 dll whereas when b.exe calls it it will behave like x64

1507662
width	height
in my main process i have the following note that i ve snipped headers footers and the positional x y height width attributes

1507666
onfocus	onblur
use a three-layered approach where the bottom layer is the normal page the top layer is your popup div and the middle layer is a transparent full-screen catch-all div that has an onfocus event that closes your popup rather than using onblur

1507667
width	height
has 2 values a width column and a height column

1507699
stdout	stderr
then you need another trick that can swap stdout and stderr this little monstrosity here

1507699
stdout	stderr
as already mentioned predate.sh will prefix each line with a timestamp and the tstdate.sh is simply a test program to write to stdout and stderr with specific time gaps

1507699
stdout	stderr
when you run the command you actually get d to stdout written to stderr but that s your tty device or whatever else stdout may have been when you started

1507742
post	put
now i have got it working another way previously another tutorial but had to put something like users user.find_all in the post controller

1507742
post	get
so how the hell can the post s table get it link to the user table

1507760
interbase	firebird
you can try ibprovider ole db firebird driver and interbase provider this very well documented updated last version 13-08-2009 and has great support

1507780
hex	binary
example i m searching for the byte sequence deadbeef in hex in a binary file

1507789
post	get
in the end the problem was that i was trying to load a 32bit binary with apache running in 64bit mode base as described in this post i was able to get it running immediately by doing the following

1507827
stdout	stderr
you can use the following trick to swap stdout and stderr

1507827
stdout	stderr
provided stdout and stderr both pointed to the same place at the start this will give you what you need

1507827
stdout	stderr
sets stdout to got to the current file handle 2 original stderr then closes 2

1507827
stdout	stderr
sets stderr to got to the current file handle 3 original stdout then closes 3

1507851
int	chars
int j 65 the chars equivalent would be a

1507913
post	get
when i run this however i get the exception association references unmapped class post

1507921
folder	directory
ok i just downloaded junit 4.7 unpacked the zip file changed directory into the folder and ran the following command successfully

1507933
width	height
set the innertubewithborder to be fixed as well and used the same ie css hack to make it 100 height width then set it s overflow to auto

1507935
jgit	egit
the jgit egit eclipse plugin is also known to have a few issues

1507973
width	height
i draw an image on every sprite within a rectangle 0 0 width height and use matrix.transformation2d to place the image in the rendered view

1507991
subtract	add
you basically just need to add for lighter or subtract for darker equal amounts from each of r g b components

1508021
uitableview	reloaddata
take a look at the reloaddata method on uitableview - it tells the view to redo everything that causes it to display cells from the data fetches on up

1508039
getter	setter
getter and setter omitted for brevity

1508052
getter	setter
things like converting getter and setter to properties and sometimes indexers for example

1508077
portrait	landscape
there is also an event which is triggered when you change the orientation of the phone where you specify the allowed mode portrait or landscape

1508098
ubuntu	debian	stdout	stderr
the devscripts package in debian ubuntu contains a script called annotate-output which does that for both stdout and stderr

1508103
hash	salt
if the user s password is secret and the salt is abc then instead of making a hash of secret you hash secretabc and store the results of that in your database

1508103
hash	salt
the only reason to safeguard the hash passwords and salt is that if an attacker has a copy of it he can test passwords offline on his own machine rather than repeatedly trying to log in to your server which you would probably lock him out after three attempts or something like that

1508106
google-chrome	firefox
i am trying to edit the browser caps for my asp .net application in web.config but it seem after editing the effects are not realized in my browsers e..g firefox and google-chrome so i heard that you can put your browsercaps in machine.config but after doing that when i run my applications on my server its now saying service not available...as in like something evil happened to my machine.config file

1508129
slideup	slidedown
you should use slideup or slidedown if you have either multiple triggers or multiple effects

1508129
slideup	slidedown
but if you are using slideup and slidedown together for the same trigger event you are basically just doing slidetoggle but making it harder on yourself

1508151
qimage	qwidget
1 i have a main qwidget object which contains the qimage on it works fine

1508151
qpainter	qimage
2 images received from remote host are painted on qimage object this work is done in a worker thread using qpainter

1508180
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and safari work with the following css 3 prefixes

1508193
filtering	grouping
having is a filtering on the final result set and is applied after order by and grouping by so mysql cannot use it to optimize the query

1508195
google-chrome	firefox
to cover both google-chrome firefox and any browser that supports css 3

1508198
cvs	svn
svn claims to be cvs done right

1508284
children	parent
use weakref-ed parent if you store root in some variable and pass it around while children are accessed from it

1508293
versioning	upgrade
you don t have to deal with sql scripts even when existing database is being upgrade to next versioning

1508327
pbm	pgm	bmp	png	bmp	pgm	bmp	ppm	bmp	pbm	ppm	pgm	ppm	pbm
bmp pbm pgm png ppm xbm xpm

1508357
hex	binary
perhaps you are mixing hex representation with binary

1508391
jobs	cron
the cloud server has facility of running cron jobs using ruby php perl python and http

1508406
put	get
if i consciously create a syntax error i get the error output on the url for example when i put a space before def

1508435
width	height
first i figured out that also the rotation changes the vie too so the width becomes the height etc

1508435
width	height
and i don t need to alter the height but the width according the scale

1508497
min	max
you should probably also make sure that you don t get integers as min max because integer division will damage the result

1508532
width	height
i want each result about 100px in height and full width to be a single link rather than have the image and title being seperate links

1508543
versioning	upgrade
most will automatically upgrade a working copy automatically to their own versioning

1508585
firefox	safari
accessibility no one knows that microsoft always made the best accessiility features on all of its products they always worked well with disabled people comparing the browsers only ie supports full accessibility and safari firefox etc are no where closer

1508635
put	get
perhaps have deck own the card objects initially and when they re removed they get put into the vector in solitairegame and don t exist in both at the same time

1508658
public	protected
the only solution i ve found is to subclass qtabwidget and override the protected qtabwidget gettabbar as public

1508660
daemons	systemd
or you could run the daemons as root and put your key in the systemd keychain

1508704
spweb	spsite	sharepoint	spsite
in short standard sharepoint guidance is that com-backed objects like spsite and spweb should not be used by different threads

1508714
button	checkbox
the problem is that when button is pressed it does not recognize the latest checkbox action

1508719
haskell	ocaml	ocaml	eiffel	erlang	ocaml
eiffel erlang ocaml haskell

1508725
stdout	stderr
stdout and stderr log files should have been created in the logs directory of your tomcat installation

1508757
vbscript	jscript
its tempting to advise you to use jscript on the server side instead of vbscript

1508774
inline	inlining
if you use a variable or method only once you may inline it but inlining is always equivalent to declaring it explicitly

1508783
width	height
i don t want to hardcode the width height either as the image i change it to could be another size

1508840
width	height
you have to define your height and width in order for the picture to show up

1508840
width	height
otherwise it is limited to the height and width of whatever the browser defaults to for that element

1508840
width	height
for instance an empty span has no height or width so any background image will be covering the background of an area of 0x0

1508840
put	get
you ll notice that if you put in i hate static dimensions in that span you tested you ll get a small corner of your image

1508840
width	height
now you could set the height and width in the css and therefore not hard-code it into the html however you can only do this for elements with a display type of block

1508840
width	height
if you want the area to have height and width but still flow inline you can use display inline-block

1508842
width	height
i don t think you can using purely css unless you specify the width and height

1508842
width	height
so just set the width and height in your css along with your image as background-image and your fine

1508869
strcpy	strncpy
use strncpy rather than strcpy

1508880
put	get
i know i could get 10 recods for each model put them in a dictionary and sort by date well once i know how to sort by date in python but this seems fairly inefficient

1508939
qvboxlayout	qwidget
it consists of the default central widget a qwidget which contains a qvboxlayout with all the other widgets in it

1508967
implements	extends
localvalidatorfactorybean does extends springvalidatoradapter though which implements org.springframework.validation.validator

1508968
icmp	tcp
since you need root permissions to send an icmp package and the implemetation of isreachable will use the slow tcp version of echo

1509014
vmware	virtualbox
i m aware that by running vmware or virtualbox could get things working however it doesn t seem to be a good solution since i want to use the processor i7 at its fullness

1509178
width	margin
also if you want the margin to have a constant width regardless then you will have to actually use pixels but this is going to be a bit more difficult

1509204
onkeyup	onkeydown
you can back this up with an onkeyup handler or onkeydown timeout to make that particular case update quicker

1509210
firefox	safari
you ve not mentioned which version of asp.net you re using - although i guess as you re having issues with firefox and safari it s 1.1 - if you re running on asp.net 2.0 the browsercaps element is now deprecated in favour of the .browser definition files

1509222
width	height
i also suspect that the document is rasterized when the content of the visualbrush isn t applied with the original 1 1 height width ratio the visual has

1509222
width	height
errors within a resizing calculation led to a 1 0.9948 height width ratio for the applied visualbrush and this led to a blurry output excluding the nested visualbrush problem

1509247
keydown	keyup
left -1000px and add all 3 events keydown keypress keyup to it

1509260

mouseup	mousedown
the mousedown event handler is used as it s for fat fingers on a windows touch screen and movement between mousedown and mouseup does not constitute a click

1509446
libxml2	libxslt
nonetheless you do have the same problem in that nokogiri can t find your libxml2 libxslt libxslt libraries

1509446
libxml2	libxslt
most likely you need windows binaries dlls of libxml2 and libxslt at a minimum

1509545
equals	gethashcode
implement the gethashcode method whenever you implement the equals

1509573
versioning	upgrade
i d really like to be able to just specify exactly which gav to use in my client pom and when it s time to upgrade assuming the bug gets properly fixed in v3.0 say just update my client pom to point to versioning 3.0.0 and my patched 2.2.1 jar just gets ignored and no hacking of nexus is required

1509601
fgets	strtok
as has been pointed out by other answers you re much better off parsing the string in the usual way fgets and strtok

1510168
versioning	upgrade
i know that at least wptools has changed some of its component structures and interfaces since the versioning used in the original application and obviously i ll have some recoding to do there but will the failure of those parts of the program prevent my code base from being upgrade at all

i want the parent process to resume execution the point after this while loop only after all children have terminated

1510922
waitpid	fork
in one approach i made parent pause after while loop and sent some condition from sigchld handler only when waitpid returned error echild no child remaining but the problem i am facing in this approach is even before parent has finished fork all processes retstat becomes -1

1510935
many-to-many	one-to-many
pat shaughnessy is developing modified auto_complete plugin which can allow to manage one-to-many and many-to-many association

1510935
many-to-many	one-to-many
also it would be better to remove from the list of suggested tasks one-to-many or products|categories many-to-many those which have been already added

1511034
daemon	cron
cron is a unix daemon that runs shell commands according to a configured schedule the crontab

1511034
jobs	cron
your cloud server provider must have something similar they call cron that runs ruby php perl python and http jobs

1511049
post	get
but i d also have to get the server to sequence its response to the xhr to follow the response to the post and figure out how to communicate the savedata outcome to the response to the xhr

1511061
printf	strlen
you should use strlen on ptr before the copy to make sure it fits or use printf if you have it

1511097
post	get
many mobile browsers have no js and implement the app as static get and post handlers

1511108
filtering	grouping
if you still want to check for membership in a grouping in addition to being part of the ou you can add this as a member-of part to the filtering

1511108
filtering	grouping
not totally sure about the wildcards - in general ldap search filtering do support wildcards but i m a bit hesitant about using a wildcard in a rdn like this grouping dn here

1511163
libpng	libz
i have a 32bit machine that compiles 64bit code for another machine and links a handful of libraries libpng libz for example

1511224
versioning	upgrade
one thing to note if you use any 3rd party packages make sure they have a delphi 2010 versioning available that you can upgrade to before you convert

1511314
vbscript	jscript
actually wscript cscript is the engine vbscript and jscript are the languages

1511314
vbscript	jscript
personal opinion only follows my personal recommendation is jscript because it reminds me more of a real programming language and makes me want to punch myself in the face less often than vbscript

1511320
vbscript	jscript
you could use vbscript but why when jscript is available

1511327
vbscript	jscript
however microsoft 1 hates javascript so you ll encounter some apis that are trivial to use with vbscript but painful to access using jscript

1511385
hash	md5
it seems to me that we should be able to add the the source code comments recompile the source code and use something like an md5 or sha1 hash using something like fciv to compare the before and after dlls to confirm that the source code comments did not impact the compiled version

1511387
vbscript	jscript
to expand on the other s answers a bit wscript and cscript are programs used to run scripts written in vbscript visual basic like syntax or jscript javascript-like syntax

1511387
vbscript	jscript
you can write wsh windows scripting host and wsc windows scripting component scripts that use both vbscript and jscript by combining them in an xml-based wrapper if you need to merge pre-existing code in the two languages

1511514
range	max
on average the system needs to handle 2000 messages daily from each client where the message size will range from 1k to msmq max size 4mb

1511550
skip-lists	tree
for larger lists you can achieve o log n updates by using a sorted o log n data structure avl rb-trees skip-lists segment tree etc.

1511550
treemap	treeset
many popular languages have some sort of sorted data structure in their library treemap treeset in java multiset multimap in c++ s stl or you can easily find a free implementation for your language

1511570
tapestry	wicket	jsf	tapestry	jsf	wicket
with wicket and other server-side-centric component frameworks like jsf and tapestry the architecture is a more traditional 3-layer one and what is sent and received are pages or fragments of the pages not pure data

1511619
for-loop	arrays
i have an arrays declared above the beginning of a for-loop as

1511710
inherited	properties
in the properties editor of the inherited control my columns collection exists

1511723
hash	md5
ok according to facebook your client library should perform all the necessary validation for you by using the application secret to md5 all the params and validate the hash

1511745
hide	show
i expected this to hide all elements and only show the printablearea however everything gets hidden

1511774
bids	ssas
likewise if you just created the cube you have to process and deploy to your ssas server to browse it through bids or sms

1511780
width	height
it seems that a won t be visible unless a height and width is specified

1511806
pascal	delphi
the most notable exceptions that spring to mind apart from the aforementioned windows are sql and delphi pascal

1511821
gridview	formview
first the answer seemed to be for a gridview and not a formview e.row.cells 0 gave it away

1511835
superclass	subclassing
you need to signify that the superclass method is being called because you need to have the ability to make that decision for each subclassing separately - otherwise you might have a subclassing that doesn t want to delegate anything to the superclass at all - so the default is that you just put in the code

1511864
equals	compareto
as chssply76 wrote in a comment you can use hashcode to decide the compareto call in the case where two collections have the same size but are not equals

1511865
curb	libcurl
gem install curb gives an error saying i need to specify where the libcurl library lives

1511877
nginx	lighttpd	apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx
you need to install a web server apache lighttpd nginx etc. on your machine then make sure the server is setup to process php files through the php interpreter

1511899
daemons	launchd
but keep in mind this will launchd apache and mysql daemons in the background

1511944
jquery	scriptaculous
seems like people use jquery with either scriptaculous or yui for the interface elements.

1511964
public	protected
if you want to expose a field make it public or protected use a property which should be capitalized if it s protected or public

1512055
post	get
you don t send the vars directly to the function they are sent via get or post

1512087
ant	maven
the real recommendation i would make though is to drop ant and convert over to maven - like the apache software foundation did they maintain both ant and maven

1512092
punctuation	words
this would match either a words or a non-word spacing punctuation etc. sequence possibly an empty one

1512137
google-chrome	firefox
tested and works in ie6 ie7 ie8 firefox 3.5.3 and google-chrome

1512183
clang	llvm
from gcc 4.x to clang llvm

1512183
clang	llvm
however currently xcode has no clang llvm compiler for the iphone device and so you can only use that setting when compiling for the simulator

1512183
clang	llvm
the best approach then is to create a copy of the debug configuration in the project settings configurations tab named debug clang and set that configuration to use the clang llvm compiler and run the static analyser

1512263
portrait	landscape
also changes when the device switches between portrait and landscape

1512274
post	get
not get or post or load

1512276
put	get
those number get put into the string

1512302
uiview	calayer
i wonder what difference will it make if a assemble the complex view by creating a different uiview for each element and adding them as children of the complex view or if i should instead create a a different calayer for each element and add them as children of the complex view s layer property

1512336
initializer	class-method
so while you can access your methods and properties in your modules without initialization you would need to use the new method to initializer your class-method

1512344
int	double
it s using a double as the interval but in fact calls math.ceiling on it and casting the result as an int to use with an underlying system.threading.timer

1512376
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
if you browse this page with google-chrome opera or firefox and the browser s window height is smaller than 800px some menus will overflow the window and the user must scroll down the page to display the options hidden

1512378
int	double
i have a test dll created in another language basic not c in fact that contains a cdecl function that adds an int to a double

1512381
comparator	comparable
once you do have said class you ll either need to write a comparator for your objects or make item comparable by itself

1512424
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties
i have multiple objects in a hierarchy which have common properties and methods inherited from the superclass and object-specific properties and methods in the subclassing

1512438
udp	tcp
it s features so far are tcp udp ipv4 ipv6 async sync and multicasting

1512476
g++	gcc
i ve been using the uva online judge to solve some programming challenges and when submitting my solutions i m told the judge will compile my code using the following parameters to gcc g++ that i don t know -lm -lcrypt -pipe -donline_judge

1512505
actionscript	mxml
don t think it is is possible to call the constructor with args from mxml but with actionscript you could have optional parameters that would set the values.

1512512
google-chrome	firefox
when you click on one of the meds at the top of the page the text loads fine in firefox but not at all in ie and google-chrome

1512531
websphere	ibm
there is ibm s debugger - part of websphere voice toolkit

1512534
nsobject	nsmanagedobject
i ve tried to write a new nsobject class which mimic the nsmanagedobject class and then move the data into the nsobject class but it still changes the db

1512587
comparator	comparable
note that comparable and comparator are distinct interfaces with different purposes

1512622
trac	mantis
we currently use email for issue tracking and i intend to set up a bug issue tracking system perhaps bug genie mantis or trac - we want something web based php open source mysql we have source control svn

1512673
haskell	scheme
maybe you d like haskell -- in which case you could try write yourself a scheme in 48 hours an interesting tutorial you get to write a scheme interpreter in haskell

1512728
cos	sin
any line on the xy plane can be described as p x cos theta + y sin theta

1512743
queue	fifo
for dealing with fifo queue and logging perhaps you could look into ring buffers and log rotation

1512743
disk	ram
for dealing with caching data in ram to minimize disk access you may or may not be better off leaving that to the operating system

1512747
google-chrome	firefox
this is one of those rare cases where things work as expected in ie and google-chrome but not firefox

1512755
asterisk	ivr
i m trying to setup an ivr or to be more specific an automated attendant using asterisk

1512776
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i ve tested the code in google-chrome firefox opera safari ie7 8 and every thing is working everywhere else.

1512781
yacc	bison
therefore you get to hack your grammar to change it from lr k to lalr 1 again forcing you to suffer the experiments that expose the strange cases and hacking the grammar reduction logic to try to handle k-lookaheads when the parser generators yacc bison .

1512794
children	parent
is it possible with single hql to initialize all parent objects with its children

1512914
strlen	strtok
ok if strlen is the only function allowed you can first find the length of your source string then loop through it and replace all non-letter characters with null - basically that s what strtok does

1512923
inherited	subclassing
an abstract class is only to be subclassing inherited from

1512938
firefox	safari
on firefox and safari i can see the browse button

1512964
post	get
post the complete function code if you want to get a more precise answer

1512969
ilist	icollection
replace ilist with icollection if you don t need indexing and just want a count and be able to enumerate through the jobs

1512972
int	boolean
i have changed one of the functions with raw pointers int and boolean to std vector and std vector.

1512972
int	boolean
same algorithm one implementation is using 4 5 dynamic arrays of int and boolean

1512991
min	max
gcc detects common code such as hand-coded min and max and turns them into one sse instruction on x86 x86_64 and when -msse is set or using cmov when i686 is available sse has higher priority

1512991
memcpy	memset
gcc knows what built-in types are and how to exploit them in real world use and will gladly do so - just like it knows what memset and memcpy does and how to optimize accordingly when copy size is known

1513003
getter	setter
properties could be renamed or they could have a setter getter added or removed

1513003
getter	setter
adding a setter getter is not breaking but all other property changes are breaking

1513004
google-chrome	safari
after that users of google-chrome and safari cannot click at link foo

1513053
tinyint	boolean
i also recommend that a tinyint for the datatype of the read column more broadly compatable than boolean but still very small

1513143
superclass	subclassing
this means that superclass get the benefit of subclassing behaviors but it also means that overriding methods can theoretically get invoked before the constructor in that class

1513149
subclass	abstract-class
as long as there are not too many implementations of foo i would declare an abstract method in someinterface for each subclass of foo and have an abstract-class forward calls to a default method that is defined for the most general type

1513153
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine so far but when i want to insert something at the cursor position it gets slow in firefox when there is a lot of text in the textarea google-chrome works fine

1513169
getter	setter
that s why i suggest the minimally evil hack - don t make everything private and if you can get away with a getter but no setter do that

1513184
free	memcpy
for example auto_ptr s can t be just memcopied if you memcpy the auto_ptr and then destructor is ran for both you ll attempt to free the same memory two times and the program will crash

1513219
redhat	fedora
redhat s fedora core is very secure because it uses selinux this is somthing that does not exist for windows

1513237
post	get
in your script you ll get broken url as post parameter _post broken_url

1513270
salt	dpapi
i have no idea if it will help but windows provides since 2000 a mechanism to retrieve and store encrypted information and you can also salt this storage on a per-application basis if needed data protection api dpapi

1513276
post	get
i am assuming that you are talking about the model that you pass to the view and the model that you get back once the form post

1513310
addclass	removeclass
and then use addclass and removeclass -

1513345
switching	screens
set the avaudiosession s category property to avaudiosessioncategoryplayback to indicate that the app s major purpose is to play back audio and it therefore should ignore the screens lock button and ring silent switching

1513352
getter	setter
therefore node_base can have pure virtual getter setter and other methods

1513374
multiplying	add
i am trying to get these valued passed to the fraction class because in the end i have to add these two fractions together and also multiplying them

1513413
mbunit	nunit
use nunit or mbunit etc for unit testing

1513444
nsinteger	double
you are receiving an error because you are declaring bvalue as a pointer to an nsinteger yet trying to initialize it with a double value

1513478
int	chars
the x pointer is a chars pointer which after dereferencing gets promoted to an int with sign extension which causes all your output values to be either 000000xx or ffffffxx depending on the value of bit 7

1513478
int	chars
instead what you probably want to do is use an int pointer to scan through the stack values instead of a chars pointer

1513480
put	get
it is simple enough to drop in or re-implement for most projects you assign a generator func and use get put helper methods to re-use your previous objectâ s and forgo usual garbage collection

1513484
int	chars
you re looking at individual chars then casting those to 32-bit int which is confusing you

1513528
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the overflow hidden will clear the float for firefox safari and google-chrome

1513618
folder	directory
i have directory called mysourcedir it has sonme files and folder

1513641
icmp	tcp
using icmp ping can be useful at a low level but presumably what you need is a connection to an actual endpoint via tcp ip to do real work

1513651
width	height
this method doesn t even need the resize event s height and width because as dlh already comments you can ask most components for their dimensions when you get notified and do your calculations with that

1513679
icmp	tcp
a lot of companies have measures in place to prevent outgoing icmp requests tcp connections to ports other than 80 443 for example or even to prevent you from reaching the internet directly by transparently proxying your traffic

1513679
icmp	udp	icmp	tcp	udp	tcp
under an internet connection i would understand any way to contact the outside be it udp tcp or icmp

1513686
post	get
now i will post the code so that someone with a similar problem can get some help

1513738
post	put
when the user picks fire fighter your sql would put 3 in the and here i m lost from your post

1513775
hash	salt
you should use a salt hash to prevent dictionary attacks

1513782
stdout	fflush
you may want to fflush stdout to ensure that the buffers are in a consistent state before you do that

1513797
versioning	upgrade
register a myfullapp url with the full versioning and have the lite app present an upgrade option that calls that url with the various data you want to exchanged encoded in it

1513808
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i created a testpage which has been tested in ie 8 google-chrome 3 opera 10 and firefox 3.5

1513868
public	protected
have mytestableclass extend myclass and then provide public methods in mytestableclass that expose the protected methods of myclass that you need

1513897
hide	show
i want to show one and hide the other based on a condition

1513916
put	get
... if we just put the file in cvs and update the other machines from there the encrypted passwords on each machine would get overwritten

1513961
clang	llvm
an interactive c console which employs llvm and its new c frontend clang

1513990
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
however this one makes me worried because the adoption rate for current browsers is spotty even in cutting edge ones like firefox opera and safari

1514024
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
personally when firefox google-chrome and opera have good implementations that s when i ll start using html5

1514050
entity-relationship	diagram
for the same reasons that entity-relationship diagram make sense for database design

1514161
django	turbogears	django	web2py	turbogears	web2py
although django turbogears web2py are all good frameworks i found the latter quite simple and flexible

1514216
put	get
or just get it off the gcc source tar ball and put them where your eclipse could pick them up adjust the include path accordingly

1514222
subtract	add
for a tree view it would be more complex but i could see that you would want all your richtext controls to be indexed maybe use the tag property and then as you move them in your tree view use the index to add subtract from other indexes and then use the relocate method in a loop that many times to get it to it s new location

1514244
udp	tcp
theoretically udp should be be 30-50 faster than tcp because it s missing the extra trip for the ack and has a smaller header overhead however in reality there are many cases where tcp would outperform udp just because of congestion control

1514244
udp	tcp
also tcp with nagle turned on batches packets which again wouldn t be a fair comparison to udp which doesn t do that

1514246
integer	unsigned
cert has developed a new approach to detecting and reporting signed integer overflow unsigned integer wrapping and integer truncation using the as-if infinitely ranged air integer model

1514278
public	protected
all examples i see tend to present entities with virtual automatic properties and an empty constructor protected or worst public and that s it

1514289
hide	show
i had mistakenly added my jscript along with that to hide and show controls

1514299
stdout	fflush
the call to fflush stdout will translate into a write call of whatever has been buffered but not sent to the underlying io port

1514340
put	get
if you put pointers to objects in the queue and any other stl container the pointers won t get deleted when you remove them

1514340
int	chars
but the destructor for plain pointer or any pod type - int chars etc is empty no-op

1514352
inherited	properties
you can t normally see the prototype chain although firefox and webkit make it available through the __proto__ properties but it is the way inherited is actually handled in js

1514352
inherited	subclassing
the only drawback i see is that you can t inherited the constructor function so every time you make a new subclassing you must write a constructor that calls the base constructor even if your subclassing s constructor does nothing at all

1514390
boost	stl
if you used a container of a proxy type as raw pointers smart pointers shared_ptr weak_ptr or adapters as boost reference_wrapper then the stl container will destroy the proxy but not the type

1514400
post	get
anyway i tried to do it from page load itself as skippyfire describes in an old post and get this error from visual studio ide

1514411
rss	feed
i m creating a table to hold items from rss feed and i need to create a column description

1514420
for-loop	loops
the while loops and the classical for-loop are interchangable

1514481
ilist	icollection
the preferencesdescriptions collection is mapped as an ilist so is an indexed collection when i require standard unindexed collections i use icollection

1514481
ilist	icollection
â how can i make it without having to override this very case - i mean how can i make fluent nhibernate s automap make always indexed collections for ilist but not for icollection

1514491
disk	ram
notably a desktop machine has lots more ram and will swap memory to disk as apps demand more

1514652
subtract	add
i wanted it to be more simple so i wrote this i realize it would do + for both add and subtract

1514679
children	parent
if someone owns parent 23 and its children but they don t own parent 24 you wouldn t want them modifying the url and changing parent 24 s children

1514695
yacc	bison
php uses yacc bison just like gcc

1514738
cos	sin
lat2 asin sin lat1 cos d r + cos lat1 sin d r cos î

1514738
cos	sin
sin lat1 cos d r - as sin and cos will never be larger than 1 the largest result can be 1

1514738
cos	sin
cos lat1 sin d r cos î - same as above

1514767
width	height
when a canvas element s dimensions are altered width or height the canvas itself is cleared and effectively reset origin policies are an exception

1514771
children	parent
use an event to dispatch property-changed notifications from the parent to the children

1514823
lisp	scheme
in lisp well scheme anyway the only fundamental data structure is a pair

1514845
next	except
i would say that if less than 20 say they can t move to 3.5 or can t in the near future then just go ahead with 3.5 and say that the next version of your library will require 3.5 and that there will be no further development on the 2.0 version except in cases where a severe security flaw or other critical bug might be found

1514846
png	tga
what i want to do is take a folder of png files combine them into a texture atlas and then export the atlas as a tga and the uv coords to xml

1514884
for-loop	loops
if you can provide an upper bound for the condition in a while loops to become true you can convert it to a for-loop

1514912
google-chrome	firefox
also when i load a javafx app in firefox or google-chrome it says it can t find java

1514966
jar	war
it has to be in the classpath of your war - either a package under web-inf or jar under web-inf lib

1514982
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication
in either case a multiplication with a power of two is replaced with a bit shift but for multiplication with a power of two + - 1 3 5 7 9 15 17 ... hotspot will generate a bit shift and an addition or a subtraction for intel cpus while generating a multiplication for amd cpus since the amd cpu executes a multiplication much faster than the intel cpu

1515030
width	height
what i m ultimately trying to do is a design with fixed width and percentage-based height where child divs are also percentage-based positioned to their parents i believe this is the correct way to deal with different screen resolutions

1515032
3dsmax	blender
you can design you map in any .bsp editor 3dsmax blender and store the data you need in xml

1515076
for-loop	loops
then just copy+paste the for-loop of your original matrix and change matrix.rows in matrix2.rows in the yellowrows loops now u have 2 loops in your yellowrows loops

1515086
int	boolean
in order to save space i am using a single 32bit int field in a struct to represent several different sets of boolean properties

1515123
unification	inference
milners algorithm can also cope with unification of cyclic graphs and the dragon book presents it as a way to do type inference

1515143
width	height
i d like to write a function that takes a filename and produces a .pdf file on a nix platform and a .wmf on a windows platform with that filename and width of 6 inches height 4

1515155
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
the recommended way to do this is to just use a uinavigationcontroller and push uiviewcontroller s onto the stack either modal or non-modal

1515187
post	get
i might be doing something completely wrong here but for some reason the values of this form i have in one of my pages get cached after the first post

1515216
memcpy	memmove
you can do that with memmove not memcpy since the src and dst are pointing to overlapping memory like so

1515297
fullscreen	minimized
where fullscreen is defined as 0 the three icons that are usually at the top of any window minimized maximize restore and close are not there

1515327
mouseup	mousedown
you don t need both a mousedown and mouseup event handler

1515332
explode	implode
i m not sure why you d serialize it in php either because implode and explode would be more appropriate

1515337
tiff	png
from two images one is a tiff and the other one is a png

1515347
min	max
i would do this in a loop 1000 times and take the max time min time and average time

1515354
tiff	png
in order to send binary data you will need to use a servlet but you can take advantage of the java advanced imaging api and read in both images then you can combine them and save them as a tiff or png

1515365
awt	swing
i m changing a program from awt to swing as proposed on the second chapter of swing s book and the panel just disappears when i do the change from panel to jpanel

1515370
pylons	turbogears
- for being too magical or too monolithic compared to alternatives such as pylons turbogears werkzeug c which are lighter-weight esp

1515377
portrait	landscape
i had to add a bit of extra code to accommodate both portrait and landscape images

1515409
stateless	stateful
ejbs - stateless and stateful session entity and message driven beans

1515411
jtree	jtable
this should have the added benefit of making your jtree behave the same way that your jtable behaves when you press a jbutton

1515464
move	drag
however the x in this case will not be persistent meaning that if you drag another form over your form and then move it away the x will not be there anymore

1515490
getter	setter
to do the same thing with objective-c on the iphone anyway requires that you declare a local variable to back the property write the property declaration and then use the synthesize directive to have the property generated for you depending on what property attributes you specify you might have a property that wraps getter and setter that take care of reference-counting for you - overall this is a time-saver but the c# way is the clear winner here

1515510
stdout	fflush
you could add fflush stdout

1515515
stdout	fflush
fflush stdout

1515561
serializable	deserialization
there are various good serializable deserialization libraries that automatically convert javabean objects to from xml and json strings

1515561
serializable	deserialization
java s built-in support for serializable can do the same thing and you can write custom serializable deserialization methods for java to call

1515730
folder	dir
i have a script all written up in bash x.sh that will move some files and other stuff on input 1 i just need osx to give me the file name when new files folder are moved created into a dir

1515739
hide	show
the code below will show hide a div on click

1515748
nunit	mstest
most frameworks mstest nunit etc. allow you to define setup and teardown methods that are guaranteed to run before and after the test

1515753
post	get
however the one thing i simply cannot get working is to have a page spit out a list of post of a certain category

1515760
hide	show
basically just use the hide and .show to show hide the appropriate div at the right time

1515789
post	get
you may use or to get the post you are looking for

1515913
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
the viewwillappear viewdidappear and viewwilldisappear viewdiddisappear messages are the only messages you need to manually send to the child view controller

1515913
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
in addition when you add the child view controller s view you should send the viewwillappear viewdidappear messages if the parent s view.window is non-nil

1515939
hide	show
as for now i hide every flash ad on show dialog

1515939
google-chrome	firefox
which works in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie

1515963
scheme	prolog
also it gives a good introduction into scheme prolog and programming paradigms logic functional imperative object oriented

1515984
superclass	subclassing
i thought all objects were subclassing of nsobject and though the cast would be made implicit superclass substitution a superclass can always be replaced by any child class of it

1515999
erlang	ocaml
you can look to my existing configs based on the code from emacswiki with some extensions - function to handle conversion from text to chars and example of it use for erlang mode - you can change it for ocaml mode also

1516070
chaiscript	c++
there is a new package chaiscript which is designed for c++

1516076
versioning	upgrade
new versioning upgrade or install alongside older versioning

1516140
versioning	upgrade
i m about to upgrade a svn server from versioning 1.5.5 to 1.6.5 - all is fine with the actual upgrade but i m a little confused about upgrading the actual repositories

1516165
int	double
implicit conversions other than inheritance such as int to double are not performed and will throw an exception

1516172
implements	extends
my problem question is this currently mythread is extends thread because i mark it as daemon and i read about how it s more prefferable to implements runnable and to use executors

1516172
implements	extends
so what i wanted to ask is if mythread will implements runnable instead of extends thread and of course will be renamed and i ll use newsinglethreadscheduledexecutor how what or maybe where do i mark something as daemon

1516238
pop-up	dialog
when my main form is displaying a modal dialog i want right-click to activate the main form not display a pop-up menu

1516250
accessor	properties
in cocoa on the mac or on the iphone the use of accessor properties is required to be kvo-conformant

1516250
accessor	ivar	accessor	properties
it is also best to use accessor properties when you want to ensure properties memory management behaviour which is to say always when setting an ivar to use the setter or dot notation and depending on which memory management pattern you follow to always use accessor properties when getting an ivar

1516250
accessor	properties
what this means is that using accessor properties will give you confidence that your objects will be around as long as you need them to be without some other part of the code releasing them out from under you

1516250
accessor	ivar	accessor	properties
the last and best reason to always use accessor properties is that it makes one fewer assumption for each properties that there is an underlying ivar for that properties and that is has the same name i guess that s two assumptions

1516250
accessor	ivar
perhaps in future you will want to replace an ivar with a derived accessor

1516292
awt	swing
painting in awt and swing

1516294
uiview	subviews
i have a parent uiview with a number of subviews

1516306
width	height
you might use the off-left technique if the plugin doesn t like the elements not having height width

1516318
int	chars
a concrete example might help on architectures with 8bit chars types - chars being by definition what c and c++ consider the architecture s byte size - and 32bit int types int has the size of 4 bytes

1516350
folder	directory
by default iis creates log files in the system32 logfiles directory of your windows folder

1516352
opensuse	linux
linux opensuse 11

1516370
unsigned	short
the write_log function should work with the same parameters as the printf function with the added parameter of unsigned short priority

1516372
ubuntu	linux
i have ubuntu linux installed to my usb flash with

1516373
gridview	sqldatasource
hi i have a gridview linked to a sqldatasource

1516412
ant	maven
i have heard of build files ant maven but i really am not sure if i am looking at the right thing

1516420
decoder	encoder
if you are using utf-8 there s a quick trick you can use to implement a utf-8 encoder decoder in js with minimal code

1516430
salt	md5
note use a random salt inside the md5 or sha1 if you prefer so it cant easily be reverse-engineered

1516435
maven	pom.xml
these files won t be checked in all information is in the maven pom.xml file

1516443
width	height
is not added to a box so will decrease any width or height

1516443
width	height
also some elements without certain css properties no specific width or height or auto do not trigger haslayout in ie

1516459
yacc	bison
this is sometimes easier than yacc bison and usually more intuitive

1516486
int	boolean
i have also read that enums are stored as small int - which as i understand it is not a problem with the boolean tests as these would be peroformed starting at the right most bits

1516492
apache	nginx
nginx doesn t have loadable modules like apache

1516493
pascal	delphi
but i learn programming and after structured programming with pascal language i m beginning to learn about oop with delphi

1516493
public	protected
i understand what is public declaration interface approachable by the outside but i don t see what s the difference between private and protected declarations

1516528
hash	md5
password is stored as an md5 hash of their real text password

1516550
hash	salt
if your old system used unsalted hash and vbulletin uses salt ones then if you want users to keep their passwords you will have to modify vbulletin to use unsalted ones too

1516550
hash	salt
you can direct users to a page when their login fails and it would check their credentials against the old system and create a new salt and hash for the new system

1516551
public	protected
the difference between private protected and public is pretty straightforward

1516556
google-chrome	firefox
using clientx and clienty alone are not sufficient if the browser window is scrolled verified in firefox 3.5 and google-chrome 3.0

1516572
int	chars
now from the above linked question we can infer what is going on here the compiler is using the implicit chars - int conversion then adding those values

1516584
int	chars
we are in agreement this this could have been more reasonably defined to mean concatenate given that strings and chars are much more distinct entities from int than they were in past lives the c programming language

1516584
int	chars
traditionally a chars constant at least in c was just another way to represent an int

1516600
int	chars
as has already been said chars is considered a form of int rather than a string so fundamentally an addition operation is adding two numbers rather than performing concatenation

1516609
g++	gcc
what are the difference between the 3 compilers cc gcc g++ when compiling

1516624
hide	show
i would just put toload and its children in index.html and set them display none in your stylesheet then attach the jquery show and hide functions to an onclick handler to make things appear or disappear

1516627
g++	gcc
g++ is a driver binary like gcc but with a few special options set for compiling c++

1516627
g++	gcc
notably in my experience g++ will link libstdc++ by default while gcc won t

1516639
int	chars
your deduction -- that chars is converted to int and therefore there is no addition operator defined on chars -- is spot on so good on you

1516639
int	double
briefly they are int + int uint + uint long + long ulong + ulong float + float double + double decimal + decimal enum-and-underlying type delegate combination string + string string + object and object + string

1516639
int	chars
their storage is that of short int but their semantics are those of the chars in a string

1516639
int	chars
the language designers decided in this case to follow the lead of earlier languages like c and treat chars like int when doing mathematics on them that does not involve strings

1516639
int	chars
appending the empty string as another answer suggests unambiguously tells the compiler this operation is on strings not on the chars s int value

1516658
g++	gcc
the easy part because it is not platform-specific is the separation of gcc and g++

1516658
g++	gcc
g++ is the gnu c++ compiler from the gcc

1516698
hash	md5
it s used to store an md5 hash

1516698
hash	md5
they have a parameter that accepts a password in plaintext convert it to the md5 hash and store lookup the hash in the table

1516742
wxpython	listctrl
i have a wxpython listctrl with five columns

1516767
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
the code you ve given then just has multiple nested loops so in the outermost for-loop is itself an associative arrays which is then looped through and the values stored in that associative arrays are also arrays

1516835
disk	ram
if you want to avoid chewing up a lot of disk space ram or cpu power doing window management you should check out matchbox

1516836
webkit	gecko
it simply states that the client says they re running internet explorer 8 using the trident layout engine similar to safari webkit or mozilla gecko

1516852
client-side	server-side
to render a dynamic html page i can format the page in server-side code php python and use ajax to fetch the formatted page and render it directly more logic on server-side less on client-side

1516858
post	get
so to get around this based on advice in another post i m planning on creating a key class which will be used as the hashmap key

1516863
mp3	wav
i d like to transcribe an english spoken wav or mp3 file to text

1516883
perl	tcl
it has code examples in tcl python ruby and perl

1516898
atoi	atof
i think you have to take the returned c-string then convert it into a number using atoi or atof depending on the type

1516904
hide	show
it hide and then show again

1516904
gentoo	linux
browser firefox 3.5.3 under linux gentoo

1516914
fadein	fadeout
you have wrote #content in the fadeout and #conent in the fadein

1516926
datamapper	activerecord
activerecord and datamapper have a find_by_sql method that helps you more but doesn t instantiate all models at least on activerecord if i m not mistaken that is

1516928
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
nearly all the uinavigationcontroller examples out there show the use of initwithnibname bundle to load a nib containing not an entire uiviewcontroller or subclass but just a uiview with the nib s file s owner class property set to uiviewcontroller or the appropriate subclass and its view outlet pointed at the uiview

the build system is widely varied and will probably be dictated by your preference between gnome kde or the ever-present command line

1517089
super	self
you must always call through to the super s initializer before messaging self

1517138
ubuntu	linux
i m using the netbeans ide for my project on ubuntu linux

1517178
portrait	landscape
it s a slight improvement on the reddit version as it handles either portrait or landscape images

1517179
width	height
update thanks to the two answers so far i have gotten it to actually call the onpaint by using setstyle controlstyles.userpaint true and i have gotten it to draw the text in the right place by sending in new rectangle 0 0 width height instead of bounds

1517190
sudo	passwd
if you are using a terminal then just use sudo instead which will prompt for the user s passwd in the terminal itself as opposed to gksudo which i believe uses a graphical popup

1517199
getter	setter
you need a getter setter for your collection

1517250
jquery	jqmodal
i ve tried jqmodal and jquery ui but haven t managed to find any good samples or tutorials yet

1517290
apache	nginx
nginx - 0.7.62 same problem under apache 2.x

1517322
many-to-many	one-to-many
that would not be useful since foreign keys are per definition prone to be duplicates one-to-many many-to-many

1517335
getter	setter
in c# you won t see many performance issues around trivial property getter and setter like this

1517363
mergesort	timsort
if you prefer reading java code than c code you could look at joshua bloch s implementation of timsort in and for java joshua s also the guy who implemented in 1997 the modified mergesort that s still used in java and one can hope that java will eventually switch to his recent port of timsort

1517391
width	height
bounds contains the height and width of your control which is what you want but it also contains the top and left properties of your control relative to the parent form so your hello is being offset on the control by however much your control is offset on its parent form

1517412
width	height
the getclientrect function according to msdn is actually only good for determining the client width height since left top are always zero

1517430
implements	extends
but if i m extends a controller and i call for example listaction on the page controller but this action is implements in content_indexcontroller it still looks for the list view script in the page controllers scripts directory

1517450
post	get
to get the names and values of your fields then validate them and then post myfields to your controller with a

1517458
vim	emacs
you can also use either vim or emacs for python development

1517470
vim	emacs	vim	notepad++
that being said i recommend learning python using a basic approach - use a text editor like notepad++ vim or emacs to learn the basics

1517473
expression-blend	silverlight
ran the project in blend dragged the dll files into c program files expression-blend 3 libraries silverlight v3.0 and

1517507
notepad++	textpad
visual studio and most other editors like notepad++ and textpad doesn t handle long lines well

1517532
textview	imageview
- consists of imageview textview

1517537
cos	sin
x r cos long sin lat

1517545
lisp	scheme
in a language such as lisp or scheme using s-expressions to represent the program text probably will reduce the amount of work for the parser

1517567
notepad++	scite
i find scite to be a good alternative to notepad++

1517584
vim	emacs
for dynamically typed languages power editors like vim and emacs make excellent ides

1517584
vim	emacs
you can use gui tools to make your layout and still use vim emacs for development

1517591
ant	maven
instead you should use an external dependency management system such as maven or ivy ivy works if you use ant but maven is both a build tool and a dependency management system so i would recommend maven if you can

1517591
ant	maven
any ide worth its weight will have plugins to support ant ivy and maven so as long as the developers have the plugin they just point to the appropriate ant or maven build files

1517639
nsmenu	nsapplication
- nsmenu applicationdockmenu nsapplication sender

1517670
haskell	ocaml
other languages offer some form of type inference the capability of the type system to deduce the type of a variable ocaml haskell scala kotlin

1517694
integer	unsigned
subtraction between integer values where one is of type unsigned produces an unsigned

1517700
direct3d	direct2d
if you don t plan on using wpf which might be overkill if you only intend to do image processing starts using technologies like direct3d opengl or the recent direct2d to apply with ease pixel shaders on a rendering target

1517704
chunked	transfer-encoding
but that doesn t even cover the potential for a server to send back a response with the transfer-encoding chunked header set

1517727
versioning	upgrade
then it will be up to you if you want to upgrade project to .net 3.5 versioning but if no - fine vs 2008 has .net 2.0 support as well

1517752
comparator	comparable
you could define separate comparator 1 or make the class comparable with a comparator method and a switch to determine how the fields are compared

1517775
firefox	safari
my understanding was that this feature is support in firefox safari and ie8

1517776
prng	random
by using a pseudo random number generator prng to produce the messages we can save the message keys whatever we feed the prng to produce a given message rather than storing the whole message

1517776
prng	random
this would make the database inserts and searches more efficient at the risk of wrongly picking the prng or rather the message generator based pm random numbers one which would produce at first messages that are somehow less likely to crc32-collide.

1517824
quicksort	heapsort
and some sorting algorithms are not like heapsort quicksort etc

1517882
changeset	cherry-pick
good branching support includes ease of merging and conflict resolution when different changes are made to a file cherry-pick taking one patch or changeset from one branch or the head trunk and applying it to another branch and the like

1517888
gridview	sqldatasource
the gridview control in asp.net provides updating capabilities when assigning a sqldatasource control to the gridview s datasourceid however when programmatically assigning a code level sqldatasource to datasource the built-in updating capabilities go away and you are forced to roll your own

1517907
firefox	safari
my understanding was that this feature is support in firefox safari and ie8

1517907
google-chrome	safari
nope it s only in webkit safari google-chrome and also via gears

1517907
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this is supported by firefox 3.5 ie8 and safari but not google-chrome

1517916
mvp	presenter
you could also consider the mvp model view presenter pattern it gives you the same separation of logic and presentation as mvc while it still allows you use the asp.net server controls

1517930
quicksort	heapsort
if you don t need stability you can use a fast memory-sipping algorithm from a library like heapsort or quicksort and forget about it

1517940
int	chars
then just sum everything togeter in right way and you got array of unsigned chars whit int

1518025
post	get
i chose _request because it handles both post and get but you could use _post as meder described

1518057
width	height
toolbarbuttons don t have height width or size properties

1518059
getter	setter
however you could provide a way of constructing a c instance from a b -- either by having the c copy the properties from the b or by having the c store the b as a private member and delegate property getter and setter to the contained b

1518161
int	chars
if you want to go from chars to int and back no need to add anything - you can simply treat the unichar as an int

1518167
min	max
i did it with the following code which uses the built-in min max and square procedures

1518176
dictionary	map
more generally you use a map implementation when you need to efficiently retrieve items by lookup retrieving something based on the key - such as dictionary caches repositories etc

1518272
nsurl	nsdata
init the vc subclass with an nsurl and then download the contents of the nsurl into an nsdata object

1518297

it looks fine it firefox but opera 9.64 displays it large size

1518338
implements	extends
i have implements a custom listview by extends linearlayout for every row

1518347
width	height
to extract width and height

1518386
int	chars
if the member is a int float chars etc it is undefined

1518488
post	get
if you dont know where to get the dependency dll post the name here and we can see what we can do about it

1518499
portrait	landscape
my application is in landscape mod.when i call mfmailcomposeviewcontroller through present model view it comes in landscape mod.i rotate device and mfmailcomposeviewcontroller view goes to portrait mod i want to restrict this rotation it should always be in landscape mod only.is there any way to do it

1518511
google-chrome	firefox
now in ie8 and google-chrome it finds the passed argument as htmldiv and works fine but in firefox it give an error cc223423432 is undefined

1518578
serializable	deserialization
reconstituting objects from their serializable form is generally called deserialization

1518613
post	get
i used dotfuscator to encrypet my dlls and on post build event i wrote command to get the encrypted dlls instad of old ones and finally i published my website

1518639
width	height
use this constructor to create the bitmap - bitmap int type int width int height

1518642
filtering	grouping
depending on how you mean filtering you could either use distinct or maybe grouping by both are used to remove or grouping duplicate entries

1518707
merb	ruby-on-rails
it has support for ruby-on-rails gae merb couchdb air webkit and i m sure it would be a snap to connect it to your java implementation

1518720
free	malloc
malloc and free are system compiler dependent so it s hard to give a specific answer

1518734
free	malloc
the malloc free implementation remembers the size of each block as it is allocated so it is not necessary to remind it of the size when freeing

1518778
next	except
or to make it much nicer for the user incorporate jquery to hide all of the fields except the first one and provide a button for them to click that unhides the next one

1518780
implements	extends
we can extends a class but we cannot implements a class

1518780
implements	extends
we can implements an interface but cannot extends an interface

1518784
int	chars
so if you put a string with 20 chars and three int in a session object that will use about 100 + 8 + 8 + 20 2 + 3 20 216 bytes

1518800
implements	extends
interfaces in contrast to ifoo for interfaces in the .net world and instead uses the difference between extends and implements to signify the difference to the programmer

1518802
implements	extends
i hope this small examples clears the differences between extends and implements

1518806
implements	extends
the implements java keyword is used to implements an interface where the extends is used to extends a class

1518806
implements	extends
remember in java you can only extends one class and implements zero to many interfaces for the implements class

1518811
superclass	subclassing
in fact if a superclass implements an interface then any subclassing will also be considered to implement that interface

1518811
inherited	subclassing
in java there is no multiple inherited so that a sub class can only have one parent class and subclassing should be considered carefully so as to choose an appropriate parent if any at all

1518811
inherited	subclassing
but having a fileutils parent class with some utility methods in and then subclassing that all over the place in order to inherited that functionality is a bad idea in this case you should likely declare the helper methods static or hold a reference to a fileutils instance instead

1518843
wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe
you could generate a web service client proxy using one of the tools available in .net either through visual studio or one of the command-line programs wsdl.exe when using asmx or svcutil.exe when using wcf and make the resulting class and its containing assembly available to com

1518898
qmainwindow	qpushbutton
connect a signal from this widget to a slot from the qmainwindow for example if the widget is a qpushbutton connect the signal click to the qmainwindow custom slot you have created

1518904
ready	each
it will make your client code more complex since you ll have to handle the return of each async call and determine when they have all completed and you re ready to build your xml

1518915
disk	ram
since ram seems to be the new disk and since that statement also means that access to memory is now considered slow similarly to how disk access has always been i do want to maximize locality of reference in memory for high performance applications

1518922
post	get
if you get it to work post back and let me know i d be quite interested in how you did this

width	height
how can i fix the width and height for a retrieved image

1519045
hide	show
and then to hide show it

1519046
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
the default behaviour when pushing a uiviewcontroller on a uinavigationcontroller is for the os to display a back button that pops the uiviewcontroller off again

1519062
width	height
check all images have width and height attributes

1519073
width	height
resizes image you specify max height width

1519161
multiplying	add
i assume you don t need me to tell you how to perform rounding if necessary multiplying it by 100 and add the extra passenger fees

i want to authenticate via ad from my webserver i even test the port 389 and it was open by telnet i even added port 389 udp and tcp to firewall of webserver to be sure it is open even i turned the firewall off but nothing changed

1519362
sproutcore	cappuccino
maybe you can use sproutcore or cappuccino accordingly

1519363
children	parent
nh return back the list of both parent elements and the derived children elements which is right b c that is what i ve asked but that is not what i need

1519363
children	parent
the children elements should be only inside the father object but since they are of type parent as well - since they derived from it.

1519371
x86	64bit
some old x86 instructions are undefined in 64bit mode

1519399
post	get
in your case i think you should use query string instead of long urls urls are flexible but to handle variable length of parameters it s better to use get or post

1519413
initializer	class-method
i have managed to add both instance and class-method to the model in question by including a module from within an initializer

1519418
hex	binary
hex -- decimal then decimal -- binary

1519419
rss	feed
i would like to get all links that match this description from a html page that has a list of rss feed

1519436
getter	setter
i had indeed forgotten the getter and the setter

1519498
pop-up	dialog
log or pop-up in a dialog box fontname just before you try to create the font and i m sure that ll show you what s going on

1519509
irrlicht	ogre3d
try ogre3d or irrlicht

1519509
irrlicht	ogre3d
with ogre3d and irrlicht you might uses .net as well though the ports are not always up to date and plugins are not as easyly included as in the c++ versions

1519617
pop-up	dialog
i need to pop-up a success confirmation dialog after a user clicks to add someone to his friends list

1519656
postgresql	mysql
our company is continuously improving the implementation of the linq to sql tecnology for oracle mysql postgresql and sqlite databases

1519715
cairngorm	flex
it worked fine and i felt that the approach could handle a fairly large group we used cairngorm on the flex side btw

1519719
getter	setter
add getter and setter in customclass.java

1519720
translation	globalization
using the built-in globalization methods is a lot of work because you have to manually create each globalized form and then manually replace all the text with the translation and this task pretty much requires the programmer to be fluent

1519745
uiview	subviews
another way to do this is to simply put a uiview atop your main view s subviews mark its userinteraction property and grey it out when needed

1519745
uiview	subviews
you could even add a uiactivityindicator as a subviews of this foreground uiview starting its animation when needed

1519778
hide	show
it would be better to only create it once and then just show hide it or have it created from the start and then just show hide it

1519783
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
you could try subclassing uiwebview and override the touchesbegan and touchesmoved etc

1519799
scons	qmake
read about scons since you use qt - it support moc objects cmake or qt s qmake for that

1519848

1520017
profiler	yourkit
i am looking for a good .net profiler and stumbled upon the yourkit one

1520017
profiler	yourkit
but i am not very experienced in profiling .net applications so i wonder if yourkit .net profiler gets the job done

1520061
width	height
now this isn t particularly difficult - the drag drop example is simply a matter of changing the x y coordinates of the svg object or a resize operation would be a simple matter of changing its width or height

1520069
for-loop	arrays
and temparray is being loaded with the archived arrays but when i go through the for-loop poollistdata addobject testtemp

1520092
touchesbegan	touchesended
you can do this very easily by comparing the touch at touchesbegan touch and the touchesended touch coordinates

1520104
folder	directory
i have added it file application directory and it s present when the files are extracted in the appdir programfiles folder

1520132
width	height
now i want to get the actual pixel width and height that the browser has rendered this div as

1520147
width	height
offsetwidth height cumulatively measures the element s borders horizontal padding vertical scrollbar if present if rendered and css width

1520147
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
if that is not what you meant and you d rather only the element s width and height excluding padding margin etc try getcomputedstyle

1520147
width	height
the values above will be the final computed pixel values for the width and height css style properties including values set by a element or an external stylesheet

1520197
point-in-polygon	convex
you must know convex hull and point-in-polygon

1520224
width	height
control_ops array width 400 height 350

1520237
ienumerable	ienumerator
in .net ienumerable just means the class provides a method getenumerator which returns an ienumerator which itself only contains current movenext and reset methods

1520237
tostring	string.format
2 by doing a string.format on your list you wouldn t have been passing the list as an object to your javascript but just the tostring result of your list

1520322
submit	submission
i d check any of your custom javascript and make sure there isn t submission your form back to the server multiple times per submit

1520325
stdout	stderr
also that warning might be on stderr instead of stdout so tail +9 might be what you need

1520350
versioning	upgrade
this is a shared server and the versioning of ruby is 1.8.5 and can t be upgrade

1520466
children	parent
for example if the subclasses are dom nodes and if the algorithm is to insert a child node that algorithm differs depending on whether the parent node is a dom element which can have children or dom text which can t and so the insertchildren method may be virtual or abstract in the domnode base class and implemented differently in each of the domelement and domtext subclasses

1520500
min	max
as far as i understand the question you are looking for procedure to calibrate 6 thresholds min and max for each of the hsv channels from a calibration image that contains your tracking marker

1520500
min	max
set the min and max thresholds to the histogram

1520513
jobs	cron
ok now i m in a real project managed by maven and which is using cron jobs defined in some of the modules

1520528
post	get
to get the price we need to post an xml file containing the product id and the credential of our company to the manufacturer

1520566
ienumerable	ilist
but if your original ienumerable is ilist why not take advantage of it and provide more performant way without copying to intermediate collection to iterate items backwards

1520641
min	max
you must put all columns of the select in the group by or use functions on them which compress the results to a single value like min max or sum

1520716
min	max
it returns those as combined quality key with the min index sign-changed so the max operation will consider better those items that occurred earlier in the original list

1520725
ubuntu	debian
or if you use apt ubuntu debian

1520734
typedef	struct
for each class struct union enum typedef in the code base all i need after templates macros have been handled is

mouseover	mouseenter
use mouseenter instead of mouseover

1520792
sorting	filtering
have a look at sorting and filtering nsarray objects

1520818
min	max
it s a wee bit risky if you don t have constants wide enough but a lot faster than explicitly looking min max up from the table and most apps domains have pretty well defined frames

1520844
move	drag
if the user drag it open i seek the animation the appropriate amount forward based on how far the manipulation processor tells me they ve move

1520851
background-image	background-position
one option to try is removing the img element altogether and setting it as the background-image of the p instead with a background-position of left center

1520866

1520944
apache	lighttpd
if you are all apache all the time this isn t so much a win but if you ever think you may want to try alternate web servers such as lighttpd then you can swap your web server w o also having to make adjustments in your python app

1520987
children	parent
i want to infer the result of the parent from the children

1520987
children	parent
if any of the children have a pass false result the parent result will be pass false

1521078
pylons	turbogears
things like pylons and turbogears really did not have that

1521123
vim	gedit	vim	textmate	textmate	gedit
i need some script that will find and open files by given pattern within current directory and it s subdirectories kind of snap open for gedit fuzzyfinder for vim and textmate s open files

1521251
min	max
if you want the distinct of only one column then you will have to aggregate the rest of the columns returned min max sum avg etc

1521273
min	max
select user_id min created_at as earliest max created_at as latest count from profile_comments where profile_id 1 group by user_id

1521292
webclient	httpwebrequest
note that if you re using .net for scraping you ll need to use httpwebrequest not webclient for redirect-dependent scraping because by default webclient doesn t provide a way for your code to attach cookies and headers to the second post-redirect request

1521303
put	get
the items you put in them will get a release message when you release the array or dictionary holding your items

1521310

1521444
trie	tree
somehow uses for it does pop up in business analysis so i was wondering when have you guys had to call up your big o skills to see how to write an algorithm which data structure did you use to fit or whether you had to actually create a new ds like your own implementation of a splay tree or trie

1521446
post	get
it sounds like what you are looking for are get or post requests

1521497
put	get
if i put the copy task above the compile as shown below i get the message to the console but if i place it after the compile it is not seen

1521623
accessor	properties
or sets a properties whose set accessor raises an event whose event handler dispatches a call to a method that writes to tempstream which how this problem will probably end up happening. the first one will just produce unexpected results for no apparent reason

1521634
ubuntu	linux
at least on my linux distro ubuntu you need to either declare double trunc double

1521677
post	get
if you post what languages you already have experience in and or what the site is written in you might get a more specific answer -

1521714

specifically i think the major change was that they refactored the system after 7 to merge directdraw into direct3d so that the two systems were no longer completely separate between 7 and 8

1522223
int	double
this works because random.next int maxvalue returns a uniformly distributed int in and random.nextdouble returns a uniformly distributed double in

this is kind of a brittle solution in that it depends on the order of the get params but it works for your specific example preserves any get args after param1 and also preserves post args

1522676
nsbitmapimagerep	nsimage
if you re running leopard that method isn t available so you ll need to create an nsbitmapimagerep with the cgimage instead and then create an nsimage of the correct size and add that representation to it

1522847
implements	extends
one way to fix this is to extends and override the render method to implements some sensible markup-generation code

1522849
width	height
i do this all of the time and simply setting a child control s size width or height property has always worked for me

1522895
primes	modulus
for each primes power modulus there are two trivial special cases

1522947
nfa	dfa
this can be done by traversing the dfa includes pseudocode or else by walking the regex s abstract-syntax tree directly or converting to nfa first as explained by doug mcilroy paper and haskell code

1522961
subtract	add
i d recommend storing it as an array of short ints one per digit and then carefully write utility classes to add and subtract portions of the number

1522992
addition	multiplication
you ll have to implement long addition long multiplication etc

1522994
int	chars
i want to store a 4-byte int in a chars array.

1522994
int	chars
such that the first 4 locations of the chars array are the 4 bytes of the int

1523025
atan2	sin	division	multiplication
besides the fact that it s theoretically impossible to simply factor out earth s gravity the first step i would take would be to benchmark each of the operations that you re performing multiplication division sin atan2 etc and then engineer a way around the operations that take significantly longer to compute or avoid computing the problematic operations

1523037
int	chars
assuming a platform where chars are 8bits and int are 4 bytes

1523054
squash	branch

one thing you can try is creating a virtualenv and then pointing pydev at the interpreter inside the virtualenv

1523373

when val function doesn t have parameter it will serves as getter not setter

1524960
profiler	yourkit
and i d recommend looking at yourkit for an easy-to-configure profiler

1524961
implements	extends
it s dirty but it works because localvalidatorfactorybean extends springvalidatoradapter and this implements org.springframework.validation.validator

1524963
children	parent
the output need to have parent list and children list under the partent list as follows

1524977
tunnel	lan
you can acces files on other server via lan or using a http tunnel but from the nature of http protocol it s not possible to access and write to remote files.

1525052
pull	push
recommended approach should it be more is to use an optimized table structure for traversal like pointed out elsewhere or to pull the data you need and push it into a dictionary associative array and query it that way

1525089
jobs	cron
then i add my jobs to that temporary file and make it a new cron table

1525116
versioning	upgrade
please upgrade your client to a versioning compatible with visual studio team system 2010

1525131
versioning	upgrade
please upgrade your client to a versioning compatible with visual studio team system 2010

1525133
quicksort	mergesort
as i know the best sorting algorithm is o n log n whatever the container - it s been proved that sorting in the broad sense of the word mergesort quicksort etc style can t go lower

1525174
versioning	upgrade
the android manifest file has versioning numbers and works based on the package name not the dispayed name so i think if you update your versioning numbers in the manifest repackage and deploy then you should be able to install as an upgrade which will preserve your user data

1525182
folder	directory
i extracted the auth folder in my classes directory and following the example in the example folder i created the try_auth.php finish_auth.php common.php file in the include directory

1525185
mockups	balsamiq
update i found balsamiq mockups to be a very helpful tool to do the mockups

1525185
mockups	balsamiq
update we had been successful using balsamiq mockups to create a design pleasant to the customer and we managed to successfully integrate this into the existing web content

1525213
button	checkbox
as when you hit save button your re-drawing method called and it again refresh your checkbox

1525252
gridview	rowdatabound
also the grid is bound to a datasource and i am only showing select columns from it by hooking rowdatabound event of the gridview

1525312
getter	setter
but the getter and setter in javascript knows nothing about the port

1525316
int	chars
where unsigned int major is the major number you want to request const chars name is the name of the device as it ll appear in proc devices and struct file_operations fops is a pointer to the file_operations table for your driver

1525321
addition	multiplication
just because multiplication has a higher precedence than addition doesn t mean we need to perform all multiplication in the expression before doing any addition

1525324
xslt	xquery
xquery xslt 2.0 xpath 2.0

1525354
button	checkbox
when i click the button a modal popup displays a checkbox list that allows the user to select options

1525379
.htaccess	httpd.conf
there are various ways to do that php.ini httpd.conf .htaccess ini_set .

1525395
junit	easymock
i have tried unit testing with junit and easymock but as soon as i mock or stub one thing i find it needs lots more

1525429
inherited	properties
that new runtime defined stringgrid created in a new page of a tpagecontrol should inherited get copy clone duplicate the properties and methods of the stringgrid parent already defined in the first page at design time and should be able to call the popup1 menu just like the stringgrid parent

1525441
inherited	properties
if you are creating a class that inherited another class all the properties of the parent method should still be relevant

1525463
public	protected
term will ouput protected or public variable sectionid defined in code-behind file in html markup

1525525
post	put
the restful gets are working as expected but put post are giving a 405 error method not supported

1525580
int	chars
i ve written several int chars s and the such to a data file with binarywriter in c#

1525593
gif	png
the following code will create a thumbnail file in a subdirectory called tmb for a jpeg png and gif file

1525644
nunit	mstest
at this point my collegue and i are looking at nunit along with possble silverlight options and mstest in conjunction with the silverlight testing framework that jeff wilcox wrote

1525644
nunit	mstest
i m not married to a particular framework but corporate seems to be most open to nunit or mstest

1525647
pop-up	dialog
want to know how to create modal dialog pop-up without title bar using javascript which will work on both ie and ff

1525657
unix	solaris
it is crossplatform runs on windows linux mac os x solaris and nearly any other unix platform out there

1525720
stdout	stderr
that s probably because the software you re running doesn t write to stdout or stderr

1525747
firefox	safari
the client website i am developing looks fine in firefox safari ie7 ie8

1525773
stdout	stderr
you should build the solution with msbuild.exe instead which is designed to give feedback to stdout and stderr

1525812
nunit	mstest
i m not going to recommend a unit testing framework but i can warn that the test attributes in mstest are sealed unable to be inherited in a new custom attribute which you create unlike nunit

1525846
children	parent
styles cascade on down from parent elements to their children

1525914
gridview	rowdatabound
i need the functionality to highlight the edited row in a gridview so on rowdatabound of the gridview i check which one s the one that has been edited and change the css style

1525962
vb6	vba
garbage collection was sub-par in vb6 vba

1525976
x86	64bit
but if i build using x86 32 bit it is working fine without any issue on a 64bit processor + 64bit os

1526021
integer	fractions
beyond that any definition including fractions seems useless and the more common integer value whole months between dates also depends on non-standard business rules

1526024
i2c	spi
minimal requirements are ethernet port 2 uarts spi bus i2c bus min 16mb ram min 4mb rom io ports

1526072
width	height
i ve tried setting an explicit width and height to the calendar widget in the smartgwt library using calendar.setwidth 500 and calendar.setheight 400 to no avail

1526076
spweb	spsite
2 spweb and spsite objects need to be created in the context of rwep

1526104
google-chrome	firefox
when the user clicks the button that downloads a file internet explorer google-chrome firefox shows the save dialog but the name of the file is the name of the aspx page for example if the page is named download.aspx the download dialog shows the file download.zip

1526132
put	get
for example if you hire a c# or java developer and put him on a fortran system and tell him to get work accomplished he is going to copy and paste throughout that system due to lack of understanding

1526171
put	get
as you get more complex with your error detection you ll probably want to put the awk script in a file and invoke it with awk -f verify.awk data.txt

1526191
getter	setter
i ve also defined a setter getter property for each column which encapsulates the logic for serializing and deserializing the json into python datastructures

1526201
postgresql	mysql
alternatively use asp.net mvc but with a free database such as postgresql or mysql

1526214
sequence	permutation
the nice thing about this code is that it returns a sequence of permutation instead of generating them all at once

1526237
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
since this is not a problem in any other browser firefox ie google-chrome safari the incompatibility seems to be with the deep-linking and the web-kit

1526243
oledbcommand	sqlcommand
this is very intrusive implies replacing all sqlconnection sqlcommand sqldataadapter and other components from system.data.sqlclient with the equivalent oledbconnection oledbcommand olddbdataadapter or odbcconnection odbccommand and odbcdataadapter

1526245
serializable	deserialization
you need to do the deserialization when the model is first loaded from the database and serializable on save only

1526282
dreamweaver	aptana
all the power of eclipse and all the usability of dreamweaver plus some nice aptana goodies

1526288
getdate	datepart
select cast datepart year getdate -1 as datetime

1526309
mouseover	mouseout
i know this has to do with event bubbling and mouseover mouseout but i can t figure out the logic of how to keep the menu open while the cursor is over the entire

1526353
solaris	bsd	solaris	aix	bsd	aix
sometimes you need it bash only because tr cut awk behave differently on linux solaris aix bsd etc

1526374
set	bag
for user-articles relationship you can use either set or list mapped as bag

1526390
implements	extends
use a partial class to extends your data class and implements the oncreated partial method and in this set the value to string.empty

1526394
extjs	mootools
you could also roll your own ui using the underlying cross-browser libraries yui extjs jquery mootools etc. or even just plain old javascript html css dom

1526443
subtraction	addition
since none of your operations are addition or subtraction you could do the whole thing in logarithm form and convert back at the end

1526468
ant	maven
i would recommend using a build system such as ant or maven

1526470
websphere	ibm
take a look at ibm help writing websphere mq base java applications

1526477
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
best link i could find google-chrome safari firefox with example

1526477
google-chrome	safari
sample source code safari google-chrome

1526557
ant	cruisecontrol
is this something i should configure in cruisecontrol or in ant

1526569
hex	binary
converting binary data to printable hex

1526601
gtk	gdk	gtk	cairo	gdk	cairo
it does however link against gtk gdk and cairo

1526601
xlib	cairo
it appears therefore that it is using either cairo or raw xlib calls to do its drawing on linux

1526645
profiler	yourkit
a great way to visualize this would be with a dynamic profiler such as yourkit which allows you to see all heap allocations

1526654
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
the above code works perfectly in ie8 firefox and google-chrome haven t tested in opera but only registers the click function with the first matching element and not all that match it

1526700
button	checkbox
the textbox value is whatever i typed in before i hit the save button but the checkbox is always false regardless of whether i checked it or not

1526709
put	get
should get you where you want to go put your table name in for table

1526728
put	get
in the other hand hashmap provides constant-time performance for the basic operations get and put so although it may use more memory getting an element may be much faster using a hashmap than a arraylist

1526769
mouseover	mouseout
you could try mouseover mouseout instead of toggling

1526787
dropbox	skydrive
i ve tried dropbox and skydrive but they each have faults

1526789
width	height
when i use the zoom-in button i use a double animation for the image width height to 1.25 of its original size each time the button is clicked

1526790
tostring	padleft
instead i d use good old tostring characters and padleft like so

1526793
stateless	stateful
i m in the stateful client-stateless server camp due to scaleability but when facing the hurdles of explaining why this and that became harder to implement using a stateless server you get kind of resigned in the long run this is where stateful server shines

1526793
stateless	stateful
i think stateful client stateless server makes you more aware of the amount of data that is transported back and forth between tires

1526793
stateless	stateful
also going from stateless to stateful is easy just ignore state info that you are providing since you already know it

1526793
stateless	stateful
anyhow gwt and many other modern toolkits silverlight talking to wcf seems to prefer stateful client stateless server due to scaleability issues

1526793
stateless	stateful
maybe stateful server should be the exception to the stateless rule .

1526809
getter	setter
as a result fxcop correctly complains that the foo property or rather its implicit getter and setter methods doesn t have the same linkdemand

1526815
filtering	grouping	sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping
i m looking for a feature rich grid sorting grouping paging ideally filtering etc grid that will work well under ie6

1526815
extjs	gxt
the most obvious contender so far is extjs or gxt

1526823
windows	wow64
even 64bit versions of windows still include msscript.ocx with wow64 in c windows syswow64

1526844
versioning	upgrade
we have an extensive classic asp site and we re looking to upgrade to asp .net most probably the latest versioning

1526863
getter	setter
you should be able to apply the attribute to the getter and setter directly

1526865
width	height
width 1200 height 800 toolbar yes menubar yes resizable yes scrollbars yes +

1526887
children	parent
this snippet will determine if the element has children using the parent selector

1526913
udp	tcp
its worth noting the same 16-bit crc implementation applies to tcp as well as udp on a per packet basis

1526913
udp	tcp
when characterizing the properties of udp consider the majority of data transfers that take place on the internet today use tcp

1526954
put	get
the only reason why it might get pushed out of the cache is if some other data is deemed more urgent to put in the cache

1527043
ssl	https
i enabled ssl on the entire site and accessing the site in https i can get static files..i can access the aspx files directly...but the routes no longer work

1527055
rss	feed
the basic answer to this is to use a method of getting the feed entries in a manner other than using the actual rss like outputting json going through the api etc

1527070
ssl	https
adding https ssl support to asp.net mvc routing

1527072
folder	directory
we have all of the com dll files located in sub folder in a com directory on the server and we want to copy that entire directory and register all the applications in component services just like they are

1527078
int	double
edit 2009-10-07 changing int arguments to double does not help

1527133
xrange	enumerate
use range xrange or enumerate

1527149
put	get
this implementation provides constant-time performance for the basic operations get and put assuming the hash function disperses the elements properly among the buckets

1527152
for-loop	loops
third you could use a while loops but even better would be a for-loop and the range and len functions

1527163
clipper	basic
look for polygon clipper or polygon clipping since the same basic algorithms that handle polygon intersection also tend to be usable for the general clipping cases

1527201
quicksort	heapsort
but if you want to be super-safe you may want to use something like introsort which starts out as quicksort but switches over to heapsort if it detects from the recursion depth that the algorithm is starting to go quadratic

1527222
nant	xmlpoke
for example we re using nant task xmlpoke to substitute config values during the build

1527260
folder	directory
currently i have a .htaccess file within the directory of the folder i want to restrict with the appropriate group that has access to it

1527274
xetex	xelatex
with xetex or xelatex the poitn is that you don t have to specify tex fonts you should use your system fonts

1527308
fast-forward	merge
this technique also falls down if an integration merge has been made with the parents reversed a temporary branch was used to perform a test merge into master and then fast-forward into the feature branch to build on further

1527325
post	get
rather when you have finished your post action redirect to the get action using redirecttoaction

1527358
inline	inlining
inline function calls won t show up as subroutine calls in the assembly code - the code to implement the function is emitted inline at the point where the function call would otherwise be that s what inlining is

1527396
stdout	stderr
for example level 1 always writes to stdout level 2 writes to stderr level 4 writes to syslog level 5 may create a new file and write messages to that etc

1527410
maven	pom.xml
you can pass an arbitrary property to a maven build using for example then configure the version in your pom.xml as 1.0.0- buildnumber

1527427
sharepoint	spsite
access to sharepoint assuming you create a new spsite in your codetorunelevated will be performed with the rights of the application pool sharepoint system

1527427
sharepoint	spsite
to summarize rwep to impersonate the app pool outside of sharepoint spsite impersonation to impersonate the app pool inside of sharepoint

1527446
rss	feed
that gets a bit stupid in this case since you can t just put javascript into a rss feed so you ll probably have to make some kind of gateway page on the same subdomain to load that page in a frame for you

1527451
acrobat	indesign
i checked this in indesign and acrobat

1527533
postgresql	mysql
installing a real database server is fairly easy so i d recommend sql server express as others have or even mysql or postgresql whatever is easier to set up

1527548
lisp	scheme
i have a passing knowledge of other lisp particularly scheme from way back

1527562
unix	bsd	unix	solaris	solaris	bsd
if you are doing it on a mac why not have fun and write a monitoring program that runs on an iphone that will monitor the network traffic under macos does something similar to the top function on unix not certain if top is on bsd or just linux solaris

1527603
listview	gridview
i have a gridview inside of a listview predefined in the xaml

1527610
cvs	svn
as of now the workflow is something like i import an svn or a cvs repository and then compile a document locally on my machine to get either a ps or a pdf file

1527631
ienumerable	iqueryable
the easiest thing to do might be to write an implementation of idatareader that can wrapper an ienumerable iqueryable is an ienumerable

1527646
min	max
i am after a result set that has entries where the max maxcolumn - min mincolumn for that group such that when their difference is summed up it is less or equal to constant c

1527646
min	max
apart from the max maxcolumn and min mincolumn value i also need the first record column a and last record column b values before creating a new entry in this result set

1527687
stdout	stderr
each process actually gets its stdin stdout and stderr file identifiers 0 1 and 2 from the calling process

1527687
folder	directory
finder sets the current working directory to the folder where the .app bundle is located so the above emulates it all best

1527687
stdout	stderr
console is usually used for viewing stdout and stderr

1527687
stdout	stderr
i cannot test this since i m not on mac but i ve actually found some sources that say that stdout and stderr should be redirected there

1527687
stdout	stderr
you can use console.app to see the output of applications launched in the normal manner because the launch infrastructure specifically sends their stdout and stderr there

1527693
hide	show
have multiple sections divs and show hide different ones using javascript which may or may not involve ajax and need not be a tabbed interface

1527693
post	put
can t offer more detail on how to do that without knowing what you re using on the server side php java but the idea is to use javascript to put the selected rows into the post data by setting a hidden field for the selected rows

1527694
portrait	landscape
when user selects landscape printing from print setup it is printer in portrait again anyway

1527743
min	max
for example if my max number in my xml is 12 and my min is 11 the charts top is 12 and the charts bottom is 11 with 11.2 11.4 11.6 11.8 in between

1527820
min	max
now we d like a number between min inclusive and max exclusive

1527820
min	max
we can use the math.random to get the correspondent in the min max interval

1527820
min	max
don t forget to add min back so that we get a number in the min max interval

1527820
min	max
the second one returns an integer between min and max both inclusive

1527820
ceil	floor
now for getting integers you could use round ceil or floor

1527820
min	max
both min and max only have approximately half the chance to roll

1527820
min	max
with max excluded from the interval it has an even less chance to roll than min

1527832
min	max
the code will also record the edge cases so if the the function produces a value greater than the max or less than the min you.will.know.about.it

1527852
multiplying	add
manipulate add multiplying by an

1527856
int	chars
so i know about string#codepointat int but it s indexed by the chars offset not by the codepoint offset

1527856
int	chars
using string#charat int to get the chars at an index

1527863
versioning	upgrade
i would go with richardod s suggestion and either bite the bullet and upgrade or find a versioning of visual studio 2005

1527868
free	malloc
when you have arrays of arrays of arrays ... in the form of pointers you need to malloc and free every level individually

1527868
free	malloc
i put it all in the main function but it s the same idea if the malloc s and free s are in their own function

1527877
nginx	lighttpd
you can conceivably use a different lighter weight webserver like nginx lighttpd to serve the static content

1527881
firefox	safari
the error occurs in ie firefox and safari but not chrome...alas

1527907
nswindow	nsbutton
i was thinking of using a transparent nswindow with transparent nsbutton containing pngs with alpha for each button but i think the overlapping buttons will be a problem

1527907
mouseup	mousedown
1- subclass nscontrol and override drawrect mouseup mousedragged and mousedown

1527907
nsbitmapimagerep	nsimage
first it looks like the nsbitmapimagerep is flipped horizontally compared to my nsimage

1527916
versioning	upgrade
my versioning is a hybrid of features from the versioning 2.0 and 2.5- it has all of the reading functionality with some 2.5 upgrade but no writing

1527937
getschematable	executereader
call executereader then getschematable to figure out the order of the columns

1527987
rss	feed
i am setting up rss feed for searches and journal alerts from the ebsco

1527991
realloc	malloc
is reporting realloc events as malloc events so objectalloc tallies

1528013
sorting	filtering
in this case you are presumably storing the sorting filtering in

1528013
sorting	filtering
in short store the item number wherever you are storing the filtering sorting information

1528059
autocomplete	multi-select
because the number of bands possible to list for an event should not be sent along as a multi-select box i d like to use an autocomplete that handles multiples like the tags box here on stackoverflow

1528059
autocomplete	multi-select
ideally i want to autocomplete like the tags here on stackoverflow and send along the selected bands id s in some kind of delimited string - all while letting django validate that the bands passed exist etc as if i left the annoying multi-select list in place

1528101
uilabel	nsstring
i have been looking for any example code for drawing a uilabel or just an nsstring or something on a curved path but have come up empty handed

1528122
sorting	filtering
when the filtering sorting criteria change re-evaluate the list and set the current index to a suitable value 0 for the first photo in the new list

1528131
button	checkbox
obviously in your button postback handler you would need to ensure you have the original html from the database and then either modify the input elements to add a text attribute to them with the value or more likely replace them with the actual values - otherwise you ll have to do lots of additional parsing of the form if your users start saving forms with radio button checkbox select lists etc

1528142
margin	height
i know 4.2 doesn t support padding and margin but i thought it supported height or line-height

1528151
mbunit	nunit
in this tutorial i m showing how to do testing with mbunit but it s exactly the same for nunit

1528158
gif	png
use transparent png to gain the full alpha channel and then a fall-back css for internet explorer 6 that uses gif or one of the many workarounds to support transparent pngs in ie6 except the workarounds using alphaimageloader

1528215
move	drag
this event covers move as well as removal so it should work for re-arranging items with drag and drop inside a list

1528221
versioning	upgrade
using svn versioning 1.3.1 unable to upgrade due to a configuration controlled cm server on centos 4.2

1528232
post	get
this one just seems to pass get variables to php not post

1528299
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
firefox i think got the paste event from version 3.0 and recent versions of webkit have it google-chrome and safari 4 have it at least don t know about opera

1528309
width	height
i wish to detect the width height of the uploaded html and store it in my db

1528309
width	height
how would you reliably determine what the rendered width height would be of the document in question

1528356
int	double
however it disregards issues of signedness and the question whether a floating-point type can represent the full range of an int type e.g float cannot store all 32-bit int precisely but double can

1528361
ant	maven
sbt is a build tool like ant maven or make

1528361
ant	maven
i mean it uses scala code instead of xml like maven and ant as the configuration source

1528367
width	height
edit note that ass other people have pointed out the height will also depend on the width because of text wrapping etc so you should set the width of the ie control to an appropiate value

1528386
width	height
as you ve discovered you won t be able to use a webbrowser control because the height and width reported are the height and width of the control itself not the document inside the control

1528399
nsmanagedobjectcontext	nsmanagedobjectmodel
you ll need to add the coredata framework to your target create a data model and instantiate the nsmanagedobjectmodel nspersistentstorecoordinator and nsmanagedobjectcontext objects

1528402
hide	show
no you can remove them from the designer as show but you cannot really hide them form code as that would violate the substitution principle

1528457
int	double
field length create your fields as large as you ll need them but don t go over - for instance if you have a number field and the value will never be over 1000 for the sake of argument then don t type it as a long int something smaller like int would be more appropriate or use a single instead of a double for decimal numbers etc

1528507
post	get
for some reason his simple form wasn t passing either post or get data through to his php script

1528580
getter	setter
use getter and setter to pass through references to your dependencies as mxml attributes and store them locally then inside this handler you will apply them

1528617
post	get
whatever you do make sure that it s submitted by post and not get

1528618
move	drag
i want the user to be able to hold the ctrl key down left-click anywhere on my form and drag it and have it move

1528648
maven	pom.xml
the problem is we use maven to do some filtering in one of the configuration xml files in the webapp faces-config.xml so it replaces properties within the xml file with properties from maven s pom.xml

1528649
gif	png
there are lots of jpg gif png etc

1528652

1528748
daemons	systemd
you ll get better systemd programming experience by creating a process that runs as a daemons and is controlled via a command-line interface

1528764
cpu	processors
i d suggest to start from reading about processors functions you are using there are some info especially about rsqrt cpu is using internal lookup table with huge approximation which makes it much simpler to get the result

1528778
public	protected
note not using is_callable as it only verifies if the parameter can be called as a function but does not check if it s actually callable with the current visibility public private protected

1528833
maven	m2e
if you are not using the m2e plugin there might be a solution described in getting maven and eclipse to work together to filter resources

1528889
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
all is well in safari and opera mac but in firefox mac the vertical bars get distorted -- as if the rendering of the top of the bar is not in sync with the bottom

1528910
hide	show
rather than show the user the splash screen i d like to hide the application for the first couple of seconds after starting it by keeping my window topmost and maximized

1528926
hash	md5
client generates response by md5 hashing the password then md5 hashing the previous hash with the challenge prepended 2

1528930

this function should fadein the id box when class display is clicked if the box is not animated and has a display value of none or fadeout if the #box had a display value of is not none

1528999
folder	directory
or you could add a virtual directory to iis or whatever under your unit test s iis folder that points to the original project and write your script tag to reference that.

1529039
initializer	class-method
basically i want to call a class method but not create a new object but when the class method is called i want a handful of static constant variables to be initializer that need to be shared among the different class-method

gridview	linqdatasource
i m using a standard gridview with a linqdatasource

1529081

1529150
lisp	scheme
update i seem to recall that at least some lisp allow you to pretty-print a function as code eg scheme s pretty-print function

1529161
post	get
either provide a view where your win32 client can post to the django server and get a response that means good login or bad login

1529186
touchesbegan	touchesended
perhaps you could try either retaining the uitouch and uievent or forging copies using custom classes that have the same class signatures then re-send the touchesbegan and touchesended events after setting editable to yes

1529191
hide	show
the click function simply looks for all span tags in the paragraph toggles them visible the show function might be a better choice here actually and then hide the read more link

1529204
solaris	aix	filesystems	xfs
log-structured or journaled filesystems such as those supplied with aix and solaris and jfs reiserfs xfs ext3 etc.

1529240
put	get
if i delete rows the footer stays put â unless of course it was already hidden and i didn t perform the aforementioned incantation to get it back

1529243
put	get
but there must be some way to get maven to put the required jars in the target directory

1529251
bash	tcsh
i m trying to set up directory completion in tcsh and or bash both are used at my site with a slight twist for a particular command foo i d like to have completion use a custom function to match the first -delimited term to an actual subtree node and then follow normal directory completion for any successive terms

1529251
bash	tcsh
i ve made several attempts of custom bash and tcsh completion to do this but the closest i ve gotten is a form of word completion where the user must treat the directory levels as separate words with spaces foo scene shot element workspace ...

1529251
bash	tcsh
fwiw here is what i ve got so far in tcsh first then bash

1529251
bash	tcsh
tcsh example note the function is actually a bash script

1529269
int	chars
execv accepts two parameters like so int execv const chars path chars const argv

1529273
maven-dependency-plugin	maven-jar-plugin
for a normal java application such as yours you can use the maven-dependency-plugin to copy your dependencies to a directory from the maven repository and configure the maven-jar-plugin to add the jar files to your manifest classpath by creating an executable jar

1529281
activemq	rabbitmq
i saw apache activemq and rabbitmq but it seems a bit overkill for what i need to do

1529296
system.data.oracleclient	odp.net
remark the ado.net team is deprecating system.data.oracleclient so for future projects you should use odp.net

1529299
clang	llvm
clang llvm shows no problems

1529312
inherited	properties
i m in the process of creating my own custom modelbinder that inherited from defaultmodelbinder and manually binds xelement-typed properties

1529325
retaincount	dealloc
trace the retaincount of the settingobject object in settingsdetailviewcontroller debugger or nslog statements where you use it and after you release it in dealloc

1529352
expression-blend	silverlight
you can also use expression-blend to author silverlight applications but as long as you are comfortable writing xaml without a visual designer you might find visual studio a bit more mature from a developer standpoint

1529352
webclient	httpwebrequest
if you want to do post operations from within silverlight without using a web service framework like .net ria services or wcf you can use a webclient or httpwebrequest object

1529397
button	checkbox
if you check out the quirksmode event compatibility tables you ll see that ie has some issues with the change event in radio button and checkbox

1529397
extjs	mootools
to overcome this problem you should be using a javascript framework like jquery yui dojo mootools extjs or closure

1529397
onchange	onblur
also if you re unfamiliar with browser events entirely make sure you understand the difference between onchange and onblur

1529420

1529420
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
the browsers they claim as supported at this very-high-bar level are as of dojo 1.3.2 ie 6 to 8 safari 3.1 to 4 firefox 2 to 3.5 google-chrome 1 to 2 core functionality including event handling also works on opera konqueror firefox 1.5 ...

1529496
getter	setter
in python you can define a object having __getattr__ self key method to handle all unknown attributes to be solvable in programmatic manner but in javascript you can only define getter and setter for pre-defined attributes

1529572
width	height
i have described the pane height and width in

1529588
subclass	abstract-class
but unless you re using such excellent testing practices and patterns i d be suspicious of abstractions that have a single concrete example -- interfaces with just one implementation no less than abstract-class with just one concrete subclass

1529627
inline	inlining
the jit compiler does do inlining of code but the fact that the c# compiler generates lambdas as delegate instances means that it is unlikely that the jitter can reasonably inline this code

1529632
hide	show
i expect that i will show the red view and then immediately hide it with some animation

1529632
put	get
another point is if i put this code in applicationdidfinishlaunching the red view does not appear at all and all logs get null

1529643
fseek	ftell
i ve tried using ftell and fseek and i had the same issue

1529704
post	put
alternatively when the author post the article the author can highlight what are the keywords that can be used in the description which can then be automatically put in the meta description tag

1529738
gridview	objectdatasource
firstly make sure you have set the datakey property on your gridview a to be the id property of the underlying object or whatever you want to pass through to objectdatasource b s select method

1529738
gridview	objectdatasource
this will pass on the selected rows datakey from gridview a to the method linked to objectdatasource b

1529795
mockups	balsamiq
i have used balsamiq for website mockups but i am creating a spec that needs to be close to exact - balsamiq is great for rougher mockups is there anything you would recommend

1529809
post	get
unload would be fine as it wouldn t wipe out the post or get request i don t think only the values left over on the page as it is left behind

1529816
junit	testng
and if you decide otherwise it is not a big undertaking to convert from junit to testng or visa versa

1529836
min	max
from the above two table i am taking intime that is min time as intime on the date and max time as outtime on the same date from table2 where table1.personid table2.personid

1529873
inherited	properties
these classes inherited many unserializable properties that makes them unusable for the automatic web service serialization into json and back once sent to the client side

1529962
boost	stl
tested libraries stl boost are good use them and get on to more functional problems

1529964
integer	unsigned
setting an integer pk as unsigned vs

1529981
portrait	landscape
but this code give portrait even if i select landscape from setup

1530002
pop-up	dialog
this installation pop-up with dialog boxes to choose the setup type as resintall or remove and proceeds on by clicking on next to finish the set up

1530048
move	drag
if you want the dialog box to move when they click and drag you have to set the position of that div based on the mouse position which can get pretty jerky quick

1530064
post	get
when i click on the next link i get value of the hash and then post it to the another backend php script using jquery .get api and also set the new hash value for that link

1530075
nunit	mstest
read this site if you are running your os x64 bit and are using mstest 32bit it will fail use nunit works

1530141
post	get
request.getparameter doesn t distinguish between get nor post variables so if you have a parameter from the url you can get it with the same method

1530198
uiview	subviews
i m new to iphone development and i m trying to do a flip animation between a uiview and another uiview containing a regular uiview and a uiscrollview the scroll view in turn has several uiview as subviews

1530198
uiview	subviews
it is animating fine but the problem is that it will sometimes every third time perhaps start the animation with one of the subviews of the scroll view instead of starting the animation with the original uiview overlayview in the code below

1530240
uitableview	uipickerview
i want to find the best way to fit both a uipickerview and a uitableview on the same screen view

1530297
hide	show
since you know you are going to reuse them create them only once and then show or hide them

1530299
width	height
we can create as small image as possible 1 pixel width and 400 pixels high or we can create a larger image with 400 pixels height

1530331
google-chrome	safari
however i ve got this featured news section on my site which on mouse hover slides more information into place and this section doesn t perform very well in any browser except safari and probably google-chrome too then.

1530331
mouseover	mouseout
the reason for this i believe is that it s doing quite some dom traversing and calculations on every mouseover mouseout event before animating

1530364
g++	gcc
even if you are not linux guy as you said you can still use the gcc g++ compiler to compile your cpp code with a single line on windows

1530461
awt	swing
after googling out i found some links but all those are talking about gui events in awt and swing

1530486
filesystems	ntfs
if this option is turned on and anonymous access is denied iis will check the supplied credentials against the active directory and the ntfs filesystems privileges of the requested resources

1530581
free	malloc
i don t spread error prone code for handling memory allocations with malloc and free all over my codebase

1530581
free	malloc
i have exactly one single location in my code where malloc and free are called

1530581
free	malloc
additionally it enables anything with the need to modify only one location beginning with simple debugging checks like counting the successful calls to malloc and free and verify at program termination that both numbers are equal up to all kinds of extended security checkings

1530591
implements	extends
beans and gui events propagate an object which extends java.util.eventobject to listeners which implements a sub-interface of eventlistener

1530593
integer	unsigned
setting an integer pk as unsigned vs

1530613
memcached	apc
it is currenty on vps with plesk 8 centos 5 apache 2 php 5.2.6 mysql 5.0.45 memcached apc

1530642
decltype	auto
i don t think type_of is going to help either if it is the same as auto and decltype in c++0x

1530670
keydown	keyup
i think this might be more related to the fact that in keydown you open your menu and keyup gets passed to the menu then instead

1530685
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
your solutions must be cross-browser ie 6+ firefox safari opera google-chrome

1530686
entity-relationship	diagram
it has 3 volumes and not only shows but also explains the usual use cases for entity-relationship diagram

1530745
post	get
i also understand how you could write views that extracted just the comments from all your post documents to get them into comment models same with users and tags

1530772
firefox	safari
this works fine in firefox safari but not ie

1530825
filtering	grouping
there is a filtering data button on the select field or grouping dialog

1530844
onmouseover	onload	onmouseover	onclick
i m trying to write a regex function to remove onclick also onload onmouseover etc. attributes from html elements

1530844
onmouseover	onclick
i m now trying to look for onclick onmouseover etc

1530879
put	get
also put the dropdown in a form method of get and action of the controller action url

1530949
salt	md5
i originally used md5 without salt then switched to md5salt+md5 then to sha1salt+sha1 and now i ve moved over to sha512salt+sha512

1530949
hash	md5
reason for md5 hash - obvious

1530965
stdout	stderr
plus you have full control over stdin stdout and stderr of executed program - including attaching callbacks to them

1530977
salt	md5
going from unsalted to salt md5 passwords

1530977
hash	salt
non-random salt for password hash

1530998
nsmutablestring	nsstring
as far as i can tell there are no nsstring or nsmutablestring methods to directly set an element of the string array

1530998
nsmutablestring	nsstring
until i find an answer and can do this with nsmutablestring i am going to use an unsigned char array and create an nsstring using the unsigned char araay

1531002
daemons	systemd
the way to write a mac os x daemons is very much like the way you would approach it on a regular unix systemd

1531002
daemons	launchd
there is some mac specific information on daemons to consider mainly regarding integrating with launchd

1531011
int	double
i did get a different error when i tried nullable int or double

1531018
dictionary	map
then use a string - delegate dictionary to map the instruction name to creation of a command

1531054
lisp	scheme
in clojure just like in lisp scheme etc everything is an expression and an expression is either an atom or a list

1531056
hide	show
in html-mode you can use m-x sgml-tags-invisible to hide show tags

1531095
post	get
the code you listed does an http get and a post with a whole ton of conversions going on in there

1531132
accessor	properties
first drop the semicolons next start using properties access instead of accessor methods next you will collapse properties into the shorthand constructor format

1531158
getter	setter
the __get function has a well-defined function header so you won t be able to create getter that return a reference for example which is really great when working with arrays - without the reference you would need to call the setter again.

1531178
accessor	properties
also i would use those accessor methods when setting properties from inside the class it means a bit more code yes -- but it also means going through the specific code like code to check some stuff they contain

1531180
accessor	properties
then set a breakpoint in the resource.culture properties accessor and the foo properties accessor and startup the debugger

1531254
int	boolean
if you require mxn boolean values to be uniquely encoded in an int you require 2 m n values

1531288
qpushbutton	qobject
2 another approach is to do void qpushbutton installeventfilter qobject filterobj on push button instance filterobj will implement custom focus events handling

1531401
caliburn	prism
there is also prism and the caliburn project

1531401
csla	prism
i ll update the thread once i ve had a good look at both prism and csla

1531458
client-side	server-side
in response to the page lifecycle page methods do not go through the server-side page lifecycle there is also a client-side page lifecycle too

1531559
postgresql	mysql
if you want to get an idea how some of the built-in functions are implemented you can look at the open-source databases source code such as mysql or postgresql

1531628
put	get
by making the field final you also get the added bonus that once the field has been set to a proper value subclasses can t put bogus stuff there except for using reflection etc but then all bets are off

1531628
implements	extends
edit also as pointed out by more attentive posters you don t implements classes you extends them

1531663
folder	directory
when the first windows 1.0 ui came along several years later said directory were represented by a folder icon in the ms-dos executive which is what the windows explorer was originally known as more or less

1531663
folder	directory
hence folder is a user-friendly metaphor for the more technical sounding directory

1531685
getter	setter
just use a interface with setter getter or the constructor variant from gustafc

1531687
wordpress	joomla
i have a website which i developed in joomla and a blog in wordpress

1531698
touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchescancelled	touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchescancelled	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchescancelled
i thought that by overriding touchesbegan withevent touchesmoved withevent touchesended withevent and touchescancelled withevent in this way should work but it doesn t

1531778
uiview	subviews	uitableview	uipickerview
if you just have a uiview with a uitableview and a uipickerview as two subviews resiszing the uitableview should be trivial and obvious

1531786
gridview	linqdatasource
when i used sql server profiler i noticed when i would get a list of all records using a linqdatasource to bind to a gridview i would see two queries being executed

1531797
mp3	wmv
the browser displays media files with wmp so i do not understand why wmv will not play but mp3 mpg work fine which are also played in wmp

1531817
getter	setter
though one of the lovely things about as3 is that because of how getter and setter are handled you can switch from public fields to accessor-controlled private fields without needing to make any changes to code that uses this object

1531819
min	max
select firsta min a lastb max b min_mincolumn min mincolumn max_maxcolumn max maxcolumn sum_n sum n

1531834
maven	pom.xml
for example the following pom.xml sets the property and then uses the property to save the maven version to the project jar s manifest

1531874
firefox	safari
it seems asp net is only good in ie and never good in firefox safari etc

1531882
hide	show
i am creating a custom simple dropdown using jquery that hide show a element based on over state

1531882
hide	show
the problem i have now is that when you go over the show element it hide you cant move your mouse in to the dropdown that was created

1531978
yslow	pagespeed
if it s web it would be wise to note your page size and performance using firebug + yslow and or pagespeed

1531995
gtk	motif
i read all the comments about the gui but anyway wxwidgets lets developers create applications for win32 mac os x gtk x11 motif wince and more using one codebase .

1532002
octal	hex	octal	binary	hex	binary
you can also use oct to translate binary octal or hex strings to numbers based on the prefix

1532010
jboss	weblogic
i know this can be done in jboss and later versions of weblogic but i wasn t sure if it s possible in 8.x

1532049
rss	feed
so the data can be coming from a db rss feed twitter api etc and can be presented in an rss feed normal xhtml an mobile version etc

1532165
pascal	delphi
if you confirm that the dll really uses the pascal calling convention then specifying it in delphi is as simple as changing the stdcall directive on your function declaration to pascal

1532264
hide	show
my requirement is to show the edit link when user place cursor over the entire master div divitemholder and hide it when he moves out

1532282
post	get
rest is a way to define a clever get or post request to a server than can reply in various formats xml plain text json

1532291
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
it works in firefox google-chrome and opera but in ie6 ie7 and safari the god forsaken browsers they all give me parsererror

1532404
free	strdup
use strdup to copy the returned by c_str into a remember to free it afterwards

1532404
free	strdup
note that strdup and free are c not c++ functions and you d be better off using methods of std string instead

1532436
hide	show
it works perfectly hide the and show it when i click on the

1532447
translation	localization
hi i am writing a small utility too using silverlight 3 and wcf for our localization team to check and correct the translation stored in .net resource files .resx

1532493
punctuation	words
you ll really have to write your own analyzer i should think since whether or not some sequence of words is a phrase is dependent on cues such as punctuation that are not available after tokenization

1532513
xlsx	xlsm
using the xlsx open xml file format will be safer than using xls or xlsm since xlsx workbooks cannot contain macros

1532518
disk	ram
if they want their stuff in memory again a weird customer put the csvs on to a ram disk

1532544
stdout	stderr
but this solution leaves stderr going only to the screen and i want stderr go to both the screen and also to the same log file that stdout is being logged to

1532633
verilog	vhdl
i d like to challenge you to write a cpu ram in vhdl verilog and see how stuff really works even when really simplified

1532688
hide	show
it s easier just to hide and show as required

1532697
min	max
i first looked into doing this with gdi+ but it gives me errors telling me min max haven t been defined defining them just brings more problems i then looked into libpng s c++ bindings png++ and couldn t get the examples to compile

1532704
tcplistener	tcpclient
hey so i m trying to build a simple lan game using sockets not tcpclient or tcplistener and yes i know they are the same thing

1532704
post	get
i m going to be as straightforward as possible so i will post some code snippets so you can get the general idea

1532718
put	get	disk	ram
make note of the system requirements and i understand 8gb of ram is required for a production server - you may be able to get away with less if you can put up with disk thrashing.

1532764
hash	md5
you cannot possibly use more than one core to calculate md5 hash of a large file because of the very nature of md5 it expects a message to be broken up in chunks and fed into hashing function in strict sequence

1532777
min	max
defining min and max as follows

1532779
hash	md5
however you can md5 the file in sections in parallel and the take an md5 of the list of hash

1532779
hash	md5
also a hash such as sha256 should be selected rather than md5 for new projects

1532829
nhibernate	bltoolkit
check out nhibernate or bltoolkit

1532861
implements	extends
in your sample you are implements that list not extends it

1532864
ienumerable	ienumerator
along with the already suggested methods of using a foreach loop i thought i d also mention that any object that implements ienumerable also provides an ienumerator interface via the getenumerator method

1532871
minimum	max
you may want to impose a minimum length options like at least one number and one special character but no max limit

1532872
hide	show
you should be able to use the iteminserting event of the listview to hide or show the add to cart link button

1532885
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
while it s running smooth on firefox safari and google-chrome ie blocks the script execution

1532889
min	max
o n pass to find min max allocate

1532891
datediff	difference
because you end up with having to fix logic to add thresholds when datediff s start to come out with thousands of months difference etc

1532927
onfocus	onblur
you would have to use the javascript events onfocus and onblur and set a variable of some sort

1532940
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
edit in this example the catch block handles either argumentnullexception or argumentoutofrangeexception and places the exception instance in a variable of type argumentexception called e

1532950
google-chrome	firefox
ie7 does not display the border-bottom but firefox and google-chrome does

1532997
uiview	uiwindow
uiwindow is a subclass of uiview so you simply subclass it and use it in you appdelegate

1533000
uiwindow	uiresponder
uiwindow is a subclass of uiresponder which has apis for handling touch events touchesbegan withevent

1533010
gif	png	gif	bmp	bmp	png
i think it doesn t support png but bmp jpeg and animated gif

1533023
min	max
it becomes more suitable for proper performance testing if you use the clear snapshot command after the code you re interested in has been jited and if you use the mechanism of producing files you can parse them yourself to gain a min max average output

1533042
interpreted-language	compiled-language
interpreted-language and it seems as though it would be in my interests to use a compiled-language to serve up the site instead of an interpreted-language

1533049
puts	gets
include gets the contents of a file and puts it in the place you inserted the include statement

1533083
joomla	concrete
i would never build a new website this way but i was looking for concrete points to convince my friend that using joomla and asp.net together isn t a good idea

1533084
interpreted-language	compiled-language
that doesn t necessarily mean that your site is going to 100 run faster on a compiled-language vs an interpreted-language

1533097
int	boolean	int	double
using the above one can test for individual optional parameters such as boolean double int ranges or any variant via the optionalboolean optionaldouble optionalinteger optionalrange and optionalvariant functions

1533097
int	double
none of the above failed in my testing unless passing in an obviously incompatible argument type such as passing in a string into an int or double parameter passing a numeric value into a range parameter or the like

1533097
int	double
they can hold int values such as 0 1 2 -1 etc. of course but these are actually typed as double when held by the cell

1533097
int	double
to prove this you can assign an int to the cell.value but it will be stored as a double -- if you check the data type held by the cell.value via typename or .gettype .tostring it will return double

1533114
xslt	xquery
saxon xpath 3.1 xquery 3.1 xslt 3.0

1533114
xslt	xquery
xmlprime xpath 3.1 xquery 3.1 xslt 2.0

1533142
width	height
the left one has a border left set to 4px solid red a width of 0p x and a height equal to the the height of the selected dom element

1533142
width	height
the top one has a border top set to 4px solid red a height of 0px and a width equal to the the width of the selected dom element

1533142
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
so here is how it looks like in firefox opera safari and google-chrome

1533142
width	height
and anyway i used jquery to get the width and height which is supposed to prevent this kind of problem

1533163
google-chrome	firefox
what it seems like to me is that firefox waits for an entire page response before making any new requests to the resources required by the page while ie and google-chrome function by starting a new request the second it is encountered

1533177
mockups	prototyping
however if you do want to test out mockups of your application interface i recommend looking at briefs a new framework for prototyping iphone applications

1533193
firefox	safari	width	height	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i need cross-browser compatible javascript code that will return me the height and width of the current document area in all three browsers ie firefox webkit google-chrome safari

1533193
width	height
i don t need the entire window size as it is on the desktop but the height and width of the document as it pertains to css layout

1533244
firefox	safari
firefox works correctly to begin with same with safari

1533286
cassini	iis
problem was with hosting wcf services.i had hosted them on cassini web server which ships with vs2008 instead of iis.cassini does not allow streaming over http.so just using iis to host wcf services resolved this issue

1533316
width	height
as far as i ve seen you always have to set the height width of the container that you want to overflow so you need to set them

1533316
width	height
to deal with the resolution i would suggest you to add a jquery script at the onready event that dynamically would fix the height and width making the overflow work

1533330
namenode	hdfs
right now i have been copying the data onto the namenode and using hdfs s put command to ingest it into the cluster

1533408
mouse	keyboard
alternatively if the user selects a value from the autocomplete drop-down either via keyboard or mouse then the text field s value is set to the autocomplete selection and the form is submitted as if the search button was clicked

1533449
unicode	ucs
utf-8 8-bit ucs unicode transformation format is a variable-length character encoding for unicode

1533456
config	ini
external config static data ini style xml yaml database etc read by a config class of some sort

1533461
hex	binary
another tricky part is how the different dbms prefer to encode things like binary data blob values - base64 hex ...and probably some others.

1533487
google-chrome	firefox
i don t know why it is working in firefox but ie and google-chrome are certainly not doing anything illegal by requesting the resources early

1533501
rss	feed
skygrid for example gives live news feed and if the news is good or bad but it s all in flash and they don t seems to provide any rss other than their twitter

1533547
int	chars
then you affect your copy pointer to an int which has the value 0 the chars 0

1533586
ant	maven
if you are using maven or ant both offer the ability to do filtering of tokens in resource files

1533618
google-chrome	firefox
this works just fine in firefox google-chrome internet explorer 8 but not in ie 6 or ie7

1533619
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
supported browsers ie6 ie7 ie8 firefox safari and google-chrome

1533639
width	height
i am creating thumbnails of fixed height and width from my php script using the following function

1533643
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
supported browsers ie6 ie7 ie8 firefox safari and google-chrome

1533701
min	max
constraints min 0 max 100000 places 0

1533723
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
my thinking right now is that most if not all of the major browsers firefox safari ie opera will cache a js file the first time it is used and then on subsequent script tags the browser will use the cached copy if available and if it hasn t expired

1533725
int	chars	int	double
the default assignment operator will behave well with plain old data int double chars short as well user defined classes per their assignment operators

1533730
versioning	upgrade
running each upgrade script in sequence is required to get up to the current versioning of the schema

1533730
versioning	upgrade
one alternative is to require upgrading to each intermediate versioning in sequence forcing the user in this example to upgrade to 1.2.3 before 1.3.0

1533732
variance	kurtosis
thus the first four moments are respectively 1 variance skewness kurtosis

1533739
x86	64bit
if the servers are going to be 64bit then at the very least your staging testing servers should be even if your devs stick to x86

1533744
hash	md5
we found that the passwords are hash using the md5 algorithm

1533754
google-chrome	firefox
firefox 3.5x google-chrome 4x include it only once

1533758
queue	fifo
a non-database solution could be to have the client make the request async and then push the request on a fifo queue to control the requests so that only one request at a time is getting evaluated

1533771
hash	md5
you could store either in the hash field itself md5 d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e or in another column which algorithm was used to create that hash

1533771
hash	md5
hopefully passwords eventually expire and over time all of the md5 hash will be phased out

1533799
ubuntu	linux
when i try to use luainterface on mono on linux using mono 2.0 on ubuntu 9.04 i get the following exception

1533806
hash	md5
-- in the login process where you verify a user s entered password temporarily store the user s submitted password in memory no security issue here as it is already in memory somewhere and do the usual md5 hash compare with the stored hash

1533824
width	height
i got the width and height of the iframes document and then resized the iframe to fit the document without scroll bars then i resized the yui panel to contain the iframe correctly

1533905
strdup	malloc
but to do what you want copy a string and allocate necessary space it will be more simple and more efficient to use strdup that does exactly that a malloc and a strcopy

1533905
strdup	calloc	strdup	malloc	calloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	strdup	free	malloc
you should also not forget to free space you allocated yourself using malloc calloc strdup or any other allocation function

1533908
directx	gdi
also wpf uses directx to draw it s graphics now gdi or gdi+ which also gives it a lot more flexibility to draw advanced 2d graphics or even 3d graphics

1533908
directx	gdi
also since it sits on top of directx the gpu is used to draw all the graphics instead of the cpu like gdi so in a way you re using less processing power from the cpu

1533933
pop-up	dialog
if allowed then execute the button as normal if not then pop-up a modal dialog saying he is not allowed to create a new project

1533955
jobs	cron
it s quite ordinary to use php for administrative tasks cron jobs etc. which have no ui at all

1534088
post	get
the first step to understanding the request response idiom is to think of the request as a specifically-formatted defined by cgi - that is it s a get or post html action set of command line parameters and the response as specifically-formatted output html that gets sent not to stdout but across the wire to some browser

1534098
google-chrome	firefox
actual behaviour in firefox google-chrome the lastindex property seems to persist through multiple regexp creations

1534098
google-chrome	firefox
note this weirdness appears to happen in firefox 3 and google-chrome 2 but curiously not ie

1534130
teamcity	ncover
ultimately i m aiming for having a new ncover coverage report the summary one at least in my teamcity build project

1534141
opera	firefox
in firefox opera it only fires the mouseout-function when leaving the div

1534186
nunit	mstest
afaik the test class attributes for mstest are identical to that of nunit

1534189
hash	salt
a random salt string chosen by the server when it first computes and stores the password hash

1534189
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
if your database indicates they are using the old algorithm with no salt first verify the password the old way by checking that the md5 hash of the password matches

1534189
hash	salt
if the password was verified have the server choose a random salt string compute the sha256 hash of the salt+password and replace the password table entry with a new one specifiy the new algorithm salt and hash

1534195
width	height
if you compare a 1680 x 1050 monitor to a 1600 x 1200 monitor you get 80 extra pixels of width but 150 fewer pixels of height

1534199
min	max
for things like sum avg min max as well as non-numeric functions like concat there are simple o n algorithms and i suspect those are used

1534205
put	get
i don t see the problem really - i get a full size keyboard on my laptops and enough space to put two editors side by side on my desktops

1534221
profiler	visualvm
i ve used the net beans profiler which uses the same underpinnings as visualvm

1534234
ftp	telnet
telnet ftp passwd fsck rlogin

1534284
ant	maven
to answer your question you can either solve this with maven apparently or ant + ivy

1534286
inherited	properties
however when you do a write the interpreter doesn t actually care about the inherited properties

1534290
int	double
it works for double int and whatever other numbers you want to use

1534338
int	double
this is often used to declare a 2d array in which case each int pointer is an array and the double pointer is an array of arrays

1534370
children	parent
i have a ul li a that are children of parent ul navigation and li

1534377
prepare	execute
i d like to use prepare statements because it will be execute in a loop

1534407
super	self
using super ext self .__init__ resources also does the same thing

1534424
altera	xilinx
this is for the same reason that even the best fpga-based cpus xilinx s microblaze altera s nios are toys compared even to low-end embedded arm cores

1534436
powerpc	i386
i would like to build an app with a universal binary containing powerpc i386 and x86-64

1534445
put	get
well if you put your engine on the web for free for a few days and advertise a little you will probably get at least a couple dozen tries

1534455
pull	push
i realize i should probably push the vars into an array hash but i am really a beginner here and i would need further instruction on how to do that and how to pull them back out

1534525
google-chrome	firefox
for firefox and google-chrome this is no problem however ie throws an object not found error and does not work

1534592
versioning	upgrade
the scripts to create the current database are stored in tfs along with the source code and then dbghost is used to generate a delta script to upgrade an environment to the current versioning

1534602
versioning	upgrade
the upgrade tool looks for the latest entry then applies each upgrade script one-by-one and finally the db is at the latest versioning

1534626
std	ostream
to reproduce this bug write 1234 to std ostream with imbued ru_ru.utf-8 locale

1534626
put	get
edit3 according to the latest notes about c++0x i can see that std time_get get -- similar to strptime and opposite of std time_put put

1534675
pinax	django-notification
an example would be pinax s django-notification emit_notices script

1534743
csv	tsv
it accepts every format that the roo library supports including .xls .xlsx .ods and text-based formats like csv and tsv

1534743
csv	tsv
csv tsv is easy and fast

1534757
children	parent
so we have 1 root 2 parent and 3 children

1534769
uitableview	uisearchbar
actually if you removed the uisearchbar from the uitableview everything would have fit and it wouldn t need to scroll

1534793
mouseover	mousemove	mouseover	mouseout	mousemove	mouseout
it is best to use jquery as it also offers mouseover mouseout and mousemove function which you can easily attach to your image s

1534821
gradle	ivy
on top of these dependency programming features gradle adds project and jar dependency features by intergration with ivy

1534834
erd	diagram
specifically i need to draw erd and dependency diagram

1534849
swt	swing	awt	swing
since swt is built to be a fairly thin wrapper around native widgets it may be easier to work with than swing awt for your particular task

1534856
gtk	gdk	gtk	cairo	gtk	clutter	gdk	cairo	clutter	cairo	clutter	gdk
some of the components i work on that are that way include x windows glib gobject gdk gtk cairo pango and clutter

1534887
direct3d	directx
as kevin suggested opengl and direct3d directx are the industry standard libraries - directx if you re target platform is windows-only opengl otherwise

1534950
floating-point	integer
there s no such thing as a floating-point integer

1534952
stdout	stderr
you can even map stdout or stderr to a scalar

1535050
hide	show
the main thing is i want to create a window once and then show and hide it as necessary

1535077
visualvm	btrace
using jstack useful in case of deadlocks or the btrace visualvm plugin could also do the trick

1535080
implements	extends
if things need to be done differently you should make a couple of different data access classes which implements the same interface and maybe share common code in an abstract class they both extends

1535084
int	chars
here s a starting point the a chars as an int has the value 65

1535088
qsqlquery	qsqldatabase
we can t see what you createtable does the code that you have never calls db.open most of the qt database and sql calls return bool for success and there is a lasterror function for both the qsqldatabase and the qsqlquery calls

1535102
gif	png
imagescience resizes gif to png as it can t handle gif very well

1535137
sequence	permutation
having identified the permutation a precalculated swap rotation sequence can be applied

1535137
sequence	permutation
the second problem is designing the swap rotation sequence for each of the 120 possible permutation and that s probably a dynamic programming thing

1535219
testcase	fixture
in your tests.py file you can load the fixture on the django testcase class as so

1535236
folder	directory
i check out trunk into e dev projects mywebsite workspace and that directory is also my eclipse workspace but i excluded the .metadata folder from subversion and only check in the projects

1535237
nunit	mstest
doing a bit more digging i came across this comparison of mstest and nunit

1535237
nunit	mstest
i have never used nunit only mstest for c# and junit for java so i am kind of biased in that respect

1535237
nunit	mstest
unless you have a particular reason to take the nunit testdriven.net approach like you need a certain feature or you just prefer that way of setting up tests and trying to integrate it back into vs then i don t see any reason not to just use mstest which works right out of the box

1535245
post	get
in my web site i query my blogger account and get blog post to display on my web site

1535281
nunit	mstest
if and when you outgrow mstest then you should look at nunit or the more modern xunit

1535294
for-loop	loops
in your second loops you re printing out the same char for every record in your map note there is only 1 b c map does not allow dups which has been set to empty string either within the 1st loops or between that and your for-loop

1535318
int	chars
bufferedreader.read chars int int

1535318
int	chars
string.string chars int int

1535381
nunit	moq
nunit has something bundled for mocks but i d definitely point you to moq

1535381
nunit	mstest
on the nunit v mstest line i m not fit to comment

1535415
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
draw one 256x256 image of a circle and scale it down with a batch tool like imagemagick graphicsmagick irfan-view or some-such to all the sizes you need

1535538
mouseup	mousedown
i tried binding the blur to mousedown and mouseup but the flash persists

1535572
hide	show
show on click but hide it after a couple of seconds

1535582
hide	fadeout
if i change fadeout to hide it works

1535585
implements	extends
you will need to extends the actionfilterattribute class and implements the onactionexecuting method in your case

1535601
floating-point	integer
in python 3 they made the operator do a floating-point division and added the operator to do integer division quotient without remainder

1535619
firefox	safari
firefox and iphone safari use the service as well and they have their own implementations

1535625
firefox	safari
i have tested on safari and firefox on the mac and firefox internet explorer on pc

1535672
ubuntu	linux
when run on linux ubuntu hardy i get the following output

1535681
pop-up	dialog
i have an iframe that can appear in a jquery modal dialog a pop-up window or just as part of a page

1535681
pop-up	dialog
the height of the content of this iframe can change as elements appear and disappear and i need the containing iframe along with the modal dialog or pop-up window where applicable to change height as necessary to be just right for the size of the content

1535692
folder	directory
when i compile the project there is another directory in the war folder called wait for it... anothergwtapp

1535699
draggable	droppable
i have a page with draggable droppable elements that once dropped need to calculate their left position and width in regards to other draggable that they may be touching

1535713
emacs	aquamacs
you may also want to look at aquamacs which currently has a beta for the latest emacs and offers somewhat better os x integration than the default build

1535718
luabind	tolua++
you may want to look at tolua++ or luabind for c++ integration

1535718
luabind	tolua++
we don t actually use luabind or tolua++ yet mostly just a lack of time to test and integrate them but a few things we ve learned

1535718
boost	allocator
if you re on a memory budget consider using lua_setallocf to change allocator behavior -- constrain it to its own area of memory to prevent fragmentation and take advantage of a more efficient small object allocator perhaps boost pool to reduce overhead other ideas in an earlier answer

1535726
mouse	keyboard
this is handy when you want to catch events that could occur in a component s children such as mouse clicks or keyboard clicks

1535726
addeventlistener	preventdefault
if you want to do your own default processing call addeventlistener with priority eventpriority.default_handler...then other listeners can be created that if they call preventdefault can enable you to not do the functionality you want by checking isdefaultprevented

1535729
maven	pom.xml
however once i do mvn compile maven complains that there is no pom.xml file in the repository and attempts to download it but can t cause it is not published at any remote repository

1535751
prng	random
use a random number generator wikipedia prng page with constraints

1535830
maven-install-plugin	pom.xml	maven	pom.xml
however using maven 2.0.9 with the maven-install-plugin version 2.2 both versions are slightly out of date it does not generate a pom.xml

1535848
mouseout	mouseleave	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout
the solution to this error is to use mouseenter and mouseleave events instead of mouseover and mouseout

1535850
mp4	h.264
short answer h.264 mpeg mp4

1535861
mousemove	mousedown
put a panel or some other control in the corner using the mousedown and mousemove events of the panel adjust the forms size appropriately

1535861
mousemove	mousedown
in mousedown i would record the coordinates then in the mousemove you can calculate the difference from the original position to adjust the forms size

1535864
post	put
to do this in the formbackingobject method which gets called again after a post submit put a copy of the value in the request object

1535869
stringstream	fstream
the attempted approach was to parse in the first few lines to a string perform a search-and-replace create stringstream and concatenate the rest of the fstream to the stringstream using a sequenceinputstream

1535890
for-loop	while-loop
replace the for-loop with a while-loop

1535921
width	height
the easy way would be to do as benpearce said and put a panel in the corner and adjust the form size using width height

1535944
imperative	declarative
replacing scriptlets with custom tags eliminates the awkward confusion of imperative java and declarative markup that used to be common in jsps

1535953
int	chars
chars and int primitive data types

1535957
post	put
put the binding event of grid in to not post back

1536018
memcpy	memset
memset sets all of the bytes in the specified buffer to the same value memcpy copies a sequence of bytes from another place to the buffer

1536023
memcpy	memmove
perhaps you d be interested in the difference between memcpy and memmove

1536038
keydown	mousedown
change keydown to mousedown

1536067
put	get
to put it differently i need to get rid of edges in such a way that after removing them the graph will still be strongly connected and of least cost for the sum of edges

1536071
google-chrome	firefox
your guess about an iframe was correct there s no better way to do it as of firefox 3.5 parsing html from google-chrome on mdc

1536102
uncaughtexceptionhandler	runnable
if you know about the threads class by instanceof... you can obtain the runnable from it and create a new thread in the terminating threads group and start it from the uncaughtexceptionhandler

1536115
move	drag
you ll have to implement the logic yourself to figure out where to move the icons based on the geometry of your grid and the progress of the drag operation

1536139
children	parent
for example rather than have the children as being contained inside the parent you could flatten things out

1536195
width	height
in your code you zoom the image by increasing the width and the height of the image

1536259
post	get
i believe that many people get the impression that you are talking about http post after a form submission as opposed to http gets

1536304
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
also in the code you ve got you have touchesbegan withevent but then you are forwarding to super touchesmoved withevent instead of touchesbegan withevent

1536362
post	get
hi i have a php srcript that receives get data and i want to redirect the data from get to another page in wordpress using post

1536379
post	get
also you should use the prg post redirect get pattern to make sure that the credit card numbers aren t submitted twice

1536379
post	get
after the post don t just render a different view send a redirect so their browser does a get against another url - probably your confirmation page

1536384
switching	screens
i have added a second virtual device to test a different screens resolution qvga but now i wanna switching back to the first avd hvga again

1536400
gdal	proj
i ve an open source proj gdal that i want to compile and run as part of an ios app

1536403
emacs	textmate
of course if someone is a wiz with emacs or textmate etc. and doesn t generate warnings i have no problem with them continuing with their chosen platform

1536445
maven	m2e
using the launch with m2e has the drawback of not properly including all sources for debugging even though they are downloaded by maven see source lookup does not seem to work

1536472
put	get
it just comes down to a matter of syntax - basically where you put the to actually invoke this function and get your closure and whether you use the new keyword

1536479
children	parent
but later i saw the advantage that it makes linking parent and children fool proof

1536503
stdout	stderr
i would like to capture stderr and stdout without restarting the process

1536506
post	get
if i understand your question well - you want to get an object - post in your case - but only some of it s properties - post.annotation and not post.content which both are strings

1536513
versioning	upgrade
a relatively easy way to upgrade to a newer glib versioning is probably to update to karmic koala ubuntu 9.10

1536546
stdout	stderr
i don t think so but you can try to read from proc pid fd 1 for stdout and proc pid fd 2 for stderr replace pid with the pid of the process

1536557

1538972
countif	named
then refer to the named range in your countif formula

1539011
getter	setter
if the current value of the property as returned by the getter is same as the value to be set the setter is not called

1539011
getter	setter
note that the getter was called twice but the setter was called only once

1539051
int	chars
it can hold any of the scalar types such as int float and chars as well as pointers structures and object ids

1539336
trie	tree
good index data structures would include a trie aka digital tree or a ternary tree

1539336
trie	tree
i m going to assume a trie or a ternary tree

with min max

1539595
inherited	properties
i have built-in a registry object properties container that i pass to appropriate objects that no longer need to inherited from an application base class

1539644
inherited	properties
you could dynamically composite another class even multiple classes - this is often used as a work around to multiple inherited to inject the methods properties of your parent class into the child class

1539678
mouseout	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout
the mouseover and mouseout events are also fired when the mouseenter and leaves any child elements

1539678
mouseleave	mouseenter
try using the mouseenter and mouseleave events instead

1539699
ubuntu	debian
generally install build-essential it s in ubuntu so it should be also in debian and then do o conf init in cpan shell

update since you have all your data in a json object from the get go just do your looping through and put it all in a variable then just append that once you re finished

1539902
min	max
if you are using c# 3 or later you could use the linq extension methods there are min max and average methods and on list there is also a findindex method amongst others but i get the impression that you are learning programming and then it is sometimes a good idea to implement stuff that may be built into the framework just for the learning value

1539924
min	max
if you have an empty array you ll end up with max min 0 and both indexes -1

1539974
struts	wicket	jsf	wicket
wicket is a very simple bare metal framework where all logic is in java rather than being split between java and jsp as in struts jsf or other such frameworks

1539990
addition	multiplication
quote ... we construct an equation involving only whole numbers and addition multiplication and exponentiation with the property that if one varies a parameter and asks whether the number of solutions is finite or infinite the answer to this question is indistinguishable from the result of independent tosses of a fair coin. in other words no algorithm can guess that result with probability 1 2

1540655
width	height
if it s a loaded object you can get the metadata width height via loader.contentloaderinfo.width etc

1540677
free	malloc
much like regular malloc free there has to be some extra information saved by the system as you mentioned

1540677
free	malloc
in general the call to malloc or the new operator sets up a header structure in memory just before the the pointer it returns to you so that later when free or the delete operator is called it can figure out what s up with the block of memory you handed it

urllib	httplib
the problem is that urllib using httplib is querying for aaaa records

versioning	upgrade
since you cannot realistically choose any versioning other than delphi 2010 to upgrade to then if you are going to upgrade at all then you have to bite the unicode bullet and will find yourself presented with lots of tempting language features to tinker with and distract you

1541739
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication	division	addition	division	subtraction	division	multiplication
the term is apparently not an exact measurement as it is clear that a double-precision floating-point operation is going to take longer than a single-precision one and multiplication and division are going to take longer than addition and subtraction

1541740

post	get
like i would like to set it that if say a post or get or some sort of ajax request is running and it runs more then x amount of seconds

1542358
opera	firefox
this works in firefox and opera

1542388

is it public or protected

1542694
getter	setter
setter getter and anything that just calls a single other method

1542865
post	get
this is a classic problem and can be solved in a not so easy way using the post redirect get pattern

1542868
int	double
when a chunk of memory is allocated for a new object instance the runtime writes zeros across the entire block ensuring that the new object starts at a known state - this is why int default to 0 double default to 0.0 pointers object references to null and so on

1542872

1543534
strdup	calloc	strdup	malloc	realloc	calloc	realloc	strdup	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	strdup	free	realloc	free	malloc
intercept all functions that allocate and deallocate memory depending on the platform the list may look like malloc calloc realloc strdup getcwd free and in addition to performing what these functions originally do save information about the calls somewhere in a dynamically growing global array probably protected by synchronization primitives for multithreaded programs

1543589
width	height
however moock later came up with a workaround some code to check the actual visible pixels of an object and return the width height based on that

1543612
width	height
to use the iframe workaround you need to declare an iframe at the same coordinates same width same height with a low z-index

1543695
junit	testng
i uses junit for my tests so you need to adapt the following example to testng

1543697
versioning	upgrade
you can upgrade the client easily or stick with older ones - be aware that new clients will upgrade the wc automatically and silently so you cannot mix n match client versioning with the same wc ie if you upgrade tortoise you have to upgrade ankh as well

1543704
post	get
personally when i i try to do a post things get complicated

1543755
realloc	malloc
you are not checking if malloc and realloc succeeded

1543771
gif	png
another solution is to create a black 1px png 8 also supported in ie6 or gif that s 50 opaque

1543790
put	get
i basically want to read the source to get a better idea of how things are put together without worrying about the code being cross platform or having fancy particle effects or anything

1543922
opera	google-chrome
works in ie6 ie7 ie8 opera 9 ff2 ff3+ google-chrome 2+ and probably every other browser

1543967
int	chars
it is int and sizeof an int variable is 4 byte it may change according to system and compiler but the sizeof chars is 1 byte

1543995
gif	png	tiff	png
you would need to use an image mime type such as image gif image jpeg image png or image tiff whichever is most appropriate

1544019
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i have tested this successfully on ie 6 7 8 firefox 3.0.1.4 google-chrome 3.0.195.25 opera 10 and safari 3.2.2 on windows xp

1544039
width	height
when i try to export the report to excel im expecting that if the text length would exceed the width of the cell then the height of the cell would grow and the whole text would be shown

1544039
width	height
unfortunately the ssrs excel generator keeps the height as is and so only the part of the text which fits the width of the cell would be shown

1544094
post	get
you must use the post method for any large amount of data the get method can only transfer a few bytes depending on how much the browser and the web server allow in an url

1544128
magento	oscommerce
i am trying to port a site design from oscommerce to magento and i am finding it quite difficult

1544149
versioning	upgrade
if you normally upgrade each time a new versioning of delphi is released sa is great

1544156
width	height
just for example you asked about the width and height

1544156
width	height
there are actually four different width height specs for a single frame the screen width height the pixel width height from which you derive the pixel aspect ratio the active width height and the compressed width height

1544156
width	height
the frame width and height is the theoretical size of the screen

1544156
width	height
the active width height excludes the overscan area

1544156
width	height
the compressed width height takes into account rounding -- for example jpeg compresses in blocks of 8x8 pixels so the compressed width and height have to be multiples of 8 for a motion jpeg file

1544156
width	height
the active width height tells you if for example some pixels at the border should be ignored

1544163
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works just fine on firefox safari and google-chrome

1544163
hide	show
in fact the printing problem is there even when the table is generated directly with no show hide or element movement trickery at all

1544210
versioning	upgrade
the customization cannot be installed because another versioning is currently installed and cannot be upgrade from this location

1544210
versioning	upgrade
microsoft.visualstudio.tools.applications.deployment.addinalreadyinstalledexception the customization cannot be installed because another versioning is currently installed and cannot be upgrade from this location

1544231
put	get
because you will try to put a type with already erased type information this function will have to emit an unchecked warning and all type information on generic interface will get erased

1544357
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux	freebsd	aix	solaris	aix
our software runs on linux solaris hpux aix freebsd macos and it seems very hard to get debuggers for some of those platforms and much easier to just add some extra tracing code

1544379
min	max
i ve done this with the min or max aggregate functions which seems to work pretty well and is far simpler to write than most other methods i ve seen

1544401
put	get
you can get the list of arguments passed to your function regardless of what you put in your function signature by looking at the arguments local variable

1544408
versioning	upgrade
if you intend to upgrade to each new versioning sa costs less than upgrading

1544421
min	max
now you can play with varying min max step and the chart will update the data series automatically

1544431
memcached	apc
i don t want to use memcached or apc for this because i think that is a big overhead for just some small hashes

1544432
getter	setter
it looks like z without arguments was supposed to be a getter and with arguments a setter

1544444
jobs	cron
i m trying to write a regex with named captures in c# to parse cron jobs

1544510
folder	directory

i can t just downgrade my os s service pack in order to add an extra feature to the vs2008 installation

1544533
nsis	uninstaller
nsis has a great plugin system and you can program it imperatively using the logiclib plugin have automatic uninstaller files generated and lots of other things besides

1544539
crossover	mutation
as i remember crossover is not the best solution for tsp more suitable solution is mutation which is inverting of sub-sequence of the vertexes

1544546
keydown	keyup
however i m not sure that there are keydown keyup events for modifier keys like ctrl shift alt

1544547
post	get
i think this post will get you going down the right path

1544572
public	protected
in my personal opinion package private and protected methods should be tested as well as public methods

1544621
width	height
resize the image to fit the width and height of the polygon shape

1544674
queue	fifo
if you have a multiple-producer single-consumer queue fifo you can easily make one lockfree using slist or a trivial lock free lifo stack

1544684
vim	emacs
however i personally recommend you to get familiar with vim emacs whatever editor you feel comfortable

1544684
vim	emacs
the best thing about emacs vim is that the flexibility to extend the functionality through plugin whatever you call it

1544700
ninject	spring.net
i ve looked at spring.net unity ninject windsor and structuremap so far and i have no idea what makes one better than the other

1544701

1544919
iprincipal	iidentity
i m looking to create a custom authentication model for my mvc app but i m not sure where to implement my custom iprincipal and iidentity classes

1544990
versioning	upgrade
currently all upgrade work fine whenever updating to a newer versioning number however i m getting an odd behavior when downgrading

1544990
pop-up	dialog
this is working so far for upgrades but for downgrades an extra unintuitive step is needed which is to relaunch the app manually and then see a windows installer dialog pop-up before it launches

1544990
versioning	upgrade
the end result is that regardless of upgrade or downgrade the current versioning needs to be fully uninstalled and the downloaded versioning fully installed so if there s another way to accomplish that that ll also be a good answer

1544992
public	protected
specify bindingflags.flattenhierarchy to include public and protected static members up the hierarchy

1544992
inherited	properties
bindingflags.declaredonly to search only the properties declared on the type not properties that were simply inherited

1545004
ssl	https
when i have fiddler capturing traffic with decrypt https traffic and ignore cert errors both checked my web service call becomes untrusted i m able to view ssl in a browser but the web service call seems to be not ignored

1545088
interpreted-language	compiled-language
as far as performance unless your running an older machine interpreted-language such as python can run nearly as fast a compiled-language such as c c++

1545117
folder	directory
i ve heard of people storing all of their files in a hidden directory above the root and including i ve heard of people using an include folder with subdirectories such as classes functions etc

1545117
folder	directory
i heard of people having an uploads folder in a separate directory on a separate server all together like amazon.

1545129
queue	fifo
this would be a fifo queue so that signaling to the blocked threads is not random

1545140
submit	submission
when the user successfully submit a form with the token delete the token from the session so any replay of that submission will fail

1545148
content-length	content-type
if the client indicates they can handle gzip encoding via the accept-encoding header or or similar then compress the file cache the compressed result somewhere write the correct headers for the response content-encoding gzip content-length n content-type text plain etc and then use sendfile 2 however that may or may not have been made available in your environment to copy the content from the open file descriptor into your response stream

1545148
apache	lighttpd
alternatively if you have apache lighttpd or similar acting as a transparent proxy in front of your server you could use the x-sendfile header which is exceedingly fast

1545150
erlang	lisp
my damage from java and lisp makes me reach for optimizing down excess consing but in erlang you dont risk that global full gc that kills every dream of real time properties

1545163
ant	maven

1545235
std	ostream
std ostream has a member operator void

1545235
std	ostream
std ostream has a member operator int

1545235
std	ostream
for char the operator is not a member it is operator std ostream const char

1545235
int	chars
in the first example everything works ok because the member operator int is first called and then the reference returned can be passed to operator ostream const chars

1545278
width	height
just set windowstartuplocation height width left and top in xaml

1545309
folder	directory
i have the following sample test configuration that has hudson create a directory of empty folder

i think that c++ is the best choice i made some small games using free engines like ogre or irrlicht especially irrlicht because it s very easy to learn

1545326
post	get
the docs imply that it will always use get or post

1545336
post	get
get and post aren t the only allowed requests

1545344
min	max
back in my vb6 days i used libraries that let you find windows by thier title then from there you could pass messages to min max close activate etc but i havent done anything like that since moving to .net though i m sure the same types of libraries exist for .net

1545353
ggplot2	lattice
i m not an expert on this but it s my understanding that this is possible with lattice but not with ggplot2

linqdatasource	detailsview
try to bind your detailsview to linqdatasource and it will automatically update linq object

ant	maven
i don t know of any ant doxia task it really would be simpler to use maven or the invoke mvn ant task from within your ant build to invoke doxia.

1545438
queue	fifo
yes you would need to implement your own queueing mechanism if you want a fifo queue

1545463

postgresql	mysql
for later either mysql or postgresql i don t do either one professionally so can t recommend one

1545598
postgresql	mysql
mysql has some advantages like easy replication but postgresql is generally nicer to work with

1545608
maven	m2e
maven integration m2e also has some mylyn connectors

1545608
cobertura	eclemma
code coverage eclemma i find the cobertura plugin doesn t work too well myself

1545619
stdout	stderr
in order to accomplish this i create a separate pipe for stdout and stderr and use them in the startupinfo structure when calling createprocess

1545619
stdout	stderr
i then launch a separate thread for each stdout stderr handle that reads from the pipe and logs the output to a window

1545619
stdout	stderr
the problem i am having is that if the child process logs to stderr and stdout in quick succession my app will sometimes display the output in the incorrect order

1545757
public	protected
the get and set can have different access restrictions public get protected set

1545793
ftpwebresponse	ftpwebrequest
i m using the ftpwebrequest and ftpwebresponse objects in the system.net namespace to issue a list command

1545831
firefox	safari
well then something that acts though a web browser firefox or safari i m on mac

1545845
inherited	properties
but i don t want to copy paste the main controltemplate and change the color there instead i want to inherited from that like with the basedon properties in style and change the color in the inherited controltemplate

1545907
crossover	mutation
you should check genetic algorithm solution of the tsp avoiding special crossover and mutation by gokturk ucoluk

1545907
sequence	permutation
the key insight is to represent the permutation as its inversion sequence for each element i store in how many elements larger than i are to the left of i in the permutation

1545941
post	get
to me this just sounds like a post or get request to the url of the login page could do the job.with the proper parameters username and password depending on the form input names used on the page set in the request the result will be the html of the page that you can then parse as you please

1545981
lxml	beautifulsoup
python has several modules you might choose from including lxml beautifulsoup and htmlparser

1546015
stdout	stderr
if you re looking for a permanent solution your best bet is probably to redirect stdout and stderr to a file when launching the program

1546019
union	distinct
union will give you all distinct results as where union all will give you results combined from the sets

1546023
helpers	actioncontroller
link_to calls the url_for helpers which calls actioncontroller url_for

1546035
disk	ram
1 build a ram disk

1546037
botan	ntl	crypto++	botan
ones in c++ i know of include the number theory packages lidia and ntl and the bigint packages used for cryptographic code in crypto++ and botan

1546037
division	modulo
of course doing this by hand is easier if you don t actually need all the arithmetic operations division and modulo in particular are rather tricky

1546044
post	get
i ll come up with a slimmed down example to post but i m running out the door now and will have to get to this later this evening

1546089
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome have no trouble displaying the pages although i can t see the parts i want when i view page source

1546092
post	get
as sab pointed out get has a very small maximum size you must post the file and to do this you must use -d rather than -f

1546104
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome are only working because you have javascript enabled - try disabling it and you ll get a mostly empty page

1546107
g++	gcc
gnu gcc recognises all of the following as c++ files and will use c++ compilation regardless of whether you invoke it through gcc or g++ .c .cc .cpp .cpp .c++ .cp or .cxx

1546110
width	height
if at a given height there only needed to be one column to fit all of the items the width of the listbox should be the size of the width of the items

1546110
width	height
or at a given height there needs to be four column s it would need to be size to four times the width of the items

1546110
width	height
finally say at a given height there needs to be more column s than the maximum allowed width of the listbox it would need to calculate how wide it should be so that the items in the column s that would not be able to fit were not truncated but just not shown until the user scrolled to the right

1546123
post	get
according to the man page the -f option does do post so it doesn t look like it s a get issue

1546159
division	addition
however this is not true in the c# version because of the parentheses the addition will come first then the division

1546209
hash	md5
you can t store them entirely secure because you d need to be able to encrypt and decrypt so one-way hash algorithms like md5 sha-1 sha-2 wouldn t suffice

1546256
httphandler	httpmodule
but if you really need to you should have a look at both httphandler and httpmodule

1546256
httpcontext	httpmodule
this could be done in a httpmodule on the beginrequest event of the httpcontext

1546305
google-chrome	firefox
works in at least ie firefox and google-chrome

1546312
accessor	properties
as the user moves to new items the accessor of those properties makes an asynchronous call to a server because it is waiting for the first request

1546314
umbraco	dotnetnuke
this is actually a problem with asp.net rather than merely umbraco - i found the answer on a dotnetnuke forum

1546346
width	height
i need to adjust properties of these controls name text width height parent container etc

1546393
integer	unsigned
the unsigned integer value is the argument plus 232 if the argument is negative

1546424
gridview	detailsview
i assume by table and by the asp.net attribute that you mean a datagrid gridview or detailsview

1546431
charindex	substr
from this i d assume that i d be able to cast this back to a string then do some instring or charindex function to figure out where the underscores are so that i can encapsulate all of that in a substr function to pick out the part i need

1546502
hash	md5
unicode or terminal 0 can wreak havok on the md5 hash and result in wildly different keys from apparently the same password hash

1546527
public	protected
if you decide that it should become public protected or internal some day it s not difficult to refactor to a property anyway and with tools like resharper it takes about 3 seconds to do so.

1546565
explode	substr
your code looks fine i would just remove the substr explode removes the whitespace between keywords

1546576
typedef	typename
typedef typename boost graph_traits adjacency_iterator adjacency_iter

1546576
typedef	typename
typedef typename boost inv_adjacency_iterator_generator type inv_adjacency_iter

1546592
width	height
i have an application control bar at the bottom of my flex application with attributes width 100 dock false left 0 bottom 0 height 50

1546595
serializable	deserialization
you can then use xml serializable and deserialization to read to and write from a file your list

1546598
ocl	uml
uml and ocl abstract out a tremendous amount of mundane and low level programming that i was able to avoid

1546598
ocl	uml
uml and ocl are simple enough that users can understand what is going on under the hood

1546598
ocl	uml
when my users ask how calculations were arrived at i simply refer them to the uml and ocl

1546606
accessor	properties	inherited	properties
originally i had the multiplechoicequestion as just a member of practicetestquestion but it added a lot of extra dots in my properties accessor and so i changed it to inherited the class as listed above

1546617
yacc	bison
a few people have suggested bison and flex or their older versions yacc and lex

1546679
yacc	bison
if you use c yacc and the gnu version bison are the standard generators

1546687
post	get
the problem is that the redirect to the returnurl is doing a get not a post hence the error

1546704
inline	inlining
in computing inline expansion or inlining is a compiler optimization that replaces a function call site with the body of the callee

1546713
inline-functions	inlining	inline	inlining
inlining solves the performance and maintainability issue by letting you declare the function as inline at least in c++ so that when you call that function - instead of having your app jumping around at runtime - the code in the inline-functions is injected at compile time every time that given function is called

1546750
button	checkbox
note that checkbox and radio button are button

1546775
webclient	webrequest
webrequest webclient which i think are http classes use under the hood will check for explicit web proxy settings if those don t exist then then proxy setting from the os as set within ie are picked up

1546791
int	chars
a piece of text in unicode or in any other chars set is represented as a series of code points int that are uniquely assigned to chars which are named entities in a large database each of which has any number of properties such as whether it s a combining mark whether it goes right-to-left etc.

1546802
post	put
your question isn t quite clear but maybe your problem has something to do with the fact that browsers don t put anything in the post data for an unchecked checkbox

1546814
post	put
when the time came to transfer to our production server the stack began to crash consistently whenever a post or put came in with a large sometimes very very large body

1546814
post	put
one of the post put s that would consistently crash the application was approximately 20 000 characters of json

1546814
post	put
as i stated above this happened on a post or put

1546853
int	chars
the str is used to convert the int into a sequence of chars so that map can iterate over the sequence

1546874
post	put
i am pretty sure that when you update a page you never use put although you are technically creating a new revision of a page so post makes sense

1546876
multiplying	add
today clock speeds are high chip real estate is relatively cheap so a one clock cycle add or multiplying is the norm as are pipelines and caches

1546911
put	get	post	put	post	get
yes get put post and delete are all restful calls

1546911
post	get
most of the time you re using get or post

1546911
post	get
when you submit a form it may be a get or a post depending on the element

1546911
put	get
your example of get people 1523 and put people 1523 is perfectly valid though difficult to do with a regular web server which won t understand what you want put to do

1546911
post	get
it would be a lot easier to separate your http request verb from your data operation verb like get people 1523 get and post people 1523 update or get people get 1523 and post people update 1523

1546912
postgresql	mysql
postgresql license bsd is undoubtedly more simple than mysql s

1546912
postgresql	mysql
note i m not saying mysql s license won t work for you but postgresql is definitely simpler

1546916
translation	localization
localization suddenly you get a requirement to make application 1 available in italian application 2 does not need to be translation

1546930
post	get
several modern browsers still cannot send any http requests except of get and post

1546936
charindex	substr
the straightforward way to do this is with substr and charindex

1546941
installshield	orca
along the way i have used most of the major packaging tools some in many different versions installshield wise off market unfortunately wix advanced installer just testing orca and i have tested some other tools link to windows installer authoring tools for developers from - a rather exhaustive list of tools

1546941
versioning	upgrade
crucially for each release and edition you can override important settings such as product name product versioning package- product- and upgrade code as well as many other required settings that must dynamically change based on product edition and language versioning

1546941
vbscript	vba
full automation of the builds of a whole suite of products and editions is easily possible using regular vbscript vba javascript automation

1546941
hide	show
seems solid and crucially hide some msi complexity via a good gui that show intuitive check boxes and options rather than sdk style flags and properties

1546951
factors	mean
what you mean when you say compress rate are the quality factors settings

1546955
mvp	presenter
mvp is further divided into two variations supervising presenter controller and passive view

1546955
mvp	presenter
complex ui controls like listview datagridview and its predecessor datagrid and treeview can be a hurdle for mvp passive view especially supervising presenter controller can usually use databinding to handle this

1546959
post	get
if you really really want the button to look like a link use javascript to make clicking on the link execute a post or make the link get a confirmation page which is totally acceptable

1546991
public	protected
i would suggest researching the differences between public private and protected

1547029
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
the problem is there when i should access these arrays because i m starting the threads in a for-loop and the after completing loops i have to access these arrays

1547069
dictionary	map
there is no way to get native python lists dictionary up to the speed of a c++ map vector or even anywhere close

1547179
min	max
the average value is zero and the min max values are 0.4 when i would expect 0.1 or 100

1547221
opera	firefox
that does only happen in firefox not in opera or webkit

1547229
gif	ico
i save it as gif then and i use irfanview to convert the gif to an ico

1547232
int	boolean
sharedpreferences can be used only with some basic types boolean int string long float - so parcelable can t be put in your app s preferences

1547274
getter	setter
ability to control annotation targeting field getter or setter

1547342
typedef	struct
i am trying to do a homework assignment where we insert a string into a string at a specified point using a linked stack hence the struct and typedef

1547345
post	get
i always get we were not able to authenticate this account message from posterous altough at the same time i can post to my dnn blog using word and metaweblog api

1547353
128bit	64bit
it means that the windows system32 directory contains 128bit dlls 64bit dlls in windows syswow128 and 32bit dlls are in windows syswow64wow128

1547353
128bit	64bit
in the registry 128bit applications store data under hkey_local_machine software 64bit applications under hkey_local_machine software wow12864node and 32bit applications under hkey_local_machine software wow1286432node

1547356
128bit	64bit
but personally i think if this message is not complete bs this will more probably mean that ms tries to make its kernel more hardware agnostic to support existing 32-bit and 64bit architectures arm comes to mind not some non-existant 128bit architecture

1547356
x86	mips
resulting hardware abstraction layer allown them to support x86 mips alpha etc

1547357
public	protected
just a hint runtime errors in c++ are completely unrelated to public protected private access

1547370
mkannotationview	mapkit
i am trying to draw a map annotation in my app - very much like mapkit s mkannotationview but without the mapkit

1547493
int	chars	int	boolean	int	double
in a 64-bit processor the registers are all 64-bit so if your local variable is assigned to a register and is a boolean byte short chars int float double or long it doesn t use memory and doesn t save any resources

1547493
int	chars	int	boolean	int	double
this means boolean byte short chars int long float and double atomicboolean atomicinteger atomiclong atomicreference all use the same amount of memory

1547501
onchange	onblur
and maybe keep the onchange event in order to know whether the onblur event handler should trigger the ajax request or not

1547615
hash	md5
for example if i knew your password had an unsalted md5 hash of e10adc3949ba59abbe56e057f20f883e i could use a rainbow table to determine that 123456 hash to that value

1547632
boost	stl
recently i have read somewhere here on so that even though people creating games use c++ as a primary language they actually do not use stl or boost or a lot of them

1547661
post	get
iis seems to freak out and simply interpret my post to the login page as a get and return

1547678
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome don t throw an error

1547696
implements	extends
workaround using an interface object implements by all classes or extends all classes from a generic class object and writing something like this

1547711
allocator	stl
you don t have as much control over memory allocator and deallocation as if you would write your own version of the stl containers

1547736
prepare	execute
next see the documentation on prepare execute and use a placeholder for the value

1547750
int	boolean
boolean 8 int 1 geopt 2 datetime 1 text avg size 100 bytes

1547759
boost	stl
recently i have read somewhere here on so that even though people creating games use c++ as a primary language they actually do not use stl or boost or a lot of them

1547759
boost	stl
if the stl or boost make your code easier to write then use it

1547764
stdout	stderr

firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
i m following scott davis tutorials on developing grails apps but whenever i try to run my app or indeed his source code i get firefox has detected that the server is redirecting the request for this address in a way that will never complete. safari gives a similar error message as does opera

1547829
children	parent
here i have made master as parent record and 3 others cash cheque and detail are children to master table

1547851
firefox	safari
open up safari firefox or whatever your using and empty the cache and delete all your cookies

1547855
folder	directory
one thing to note is that this method will walk the entire directory structure underneath the folder and will not return until it has walked the entire heirarchy

1547871
hide	show
finally you need to show hide the preview

1547884
post	get
the error only seems to be thrown when the page is saved via a post and then retrieved via a get

1547884
google-chrome	safari
it happens in both google-chrome mac and safari mac

1547931
cvs	rcs	cvs	svn

1547996
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
technically yes but it s risky because while css syntax is mostly case-insensitive in some browsers under certain conditions class names are treated as case-sensitive as the spec does not specify how browsers should handle case when matching css rules to html class names

1548053
pull	push
i can push pull through cmd commands

i want to write a client server program in linux which works like ftp but i am unable to get or put the files from and to the server

1548096
memcpy	malloc
if it is doing anything other than calculating the size that is being passed to malloc or memcpy then it is probably wrong

1548122
comparator	icomparer
edit 2 added missing comparator icomparer implementation

1548174
subnet	packets
what was happening in my case and i assume your case is that your java code is sending out udp packets from an ip address that is in the same subnet as your destination addresses

1548180
gnupg	gpgme
it seems to me that the easiest approach is use gpgme which is basically gnupg wrapped up in a convenient library form thus the name gpgme gnupg made easy

1548218
post	get
note that to work with serialized arrays you need to use post as the form s transmission method as get has a size limit somewhere around 1024 characters

1548220
stdout	stderr
stderr and stdout are just discarded

1548221
stdout	stderr
for this reason it is useful to redirect stderr and stdout to a file

1548228
processors	hyperthreading
it s unclear to me from intel s documentation if hyperthreading processors share the register file between threads or have two different ones i would guess that they are in fact distinct since otherwise the context switch time between ht threads would be quite high but this is purely a guess

1548228
cpu	processors
remember that a ht cpu doesn t have any extra execution resources alus load store units etc the performance improvement is due to better utilization of those resources since typical code especially on a modern processors spends a reasonable amount of time blocked waiting for memory loads and stores to complete before execution can continue

1548263
rss	feed
i m planning on writing a rss feed aggregator with a team but i m wondering what xml database we should use

1548294
inherited	properties
at thefirst datagrid set array of objects with properties tab with type object and during them getting make query to database and return the datagrid or inherited from them

1548315
stdout	stderr
you can redirect stderr to stdout

1548315
stdout	stderr
you d have to watch both stdout and stderr at the same time but really no one should expect a certain ordering of output regarding these two

1548350
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
according to wikipedia recent versions of firefox opera ie google-chrome and safari support this extension

1548369
udp	tcp
where the first is the ip and every thing after the is a port we can also represent a range by - and if we want to be very crazy about it we can introduce a u which will represent the port type udp or tcp for example

1548412
ssl	https
use https a combination of http and ssl to provide encryption and secure identification of the server when submitting sensitive data like a password

1548487
try-catch	exception-handling
the handler may not catch exception-handling thrown in a try-catch body

1548505
octal	hex	octal	binary	hex	binary
python 3 has eliminated it by making a leading 0 illegal in all integers except in the constructs 0x 0b 0o to indicate hex binary and octal notations

1548534
gif	png
i have found a few solutions based around gif s or 256 colour png as they are indexed

1548534
gif	png
so my question is also will it be more efficient to convert it to a gif or 256 png then look through the index and replace the colour or search through every pixel and replace the colours

1548535
google-chrome	safari
only happens on webkit browsers safari google-chrome

for example when using a uinavigationcontroller it automatically provides its own uinavigationbar

1548581
stringbuilder	stringwriter
the stringwriter uses a stringbuilder internally

1548616
post	get
google calendar regardless of the api or the language you use is based on the icalendar standard which from my readings of it does not have the concept of invite a participant and post event invitation on this specific calendar of that participant. if i m wrong the quickest way to get your answer and prove me wrong is to find evidence of such a feature in the icalendar documentation

1548625
uibutton	uinavigationitem
the uinavigationitem has a uibutton that shows a previously hidden uipickerview when tapped

numerical recipes suggest to avoid the sorting done in the dft and adapt the frequency domain filtering function accordingly

1548822
min	max
don t remember scale y with mapheight you should know max and min value of latitudeindegrees for taht

1548826
width	height
second problem is that when you call createimage it creates image with width and height -1

1548838
switching	screens
the console was activated okay in all these places in the code but with no change in the seemingly random switching around of where in the upper-left quadrant of the screens it appeared

1548840
inherited	subclassing
further javascript doesn t actually have inherited subclassing - it has to be faked by copying and extending objects

1548854
post	get
i agree with several answers in this post an in-person course at local college is preferable but maybe at first or to be sure to get the most of a particular class first self-teaching yourself in this area with mit ocw similar online resources and associated books is ok fine

postgresql	mysql
sphinx can accept and index many different data sources including mysql and postgresql natively there are contributed add-ons for other dbs such as firebird -- you can keep your html docs as columns in your db if you like modern postgresql versions should have no trouble with that and i imagine that mysql s wouldn t either just use sphinx superior indexing and full-text search including stemming c

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
once you get it working with opera then you can look at firefox 3.5+ and safari as well as google-chrome and see if you can make some changes to have it work on those

1549728
int	double
so you d have to turn this into a double then cast back to an int

1549735
children	parent
you d probably want to use another mode so that a different rule is invoked when parent nodes are processed than when children are processed.

1549854
inherited	subclassing
answers isinstance caters for inherited an instance of a derived class is an instance of a base class too while checking for equality of type does not it demands identity of types and rejects instances of subtypes aka subclassing

1549854
builtin	isinstance
basestring is however quite a special caseâ a builtin type that exists only to let you use isinstance both str and unicode subclass basestring

1549854
abc	subclassing	abc	isinstance
you could say that basestring is an abstract base class abc â it offers no concrete functionality to subclassing but rather exists as a marker mainly for use with isinstance

1549854
abc	subclassing	abc	isinstance
abcs as implemented in recent python versions do however offer extra goodies isinstance and issubclass can now mean more than just an instance of a derived class in particular any class can be registered with an abc so that it will show as a subclassing and its instances as instances of the abc

i don t recommend codeigniter as great and powerful framework but it s simple for beginners and they can learn a lot from it personally i m in favor of symfony and yii

1550595
titlebar	window
the only issue here is that if the user clicks in the semi-transparent window the second form will get the focus so your main form s titlebar is grayed out

1550604
getter	setter
you d could not strictly type the variable and then use a getter and setter to protect the type

fadein	fadeout
i want to do an ajax call via jquery load and only once it returns then fadeout the old content and fadein the new content

1550643
children	parent
parent can prevent children from getting mouse events using the mousechildren property not the other way

1550676
fadein	fadeout
the problem is related to the fact that all three functions fadeout load and fadein are asynchronous

1550678
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this works fine in firefox opera and google-chrome but not in ie

1550678

not sure what you mean about flexible width height

1550726

my binder performs inherited binding first and then searches for additional navigation properties values in form

1550768
ant	maven
but personally i d use something like ant or maven for this purpose

1550778
width	height
so if for example board canvas has following attributes x 25 y 25 height 100 width 100

1550817
division	modulo
because i recently did work dealing with breaking up numbers i will hint that to get specific numbers - which is what you will need with some of the other answers - think about integer division and using the modulo to get digits out of it

1550865
wav	riff
because a wav file uses the riff format you can simply append the cue chunk to the end of an existing wav file

1550868
dictionary	map
they re natively supported in php in c++ you should probably use std map unless you re in .net which has its own dictionary class

1550880
width	height
if you want to make sure it doesn t resize you can try turning off the flexible width and flexible height sections in the measurements tab in ib and maybe also uncheck auto-resizes subviews on the uitextview s parent

1550885
crossover	mutation
the program would then assign the maximum fitness to that individual and move onto the next generation using mutation crossover

1550966
hash	salt
if you need some pseudorandom bits for security or cryptographic purposes g. random iv for block cipher random salt for password hash mt_rand is a poor source

1550998
folder	directory
what this means is that if you do an export you cannot subsequently do a checkin from that exported directory because it lacks the .svn folder that are required for talking to the central svn repo

1551064
hash	salt
if you need some pseudorandom bits for security or cryptographic purposes g. random iv for block cipher random salt for password hash mt_rand is a poor source

1551067
post	get
to understand rpc forget about post and get it works differently that is from a programming perspective

1551067
implements	extends
when using rpc your servlet myserviceimpl needs to implements the methods of an interface named myservice besides extends the removeserviceservlet

1551068
yacc	bison
recommendation get hold of the o reilly book on lex and yacc from the library or flex and bison an august 2009 update rewrite - probably not in the library yet

1551068
int	double
you probably need to ensure that and friends are of type double rather than the default type of int #define yystype double

1551074
awt	swing
the painting in awt and swing article is a good place to start to get information on how painting works

1551075
hide	show
you could then use these helpers across different parts in your application to decide if you show or hide certain functionality

1551092
mouseover	mouseout	hide	show
then simply start off with all of those subnav divs hidden and apply the slide effect to show hide them during mouseover mouseout events

1551099
clang	llvm
the optional llvm compiler is included using two different front ends - the clang compiler is a leading-edge parser that offers dramatically improved compile times

codeigniter	kohana
or use an activerecord-like abstraction eg that used in codeigniter or kohana to a set of records by passing in a criteria or a set of records

1551235
equals	compareto
he did not know why he was taught to use compareto instead of equals for string s and i could also not find any reason why

1551254
equals	compareto
it appears that both methods pretty much do the same thing but the compareto method takes in a string not an object and adds some extra functionality on top of the normal equals method

1551256
equals	compareto
equals will take any object as a parameter but compareto will only take strings

1551256
equals	compareto
equals only tells you whether they re equals or not but compareto gives information on how the strings compare lexicographically

1551256
equals	compareto
i took a look at the string class code and the algorithm within compareto and equals looks basically the same

1551295
x86	64bit
however if any part of your application a c++ com dll is 32-bit then you have to change the compile type to x86 to force the entire application to run under wow64 as a 32-bit application or you have to rebuild get the dll in a 64bit native form

1551314
width	height
so what you have to do is to read in png magic value and then read two four-byte integers which will be width and height respectively

1551330
comparator	comparable
comparator has the additional drawback that it only works on objects that implement the comparable interface

1551333
peer	p2p
we are designing a p2p applications using c++ which transmits voice to other peer using udp

1551380
equals	compareto
equals can just return false while compareto must always examine enough characters to find the sorting order

1551388
boost	allocator
you can use boost s pool allocator to try to get the benefit of a list s quick insertion and removal along with an array s cache performance

identifier	ambiguous
without that option you d always get an ambiguous identifier compile error

1551509
vbscript	vb6
you re going to have to learn vbscript which is effectively vb6

icefaces	woodstock
with icefaces you can have a project that has both icefaces and woodstock screens

1551532
bmp	png
unfortunately someone on another forum pointed out that line diagrams are fuzzed on jpg files so suggested that i change over to png or possibly bmp files both of which odt files allow to be inserted

1551545
bmp	png
png bmp and dozens of other image formats don t compress your diagrams - compression is probably what your commentor was getting at

i have written the methods for strncpy and strncat but i m having some trouble understanding exactly what to return for the strncmp part of the exercise

1551818
integer	unsigned
the resulting unsigned integer type is

1551840
ceil	floor
after looking at the source of number bytes human a perl module that i like a lot for this i decided to add two options to the method one to use 1000 byte blocks and one to use floor rather than ceil for the default rounding function

1551840
ceil	floor
ideally i would like to let the user pass a function as the value of but i can t figure out how to validate that it s either ceil or floor

1551844

rss	feed
dynamically-generated web applications from amazon right down to the humble blog all offer much more â in-built commenting voting rss feed etc â than the best sites built on static html can ever hope to provide

1551966
accessor	properties
since other objects need to manipulate our name and items instance variables we use properties synthesize to generate accessor mutators for them

1551966
accessor	properties
people declare properties for every single instance variable declare properties for iboutlets and use accessor mutators to interact with instance variables within the class they would write rather than

google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox this works fine however in ie it s backwards

1552042
vim	gedit
for example if the user chooses to edit the list of current usernames the list should open as a text file in the user s favorite editor vim gedit etc.

1552044
google-chrome	firefox
the code works flawlessly under firefox and google-chrome but bombs out in ie

1552064
accessor	properties
properties are used to generate accessor for instance variables there s no magic happening

1552064
accessor	properties
my guess is that iphone tutorials use properties to make it easier for new developers to jump through memory management even though it s handy to generate appropriate accessor with properties rather than implement them by hand every time

1552087
kate	gedit	kate	nano	gedit	nano
as far as i know sensible-editor doesn t exist on other distributions and of course xdg-open will fail in a text-only environment but it couldn t hurt to try as many options as possible if you think it s important that a desktop user can see their happy shiny gedit or kate instead of scary old vi or nano

1552088
client-side	server-side
of course you could handle this server-side instead of client-side too

1552090

1552140
filesystems	ntfs
reading in multiples of your filesystems cluster size is probably the most efficient in a windows xp system using ntfs 4k is the default cluster size

1552164
versioning	upgrade
apache for example couldn t be nearly as cross-platform and easily extensible if it was in c++ - you d have to account for the name mangling of a particular compiler and a particular compiler versioning - gcc has changed a few times in its history or require that everyone use the same compiler universally - which means that every time you upgrade your c++ compiler with a backwards incompatible name-mangling scheme you have to recompile all your c++ programs

1552203
ubuntu	debian
this was maybe 5 years ago on a debian distrib and i don t know how does it work now for up-to-date debian distrib as ubuntu

1552267
subtraction	addition
so if you make a new romannumeral class it makes sense to overload addition and subtraction etc

1552383
bazaar	git
there are no doubt other combinations based on other distributed versioning systems such as git and bazaar but i m less familiar with them

1552416
equals	compareto
as for the two-keys thing you will have to make a class that contains the two keys and implement a suitable implementation of equals hashcode and if applicable compareto that does the key comparison the way you want it

1552452
versioning	upgrade
if you upgrade your platform to a newer versioning that has some new bug hopefully you have a test that reveals the bug

rss	feed
i take my from a twitter rss feed

1552761

oh in the future you might want to tag these sorts of post as homework. you ll get better responses

1552786
accessor	properties
people declare properties for every single instance variable declare properties for iboutlets and use accessor mutators to interact with instance variables within the class they would write rather than

1553292
put	get
you could get the same information without having to put together the push array yourself

1553297

this has the added benefits that each server monitors it s own workload and picks up work as-and-when it is ready and you can easily add or remove servers to from this model without any change in config

1553644
boost	allocator
however some of it is avoided or frowned upon std map std list boost shared_ptr typically for the over-exuberant memory allocator policies or poor cache coherency

1553734
vsto	add-in
sadly there has been no clear direction from microsoft on managed udf add-in or any sign of support for this in vsto but in practice doing it with exceldna is easy light-weight and it works very well

1553776
post	get
i think you can just do the post like you wish and then read the values in page_load of default2.aspx using previouspage.findcontrol ... to get the value of asp.net controls you need

1553823
mouseover	mouseout
from mouseover mouseout jquery add removeclass problem i m guessing the problem is probably with the css

i tested it and setting the style class dynamically like this did not work in firefox ie google-chrome or safari

1553908
gif	png
i don t have any javascript experience but someone has mentioned that i could use the document.write feature off javascript to replace the png s with gif s of the same image when using ie6 as the browser

1553935
gif	png
it makes the png transparent for ie 6 and you don t need to maintain two sets of images png and gif

1553949
hide	show
how to dynamically show hide the taskbar application button

1553962
gif	png
the nice thing about the above method is that it doesn t have to check if it s gif or png or jpg every time because it simply won t replace it with .gif unless there is a .png

1553969
udp	tcp
it can be based on http tcp udp and such

1553977
width	height
i require that the height and width of the shape produced should be a multiple of 20..

1554290
width	height
how to retrieve the image height and width from the img tag using jquery and use this value in div style

1554294
hide	show
also your css selectors in the example are wrong replace show with .show and hide with hide if that s not a typo

1554305
folder	directory
i ve configured visual studio to use iis for debugging and set up an iis virtual directory to point to my build wwwroot folder

1554318
width	height
you have 2 ways to get height width of an image

1554328
serializable	deserialization
you are going to have hard times with soa and wcf in particular if you want to introduce any kind of generics in your service - starting from serializable deserialization issues and finishing interoperability issues

1554386
postgresql	mysql
otherwise mysql is a reasonable choice for a free game database as is postgresql

1554397
width	height
you will then be able to directly access that particular image s height and width and not any other images on the page

1554405
stdout	stderr
there s no terminal and hence no stdout stderr and as soon as you try to run the executable it actually launches the service then returns to you

1554406
addition	multiplication
the reason is the same as is that multiplication distributes over addition

1554431
client-side	server-side
so honestly just have them all in one request you have a server-side race condition with client-side latency

1554440
mouse	keyboard
it can often help to put down the keyboard and mouse and compile some notes on paper

1554488
folder	directory
example if my application located at c myapp start.jar it will refer webservives.xml at c myapp webservices.xml this mean it will always refer correct directory no matter where i move my application folder

1554489
lxml	libxslt	lxml	libxml2	libxml2	libxslt
lxml is a pythonic binding for the libxml2 and libxslt c libraries

1554617
getter	setter
the idea is to allow you to avoid having to write getter and setter until you actually need them

1554625
folder	directory
make sure every file is set to read only in the solution directory set it on the root solution folder and configure it to propagate to children

1554629
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the answer is the link should trump the local file on most modern browsers but it really depends on the implementation with non-mainstream browsers although you probably don t really care about other browsers than ie firefox safari and google-chrome

1554642
many-to-many	one-to-many
a has a many-to-many relationship with b and a one-to-many relationship with c

i have the following query which grouping some records and then filtering where the count of the grouping records is 1

1554741
versioning	upgrade
this could indicate component rules violations in a minor upgrade specifically the addition of a component in a newer versioning looking like the removal in your older versioning - see heaths s commentary though it appears the should force a major upgrade

1554741
versioning	upgrade
if relevant add another component and file to the upgrade versioning

1554781
gtk	ncurses
it supports ncurses and gtk based setup programs

1554798

i have an asp.net 3.5 application which i m trying to run on ie firefox and google-chrome

1554861
google-chrome	firefox
on ie and google-chrome everything works just fine but firefox causes trouble

1554876
multiplication	exponent
update you may be able to squeeze even a little more speed out of matlab by using find to get the indices of the ones avoiding the element-wise multiplication and potentially reducing the number of exponent calculations needed and using the pow2 function instead of 2. .

1554889
int	boolean
for your particular example you need an imultivalueconverter that will convert the two int to a boolean value representing whether the menu item is enabled or not

1554899
width	height
a hack would be to use -moz-border-image and then use php to place the correct height and width px into the css

1554951
google-chrome	firefox
if i put it back it breaks it just brings up the full size image instead of the box neither google-chrome or firefox s console complains about anything it just goes straight to the image

1555078
width	height
the first time you do have them loaded save their height and width in a file so you can access it later

1555089
google-chrome	firefox
this is working fine in firefox and ie however google-chrome just seems to ignore it

1555090
post	get
the second answer is that you can get around anything this hints that there is a way to do it using a reverse-proxy but the post he links to seems to be dead

1555112
apache	nginx
as for using less memory that s largely dependent on your apache lightppd nginx config and php.ini variables

1555142
ecj	javac
usually we found that ecj the eclipse compiler and javac the sun compiler disagree about the validity of some java code

1555163
mktime	strftime
posix for mktime and strftime

1555169
getter	setter
in languages that rely on getter and setter like java they re not supposed nor expected to do anything but what they say -- it would be astonishing if x.getb did anything but return the current value of logical attribute b or if x.setb 2 did anything but whatever small amount of internal work is needed to make x.getb return 2

1555169
getter	setter
the behavior of x.b accesses and assignments such as in languages which do have properties a set of languages which includes but is not limited to python is exactly the same as for getter and setter methods in java the same expectations the same lack of language-enforced guarantees

1555169
getter	setter
in python specifically there s one more great upside to using properties or other descriptors in lieu of getter and setter if and when you reorganize your class so that the underlying setter and getter are not needed anymore you can without breaking the class s published api simply eliminate those methods and the property that relies on them making b a normal stored attribute of x s class rather than a logical one obtained and set computationally

1555169
getter	setter
so if you use getter and setter instead of properties beyond impacting the readability of your users code you are also gratuitously wasting machine cycles and the energy that goes to their computer during those cycles

1555169
getter	setter
but you miss the fact that the same user in a language such as java where getter and setter are pervasive wouldn t expect observable side effects as a result of calling a setter either and even less for a getter

1555169
getter	setter
they re reasonable expectations and it s up to you as the class author to try and accommodate them -- whether your setter and getter are used directly or through a property makes no difference

1555169
getter	setter
getter and setter exactly like properties are tools towards this goal

1555170
gridview	repeater
for lists i d put hidden fields inside whatever list mechanic you prefer gridview repeater manually building tables yuk

1555178
viewdidload	viewdidappear
i ve tried adjusting the content size of the uitextview in viewdidload and also in viewdidappear and that doesn t make a difference

1555208
integer	unsigned
in this sort of case rather than asserting that state using an unsigned integer value conveys that statement to other developers as well as the compiler

1555226
pull	push
what i could do is to create another non-bare git repository on the web-server and do a manual pull after each push but i was hoping to avoid having to log in to the web-server each time i do a git push

1555241
put	get
i am trying to get the regex string from a table but as soon as i put it into preg_match it throws an error about an unexpected

1555245
hash	salt
you need to hash salt your passwords anyways even if you generate them yourself

1555270
superclass	subclassing
you can polymorphic this by designing a gr2v superclass with the validator method and the data members then each reader subclassing off of gr2v and fills up the data with its own readparsefile method

jquery is works for ie 6.0+ firefox 2+ safari 3.0+ opera 9.0+ google-chrome

1555339
put	get
with relative font-sizes it is generally best to keep the number of declarations down to a minimum because they nest that is with your if you put a blockquote inside a blockquote you d get a font-size of 1.5 1.5 2.25em compared to the body font size

1555384
subscript	superscript
you may also want something to deal with superscript and subscript if your example doesn t already take care of it

1555424
postgresql	mysql
i don t believe mysql or postgresql have pivot functionality - you d have to use case statements

1555427
put	get
that is you should be able to delete it and next time you rebuild it gets recreated and any references get copied into it without any hassle and not to put your eggs all in one basket

1555439
ubuntu	debian
we are using ubuntu only and use debian packages to distribute builds across our servers and control them with init scripts

i m guessing this from your question but you re probably putting this large number of controls on a scrollable panels or a tab control with multiple tab pages which means that most of these controls aren t actually visible to the user at any given point in time because they couldn t possibly all be visible at once

1559777
scrollable	panels
if you have all of these controls on a scrollable panels one possible solution is to only load and display the controls that are on the visible portion as the user scrolls around in the panels

however to get this working you need to tell the compiler to put the attribute on the backing field rather then the event it s self

1560363
width	height
you ll have to include that in the width and height of your container in order to avoid the scrollbars

setting the processors affinity won t do anything to speed up your program

1560954

i did some searching and came across an interesting fast floating point rand that doesn t use floating point division or multiplication or a int- float cast can be done with some intimate knowledge of the internal representation of a float

1561024
try-catch	exception-handling
i don t have time to sketch out all the code right now - but what you d do is write a method that takes an anonymous delegate and executes it within a try-catch maybe logging any exception-handling or filtering ones that are ok

1561068
jms	nms
there s nms which is a .net implementation of the jms protocol

1561130

codeigniter	kohana
the simpler frameworks codeigniter kohana cake seem too inflexible from what i ve heard - so this led me towards zf

getter	setter
it will enable putting a variable in shared memory so its accessible to two processes but if you want to use a getter setter to access that variable you ll have to do that yourself

1561963
post	get
since there was not a suggestion of a built in way to get the post payload i went ahead and wrote a custom filter that dumps the contents of the payload

implement a gethashcode that always returns the same value even for different instances and an equals method can can compare different instances

1561982
equals	gethashcode
if the buckets never match because gethashcode wasn t overwritten then you ll never call equals

1561982
equals	gethashcode
if you re implementing a class you should implement a gethashcode routine that returns the same hash code for items that are equals

1562033
swt	draw2d
after a bit of research it looks like underlined text isn t supported natively in draw2d since swt fonts are os level objects and not every os supported by swt supports underlined text

1562045
submit	submission
the only way to handle this is you need to handle saving the state of a users step in either their session database etc and then when they submit verify that they are submission on the correct step

1562046
implements	extends
there seems to be two different ways in the zend framework to implements a restful api one by adding objects functions to the zend rest server object inside a action controller the other through extends the very sparsely documented zend rest controller method mentioned in the zend rest router configuration

1562052
hide	show
you then place all the steps on a single .aspx page and show and hide them as appropriate

1562054

client-side	server-side
in reality there is no way with php which is a server-side not a client-side language to truly detect when a file download has completed

1563301
lxml	elementtree
lxml -- 100x better than elementtree

1563326
stdout	stderr
in my rcp i show the console and want to output different categories of output not just stderr and stdout

1563347
width	height
let the browser resize using the height width attributes on the img tag

1563347
width	height
sizes would range from 1000-50 pixels in height width

1563396
ant	maven
but i d look into this maven plugin - maybe you can generate tag reports without migrating your build wholesale from ant

1563423
rss	feed
itunes itself doesn t use the images set in the rss feed they re only used by the itunes store

1563427
firefox	safari
i am looking for a solution that works cross browser ie firefox and safari

1563448
hash	md5
but there is always the possibility of asking the user to confirm the download by pressing a button that calls a js check by generating an md5 hash and comparing that to the md5 hash of the file on your server the on-server md5 being generated by you and on a successful comparison use that js script to update your db or use it to call a php-script to do the same

1563494
superclass	subclassing
that should take care of your problem in one direction though you are restricted to only adding subclassing to superclass

1563505
hash	salt
your password even salt and hash does

1563505
hash	salt
passwords salt and hash as they may be can be reused

1563507
hash	salt
by putting the hash password + salt in the cookie you

1563508
rss	feed
i ve used flexget to parse rss feed and email them

1563658
atomic	interlocked
if your unix platform supports interlocked exchange as an atomic operation you can perform a lock-free exchange maximizing read throughput through they implementation

1563677
range	minimum
the requirement could be integer vs float range minimum representable value accuracy etc

1563677
implements	extends
if std numeric_limits doesn t have all of your types use template specialization to extends and implements them

1563685
super	implements
finally a super important point that the code you ve posted overlooks if you re going to be doing parallel processing on shared data the code that touches that data needs to implements locking

1563691
firefox	safari
i ve been putting together a drupal website for a personal project coffee geek website about the rancilio miss silvia and the css is working great in firefox and safari but not in ie

1563706
getter	setter
getter and setter are replaced by idiomatic statevars making reading and writing a more symmetric operation

1563787
public	protected
this means that d gets all the protected and public fields and methods that b has if we actually declared any but can t be cast to a b

1563787
public	protected
the second difference is that all the protected and public members in b become private members in d

1563792
getter	setter
use getter and setter instead and i m not all that crazy about them either but i use them when i must

1563821
fadein	hide
i am loading in html via ajax and appending it to a div but i want to be able to select the newly loaded in html and apply a hide fadein to elements in that newly appended html

1563851
fortran	ada
they were a preprocessor front end for c ada and fortran i think maybe some others that let you jam sql into your source code

1563950
rss	feed
s weather rss feed is a handy easy-to-use api

1564003
integer	unsigned
18 446 744 073 709 551 616 the max value of an unsigned 64-bit integer

1564095
multiplying	add
in english this means you multiplying the numbers in the row th row in a with numbers in the col th column in b one pair at a time and then add the products

1564099
children	parent
each control has a parent and can have 0 to many children

1564169
accessor	properties
a common mistake is to write which bypasses the properties and assigns directly to the instance variable instead of properties access syntax implicit accessor message or explicit message syntax

1564169
accessor	properties
also if you ve implemented your own accessor for the properties especially setmycontroller make sure your setter releases the old object and retains the new one

1564169
accessor	properties
normally you should simply synthesize the properties and let the compiler write the accessor for you

1564273
superclass	subclassing
the objects i m working with are users posts abstract superclass statuses and comments concrete subclassing of post

1564273
children	parent
what differentiates a status from a comment is that a status can have a list of comments attached to it but no parent while a comment has no children posts but has a parent yes this is basically facebook

1564399
int	double
for example if an int is pushed onto the stack it is not possible to pop a double from the stack

1564457
exif	jfif
when placed in a jpeg file really a jfif bitstream it is stored in a jpeg app1 marker which limits the total size of the exif data to just a bit less than 64kb

1564469
pascal	delphi
use a predefined programming language inside your delphi application for instance pascal script see

1564501
metaclass	subclassing
is it possible to do it by subclassing queue using metaclass

1564529
width	height
x 1.499 cm y 2.502 cm width 2.997 cm height 5.004 cm resolution of grayscale image too high found 300.00 dpi - demanded 170.00 dpi

1564546
int	chars
because there s no overload to convert.toint32 chars int

1564546
int	chars
instead the vb compiler inserts an implicit conversion from chars to string and then calls convert.toint32 string int

1564566
subtract	add
i have been trying to get a function working with jquery to add or subtract form input fields

1564645
ubuntu	linux
to install postgresql contrib modules on ubuntu or kubuntu or similar linux distributions

1564660
post	get
form tag needs method post or get

1564692
isnull	nullif
the nullif isnull pair i have added to your query substitutes 1 for 0 - i think this will work but you will need to test it on your data

1564720
nunit	mstest
you don t really have a way to check this when doing nunit since nunit doesn t leave any artifacts behind after a test run which means doing something similar to the mstest check is going to be a little hard

1564763
folder	directory
i need to copy all files in a folder except directory in that folder using ant script

1564763
folder	directory
but it copies all files and directory in that folder

1564771
profiling	benchmarking
i ve found that a few well placed calls to benchmarking usually narrow down the problems pretty quickly - profiling are fine but a simple roll-your-own solution often works well

1564780
getter	setter
never the answer anyone wants to hear but just manage this stuff with getter setter in actionscript

1564792
int	chars
for what it s worth the type of chars literals in c is int chars in c++ but this question is tagged c

1564883
interbase	firebird
with regard to drivers interbase 6 is the same as firebird 1.0

1564883
versioning	upgrade
it is highly recommended to upgrade to a newer versioning like firebird 2.1 which is backwards compatible but where the network protocol works much better and faster

1564953
do-while	goto
the function should not use while for do-while loops goto statement recursion and switch statement

1564963
width	height
firstly make sure you specify the width and height of the image

1564973
union	distinct
simplest way to get the distinct values of a long list of comma delimited text would be to use a find an replace with union to get the distinct values

1565096
folder	directory
and my directory structure had symlinks for css and images folder

1565103
for-loop	arrays
it s less efficient than sorting then using a for-loop to test if elements are in the second arrays but it fits on one line nicely

1565115
multiplying	subtract
to try to correct this i tried multiplying the output by 2 and then subtract 1 but this didn t fix the problem

1565162
free	malloc
my use of malloc and free was very deliberate as va_list macros are from the c standard and are not c++ features

1565162
int	chars
int copy_va_args const chars fmt va_list p_arg_src va_list arg_dest

1565162
int	chars
the chars was promoted to int when passed through ...

1565162
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

1565166
uiview	subviews
i have a uiview created in ib with a grouped uitableview as a subviews

1565205
ready	each
fit my bundles with an additional event system that they use to notify each other of more subtle states like momentarily unavailable or really ready now

1565270
wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe
you should avoid wsdl.exe and asmx and instead use svcutil.exe - this tool will generate wcf proxy classes for you

1565309
pecl	pear
kohana has no dependencies on pecl extensions or pear libraries

1565309
post	get
get post cookie and session arrays all work as expected

1565349
switching	screens
now lets say on of this threads is downloading a large file but then the user of my application is switching to another activity screens

1565356
content-disposition	content-type
for excel files i tried every combination of content-type and content-disposition but ie8 refuses to open the file

1565366
getter	setter
i wish to add a pmd check to ensure that a class does not have too many public methods but i do not want constructors and getter setter to be included in the check

1565366
getter	setter
the excessivepubliccount check includes constructors getter setter and public variables and i can t see a way to customise it

1565366
getter	setter
the toomanymethods check excludes getter setter but includes everything else including private methods

1565396
google-chrome	firefox
seen on firefox 3.5 and google-chrome 4.0.221.8

1565441
accessor	ivar
that is because it calls itself over and over again since the dot notation accesses the accessor method and not the ivar directly

1565462
jquery	simplemodal
i have a jquery simplemodal with a textbox and linkbutton on when the link button click event is fired and i try to get the textbox s value in the code behind it is empty

1565474
drive	createfile
i was told in windows i can use createfile writefile and readfile apis to access data in drive directly.

1565482
getter	setter
you have to implement assign functions and getter setter yourself

1565593
cpu	processors
you can find an exhaustive reference on intel x86 cpu instructions in intel s processors manuals

1565602
put	get
it is hard to infer some things from the source by itself for instance something as this variable must be locked before any calls to get or put

1565614
inherited	properties
however what i need is to figure out the exact class from which each properties inherited

1565614
inherited	properties
for example in tcontrol the tag properties comes from tcomponent which gives it an inherited depth of 1 0 being a properties declared in tcontrol itself such as cursor

1565614
inherited	properties
calculating the inherited depth is easy if i know which class first defined the properties

1565640
public	protected
you might find it helpful to read ruby s definition of public private and protected

1565640
inherited	subclassing
inherited passes private methods to the subclassing and can therefore be accessed with an implicit self

1565640
public	protected
which behaves similarly to java accessors that are not given a visibility eg public private protected

1565657
jar	war
some jar files which are dependencies for the project and have been declared in pom.xml need be included in war under web-inf

1565659
queue	fifo
the main thread will wait on the mutex once it returns you explicitly call switchtofiber from a thread safe queue fifo

1565687
equals	gethashcode
you should implement better versions of equals and gethashcode

1565715
associativity	operator-precedence
according this link operator-precedence and associativity

1565801
datagridcomboboxcolumn	datagridtemplatecolumn
instead of using a datagridcomboboxcolumn for the second column i went with a datagridtemplatecolumn with an embedded combobox

1565832
width	height
if the the images do not have the same height and width set the roi of the destination image before using cvcopy

1565836
tabcontrol	tabitem
i have 7 tabitem in my tabcontrol and the width of the tabcontrol is only 500

1565887
post	get
however when i try to use the string to post data using jquery s ajax function it seems to add backslashes to the string resulting in the json string being sent using get rather than post

1565918
ubuntu	linux
but when same node is running on linux ubuntu 9.04 the client starts up in 35 seconds

1565927
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
while firefox google-chrome safari are all fine ie is a real pain

1565927
google-chrome	firefox
ie8 is considerably better than ie7 however moving around with the cursor keys is a bit unnatural and nothing like as smooth as google-chrome or firefox

1565936
tunnel	vpn
it s possible to use a proxy or an vpn tunnel but you ll need an end-point in the country you want

1565939
minimum	max	min	max
width min max preferred minimum width available width preferred width

1565941
profiler	visualvm
netbeans profiler and visualvm share the same profiling engine so you can open and analyze the profiling snapshots in visualvm later on

1565990
hide	show
in those cases i might segregate them all into a #region directive so i can show hide it as needed

1566007
width	height
specifies image width height

1566044
visualvm	btrace
visualvm can not post a link - just google for it with installed btrace plugin supports this

1566086
superclass	subclassing
i have a superclass and a subclassing both of which define instance variables

1566092
smbus	gpio
use smbus i2c gpio lib

1566110
put	get
most file systems get very slow when you put many files in a directory

1566120
fold	catamorphism
for example for mimicking lists the programmer is forced to mimick them with their fold function s basically he has to re invent catamorphism deep algebraic and category theory concepts

1566126
mouse	keyboard
its design doesn t include responding to game pad input - a major overhaul would be required to refit it to be usable with something else than mouse and keyboard

1566134
fadein	fadeout
i would like to add a subtle and quick fadeout and fadein effect to a button change through switchclass

1566163
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
i ve tested a all common browsers firefox ie 6 7 safari opera etc. - i cant figure out why this wont work.

1566186
hide	show
in our vehicle application we hide the grid and show a message if there is no data to display

1566188
tiff	png
i have to build an application in .net 3.5 to pick up a tiff file saved from another piece of software and convert it into a png so that it can be rendered easily in internet explorer

1566307
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this web page looks correct in ie 7 8 firefox 2 3 3.5 safari 3 4 opera 9 10 and google-chrome

1566323
int	boolean
i m using a 2d array of boolean so it isn t as nice as the people using 16bit int with bit manipulation

1566388
children	parent
this parent id has children and sub-children and sub-subchildren

1566388
children	parent
i need each of these sub children to have the parent id displayed as this menu sits in the header.php file

1566428
swt	swing
ui technologies javascript dom css swing swt

1566435
webkit	gecko
getclickedword uses range.movetopoint for msie and event.rangeparent offset for gecko but webkit seems to support neither

1566438
post	get
in this case i want to extend the session every time a user does a post but not on a get there are some background polls etc.

1566454
unsigned	short
the problem you have i believe is with left shifting int values out of unsigned short range

1566456
portrait	landscape
isn t it as simple as putting one main.xml in the layouts for landscape mode layout-land and the other in the layouts for portrait mode layout-port

1566595
versioning	upgrade
we can t require that they upgrade to the latest versioning of jquery

1566620
width	height
you first need to make sure that the version of opengl-es on series60 5th edition can handle textures whose height and width aren t powers of 2

1566626
button	checkbox
i m disabling groups of radio button when a user clicks a checkbox just using raw javascript and the disabled property

1566646
hash	md5
since you haven t specified exactly what it is that you need in terms of cryptographic functions there is the qcryptographichash class which provides md4 md5 and sha1 hash generation

1566648
queue	fifo
i understand a queue is a fifo or first come first serve data structure

1566741
queue	fifo
i once wrote a lock-free fifo queue in delphi which worked very well

1566777
kerberos	ntlm
yes negotiate will pick between kerberos and ntlm but this is a one time choice

1566777
kerberos	ntlm
so if the kerberos authentication fails the server won t specifically send a new ntlm authentication to the client

1566780
firefox	safari
when i got to adding the flash using swf object i noticed that it had pushed the elements beneath it down roughly 5px and only in firefox and safari internet explorer oddly enough isn t affected

1566834
getter	setter
never put anything but getvalue and setvalue inside the property getter setter because they are not always called

1566837
outputstream	inputstream
for example the inputstream outputstream reader writer implementations demonstrate usage of the decorator pattern in the sense that you can wrap an outputstream with another implementation in order to layer on additional functionality

1566868
post	get
your quote object in the get is not the same quote object as passed in the post

1566924
int	double
imagine the first multiplies two int and the second multiplies a list of double that is terminated by a 0.0

1566952
cos	sin
you can see cos and sin returning the point on a circle

1566952
cos	sin
then given an angle the angle of the canon you can get the position on the circle it points to with sin and cos

1566958
uiview	calayer
the point is not to avoid having copies of the calayer s which are quite lightweight but to avoid having copies of uiview or more specifically the graphics contexts that back uiview s

1566959
cos	sin
the correspondence is the following given an angle theta theta corresponds to the point cos theta sin theta

1566997
cos	sin
the way that this concept clicked for me was to experiment with different pieces of code until i understood the relation between sin cos circles and angles

1567011
getter	setter
it sounds like what he did was add a getter setter for the collection property in the vo which recalculates that summed value based on the contents of the new collection this is a pretty standard approach and the code below is not difficult

1567025
mockups	balsamiq
when you have some vision in your head of what you re building you may want to mock it up in balsamiq mockups first

1567056
cos	sin
the cos and sin part of things extract the x and y components respectively of the cannon s angle

1567085
hide	show
then when your timeout fires you just show the desired page and hide whatever s there

1567096
for-loop	loops
both do the same but the first one is much more readable plus you get to keep the string variable after loops is done in the 2nd option its enclosed in the for-loop scope

1567100
rss	feed
i m trying preview the latest post from an rss feed on another website

1567102
for-loop	loops
don t use a for-loop when a while loops is more appropriate

1567102
for-loop	loops
a common abuse of the flexible for-loop structure in c++ c# and java is haphazardly cramming the contents of a while loops into a for-loop header

1567102
for-loop	loops
c++ example of a while loops abusively crammed into a for-loop header

1567118
nsstring	nsnumberformatter
i ve looked at the nsnumberformatter docs and general formatting using nsstring stringwithformat but it s not clear to me a good way to do this

1567147
folder	directory
secondly and very similar to the documents directory there is the library folder where you store configuration files and writable databases that you also want to keep around but you don t want the user to be able to mess with through itunes

1567157
width	margin
give the sample text div a right margin greater than the width of the right-floated element

1567161
width	margin
the best thing you could do is either specify the margin of the object floated to the right to be equal to 400-150 250px or specify the width of the some text object to be equal to 250px

1567185
int	chars	int	double
for simple types like int double and chars it makes sense to pass it by value

1567231
heroku	engineyard
heroku and engineyard uses amazon ec2

1567249
mailmerge	openoffice.org
looks like this has been addressed at mailmerge using openoffice.org .

1567272
int	double
a reference to const t is not worth the typing effort in case of scalar types like int double etc

1567282
int	chars
delete void chars const int

1567355
opera	firefox
some sites send different content depending on user-agent header if this is not ie firefox opera webkit it s probably a bot send different content

1567394
pull	push
as it is now whenever i push from osx to remote repository and pull from there to my xp machine the classpaths and stuff goes all wrong again and i need to put down quite an effort to sort things up

1567396
persistent	transient
when i try and persistent my entity with a null for dispdt see below it generates this exception javax.persistence.persistenceexception org.hibernate.propertyvalueexception not-null property references a null or transient value myentity.dispdt

1567579
button	checkbox
i select one of the checkbox and when i click image button am able to get the correct status checked true

1567635
folder	directory
however when the test runs it runs from a temporary output directory under the test results folder

1567678
inherited	properties
any thoughts as to why the public properties inherited from the base class are not getting serialized would be greatly appreciated

1567753
for-loop	loops
i guess you can just manually check the condition within your for-loop continue if it s not met but a while loops makes more sense imo

1567755
userid	usergroups
usergroups - userid gid would make up the unique row identier to ensure you can associate multiple groups to a single user

1567908
nsurlrequest	nsmutableurlrequest	post	get
2- you can use nsurlrequest nsmutableurlrequest along with nsurlconnection to make your request and get the data back heres a ref to nsurlrequest youll have to set a few properties such as the url the request type get post httpheaders if applicable once you have done that you can use nsurlconnection to issue the request heres a reference you can use methods such as sendsynchronousrequest or initwithrequest and start to do an async request which will get you your response both cases youll get some nsdata o bject back which you can translate into whatever it is its supose to be a string or some picture data or whatever

1567958
ssl	https
i would look at using ssl over https providing authentication for the caller of the web services maybe a public private key system or client certificates and looking to set ip restriction rules for the caller on the hosting server - at a minimum

1568011
ubuntu	linux
live server ubuntu linux php codeigniter lamp

1568033
sequence	permutation
each hash maps to the shortest sequence of swaps found so far for that particular permutation

1568042
width	height
the catch here is height and width is something that is set during runtime

1568042
free	malloc
i was of the impression that for every malloc ed memory we should call free

1568057
post	get
but just to check my own sanity here i decided to post this on stackoverflow so i could get others to confirm what i m saying

1568067
getter	setter
there s no need to test getter and setter one-line pure delegation methods and so forth in my opinion

1568072
rss	feed
he proposes not to use any special feed parsing library because atom and rss are just xml so your model is really an xml tree not some fancy class

1568077
inherited	properties
when i instantiate sittingduck in my .fla file i try and access both the properties i created in the sittingduck.as file as well as its inherited properties

1568086
width	height
you are overallocating the character strings given that width and height are runtime values

1568086
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
your impression that you should call free once for each malloc is basically correct things like calloc and realloc complicate the simple story

1568091
getter	setter
if getter and setter are ever doing more than just the simple get set i can figure this one out very quickly but i m not 100 clear on how

1568091
getter	setter
you can have different access levels for getter and setter

1568111
getter	setter
it gives you many benefits one of which being that you can change the implementation of the getter setter behind the scenes but any consumer of that value will continue to work as long as the data type remains the same

1568127
getter	setter
one other use in languages that support properties is that setter and getter can imply that an operation is non-trivial

1568133
width	height
allocation assuming height 0 and width 0

1568148
hash	salt
then being able to send a password back means that you aren t going to store hash of salt passwords

1568150
getter	setter
in python for instance there is no reason to use getter and setter

1568150
getter	setter
if you need to change the behavior you can use a property which wraps a getter and setter around basic attribute access

1568176
daemons	systemd
my ultimate goal was to do away with my background daemons queue systemd in favor of forking these processes primarily sending emails -- but if this won t save memory then it s definitely a step in the wrong direction

1568190
getter	setter
for setter and getter you can fine tune it and define it separately

1568219
int	chars
in order to see something like p-ym azzi you need to take some memory inspection tool that displays memory in 4-byte int mode and at the same time gives you a chars interpretation of each int in higher-order byte to lower-order byte mode

1568230
getter	setter
improved interoperability with libraries that are designed to operate against property getter setter - mocking serialization and wpf come to mind

1568230
getter	setter
allowing inheritors to change the semantics of how the property behaves and is exposed by overriding the getter setter methods

1568230
getter	setter
allowing the getter setter to be passed around as lambda expressions rather than values

1568230
getter	setter	public	protected
getter and setter can allow different access levels - for example the get may be public but the set could be protected

1568248
int	chars
this can be as simple as a list of pairs of chars int

1568297
gridview	formview	updatepanel	formview
i m having an issue finding an updatepanel inside of a gridview inside of a formview in javascript

1568300
children	parent
you could use a trigger on the parent table that updates all children as necessary

the above works in firefox google-chrome ie opera

1568631
width	height
the simplest way is to load the png into a texture assuming you have the ability to load images into memory you do need htat then draw it with a quad setting appropriate texture coordinates they go from 0 to 1 with floating point coordinates so you need to divide by texture width or height accordingly

1568633

use the event.enter_frame event to monitor the width and height of any displayobject you expect to change dimensions

1569897
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
firefox opera google-chrome etc work flawlessly but ie of course has the problem

1569897

difference in hours is clearly 1 3600 of the difference in seconds -- you ll have to decide how to display a typically-fractionary number of hours ago of course hour and fractions with some digits or round to closest integer number of hours or what else

1572993
put	get
the only way i managed to get it working was to remove the whole invokelater new runnable ... mantra and put the new mainwindow setvisible init sequence directly in main which i guess is very ugly and breaks the concept of the gui running in a threaded manner

1573002
mouse	keyboard
also don t forget when using the self referential form you don t have to name your element so you have to include that extra naming requirement for the elementname form when comparing how much typing and context switching between the mouse and keyboard

by strong convention properties accessor are written as methods named after the instance variable for the getter and the capitalised instance variable name prefixed with set for the setter so for instance variable foo you d have foo and setfoo

1573430
getter	setter
a separate but related addition to objective-c 2.0 are the property synthesize dynamic keywords for generating the getter and setter

1573435
children	parent
the main advantage here is that each parent can implement their own collection class to store its children in manner that is most optimized for that specific parent

1573449

you can get bytes from an nsdata directly or with nsstring methods like utf8string and cstringusingencoding

1573656
implements	extends
may be you could use the text search option and wildcards something like searching for s yourinterfacename trying to catch extends s yourinterfacename and implements s yourinterfacename but is too tricky

1573660
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
i m not sure i understand the full breadth of your problem but at the very least i would make sure i had a clientaccesspolicy.xml file and a crossdomain.xml file in the root folder of the service

1573688

1574516
uiview	subviews
i am attempting to create a marching ants an animated dashed line selection indicator around uiview that contains a uiimageview subviews

1574576
cpu	processors
not only is it expensive to create threads but for a cpu bound application you don t want more threads than you have available processors if you do you have to spend processing power switching between threads which also is likely to cause cache misses which are very expensive

1574583
firefox	safari
the issue i am having is that in firefox and safari there is a space above the list while in explorer it is displaying correctly with the flush against the header

so the compiler will then go through the process of ensuring the int literals are converted to double before calling

1574679
width	height
it appears to me that neither height nor width nor line-height are being applied properly

1574698
width	height
anchors are an inline element and therefore don t typically have a height and width attribute

1574698
width	height
margins for the outside padding for the inside and height width for any other futzing that s necessary

1574721

1574996
unix	bsd
there are 195k keys in my dictionary i m using the bsd unix words file

1575033
typedef	struct
if that s not it then i d try to verify if it is a compiler syntax issue by splitting up the definition so you define the struct as a typedef and then define the pointer in a separate statement

1575047
put	get
then you might as well just get the customer update the credit balance with your client and then put the back to customer 21

1575051
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine on firefox and google-chrome but on ie the grid never displays the scrollbar no matter how many rows i add they are added to the bottom of the grid and a vertical scrollbar never appears

1575092
int	double
i am not sure if it is any faster but you could cast your double to an int and test for equality

1575093
instances	transient	persistent	transient
it should be the responsibility of the dao to load a persistent object from the datastore and returning a transient instances

1575100
google-chrome	safari
but in google-chrome and safari you ll can have a bad experiencie when displaying post-submit form the response

1575109
crossover	mutation
crossover and mutation can then be accomplished by the appropriate bit-masking operations

1575162
bufferedreader	fileinputstream
open the file using a fileinputstream skip the relevant number of bytes then wrap the bufferedreader around the stream via an inputstreamreader

1575162
fileinputstream	filechannel	bufferedreader	fileinputstream	bufferedreader	filechannel
open the file with either fileinputstream or randomaccessfile call getchannel on the stream randomaccessfile to get an underlying filechannel call position on the channel then call channels.newinputstream to get an input stream from the channel which you can pass to inputstreamreader - bufferedreader

1575175
ceil	floor
then given a number to test i would round it both up and down using the floor and ceil functions to get one or two candidate answers

1575285
firefox	safari
.url files open in safari but that s not good enough for reasons that aren t worth going into here. as part of my efforts to use either filetype on either system i m writing an applescript to open .url files on os x firefox

google-chrome	safari
edit when i say major browsers specifically i meant safari 4.0.3 google-chrome 3.0.195.27 and ie 8.0.6

1575582
tostring	gethashcode
the problem is that you need a single class for it to compare and it uses both tostring and gethashcode in the comparison which is why your dictionary idea didn t work it isn t comparing the elements of the dictionary it s comparing the tostring and gethashcode of it

1575584
hash	md5
- i create a md5 hash

1575631
width	height
the total number of pixels will be its width multiplied by its height

1575648
google-chrome	safari
but in google-chrome safari the dialog is not opened in center of the screen but a long way down the page

1575648
google-chrome	safari
- works in safari google-chrome

1575648
google-chrome	safari
- do not work in safari google-chrome

1575653
post	get
the only difference between the two sets is that the delete routes use get and are supposed to return json while the othere ones use post and redirect

1575675
dictionary	map
now that is simple enough it just builds a dictionary map for the objects during the clone and populates it with any object that should not be cloned

1575716
button	checkbox
i am making a program which dynamically adds objects such as a button or a checkbox to a form

1575806

however the relationship between swing and awt is seriously messed up

1575812
accessor	properties
while properties are new accessor have always been a key part of objc

1575812
accessor	properties
properties just made it easier to write accessor

1575812
getter	setter
or we just typed a lot of getter and setter by hand

1575937
post	get
so i thought i would post them here to get some clarification

1575964
post	get
i ve used thirster42 s solution before but that only works for me when it s a get not a post

1575964
firefox	safari
it also seems to be browser-specific -- firefox won t submit the form when the user hits enter in a textbox but safari will

1575964
firefox	safari
firefox 3.5.3 safari 4.0.3 macosx

1575964
opera	firefox
a basically you don t. i believe this is because the behavior is inconsistent across platforms and web browsers and what works for firefox might not work for ie or opera

1575964
firefox	safari
tested in firefox safari and ie 8

1576015
ia-32	x86
the canonical reference to x86 is probably the intelâ 64 and ia-32 architectures software developer s manual

1576040
post	get
i have researched getjson which works great except that i need to post not get

1576047
folder	directory
you would need to apply this permission on the folder that the virtual directory points to

1576058
versioning	upgrade
then make your paid versioning the free paid upgrade versioning and remove your existing lite versioning from the store

1576058
migrate	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
a problem with this is how to get all of your existing customers to upgrade to the intermediate versioning that flips the paid switch in time to migrate the application to the free paid upgrade model

1576105
post	get
you can do a post but what you want is a jsonp request to get around the cross domain issues

1576106
post	get
when i just run the php or throw the url in the browser with the post info concatenated i don t get that extra space and 1 at the end.

1576115
cpython	ironpython
i don t really see a style argument to be made here either way -- both multiprocessing in cpython 2.6 and threading in the current versions of jython and ironpython let you code in extremely similar ways and styles

1576134
post	get
a rest-based webservice is the cgi-based application that is similar to using an html form element generally using get but if you are doing anything that can be destructive or change databases you will want to use post

1576134
client-side	server-side
you can write applications using these apis in any language which is the advantage as you can then choose which language is best for the server-side and that has no impact on what you do on the client-side

1576167

while basically all of the core java libraries are there swing and awt libraries are not

1576340
rss	feed
especially for blogs there needs to be a way to automatically list posts chronologically and generate a rss feed

1576374
integer	unsigned
but it returns a signed number where i want an unsigned number because i want to send that number to the server as an integer during encryption and have to decrypt it at server

1576467
google-chrome	firefox
i have version 3.0.195.27 and want to debug some javascript that is working in ie firefox but not in google-chrome

1576472
hide	show
the menu show four default options settings about flash... i would like to hide them

when i access file whith unc filepath from asp.net i found the following problem

1576536
subtraction	multiplication
this also works for subtraction and multiplication

update - it looks java 8 will have support in the form of library methods for treating int and long as unsigned types - see unsigned integer arithmetic api now in jdk 8 by joseph darcy oracle

1576544
rss	feed
if you do not use summaries but instead let the module create summaries automatically then if you change these settings in module options then all of your content will be served by the rss feed

1576594
google-chrome	firefox
but i changed a few code in the plugin to add links to thumbnails it works perfectly on firefox google-chrome

1576613
put	get
..but i m getting errors on that mentioning that only get put and delete requests are allowed.

1576644
emacs	textmate
this short screencast looks at the latter comparing textmate and emacs

1576650
typedef	struct
i believe that typedef remains a pure c keyword and really only happens to work with objective-c types usually because they happen to be implemented as struct

1576655
put	get	post	put	post	get
the reason you re getting an error about only get put and delete requests being allowed is that you re using a post request

1576655
post	put
you can do it by changing post to put in your link_to call

1576689
free	malloc
and one of my concern is why the same solution for malloc free works perfect

1576689
free	malloc
when hacking malloc free functions itâ s okay

1576695
inherited	subclassing
if the object model is an inherited hierarchy then the relationship should not need to be bi-directional and the solution is to obtain the subclassing instance from the subclassing dao

1576695
set	bag
if the object model is a bi-directional relationship then you need to set inverse true on the set or bag at the one end of the relationship - in this case basicentity

1576695
set	bag
hibernate 3 allows the use of indexed collections at the one end of the relationship but the hibernate 2 functionality with set or bag should be enough to test the theory

1576814
quicksort	mergesort
you should check other sorting algorithms as well at least if you re not taught a few more quicksort mergesort etc. in class

1576838
post	get
since in a dilbertesque way everything get changed every second i was wondering if there is any simple way of grouping _post data i mean sending post like this

1576894

since qtextbrowser inherited from qtextedit you should use it and set the readonly properties to false

1576900
post	get
which allows to send sms via email http get post rest xml etc

1576948
webrat	cucumber
you can see this by the innovative testing framework like cucumber webrat shoulda coulda rspec test spec

1576966
sorting	filtering
regarding collectionview you can define collectionviewsource in the view xaml and then bind its sorting and filtering properties to viewmodel

1577026
srp	principles
well while you can do this as described in other answers i believe there is more important thing to be answered regarding your example and that is that you are probably violating srp principles with class having many dependencies

1577032
width	height
using var dst new bitmap width height pixelformat.format32bppargb

1577065
implements	extends
it s very useful if you want to make sure a class implements an interface or extends abstract class ie for plugins adapters ...

1577069
profiling	instrumentation
the closest thing i can find to instrumentation program flow and generate test coverage files in my build settings is generate profiling code which doesn t appear to do what i want it to do

1577096
switching	screens
it can do the basic switching to full screens and back to normal size stunts however with one exception

1577096
switching	screens
on the first fresh load of the app if i switching to full screens mode first and then click to play the movie the player would be in full screens yet the movie itself would remain in it s original size

1577096
width	height
the videodisplay object even returns the expected width height but the movie just plays in it s original size

1577096
switching	screens
if i switching screens sizes during movie playback then the movie size will shrink or stretch as it should

1577097
boost	stl
while boost is more modern c++ it also harder to use for non trivial tasks - and without a modern c++ experience and deep stl knowledge it is difficult to use correctly

1577142
s-function	simulink
for instance if you want to synchronise 2 tools or your s-function simulink requires additional information

1577142
matlab	simulink
but then such a file is propably called by matlab simulink in the first place

1577153
ssl	https	xml-rpc	json-rpc
if you use https ssl on the server side it shouldn t matter if you use xml-rpc or json-rpc

1577188
vxworks	ecos
ecos vxworks linux good posix support so you can use this

1577205
super	self
you are not checking if self super init

1577205

1577469
post	get
i ve written a small web application which is basically a jquery powered chat client within the browser to get the post i m polling the server with an ajax request and then appending any new replies i m worried about making this as efficient as possible while not losing the realtime feel

1577517
put	get
get your text and put it in a loop

1577549
post	put
http put isn t inherently any more secure than http post if you re allowing the uploaded files to be exceuted on your server

1577564
addclass	removeclass
secondly as ken says it s generally better to switch a class on and off and then use addclass and removeclass functions in jquery

1577611
vpn	lan
if it s a machine on your lan or vpn you can use a unc path but you ll have to know each machine s username and password

1577646
g++	gcc
change gcc to g++ if you really care - it may handle better.

1577696
int	double
i need to store a collection of int and double representing nominal and real valued data in c++

1577696
int	double
the efficiency i am talking about is primarily the efficiency of retrieving the int double value of a certain column although fast setting of values is important too

1577696
int	double
after some more thought and reading the suggestions so far it seems that just storing int columns and double columns in two separate vectors is a solid solution

1577696
int	double
just storing as a is okay too i guess but it depends on how fast the conversion between double and int is which is probably pretty impressive

1577705
int	double
but in that case you d have to have some way to know which elements of the vector should be treated as int and which ones should be treated as double

1577705
int	double
to keep track of which ones are int and which ones are double you could use a bitset or something like that

1577705
int	double
if not and exact int precision isn t important then you might as well just store them all as double

1577719
bufferedreader	printwriter
the teacher requires that we use socket bufferedreader printwriter and various other things including bufferedreader s readline method

1577724
children	parent
the restored resources know how to get their own children and parent via the tree s content provider so not all elements of the tree need to be persisted

1577769
put	get
so to reference images that are stored in your app bundle you just need to get the right path to put in your img tag

1577770
for-loop	loops
- sometimes you need to loops through the rows like using a regular for-loop

1577798
int	double
since int can be converted to double without loss of precision.

1577827
config	ini
so what i need is a simple solution with few code and ini config

1578529
rss	feed
i m using an xmldatasource to fetch an rss feed on the same domain

1578544

entities	entitymanager
so somehow i need to be able to scope entities to a particular entitymanager factory

1578801
cpython	ironpython
or if you need to add this to an already existing client then you could still bind in either ironpython or cpython as an embedded scripting engine

1578814
children	parent
inamingcontainer is just a marker interface that tells asp.net a control contains children that may need to be accessed independently of their parent control so child controls get those extra pretty ids we asp.net developers have come to know and love

1578819
tunnel	vpn
just use regular sql connections over a secure vpn or an ssh tunnel

1578819
tunnel	vpn
since the linked server talks to your server over a vpn or ssh tunnel all data is send encrypted over the internet

1578828
profiling	instrumentation

1578836
tabs	tabpanel
height - sets the height of the body of the tabs does not include the tabpanel headers

1578875
superclass	subclassing
add a method _validate_b self b single leading underscore to indicate protected callable from derived classes but not by general client code that validates the value of b which only subclassing know vs the value of a which the abstract superclass does know

1578875
superclass	subclassing
since the responsibility of that change lies entirely with the subclassing then the responsibility for triggering validation must also be with them the superclass can perform validation given the proposed new value of b but it cannot know when validity must be checked

1578875
inherited	subclassing
if most subclassing fall into broad categories in terms of the strategies they use to affect their b s values you can factor that out into either intermediate abstract classes inheriting from the general one and specializing the general approach to determining b including the validation call or better if feasible some form of strategy design pattern typically implemented via either composition or mix-in inherited

1578908
nfa	dfa
optional convert the nfa to a dfa

1578960

let s say i want to calculate a hash of a data structure using a hash algorithm like md5 which accepts a serial stream for the purposes of equivalence checking

1579014
mouseup	mousedown
if you track the mouse position by capturing any mousedown events you will know where the last click mouseup happened and that should allow you to reconstruct things

1579022
affinity	processors
scheduling is still determined by thread priority but it can be influenced by setting thread affinity and thread ideal processors as discussed in this topic

1579042
superclass	subclassing
if this is what you want then your design must assign responsibility by decomposing things into the part the superclass is responsible for and the part the subclassing is responsible for

put	get
if i ve understood you correctly you need to put the code to get the value inside an event handler for the input textarea for example in an event handler foe the keypress event

1579457
getter	setter
it may be that the setter has logic that should run or perhaps the implementation used an ivar with name different from the getter setter or perhaps two ivars that need to be released and or have their value set to nil

prepare	execute
i d rather create a prepare query load a line from the file and execute the prepare query

1579771
sorting	grouping
the reason for which i avoid sorting is that it may take some more time and because after i make the first set of grouping some of them will be locked and the unlocked grouping will be dissolved and regrouped using a different time offset

1579771
sorting	grouping
and when dissolving grouping the files order may be changed and they will require sorting again

1579788
udp	tcp
i would suggest using udp rather than tcp with manual ack commands this way you don t get the constant connected sockets as per your boss

1579799

when your application is ready to run the plugins you would load a list of plugin candidates either an xml file or scan the class files within a specific directory and load each class in order to execute them one by one

1579968
put	get
if you have two columns as varchar and put in the values 10 and 20 and add them you ll get 1020 instead of 30 which you d likely expect

1579979
pull	push
so create a separate say gitrepos directory and then each local copy should push and pull from there

create a group based on col a and put a b c inside that group header - get rid of the details section entirely

1580034
cvs	rcs
this capability similar to the keyword expansion in cvs rcs and others only really works with a linear history

1580034
cvs	svn
part of the point of svn was to make the use of branches and merging much easier than in cvs

1580063
unsigned	short
the problem is that the function we found that does this operation named from the images and video processing lib supports only the types unsigned char ipp8u signed unsigned short ipp16s ipp16u and float ipp32f

1580099
post	get
for example if you are storing if the http type of the request get post etc this can only ever be a couple of types and better to store as an int and get improved i o + query performance

1580108
accessor	properties
in fact if you look at il you ll see the properties accessor replaced by get and or set methods

1580121
profiler	yourkit
yourkit is an excellent commercial profiler that has good eclipse integration

1580160
post	get
if you wanted to use post and _files i think the closest you could get would be to point upload_tmp_dir at a ramdisk

1580204
int	double
unforunately both of these methods require you transform your byte into one of int float or double depending on the image format

1580216
put	get
but i don t know what to put in routes.rb to get it to hook up correctly.

1580268
dictionary	map
i don t know if something analogous exists in .net but you can always fake it with a dictionary hash map which uses the current thread instance as the key

1580292
width	height
i have a project with a lot of frames and when i reload my project they are resized to a width and height of 443x270 or thereabout

1580321

if you still have trouble please post the tag for a maven pom.xml dependency you are using and i can try to be more specific

1580613
profiler	visualvm
visualvm is a stand-alone subset of the netbeans profiler

1580623
x86	64bit
in that case the correct solution was to explicitly compile to x86 this is a small tool that would not gain from running in 64bit

1580630
width	height
when the user hovers over the ad the flash movie expands by increasing the height and width of the flash object

1581153
move	drag
you didn t specify if the axes always remain where they originally started or if they change depending on where the draggable item is on drag start like if you move it a little bit then let go and try to drag it some more

1581172
hide	show
in some cases conditional formatting will do the job but only for appearance -- it can t do things like show hide controls or alter the rowsource of dropdown lists or requery them

1581202
width	height
edit the problem isn t the width its the height of the container being overlapped by the new height of the now populated grid

this works fine in firefox safari opera and google-chrome but ie 6 7 simply do not show the alert

1581248
int	double
when you write 200 is an int literal which is then converted into double via widening primitive conversion

1581259
min	max
as long as it s well documented and you provide methods to allow the user of the library to control the threadpool such as min max threads and maybe the option to not use a threadpool at all

1581400
children	parent
this function takes rows that don t have children and recursively generate fullid for each row up to their parent

1581466
subtraction	addition
the preferance is brackets first then divide multioply and last subtraction and then addition

1581481
ant	maven
for example in java it is common to use ant or maven scripts that can be used in both the ides and as separate build processes

1581493
public	protected
it s important to remember that that access modifiers private protected public are controlling class access not instance access

1581495
children	parent
once all the classes are built up into a tree like structure - one top level class containing a whole lot of other classes the isvalid method is called on the parent which in turn calls isvalid on all of its children

1581495
children	parent
if isvalid returns false the errors property on the parent is set with the errors properties of all of its children that failed the isvalid call

1581504
postgresql	mysql
actually i don t have a postgresql on hand to test if this actually works and mysql doesn t support sql-99 s with recursive and i don t seriously recommend it either

however if you are trying to make html templates i would highly recommend you to get a real templating engine like smarty dwoo or savant

1581611
hash	salt
and the salt should be unique for each user and should be stored along with the password hash

1581614
salt	md5
mr atwood wrote about the strength of md5 against rainbow tables and basically with a long salt like that you re sitting pretty though some random punctuation numbers it could improve it

1581639
button	checkbox
button checkbox combobox and radiobutton controls

1581647
implements	extends
sudo noob was wrong with the statement extends should be implements

1581663
salt	md5
the benefit of having a salt is that it makes it harder for an attacker to pre-generate the md5 signature of every dictionary word

1581663
salt	md5
but if an attacker learns that you have a fixed salt they could then pre-generate the md5 signature of every dictionary word prefixed by your fixed salt

1581663
salt	md5
it makes it a bit more expensive to check the password since you need to look up the salt before you can generate the md5 signature but it makes it much more difficult for an attacker to pre-generate md5 s

1581668
firefox	safari
moreover the sun test your jvm page crashes every browser firefox 3.0 safari i tried under osx 10.6

1581687
portrait	landscape
physically rotate the device from portrait to landscape

1581687
portrait	landscape
animate the portrait view highguicontroller to landscape

1581687
portrait	landscape
this will take care of step 2 it will rotate the portrait view to landscape in either direction

1581687
portrait	landscape
that should present the landscape view after the rotation animation is complete and then dismiss it after the device is rotated back to portrait

1581702
accessor	properties
i m currently building a node editor as in blender and am having trouble getting delegates to properties accessor from a generic type

in this approach you are using the db for sorting and a simple comparison for grouping

1581798
width	height
you will need to adjust the thumbnail and full-sized image width and height accordingly

1581820
ienumerable	ienumerator
even though this is supported by c# via ienumerator ienumerable there is a better idiom foreach

1581851
dlsym	dlopen
on posix it works pretty much the same but the functions are slightly different use dlopen to load the dynamic library and dlsym to retrieve the symbol

1581851
dlsym	dlopen
the programming library howto describes this in more detail or see the man pages for dlopen and dlsym

1581852
int	chars
in a 32-bit architecture sizeof int would return 4 while sizeof chars would return 1

1581877
ant	maven
i d like to benefit from the maven dependency management and from the available plugins right now i m using huge custom ant files

1581892
udp	tcp	tunnel	packets
this is how for example openvpn works - it receives the raw ip packets over udp or tcp and tunnel them back into the kernel over a tun tap interface

1581895
put	get
i m using an array for the pages i ve already visited to filter the links i add to the queue but if there are more than one threads and they get the same links on different pages they put duplicate links to the queue

1581907
allocator	stl
please see stl implementing code allocator then you ll understand

1581919
hash	salt
improving upon salt hash add pepper

1581919
hash	salt
if you want extra security the security folks now 2017 recommend adding a pepper to the automatically salt password hash

i m considering refactoring my code not to directly store the tokens on the the char but instead store a copy of them by mallocing space to strlen token +1 then using strcpy

1582007
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
file uploads using the xmlhttprequest object is not possible in all browsers only firefox and safari google-chrome support it so for a cross-browser implementation use the trick

1582014
children	parent
the parent that acts as your background should be changed to a sibling before the container that wraps your children

1582016
unicode	ucs
package ucs error unknown unicode character 79297 u+135c1

1582022

rss	feed
please check this jfeed javascript jquery rss atom feed parser plugin

1582098
post	get
this is certainly good enough for my needs however i will test another library when i get a monent and post the results here

1582101
hash	salt
if you are storing any user passwords that will be used for authentication that your own application will perform the best way of storing this is with a salt one-way hash function

1582101
hash	salt
any attacker even one with access to the raw database would have to brute-force reverse engineer all of your salt hash

1582113
jtable	jtextpane
i created jtable with jtextpane as cell editor.i want to stop cell editing and want to do some processing if i pressed enter key in jtextpane .and i also want to use single line in jtextpane

1582134
width	height
i used a simple screen representation where div#wrapper is just a box with specified width and height overflow set to hidden so the animated elements don t get shown when they are out of boundaries and two divs with ids of #left and #right each has absolute position width 50 #left is moved -50 to the left and #right is moved -50 to the right

1582175
client-side	server-side
for a short form perhaps an html form with client-side or server-side validation would be suitable

1582181
inotifycollectionchanged	ilist
the only solution that i ve thought of is inhereting form a base class which will use reflection to iterate through all the ilist fields try to cast them to inotifycollectionchanged and will add an event handler which will call notify

1582198
put	get
so in my method i go off and get these values from the database and put them into my application

you ll need to supply these as get or post data with the asynchronous request

1582297
children	parent
parent 1 children

1582297
put	get	post	put	post	get
i want to use the methoddispatcher so that each of the above can have get post put delete functions

1582309
post	get
i would not like to get a thread-stall while a chunk of slow post data comes in

1582316
interpreted-language	compiled-language
ruby is an interpreted-language so it can be up to 50 times slower executing code than just-in-time compiled-language like java and c# based on tests i ve seen

1582350
cos	sin
i am trying to for example locate sin cos and tan in a string like 1+sin 28 +cos 72

1582381

if your index is small enough to fit comfortably into ram and you don t update it frequently you can maintain an index on the disk and then create a ramdirectory from it using the ramdirectory directory dir constructor

1582386
width	height
so the whole region from 10 0 - width - height to 0 0

1582440
post	get
based on this post it looks like using dbcc log database_name in sql 2000 will get the transaction log information

1582512
getter	setter
and the references to objects by getter and setter

1582515
stdout	stderr
yes your observation is confirmed - the order of the last three args is indeed stdin stdout stderr so the outpipe in the docs is erroneously getting passed as the input instead

1582523
tabcontrol	tabitem
i have a tabcontrol object with some tabitem objects inside

1582523
tabcontrol	tabitem
for the second design i tried to adjust horizontalalignment property to center in tabitem objects and horizontalcontentaglinment property to center in tabcontrol object but neither works

one is that the web relies on tcp not udp

1582675
width	height
the crop function takes its arguments as a proportion of the image width or height specified as a float value from 0.0 to 1.0

1582745
put	get
you would have to put some work in to get a unit test application based on an xunit framework to target multiple cores ie uses multiple threads or write your own framework that does it

1582787
processors	hyperthreading
note here doesn t mean hyperthreading just normal multi-core processors functionalities

1582794
fpdf	fpdi
check out fpdf with fpdi

1582846
button	checkbox
one approach here is to associate a label control with the checkbox and then using a combination of css and jquery to make the actual checkbox itself invisible render the label as a button and modify the label s border property as the checkbox is checked or unchecked

1582846
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this code works in google-chrome safari opera firefox and ie thanks to a conditional-comment hack since ie treats hidden form elements differently to other browsers

1582846
submit	submission
if you submit the enclosing form you get ordinary html checkbox behaviour in the resulting form submission

1582854
ssl	https
what auger said plus get yourself an ssl certificate and server everything over https

1582856
innodb	myisam
innodb does it also supports foreign keys for instance -- it s far more advanced that myisam

1582945
min	max
i d use min and max for conciseness but three nested if thens would be just as good i think

1582972
int	chars
especially for this domain where there s a tiny vocabulary of possible chars it would be better to use something like an array of int where the array is indexed by thechar - a or something like that

1582975
put	get
in the constructor and add a static variable initializer for numbertomonthmap but that doesn t work - you d get a nullreferenceexception immediately because you d be trying to put the value into a map which didn t exist yet

1583029
subtraction	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	multiplication
basically it boils down to long-addition multiplication division subtraction

it works fine in firefox ie and opera basically it expands a content block originally filling half of the page to the full page

1583082
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
second you must have as many calls to free as you do to malloc and calloc but realloc can mess with the counting

1583082
strtok	getline
note that the pointers returned by strtok are all pointers into the single chunk of space allocated by getline

1583082
free	malloc
all the subsequent frees on the parts of dest are trying to free an address not returned by malloc and valgrind is trying to tell you that

1583082
free	strdup
note that you will need to free each of the separately allocated strdup d strings as well as the array of character pointers that are accessed via dest

1583088
websphere	ibm
as for ivr s you could have a look at ibm s websphere voice response or genesys voice portal

nemerle	boo
maybe boo and nemerle macros are false by his standards

1583108
mp3	flv
i need to extract the audio data from a flv and inject it into a mp3 with c#

1583146
lisp	scheme
for something truly different try lisp or scheme

1583152
lisp	scheme	pascal	delphi
i ve programmed in pascal delphi assembly c c++ scheme lisp java c# and cuda

haskell	scheme	lisp	scheme
i ll second lisp scheme and also suggest haskell as a language that will challenge the way you think about programming

1583188
lisp	scheme
in my case this came through my studies in tcl tk which is multi-paradigm but i imagine you can get the same effect from any of the strongly functional languages such as lisp or scheme

1583237
pop-up	dialog
i want to move this button into right corner of pop-up dialog

1583237
pop-up	dialog

audiotoolbox	avfoundation
i m importing audiotoolbox avfoundation and coreaudio

1583289
firefox	safari
the xmlhttprequest object was implemented as an activex object in internet explorer and has later become a native javascript object in most modern browsers firefox safari

1583352
hash	md5
use a cookie and store a unique value maybe a guid md5 hash or something

1583370
udp	tcp
if it receives it as udp is not as reliable as tcp of course

1583448
google-chrome	firefox
if you swap the padding for margin it works the same in both firefox and google-chrome on my pc anyway

1583479
public	protected
you can expose the base protected method with a public method on the derived class for example

1583489
equals	gethashcode	equals	tostring	tostring	gethashcode
then there are some common members that are implemented by every type like equals tostring gethashcode

1583492
children	parent
you can do it by filtering the children of a parent to return only text nodes but if your question is about performing some manipulation on the text then get the parent element and manipulate the text contents

1583503
equals	gethashcode
to provide common members such as equals finalize gethashcode tostring..

1583521
lisp	scheme
i can incrementally build and run my programs later i saw this in lisp scheme and forth

first of all managed is a bit of a misnomer languages like ocaml haskell and sml achieve such protections and safety while being fully compiled

1583715
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
-i starts case-sensitive matching - if you want the whole pattern to be case-insensitive then you don t need to end the

1583717
haskell	sml
languages such as scala sml and haskell are non-null by default null is called option or maybe and require special syntax and checks

1583723
put	get
when possible i expect that malloc will try to put different requests close to each other as it will have a block of code that is available for malloc until it has to get a new block

1583734
haskell	scheme	lisp	scheme
haskell is pretty popular these days as a mind-bender though it may not hurt as much for you if you already know lisp and scheme

1583745
filesystems	fat
the pre-commit hook should be disabled by default but older versions pre 1.6.0 used to install them turned off by having executable permissions turned off which might not work on non-unix filesystems like fat

1583797
int	boolean
in objective-c i need to associate a mutable collection int monotonic non-contiguous could get fairly large to boolean values

1583827

width	height
width and height s default value is auto

1583854
hash	salt
yes i have to agree with the option of storing the salt hash

i would recommend a salt sha256 hash of the password stored in the database

1583873
ubuntu	linux
i m running ubuntu linux 9.04

1583965
boost	stl
the boost library contains some of the highest quality c++ code available and relies heavily on the stl

1584120
internationalization	localization
that s actually called internationalization or localization

1584131
lisp	scheme
it s not exactly the same as scheme or common lisp but learning it will help you if you ever want to work through the structure and interpretation of computer programs or grok what paul graham s talking about in his essays and you can relate to this comic from xkcd

1584199
google-chrome	firefox
especially why would this work in ie and google-chrome but not firefox

1584201
networkstream	sslstream
you would pass a normal unencrypted networkstream which is the encapsulation of the tcp socket connection as the parameter to an sslstream object

1584201
networkstream	sslstream
once you ve finished with the initial ssl transmissions you can simply close the sslstream and use the underlying networkstream for subsequent plaintext transmissions

1584213
mouse	keyboard
basically i want my application to have complete control over the keyboard while it s being used if they want to navigate away they will still be able to do so with the mouse

1584227

1584292
sproutcore	javascriptmvc
i started using javascriptmvc sproutcore framework sproutcore.com and i found it impressive

1584320
int	double
where user can only input number like int double not any letter

1584328
int	double
now the question is why the original value 8224055000.0000000000 which is an int - and exactly representable as a double - ends up with extra data in

1584365
nsobject	nsmanagedobject
note that a property name cannot be the same as any no-parameter method name of nsobject or nsmanagedobject for example you cannot give a property the name â œdescriptionâ see nspropertydescription

1584402
free	realloc
the c standard says straightforwardly that behavior is undefined if the value of a pointer that refers to space deallocated by a call to the free or realloc function is used

1584432
free	malloc
if you want to be sure provide your own alternative implementation of malloc and free

1584437
lisp	scheme
i would have suggested mastering lisp in some relevant dialect so even if you have lisp and scheme on your resume it might be worthwhile to really learn deeply

1584535
internationalization	localization
internationalization localization

1584574
post	get
this is actually equivalent the current handler executing another http get post then streaming the results to the client

1584598
hide	show
the appropriate message is injected into the #screen div and show hide is then applied

1584604
equals	gethashcode
you could overload equals and gethashcode but that is not recommended for mutable types

1584608
width	height
another a bit clumsier way might be to make the function accept a pointer to a single-dimensional array and both width and height given as arguments and calculate the indexes into a two-dimensional representation yourself

1584682
min	max
maybe you could use the defaultview.rowfilter to launch a query that group by unique columns and select the min or max rowid as the row to keep

1584769
codeigniter	kohana	symfony	kohana
i ve noticed the same pattern in codeigniter and kohana and to some extent also in symfony

you can run ie8 ie7 ie6 firefox 3.5 firefox 3 firefox 2 safari 4 safari 3 opera 10 opera 9 google-chrome

1584845
hash	salt
you need to use the same salt when checking the hash - each user should have their email address salt and hash stored

1584946
rss	feed
my js file calls uses an xmlhttprequest to display an rss feed

1584953
parent-child	one-to-many
each child in the table has a foreign key to a parent parent-child relationship is one-to-many

i already got a listbox that displays all the children but i m not sure how to change the query so that i see only the active parent children the parent which i am looking at its form right now

1584973
subtract	add
you can add and subtract time from dates as well

1584983
put	get	waitpid	posix
since waitpid blocks your application or rather the thread calling it you will either need to put it on a background thread or use the signalling mechanism in posix to get information about child process termination

1584986
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i use juggernaut for server push which works very nice in firefox opera and google-chrome but it doesn t work at all in ie

1584989
put	get
if you try to do the same thing in r you have to put the nested function first or you get an error

balsamiq mockups has some iphone-like controls and you get a mock up done faster than in visual studio

1585110
width	height
actually i want the map div will cover the 70 of width leaving 30 for my menus and 60 of height leaving 40 for my website banner

1585110
width	height
when i assigned the div height and width in the map will not render properly instead it either shrinks to top or left depending on the attribute assigned

1585110
width	height
but when i explicitly assign height and width in px say 400px the map will render perfectly

1585115
getter	setter
on the other hand you may very well have legitimate reasons to have a bunch of properties that are no more than getter and setter

1585130
width	height
the problem is observing document.documentelement for change of height and width of viewport or document.body depending on quirks standard mode

1585154
range	max
the longest running times do happen with very sparse density for n 4096 the running time peaks are in the k 16-64 range with a gentle peak for mean runtime at 4212 steps k 31 max runtime peaked at 5101 steps k 58

i ve checked it in google-chrome v3.0.195.27 and it has the same safari bug although it has a newer version of webkit

1585249
int	double
note each built-in value type int double intptr has overridden equals which is why it behaves different for value types compares content then with referenceequals compares addresses

1585284
inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties
if i have two classes one which inherited from the other and i use the same method properties name in both how can i make that method call the subclassing regardless of whether the current object has been cast back to it s base class

1585305
hash	md5
yes sha1 is a better hash than md5

1585450
ant	maven	ant	pom.xml	maven	pom.xml
if you don t have any pom.xml or build.xml file in your project your project is likely not using maven nor ant

1585471
try-catch	exception-handling
put the assignment of servername in the constructor of chatserver where you either try-catch the exception-handling yourself and do something appropriate or let the constructor throw an unknownhostexception if possible

rss	feed
i need this code to execute every night for as long as the rss feed exists indefinitely

1585517

1585525
width	height
i also have a rectangle that s centered at b and the width and height of the rectangle

1585536
fink	macports
by the way you might want to check out macports and fink two independent projects that tailor and package for os x hundreds of popular open source packages

1585548
uiview	uiwindow
the interesting bit here is that uiwindow is itself a subclass of uiview so you can add all four views to your window directly

1585565
width	height
you can get that from the width of the rectangle and the difference between the x coordinates of a and b or height and y coordinates

1585565
width	height
based on the width and height you can check which case applies and the other case will be on the extension of a side of the rectangle

1585578
google-chrome	firefox
the following code was tested on ie6 ie7 ie8 google-chrome 3 and firefox 3.5

1585579
swt	swing
apart from eclipse and eclipse plugins swt mostly lost its battle with swing

post	get
the problem is when i do a form post i m able to get all of the fields but it is not parsing the query strings

1585599
accessor	properties
if you want fast access you could look at hyperdescriptor or there are ways of compiling a delegate to the properties accessor or you can build an expression from the string and compile it including a cast to object if you want a known signature rather than calling the much slower dynamicinvoke

1585643
mouseover	mouseout
i had to revert back to mouseover mouseout like this

1585643
mouseover	mouseout
mouseover mouseout

1585643

1585666
mouseleave	mouseenter
the hover method is a convenience method that binds event handler to the mouseenter and mouseleave events

1585666
mouseleave	mouseenter
you should bind to the mouseenter and mouseleave events instead

1585666
mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseenter
edit the difference between mouseenter and mouseover is that mouseenter and mouseleave don t bubble

1585666
mouseover	mouseenter
this means that you ll get a mouseover event if the mouse moves into any element inside the one you bound to which is probably not what you want whereas you ll only get a mouseenter event if the mouse entered that element itself

1585669
public	protected
you could store them as protected variables in your asp.net page s code-behind and then use databinding expressions to store them as public variables in your javascript .

1585688
portrait	landscape
load up the app and then change the simulator s orientation a few times from landscape to portrait and it should occur

1585772
width	height
so instead of creating a move and resize effect for each item in the layout which would actually set the width and height explicitly set the matrix

1585772
width	height
then make sure the layout isn t invalidated again which will happen if you set the width height directly or you might start getting an infinite loop

1585834
nunit	mstest
you can execute team system tests mstest in nunit if you use a special nunit addin that recognizes the ms test attributes testclass etc

1585873
yacc	bison

1586016
memset	calloc
from the pedantic point of view though calloc as well as memset ... 0 ... is only guaranteed to properly initialize with zeroes objects of type unsigned char

1586016
memset	calloc
formally in the current c language you can initialize only integer types with calloc and memset ... 0 ...

1586020

this is because of custom permissions in the application dynamic files directory and physical files and folder mixed with different permissions files that the user should have access to are mixed with ones they should not

1586067
qobject	qwidget	qobject	qmetaobject
i m afraid you can t use connectslotsbyname for the parent-child issues with qwidget but if you really want it you have all the metadata available in qmetaobject so you can write a function that works like connectslotsbyname on any pair set of qobject s

1586069
getter	setter
following the suggestions from brian agnew and nicky de maeyer use both setter and getter and an array or an object in the constructor

1586069
getter	setter
if you were to use setter and getter solely then you would have to set each individual property in your code after the object is instantiated

1586069
getter	setter
using getter and setter you get encapsulation of the logic that will drive each property that you need to manage within these objects

1586069
getter	setter
additionally zend framework provides the getter and setter so that you can freely modify the object in code at any time

1586073

punctuation	words
since i m studying malloc in class i ve lowercased every words removed all the punctuation in the article and string copied them into malloc

1586474
submit	submission
i thought about folder submission where the user selects the paths of the one folder or many folders he wants to submit and the system would then internally analyze the content and break them into either multiple entries or 1 entry and then populate as many entries as needed just as if it were done through a web form

1586480
for-loop	loops
at the start of the for-loop to get it to point to the correct word instead of using a while loops to find the start of the next word

1586572
accessor	properties
to answer the question from a language convention point of view prior to c# 3.0 access to internal data was typically performed by declaring private fields with public properties providing read and or write accessor

1586607
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
this is due to what can only be described as a defect in system.web.ui.util.getnonprivatefieldtype type classtype string fieldname that allows ui .aspx .ascx fields to compile as case-insensitive but attempts to retrieve them as case-sensitive during the intial parse

1586655
innodb	myisam
i just found this article which provides an example of a converting a large table from myisam to innodb while this isn t what you are doing he uses an intermediate memory table and describes going from memory to innodb in an efficient way - ordering the table in memory the way that innodb expects it to be ordered in the end

accelerometer	gyroscope
i am using two sensors from hitechnic the first being an accelerometer and the second being a gyroscope

1586697
cvs	svn
but it isn t the local disk file system and as a result they are invisible to tools like cvs or svn which operate strictly on the local disk file system

1586697
cvs	svn
however once changes to the database structure are managed by a copy-merge version control system like cvs or svn propagation and merging will be mostly automatic bar conflicts and

in the linux world of .deb debian and .rpm packages i can list the contents of any package installed using a tool such as dpkg or rpm

1586703
folder	directory
i am contemplating writing a program that will move some newly created directory to another that puts them into date-stamped folder

1586703

the application in question is very create update heavy and users only come to it when they need to make changes a quick parse of our logs show puts and post outnumber get s almost 50 to 1

1586791
ant	maven
i should be able to adapt to different entity relationships after that but i would settle for an example with just one or two entities with all files where they need to be without depending on a blac-box-build ide like eclipse i like ant and am learning maven ideally configured for mysql

i seem to have two problems apart from the fact there is almost no documentation for the hardware in question the bytes are expecting to be unsigned so i can t do a straight integer conversion

1586897
width	height
how can i resize it proprtionally to allow meto draw the sprite into a bitmapdata object which in cs3 flash player 9 is limited to 2880 height or width

1586940

versioning	upgrade
so you need the changes done in the data-structure in versioning 5 to successfully upgrade to versioning 6

1587452
disk	ram
the reason i want to use apc cache as general cache is that i m not happy with pear cache_lite from pear in terms of using it for variable caching as it stores it on the disk and disk i o is a bottleneck whereas ram is not and apc stores variables in ram not in files on the disk

1587452
opcache	apc
so anyone have any experience or knows if it is possible to setup apc to only run as general cache being called via it s api in my php code similarly to that of pear cache_lite while i maintain another opcache in my case xcache

1587459
dataoutputstream	bytearrayoutputstream
thanks for stream chaining you can have dataoutputstream - cipheroutputstream - bytearrayoutputstream

1587499

getter	setter
i need some advice on what i should test and how to make my classes more behavioral and not simple data containers with a bunch of getter setter

1587550
organization	naming
for your colleague to bring his naming convention from a previous organization into a new one without checking local standards is bad practice

1587551
organization	naming
however in an organization one person or a group defines the database naming conventions standardizes it and others will follow it whether they like it or not

1587625
ubuntu	linux
i m using ubuntu linux 9.04 with tpm emulator 0.60 from mario strasser

1587720
ubuntu	linux	kde	gnome
do they work similarly in mac os x and linux gnome kde ubuntu or wherever the difference is or is it completely different

1587774
ienumerable	iqueryable
the actor class doesn t implement ienumerable or iqueryable so you can t run a query on it and anyway actor is a type not an instance of a type .

1587783
kde	gnome
the xscreensaver faq seems to suggest that gnome and kde each have their own screensaver frameworks

1587786
ienumerable	iqueryable
you can t do a select directly over the actor class since it does not implement ienumerable nor iqueryable

1587810
avr	microcontroller
update just to be clear the tool chain i m using is avr studio to compile the code and then avrdude to upload it to the microcontroller

1587814
multiplying	add
multiplying this by the previously-obtained random floating-point value and add the minimum

1587825
int	double
your double arguments are larger than this causing an int overflow when they are converted to int

children	parent
i have a parent class with several children

1587855
touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchescancelled	touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchescancelled	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchescancelled
i ve subclassed uitableview as krtableview and implemented the four touch-based methods touchesbegan touchesended touchesmoved and touchescancelled so that i can detect when a touch-based event is being handled on a uitableview

1587857
post	get
my current workaround is to allow users to set a compatability flag to say that it s safe to send the parameters as a post request instead in the case where the uri would be too long but this is not ideal since the protocol i m using is restful and get should be used for queries

1587902
rss	feed
i can t rely on something like an rss feed and i need to ignore minor noise like date text

1587964
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
i only want to works on all latest browser which is ff2 3 ie7 ie8 safari google-chrome opera latest

int	double
this double value multiplied to 100 as int is send to a device cash register and this values must be correct

1588020
post	get
i can call it from raw javascript or jquery to post get data

1588046
post	get
i just noticed a strange thing in midp 2.0 api the httpconnection class apidocs make explicit references to methods get post and head but no other methods

1588128
post	get
its an online reference allows for collaboration and you won t get shot to pieces when you post random questions on so all day long and answer them in a week when you find the answers

1588162
google-chrome	firefox
when i use firefox or google-chrome this code does a get over this thispage.aspx

1588164
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
i recommend using a version control system bazaar hg svn git

1588179
versioning	upgrade
the problem is that we are trying to upgrade our versioning with the one use with tfs2010 but we cannot find the dll that we were using microsoft.teamfoundation.webaccess

1588190
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
probably because firefox google-chrome handles the click on the tag and opera does it on the tag

1588216
loops	if-statement
it would still involve a loops to find the right constructor but one loops with a simple if-statement to find the right one is far preferrable to looking at arguments and attempting to match this way

1588283
pop-up	dialog
once an hour i want to pop-up a dialog and lock the screen for two minutes in order to take a break

1588283

migrate	upgrade
so if i where in your position i d add an intermediate step and upgrade migrate to a drupal 5 install first then do another upgrade to drupal 6

1588292
versioning	upgrade
since the most error reports came in from users doing 1 versioning upgrade only going the same route should minimize the probability of encountering unexpected errors conditions

1588292
postgresql	mysql
note auto_increment is the mysql way of handling this if using postgresql take a look at the documentation for the serial pseudo type and the accompanying sequence generation mechanism

1588294
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
i then use md5 to hash salt password and email in that order together as password and rehash when they log-in

1588302
inherited	properties
but changes in other properties reflects but not height and there is no duplicate css entry and inherited value from other div

1588309
post	get
a form can be get or post but not both

1588317
hash	salt
the purpose of the salt is that if you hash the same value twice but with different salt the result will be different.if attacker aquires you databases of hash salt will renders ineffective attack with pre-calculated database of hash of known passwords

1588373
min	max
there is a dup here somewhere on so it had max instead of min but i can distinctly remember it

1588384
feof	fread
the correct way is to check the return value of fread or whatever function you re using to read or alternatively to call feof after the function that does the reading

1588416
maven	m2e
i mean i know there is a clover plugin for eclipse there is also a clover plugin for maven2 and of course there is maven plugin for eclipse m2e - which i am already using

1588472
google-chrome	safari
in addition to ie not supporting it it seems like the webkit based browsers safari google-chrome despite claiming to have js 1.7 support actually executing script tags declared as being in js 1.7 do not actually support any of these features which means that for now js 1.7 with its very nice features is limited to geko browsers alone

1588505
maven	m2e
calling starting the maven process is done via the m2e plugin and that s it

1588505
maven	m2e
the m2e plugin is not really needed for neither clover-maven nor clover-eclipse but it s nice when working with eclipse and maven

1588515
freemarker	velocity
i would perhaps look at velocity initially and if you have to do more of this sort of work take a further look at freemarker

1588532
filtering	grouping
in this instance you are filtering on the grouping column which could just be filtering using a where clause instead

1588552
opml	rss
can that be done by using opml rss atom ..etc

1588589
google-chrome	firefox
this bug only happens in firefox it works fine in google-chrome for example

awt	swing
java has been playing catchup for a long time with guis and missed the boat with the early releases of awt swing and poor ide designer support

1588720
folder	directory
a script iterates through that folder structure creating index.txt files in every directory listing the sub-items

1588720
rss	feed
and an weblog atom.xml in hardcoded the output directory for the rss feed

1588727
uicontrol	uibutton
edit i suggest subclassing uicontrol in the example below but if you don t need any special behavior on your button apart from the non-rectangleness of it then just subclassing a borderless uibutton set up with your png will do the job and require less work

1588735
put	get	post	put	post	get
methods get post put delete head

1588742
organization	naming
i m also with akf on the idea that the real problem is taking naming conventions from some other organization and ignoring the naming conventions of the current organization

1588772
switching	screens
as with the screens grab approach this on it s own does not prevent an user from by passing it by using the windows key alt - tab or ctrl - esc to bring up the start menu or to switching to other tasks

1588794
implements	extends
even if you were to implements a bin field you could just extends the models.charfield and cast it to hex in the to_python method

1588821
3des	aes
using an algorithm like 3des or aes with 16-byte blocks in cbc mode with pkcs #5 padding most email addresses will be encrypted in two blocks

1588858
addition	multiplication
by then combining the beads percentage and the simple rating by say addition certainly not by multiplication we are able to effectively use minmax in a fashion that is more akin to the way it is used in cases when it is not possible to evaluate the game tree to its end

1588866
gtk	drawingarea
i would like to draw some graphics to the gtk drawingarea widget but i want that widget to be resizable so when i draw let s say a line from 0 0 to 50 50 pixel - the drawing area should be resized to a square of size 50 50

1588866
gtk	drawingarea
and to do this - i put the gtk drawingarea widget into the gtk scrolledwindow container

1588866
gtk	drawingarea
so when i put a picture with size 100 100 to the drawing area - i will call the appropriate member function gtk drawingarea set___size_request 100 100 which will set the size of the drawing area to 100 100 pixels

1588866
gtk	drawingarea
so if the gtk scrolledwindow is smaller than the gtk drawingarea inside it the scrolled window should change to scrollable - but the problem is that it does not work

1588918
profiling	debugging
you can t get a collection of live objects implementing the interface though - at least not without using the debugging profiling api or something similar

1588929
filtering	grouping
there are two selects on the page which filtering a list by type and age grouping

1588939

lwjgl	jogl
if you want to learn about the underlying mechanics of 3d graphics go straight to opengl using jogl or lwjgl

1588999
try-catch	exception-handling
a caller that suspects that they might say be causing a path not found exception-handling by calling your code cannot wrap their call in a try-catch which catches ioexception

1589081
strace	systemtap
linux strace oprofile systemtap

1589097
put	get	mouse	keyboard
what s happening when you put your polling in a loop is that you re never letting control get back to the dispatcher which does all of the windows message handling messages for drawing move minimize maximize keyboard mouse input etc... for the application

1589102
onmousemove	onmouseup	onmousemove	mouseup	onmousemove	mousedown	mouseover	onmouseup	mouseover	mouseup	mouseover	mousedown	mouseover	onmousemove	onmouseup	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown

int	chars
edges is an array of 500 pointers to int and you are assigning a pointer to two chars to its first element

1589339
post	get
get rid of the counter_cache and implement after_create and after_destroy callbacks in your comment model that increment and decrement the count field in your post model

1589344
int	chars
since an int and a chars have different sizes you should try

1589372
range	minimum
the minimum statistics you should count in my opinion are the number of allocations of common block sizes range

1589381
ssl	https
note that this is not bullet-proof code as it assumes your for example running ssl https on the default port of 443

1589389
int	chars
the expression yields a pointer to int not pointer to chars

1589389
int	chars
sizeof chars is defined to be 1 and sizeof int is typically 4 meaning that your code will dereference a value 4 bytes into the chars array not 1 byte into the chars array

1589447
int	chars
ignoring the type compatibility edges 0 point to the int at the address where the c and d and possibly two more unspecified chars are

1589447
int	chars
edges 0 0 is the first int in edges 0 that s the mix of c d and possible two more unspecified chars

1589447
int	chars
edges 0 1 points to the int right after the mix of c d and possibly two more unspecified chars

1589447
int	chars
if you print an int instead of 2 chars

button	checkbox
another issues is that in my save button function while it can retreive the value of textboxes and the checkbox in code it cannot get the text from labels that have changed.

1589462
listview	gridview
the catch is that if you have any controls that create other controls like listview repeaters gridview etc

1589551
post	get
i am working to get each value of the checked element and post them to php

1589558
bluetooth	usb

1589701
xetex	xelatex
you probably won t be able to load tex gyre pagella with xetex or xelatex

1589727
maven	pom.xml
this pom.xml also uses the copy-dependencies goal of maven to make sure everything is in place

1589803
opera	firefox
it s not very hard to make the code work across firefox and opera -- you don t have to worry about ie

1589820
firefox	safari
ie6 ie7 ie8 firefox safari

1589820
opera	google-chrome
but google-chrome up-to-date as i type this at version 3.0.195.27 and opera up-to-date as i type this version 10.0 build 1750 don t

1589919
getter	setter
scala turns var into a private field one getter and one setter

1589919
getter	setter
so in order to get set a var by identifying it using a string you need to use java reflection to find the getter setter methods

1589950
int	double
obviously reordering things like int and double in the declaration is not too big a deal but bigger objects and things requiring dynamic allocation sometimes can be

1589980
onmousedown	onmouseup
the way i was able to get around this is by using the li elements onmousedown and onmouseup events

1589986
for-loop	arrays
right now i m using 1 for-loop that goes copies arraycolor then filters the copied arrays using an nspredicate

1590029
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it will only work on firefox safari and google-chrome though so it s a only a progressive enhancement

1590029
width	height
width height are optional but if the images are all the same size then it s better to use css instead of the width height attributes on the images themselves

1590087
ant	maven
some important things to note you cannot use the maven dependency as a refid in setting the ant property

1590087
ant	maven
i would highly recommend anyone considering maven use ant with maven plugins or even better use ant with ivy instead

1590087
ant	maven
maven does address some things that aren t addressed implicitly by ant but with some up front planning ant is the much more flexible better documented and the less buggy tool

1590099
apache	nginx
the reason why i m asking this question is that the site was running on nginx and i need to rebuild the same configuration on apache

1590430
keydown	keyup
i thought about subclassing an nstextfield and override keydown and keyup but it seems these overrides do nothing.

1590446
x86	64bit
so even better choose the any cpu option and your app will automatically jit compile as 64bit on a 64bit machine with the 64bit version of the framework installed and 32-bit x86 everywhere else

1590467
16-bit	64bit
windows 64bit can run 32-bit applications without problems it s 16-bit applications they can t run

1590491
gtk	cairo
i ve done something like that before for a different purpose with gtk on x which indirectly uses cairo

hide	show
i m pretty sure i can show a gif easily using jquery but i m not sure how to stop hide the busy indicator when the new document excel doc has finished loading

1590860
charindex	substr
the pattern could be as simple as word space number and you can split it based on space using patindex or charindex in conjunction with substr

1590874
charindex	substr
substr name 1 charindex name 1 - text before space

1590874
charindex	substr
cast substr name charindex name 1 +1 100 as int - text after space with cast to int for correct ordering

1590893
typedef	struct
typedef struct uint1024_tag

1590893

and then use that user-controls in your tabcontrol like this

1590957
hide	show
the site needs to show hide questions dynamically based on answers to other questions on the same page

1590957
client-side	server-side
when i do that the des suite will actually handle both the client-side and server-side portions of this visibility and validation functionality

1590962
firefox	safari
all these work perfectly in safari and firefox

1590980
rss	feed
if you are looking to programatically read rss feed into your php applications i recommend using magpie which is an open-source library built just for that purpose

1590985
bash	tcsh
if doing the latter then this can be managed globally by editing etc profile and etc cshrc for ksh sh bash csh and tcsh shells

1591006
opera	firefox
you can get the image data in the form of a data url this only works in firefox and opera so far though

1591010
post	get
you don t need a file input just get the data with ctx.getimagedata and post it to the server with ajax

1591051
int	boolean
clojure doesn t consider the int 0 to be boolean false

1591092
children	parent
parent only in its own children

1591138
children	parent
you ll notice that your parent table copolicypointer is joined twice even though your criteria only joins the children table

1591142
put	get
you will also need another column to get the final entry in the route so put the to column in the grid also and set the totals row for that column to last

1591159
ostringstream	std
your code works though ostringstream is in the std namespace

1591165
ostringstream	std
since you didn t put down a using for it you need to use the type std ostringstream

1591210
xml-rpc	json-rpc
using xml-rpc or json-rpc are only means to encapsulate your data into a form that is easy to transport

1591210
ssl	https
creating an https ssl connection encrypts all communication between the client iphone and the server django

1591229
width	height
however if you have a bunch of fields x y width and height it s a common convention to name the constructor parameters that initialize them with the field name plus a leading underscore

1591308
firefox	safari
but when i look at the site in os x either safari or firefox the font size is too big

1591315
hash	salt
in storing hash passwords is a common practice to add a nonce or a salt and is marginally true that this salt is better kept secret

1591315
hash	salt
which is linked from the wikipedia salt entry you ll see that is talking about this kind of salt the password hash

1591368
typeerror	attributeerror
obviously you can have an attributeerror if duck has no quack a typeerror if duck has a quack but it is not callable

1591376
subtraction	addition
instead of calculating actual euclidian distance which requires a square-root calculation do your select on the linear distance that requires only subtraction and addition

1591378
put	get
if it helps this is a snippet of prototype js i put together that detects if an element is within the viewport or not which might get you started if you re not happy with the other solution

1591381
post	get
i recently did some optimizing for mysql outlined here www.mooreds.com wordpress archives 000547 sorry i only get 1 hyperlink per post but am not sure how many of the steps i went through are applicable to oracle

1591391
pascal	delphi
packed array of char is assignment compatible with delphi string this goes back to very early forms of pascal - packed array of char was the string type

1591411
gridview	formview
controls inside of templates such as in your formview or in a gridview are not directly accessible in the code behind

1591421
mouse	keyboard
global keyboard and mouse hooks need to be implemented in a separate .dll

1591438
children	parent
then you iterate over the menu items and if they have a non-null parentid you add them to their parent s list of children

1591453
post	get
this might be cookie based or a session id might be transmitted as a post or get parameter along with each request

1591464
bash	zsh
ksh93 bash and zsh all understand c-like for-loop syntax

1591464
bash	zsh
unfortunately while ksh and zsh understand the curly brace range syntax with constants and variables bash only handles constants including bash 4

1591471
width	height
if what you want is a frame around your image i would create a div or span with a set width and height and an img slightly smaller inside it

1591524
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication	division	addition	division	subtraction	division	multiplication
in school you memorized single-digit addition multiplication subtraction and division

1591591
unsigned	short
unfortunately many of these methods accept string lengths of varying size max unsigned char max short etc... and i m stuck writing code to make sure that my string instances do not exceed the maximum length prescribed by the low-level api

1591595
curb	libcurl
net http if you don t want an external dependency curb libcurl multi if you need raw performance patron if you want a good middle-of-the-road solution and open-uri if you need something quick and dirty that will never see production usage

1591634
google-chrome	firefox
the image of the card on my site bottom right displays differently in google-chrome and firefox

1591634
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome its ratio is preserved but the ratio is twisted in firefox

1591664
mouseleave	mouseenter
i attach mouseenter and mouseleave events to the overlaying div element

1591670
getter	setter
i m guessing this is already in place but your model must have a getter and setter on the routename property in order to be properly bound

1591683
photoshop	paint.net
different browsers achieve varying levels of quality which never compare to what you can achieve with a dedicated digital image editor photoshop paint.net etc

1591683
width	height
best to resize it to the desired dimensions before publishing then explicitly set the actual height and width in pixels

1591693
777	tmp
i checked the permissions on the tmp directory they re set to 777 though i can t see the graph_8xynso.svg file in there

1591733
boost	stl
i usually implement it by wrapping an stl queue and protecting it using boost mutex

1591746
gtk	drawingarea
add a gtk viewport in between your scrolledwindow and drawingarea

1591750
onfocus	onblur
you could use the onfocus event in various ways to ensure that the onblur has completed

1591750
onmousedown	onfocus
i m imagining something along the lines of throwing out onmousedown and just putting a check in onfocus to see if the mouse button is currently down

1591796
mouseleave	mouseenter
from what i understand mouseenter and mouseleave do not bubble down to child elements

1591796
mouseleave	mouseenter
src mouseenter and mouseleave events for firefox

1591796
mouseover	mouseout
try mouseover and mouseout instead and it should work as expected

1591819
french	polish	french	turkish	turkish	polish
the php docs are available in english bulgarian portuguese german french japanese korean polish romanian and turkish plus they have archives of other languages which aren t listed as active any more so they re probably well out-of-date but might still be helpful

opera 7+ konqueror 3 safari and ie5 mac

1592002
realloc	malloc
read up on malloc and realloc

1592043
put	get
i would like to be able to get the source of each page for each department under business or whatever department i put in like accounting

1592045
cpu	hyperthreading
i am going to assume you have more than 1 core cpu in your system as that would be too obvious -- and no hyperthreading on a pentium 4 doesn t count as having two cores regardless of what intel s marketing would have you believe. there are two problems that i see

1592066
powerpc	i386
the default os x perl is a universal binary and thus has ccflags like -arch i386 -arch powerpc etc

1592087
realloc	malloc
you may also want to check for failure after calling malloc and realloc

1592102
translation	localization
on a side note if anyone is looking for a tool to help out with translation david deraedt wrote some nice air apps called lupo localization studio that are reasonably inexpensive

1592152
firefox	safari
firefox safari etc all work great

1592171
realloc	malloc
the closest to a dynamic array is by using malloc and it s associated commands delete realloc etc

1592185
wicket	smartgwt
i have been using smartgwt but have run into trouble mixing smartgwt with other frameworks such as wicket

1592191
boost	stl
if you find that it provides everything that you need then there is not much of a difference using that or using another stl implementation alongside boost

1592214
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
from your question it s not exactly clear if you re only having a problem in ie but when i hit the supplied page in firefox google-chrome and opera it loads as expected

1592240
jython	pypy	cpython	pypy	cpython	ironpython
__subclasses__ is part of the python language and implemented by ironpython and jython as well as cpython no pypy at hand to test right now but i d be astonished if they have broken that

1592254
dictionary	map
i have a situation where i want to map a pair of objects to a dictionary of information

1592305
int	chars
however if you had chars from some other source in a and needed to convert them to an int you could create an with the â initwithcstring encoding and then use its intvalue method but in this particular problem that simply isn t needed

1592321
apache	nginx
i would try to run the app in production on apache passenger see if the problem is specific to nginx passenger

1592332
wicket	gxt
i have used gxt and i have done some simple integrations with wicket components with it

1592368
ienumerable	iqueryable
ideally i want the expression to be evaluated directly inside the iqueryable data source and not in memory as an ienumerable

1592389
post	get
the js queries another file with parameters set in get or post

1592395
rss	feed
i am trying to view the wordpress rss feed but when i view it in firefox it asks me to subscribe so i can t actually view it and see what i need to do to view the full article

1592404
jython	pypy	cpython	pypy	cpython	ironpython
some of the most important areas of python development these days are moving python to other virtual machines such as jython jvm ironpython .net pypy and the unladen swallow project moving cpython to an llvm -based representation

1592430
yslow	pagespeed
i am doing a web performance optimization using yslow and pagespeed recomendations but when it comes to file sizes neither says anything about it

1592440
equals	gethashcode	equals	tostring	tostring	gethashcode
i also see equals gethashcode gettype and tostring which are fairly undesirable to expose to the excel user

1592446
post	get
there are simple rules you use get possibly with url parameters for constant things that do not change the server and post for thing that modify the server

1592446
post	put
this allows user agents to represent other methods such as post put and delete in a special way so that the user is made aware of the fact that a possibly unsafe action is being requested

1592446
post	get
there you go get should not change anything post is for thing that change the server unsafe operation

1592446
post	get
then change server post don t change server get

1592446
put	get	post	put	post	get
and since a url can be accessed with any verbs get or post don t put the data that change the server in the url because someone may copy that url do a get and change your server without you knowing

1592452
post	get
then to delete a user i post to this same page except i post a variable instead of doing a get since deleting is a stateful action and should be done with a post

1592481
domxpath	domdocument
if it s really complex then you may want to use domdocument with domxpath but here s a simple example using simplexml

1592521
jobs	cron
all i d like to see are emails for cron jobs where i ve echo d something

1592541
inherited	properties
even though they both inherited from page i can only access the profile properties if i m at the actual page level

1592559
onkeyup	onkeydown
when the activity starts the only keys that onkeydown or onkeyup get called for are the dpad up down left right keys

1592596
mbunit	nunit
you may have a look on pex - it allows to generate tests for nunit mbunit and others

1592610
sudoers	visudo
fixed editing etc sudoers with visudo to add

1592611
salt	md5
md5 md5 password + salt

1592615
spaces	delimiter
since command-line arguments are delimiter by spaces unless the file path is quoted the application perl.exe in this case will see three arguments

1592620
pbkdf2	hash
going forward the only secure password hashing schemes are iterative hash such as bcrypt and pbkdf2

1592623
hash	md5
they do an excellent job of using a long hash unique to each password and running the password through md5 thousands of times

1592635
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
program library self-awareness to solve very specific crash events i often have implemented wrappers on system libraries such as malloc free realloc which extensions that can do things like walk memory detect double frees attempts to free non-allocated pointers check for obvious buffer over-runs etc

1592683
jobs	cron
it is better to schedule php scripts to run as cron jobs that exit within hours or minutes so that memory can be freed

1592696
button	checkbox
i have a big fat search button along with some checkbox for the user to choose what region they want to search in

1592699

post	put
take a look at this newsgroup post with details and sample code for how to put a timeout on socket connections in lunux

1592746
textarea	textbox
i have kept a submit button at the end of the form which on click will submit the actual value of the textbox textarea and even the value for the field of type file upload

1592749
ant	maven
on the build tools side there are ant and maven as the major players

1592749
ant	maven
i prefer ant over maven personally

1592792
tabitem	contentcontrol
since tabitem is a contentcontrol you can present a usercontrol as its content

1592808
firefox	safari
it works to my liking in firefox safari

1592815
pascal	delphi
or you could take a look at fastmm4 - which is open source but in pascal delphi

1592816
public	protected
the recommended practice here is to make this field private and expose it through an externally visible property with a public or protected access modifier

1592847
switching	screens
as the default behavior of ie is to switching to the full screens mode on alt - enter command

1592885
post	get
does the post data still get sent received regardless or is it negotiated before the data is finally sent

1592888
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
specifically you ll want to look at mousedown mouseup and mousemove

1592960
pop-up	dialog
import the icon your want in the pop-up dialog and make sure the id of the icon is the smallest one

1592976
getter	setter
in that case use a private field with a public getter and a private setter

1592983
opera	safari
but for opera and safari it s critical that the css load in the right order because sifr gets wind of the styling as it happens

1592983
opera	safari
so this fixed the weirdness described above in safari and opera but i m still having some mysterious styling issues in opera â but that s another story

1592994
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
use mousedown mousemove and mouseup

1593034
post	get
also to get to grips with the output of profile have a look at this post

1593052
rss	feed
i use django feed framework to organize rss feed for my website

1593061
width	height
so you have to round up your width and height to 512

1593066
libcurl	libssh
looking at the libcurl section on phpinfo i notice that the php installs without scp sftp support do not have a libssh version listed whereas the one with the support says libssh version- libssh2 1.1

1593069
width	margin
retrieves the width of the object including padding but not including margin border or scroll bar

1593131
folder	directory
you might need to make your newfiles folder the current directory so the java vm can find your files

1593164
folder	directory
to list files and folder in a given directory in .net

1593185
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
note however this won t work in opera and i haven t tested in safari google-chrome anything else

1593260
children	parent
the expression uses a regular expression currentpage and tests it against the class of the parent node so the direct children of the element li.currentpage will be set to #eff the other descendants will be set to #ef0

1593294
textblock	itemscontrol
i ve made an itemscontrol which has its datacontext set and shows the data as pairs of checkboxes and textblock

1593306
children	parent
now i d like to gain access to the subset of all parent call it the 2nd set that said children from the 1st set relate to

1593324
inherited	properties
i think that if you set some of your cell s properties to inherited they will inherited those properties from the table row

1593342
coalesce	isnull
isnull and coalesce though equivalent can behave differently

1593342
coalesce	isnull
an expression involving isnull with non-null parameters is considered to be not null while expressions involving coalesce with non-null parameters is considered to be null

1593345
versioning	upgrade
the upgrade patch cannot be installed by the windows installer service because the program to be upgrade is missing or the upgrade patch may update a different versioning of the program.

1593362
serializable	deserialization
this is obviously not required as long as aggregate1 is a struct...this may prove to be useful when you are creating a class struct heirarchy for the express purpose of serializable deserialization with the xmlserializer many seemingly mysterious exceptions will disappear just by using structs in this case

1593393
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
ie8 firefox 3 recent opera and safari google-chrome support postmessage which allows cooperating pages on different domains to talk to each other

1593457
superclass	subclassing
the object on the first line is the superclass this says that myclass is a subclassing of object

1593471
super	self
super myclass self .__init__ args kwargs

1593480
getter	setter
you just specify that there is a property with a getter and a setter whatever they will do

1593480
getter	setter
the compiler will create a field and generate the getter and setter implementation for it

1593497
getter	setter
this could be achieved via __get and __set but the most common implementation is for getting and setting runtime generated properties and it d be a hassle to code pseudo getter and setter for each added property as well as using __set is a no-no in my opinion

1593504
width	height
i know i can use height and width attribute of img tag but i don t know the image size

1593516
width	height
just use height or width

1593538
inherited	properties
i d probably override the class and inherited the properties with a concrete type then serialize that

1593549
width	height
remember also that you can give a percentage of the original width height as value as well for instance

1593683
width	height
you can see the 320 x 240 fillrect doesn t fill the jpanel entirely a border of 10 px width and 30 px height remains

1593684
treemap	treeset
use a treeset or treemap

1593733
pseudo-class	visited
i m not really sure but as far as i remember you have to explicitely declare the link and visited pseudo-class

1593762
cart	oscommerce	opencart	oscommerce
in my opinion if you re looking for lightweight which is hard to define for e-comemrce zen cart oscommerce or opencart would be a good bet

1593763
width	height
before an application can use a memory device context for drawing operations it must select a bitmap of the correct width and height into the device context

1593763
width	height
this may be done by using createcompatiblebitmap to specify the height width and color organization required in the function call

1593823
getter	setter
check that it s a property and that you have protected getter and setter privates will not work since nhibernate will want to proxy the collection for lazyloading

1593827
consistency	acid
well in-memory databases generally lack the d durability in acid atomicity consistency isolation durability by their very nature

1593832
actionscript	mxml
the flex compiler generates a lot of intermediate code to convert mxml files into actionscript you can view those files if you compile with -keep compiler option

1593846
superclass	subclassing
the member variables in your subclassing hide the variables in the superclass

1593953
libjpeg	libtiff
to manipulate jpeg files use libjpeg the tiff files use libtiff etc

1593953
gif	png
another easy option is gd which allows manipulation of many image formats png jpeg gif ...

width	height
which makes sense as the rectangle has 10px less width and 30px less height

1593971
width	height
if you set the same width height

1593979
width	height
frame.setsize width height

1594004
keydown	keyup
the technical answer is that the keydown and keyup event is intercepted before it reaches the js layer by the application

1594004
keydown	keyup
just as you can return true or false in an event to prevent propagation the application stops propagation of the keydown and keyup events to scripting interfaces outside of its trusted domain eg

1594013
writetofile	nsdata
the modern way is to create nsdata from the root object|dictionary then write that data to the desired path using writetofile options error or writetourl options error

1594041
filesystems	ntfs
well a problem with uppercase letters would be that some filesystems like ntfs ignore them and treat filename.txt and filename.txt as the same file whereas other filesystems ext for example i think thinks of these as 2 different files

1594041
filesystems	ntfs
so if you have some reference to a file that you called file.txt and the reference points to the file file.txt then on ntfs this would be no problem but if you copy the files to a filesystems like ext the reference would fail because the filesystems thinks there is no such file as file.txt

1594052
lxml	elementtree
i have to write an xml file using python standard modules not using elementtree lxml etc the metadata is a saml identity provider metadata and is of the form -

cassini	iis
although this may be running on the same machine the server here is the iis cassini process that serves up your webpage to the client your browser

1594081
cassini	iis
in order to stop this you ll need to stop shutdown the iis or cassini cassini small web server used by visual studio when running a web app on your local development machine or stop shutdown the sql server process

1594240
maven	cargo
to me cargo shouldn t fail and this is likely a bug in cargo s maven 2 plugin or in the core api that should handle this case gracefully

1594323
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
no problems in any version of firefox opera google-chrome safari or ie8

1594325
hide	show
provide an id to the select element and find the selected element and check its value to 1 and show hide the appropriate div

1594357
hide	show
i have a control that i want to show hide depending on the value of a boolean

1594387
int	double
in fact this lambda expression will even fit a delegate that takes an int and returns a double because the result of the lambda a is implicitly convertible to double

1594481
post	get
check the kind of data http headers you are sending with your get post request and try to make it similar to a web browser s my web browser can view the page

1594540
multiplying	division	multiplying	multiplication	division	multiplication
as a fast alternative to multiplication division or on architectures that cannot multiplying divide look at example below

1594540
division	multiplication
in fact software multiplication division implementations are often based upon shifts

1594541
boost	blitz++
but have a look at blitz++ newmat and boost solutions that eliminate temporary objects thanks to expression templates -- c++0x s rvalue references will simplify et solution

1594659
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i have tested the following in ie firefox google-chrome and safari

1594687
int	boolean
- this allows you to use one int variable to store a number of boolean values in a compact and efficient manner

1594687
int	boolean
this can often be used to make code much more efficient pass one 32-bit int instead of an array of 32 boolean as a parameter

1594692
width	height
for example if the original image has a height of 300px and a width of 200px and the img.height property is set to 75

1594692

and public and protected are in the same folder

1594709
jar	war
ear enterprise archive files contain the war files along with the jar files containing code

1594716
division	multiplication
one as an alternate way to do integer multiplication and division

1594723
jar	war
in j2ee application modules are packaged as ear jar and war based on their functionality

1594723
jar	.war
web modules which contain servlet class files jsp files supporting files gif and html files are packaged as jar file with .war web archive extension

1594723
jar	.war
all above files .jar and .war are packaged as jar file with .ear enterprise archive extension and deployed into application server

1594724
jar	war
it is also a jar file it has a special directory called app-inf that contains the application.xml file and it contains jar and war files

1594757

width and height are the known dimensions of the supposedly 2-dimensional array

1594758
updatepanel	scriptmanager
problem started showing up after i moved the scriptmanager to a master page - and only when i was using pages with no updatepanel

1594803
g++	gcc
i m developing a multithreaded program running on linux compiled with g++ 4.3 and if you search around for a bit you find a lot of scary stories about std string not being thread-safe with gcc

1594818
jar	war
a web container requires the web module to be packaged as a war file - that is a special jar file with a web.xml file in the web-inf folder

1594818
jar	war
enterprise applications may consist of one or more modules that can either be web modules packaged as a war file or ejb modules packaged as a jar file or both of them

1594818
jar	war
basically ear files are a superset containing war files and jar files

submit	submission
i use a separate internal tool at vmware for submission to our perforce servers so i haven t used git p4 submit though.

1594979
inherited	subclassing
i have a base class that declares a virtual function and a large set of subclassing that inherited from the class some of which may override the function

1595016
boxlayout	miglayout
if you re able you may want to check out the miglayout but boxlayout is also easy to use and in the java toolkit already

1595023
width	height
you can set the height or width to the size you want

1595023
width	height
if you use 2 you can set both the height and width

1595030
for-loop	arrays
but the for-loop is too slow as it takes 2 seconds to convert a 76800 x 1 arrays

1595044
int	double
754 double contain 53 bits of precision so on input the computer strives to convert 0.1 to the closest fractions it can of the form where j is an int containing exactly 53 bits

1595058

now i upgrade the os versioning and tried to compile the code in xcode 3.2 but the app crashes with an error

1595103
wordpress	joomla
try joomla drupal or wordpress

1595104
profiling	benchmarking
this is close to what we d hoped for based on the benchmarking and the profiling referred to in the question

1595123
public	protected
i generally think everything that s either public or protected should be documented as that s the api your class is providing protected is part of the api you give to anyone who s going to extend your class

1595123
getter	setter
for some methods it can be overkill when the method is simple enough like simple getter and setter

1595125
domxpath	domdocument

1595217
post	get
i have searched many blog post but could not get any solution

1595230
onkeydown	onblur
i suppose if you really wanted to use tabs you could do an onblur event handler which just gave focus back to the window and an onkeydown event handler that inserted 4 spaces whenever the tab key was pressed

1595242
public	protected
the solution i normally choose is that i create a specialized class inside my unit test that exposes these protected methods as public

1595251
typedef	struct
typedef struct no

1595279
gridview	repeater
if you use a repeater instead of a gridview you will have much more control over the rendered output.

1595299
int	chars
voiceremoval chars buf int bytes int bps int nch

1595321
public	protected
later tests for code that uses the refactored methods via the public methods of specializations also test the code -- in this case that the public methods of the specialization work properly when using the common protected methods

1595326
superclass	subclassing
your case is a bit different in that your class is intended to be used as a superclass so testing it via a subclassing makes a lot of sense since the class isn t intended to stand on its own

1595328
bluetooth	usb
a little more expensive are the omap3530 eval board from logicpd which i believe has wifi bluetooth and usb hw on the board

1595329
updatepanel	scriptmanager
none of our web.configs are leet they are just normal although we do use scriptmanager and updatepanel

i have a view set up with an image in it but when i add it to the scroll view i only get a black rectangle no matter what i put in the view i add

1595410
charindex	substr
you can do this with fewer cascading ctes but i find the substr charindex len syntax can quickly become very difficult to read and debug

1595425
public	protected
for instance if you are inside folder protected code and you need to access folder public content main.css you would use the path .. .. public content main.css

1595442
free	malloc
malloc and free are implemented in the c library rather than the operating system itself

1595460

ubuntu	linux
my system is linux ubuntu 9.04 with default python 2.6

1595494
udp	tcp
tcp ethernet udp and i ll get around to things like ftp but i m pretty sure ftp is built on top of tcp as is http

1595536
mef	prism
mef and prism serve two very distinct goals

1595536
mef	prism
in this respect it s filling the same goal as unity does within prism and in fact you could pretty easily rework prism to use mef instead of unity

equals	gethashcode
i also see equals gethashcode

1595657

getter	setter
this includes getter setter as well

1595658
getter	setter
failed to hit on one of my key points just alluded to it with the getter setter

1595704
subtraction	addition
i can t use anything more than basic addition and subtraction and string parsing functions

1595720
subtract	add
you need to parse the string and come up with a list of values for example year month day hour minute second and then do other-base math to add and subtract

1595739
subtract	add
just add or subtract the amount of time to from your number of seconds representation

1595743
inherited	subclassing
this can be achieved using inherited along with the template method pattern calling abstract or virtual methods in a base class which are overridden in subclassing to achieve the desired new behavior but it s more often demonstrated using composition using the strategy pattern encapsulating the variant behavior in class and passing it to the closed type to be used in determining the overall behavior achieved

1595744
invokelater	invokeandwait
i would expect therefore that it would be thread-safe and that you wouldn t need to wrap the call in an invokelater or an invokeandwait

1595745
inherited	subclassing
you can create your own asp image control by subclassing image that knows how to check a certain inherited structure to find the image

1595844

1595894
appfuse	spring
i ve found that the tutorials for the appfuse framework are a great way to get aquainted with the basic features of spring

1595900
subnet	packets
from there an attacker can inject blindly whatever message he needs but in this case since the connection is not plain html but an ssl stream which involves exchange of info like keys etc and given that the attacker cant see since the injection is done blindly at least unless its in the same subnet and can sniff the packets .

1595945
put	get
i m trying to create an mjpeg stream i have a series of jpegs that i want to put together into a stream so that a user can just hit a url and get an mjpeg stream

private dictionary string string map new dictionary string string

1596068
gridview	objectdatasource
i have a a gridview attached to an objectdatasource

1596121

i think this is more common because in c# they don t have implements and extends to refer class vs interface inheritance

1596125
activemq	rabbitmq
there s a comparison between rabbitmq and activemq here

1596134
outputstream	inputstream
in java socket you will be given a set of inputstream and outputstream simple so that you can read data from and send data to your peer

1596151
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
if the clientaccesspolicy.xml is either not found the web request returns a 404 status code returned with an unexpected mime-type is not valid xml or has an invalid root node then the silverlight runtime will issue a request for a for the flash policy file with a name of crossdomain.xml at the root of the requested target domain using the http protocol.

uninstall	upgrade
you can make an msi that will do the upgrade for you by uninstall the product if it is installed this way you will basically only need to run the msi and it will take care for everything

1596379
automake	autotools
it s the same sort of script often commonly found among projects that use the gnu build system -- also known as just the gnu autotools or for each tool individually as autoconf automake and libtool

1596379
scons	automake
think of scons as an improved cross-platform substitute for the classic make utility with integrated functionality similar to autoconf automake and compiler caches such as ccache

1596379
scons	autotools
spray spray is a build tool helping you in configuring building and installing your project it is similar in purpose to the autotools or cmake but created following the spirit of scons and waf using the python programming language

1596389
hide	show
your method is using css to show hide the content which means that it is going to be visible to a spider

1596389

slideup	slidedown
i m currently using jquery with a gridview table and it s lagging and lagging making the slideup slidedown unusable

1596432

i would like to know a good syntax for c++ getter and setter

1596440
ubuntu	freebsd
since those two oses don t have an libraries in common i ll probably be installing something from source and hopefully submitting packages to the ubuntu and freebsd folks if i have time

1596460
apache	nginx
for example in ruby on rails you can use web servers apache nginx and run ruby interpreters behind those which in fact will process html with embedded ruby code inside

1596487
getter	setter
getter and setter are not oo

1596509
rational-numbers	integer
as documented integer division yields rational-numbers

1596516
getter	setter
+1 on questioning the use of setter and getter

1596517
mkmapview	mapkit
if you re relying on mapkit and are using mkmapview s user-location update mechanism then take a look at my response to this question and implement the observer section observevalueforkeypath to be notified when the map has a location success or implement mkmapviewdelegate s mapviewdidfailloadingmap to be notified if there was an error

1596546
post	get
when i recreate the login screen locally and perform the same https post that the online login screen performs i get the error 422 - unprocessable entity

the problem is cvcanny can only handle ipl_depth_8s or u signed unsigned short or at least that s what i suspect

1596691
unsigned	short
casting my float32 to unsigned short wouldn t help much since the values would loose their precision and i would miss edges with opencvs canny

1596736
comparator	icomparer
the error i was getting was icomparer or the comparator methods it relies upon did not return zero when array.sort called x

1596743
forth	smalltalk
definitely try haskell or smalltalk or forth

1596743
forth	smalltalk
i would say smalltalk would be most useful while forth would get you away from the x86 asm and c bullshit

1596826
folder	directory
select the directory you ve checked out the repository to and i recommend using the create folder references option instead of the recursively create groups option because added and removed items will be automatically reflected in a folder reference but not in a group

1596938
stdout	stderr	stdout	stdio
if you try to clone stdout and stderr for a program that runs without a console ie it is started with wperl instead of perl you won t be able to get data through stdio

hide	show
to ensure you execute something after an effect like hide or show use a callback

1598149
hide	show
show and hide are actually animation effects but when no arguments are passed they use an instant duration

1598149
hide	show
thus what you really should be using is a callback off of the hide call to trigger a callback function which calls append and then show

1598180
listview	gridview
in contrast to the listview gridview the wpf datagrid control does not follow this convention by default

1598236
hex	binary
looking at the file in a hex editor they obviously have different regions which are delimited somehow looks like typical binary saved structs

1598263
ready	each
check each 3rd party component set to make sure they re at least ready for delphi 2009...better yet 2010

1598268
gif	png
i wish to dynamically generate a google maps overlay that will consist of a single transparent gif png image with multiple dots on various locations

1598281
postgresql	mysql
super smack is a benchmarking stress testing and load generation tool for mysql and postgresql

1598305
ienumerable	ienumerator
you can also return an ienumerable instead of an ienumerator without chaning anything but the return type

1598310
x86	64bit
as long as the program expanding the environment variable your build tool is 32-bit programfiles will expand to x program files on a 32-bit os and to x program files x86 on a 64bit os

1598368
int	double
both c# and java have primitive or value types int double float etc.

1598368
int	boolean	int	double
double double int int bool boolean etc

1598368
int	double
for instance double is an alias for system.double and int is an alias for system.int32

1598381
hide	show
you have to use callback if you want to queue the other methods run after the show hide thing like sixten otto has said

1598381
hide	show
the animation of show hide will not wait for append method to execute

1598392
children	parent
i have a parent class called vehicle and a couple of children classes car truck suv

1598403
put	get
i get the following warning in a asp.net project using the tag to put a .swf

1598429
strncmp	strcmp
be cautious about using strncmp instead of strcmp which was suggested in one answer

1598434
strncmp	strcmp	strncmp	memcmp	memcmp	strcmp
note also the functions strncmp and memcmp which are similar to strcmp but are safer

1598447
post	get
one caveat is that paras only sniffs http get post requests using the method above so to sniff all network traffic try the following

1598475
pop-up	dialog
the best you can do is to capture the user leaving the page and pop-up a dialog asking them if they re sure they want to

1598496
elementtree	beautifulsoup
you can also use abiword wvware to convert word document to xhtml and then parse it with beautifulsoup elementtree etc

1598513
width	height
i think that it is called twice because the height and width changes

1598558
getter	setter
i m more interested in testing the behaviour of the architecture instead of the getter setter

1598587
spyware	antivirus
whenever the your website loading funny external script like adware spyware your antivirus will alert you

1598627
prepare	execute
prepare queries are more efficient when you execute a query multiple times and also obviate the need to sanitize user input

1598643
setinterval	settimeout
evaluating code by using eval and its relatives function settimeout and setinterval is considered dangerous because they will execute the code you pass with the privileges of the caller and almost all the times there is a workaround to avoid them

1598720
children	parent
you can t use the condition in the threaded call since it would only find results that match that condition parent and children

1598764
client-side	server-side
while not really a console skulpt.org runs python code client-side with no plugins or anything which makes it a lot faster than a server-side prompt

1598770
width	height
you don t have to be a wizard but some basic knowledge will enable you to do things like create image sprites from the mockup and get information relating to the width height color etc of the different components in the design

1598812
pull	push
you can pull and push against an svn server

1598823
daemons	systemd
parts of the systemd are stand-alone command line or daemons processes

1598847
perl	tcl
git s core is written in c and should be faster than mercurial s and tools written in sh perl tcl and uses standard gnu utils

1598847
pull	push
they basic command sets are very similar init clone add status commit push pull etc.

1598863
memcpy	strncpy	memcpy	strcpy	strcpy	strncpy
this is a good strategy - it has low overhead and it actually generates some efficient code compare to strcpy which has to check for the end of the string and has no way of knowing how many iterations it must make and poor confused strncpy which has to check both - both can be slower and either could be sped up by using memcpy if you happen to have already calculated the string s length for some reason

1598884
post	put
using traditional post you could put all the html content in the value attribute of an input type hidden in your page named html_content or something like that and when the user clicks in the button save you send your user to another page with a link do the file

1598884
post	put
using ajax you just need to do an ajax post passing this variable and then your script returns a download link and you dynamically put it in your html - without reloading your page like it was only cliente side

1598918
width	height
you can find out the actual pixel height and width from the imagesource

1598941
ethernet	wireless
i could do an endless timer checking isinetoffline but i would prefer a hook callback that tells me when i plug unplug the ethernet network cable or connect to wireless internet

1598945
ubuntu	linux
actually i m trying to upload the image file and i m using ubuntu linux machine

1598994
cout	cin
as cin and cout are usually tied calling an input function for std cin will cause std cout to be flushed in any case so you may as well put a n into your prompt string and save on the verbose extra operators

1599014
jquery	jqmodal
a lightweight alternative to jquery ui s dialogs is jqmodal

1599030
int	chars	int	double
the function below would only stream chars or strings into the stringstream but not anything else int double float etc. in fact the fail flag is set if i attempt to convert for example an int into a string

1599030
int	chars	int	double
tested for int double float not working chars and strings working

1599077
innodb	myisam
it would work on tables which use table-level locking myisam but on innodb etc it could deadlock or produce duplicate keys i think depending on the isolation level in use

1599093
filehandle	freopen
freopen returns a filehandle but it s the previous value before we put it in binary mode so don t use it for anything

1599142
int	chars	int	double
variables like int chars double .

1599156
accessor	ivar
if you do need an ivar i cannot stress enough how important it is to always use accessor for them and never access them directly

1599176
int	double
when i started oo programming many years ago i gained the impression that variables if that is the right word were either primitives int double etc. or first-class objects string jpane etc.

1599216
onchange	onblur
for a text input i can add an event handler for onblur and onchange

1599223
int	double
for example the int32 class wraps the int data type and the double class wraps the double data type

1599223
int	double
for instance int is the short name for system.int32 and double is the short form of system.double

1599226
inherited	properties
instead you have structs vs classes but structs share many of the features of classes such as the ability to have properties and methods and inherited from the object class as well

1599309
itext	jpedal
you could also look at icesoft itext jpedal and multivalent who offer open source pdf tools

1599332
folder	directory
i can t find any way to do this apart from make the et folder a virtual directory which i don t really want to do

1599446
qdockwidget	qwidget
subclassing qwidget and then having a private qdockwidget attribute of course does make sense but it will probably not help you for implementing your own dock widget as long as i understand it correctly

1599461
elf	coff
your program won t run on another os also because there are different file formats for executables for example win has coff pe linux has the elf file format just like any other file format this also contains meta data the html or sgml file format

1599466
equals	gethashcode
but it calls only gethashcode and doesn t call equals

1599495
vb.net	vb6
there s no need to do obsessive cleaning in vb.net or in vb6

1599495
vb.net	vb6
api calls in vb6 are the equivalent of unmanaged code in vb.net - both need extreme care especially in releasing resources

1599502
qmainwindow	qdockwidget
the reason is that you most probably want your class to be a variation of a qdockwidget is-a relationship meaning that it should have all its public methods and its instances should be able to passed to methods asking qdockwidget instances for example you want to be able to add one to a qmainwindow

1599519
win64	windows
a win64 binary on the other hand is in pe format too but windows 2000 will reject it

1599528
sorting	grouping
i was able to get this row to always appear at the buttom of the grid using custom grouping sorting

1599535
qobject	qwidget
for instance a qwidget is-a qobject

1599581
put	get
i put a onworkflowitemchanged and i want to get the value of the column which is changed

1599597
joomla	phpbb
i know joomla and phpbb and other mysql intensive applications use caching so as to not make as many mysql queries so this is what got me thinking

1599613
int	double
in c# int double etc. keywords are basically aliases for those struct s

1599622
mp3	wav
now i m asking myself where can i find free icons wav and small mp3 files which can be used in my applications

1599646
filtering	grouping
also join predicates and filtering predicates are physically grouping together in the where clause which can cause them to be confused for one another

1599687
pull	push
push pull to from client with slight delay

1599702
min	max
i have a windows console application written in c++ and want to hide remove the complete title bar of the console window including the close min max controls etc

1599709
button	checkbox
button checkbox fileupload layer password radio reset select submit text textarea window

1599838
button	checkbox
now i d like to have the checkbox bound to a property of my model so that i can then trigger an action with a link or a button so that only the selected items are sent to the controller

1599872
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i tried this code in my server it works perfectly i get my name and picture with the fb logo i tried it in ie8 google-chrome 4.0 safari 3.21 and firefox 3.5 all with success

1599901
post	get
even you can use jquery to post the value to php and get the ajax response within a single line of code like below

1599930
jgit	egit
instead of language bindings there are partial or complete reimplementations of git in other languages some of those are partially reimplementations and partially wrappers around git commands jgit java used by egit eclipse git plugin grit ruby dulwich python git# c#

1599935
jobs	cron
ps i don t want to explode my script and make 2 cron jobs one every day the other evevery x day x

1599940
pop-up	dialog
to match classes so you are looking for an element with id pop-up and class dialog

1599945
versioning	upgrade
i thought i could avoid all these issues if the upgrade code would perform the conversion directly on the user.config file but i found no easy way to get the location of the user.config of the previous versioning since localfilesettingsprovider.getpreviousconfigfilename bool is a private method

1599983
bazaar	git	bazaar	cvs
any linux box can support subersion git mercurial bazaar cvs and more you just have to install any linux distribution and configure each service

1599989
sorting	grouping
but the grouping also allows to do some sorting as it implements a compareto-method

1600035
versioning	upgrade
this may not really be the answer you are looking for but it sounds like you are overcomplicating the problem by trying to manage this as an upgrade where you aren t going to continue to support the old versioning

1600035
versioning	upgrade
when the user upgrade to the new versioning the age is still stored so when you access the dateofbirth field you just check if a dateofbirth exists and if it doesn t you calculate it from the age and save it so when you next access it it already has a date of birth and the age field can be ignored

1600177
executable	upx
upx is an excellent compression utility for dlls and executable

1600183
translation	localization
the tool helps you easily manage translation of your resources by letting translators work on a single localization project file and creating the satellite dlls right-away from the translation

1600218
mouseleave	mouseenter
i have added event handlers to the mypopupanchor element for the events mouseenter and mouseleave

1600327
hide	show
easiest way is to add a uiactivityindicatorview on top of your navigation bar and show hide it as needed

1600329
post	get
others will post nicer cleaner answers but this will get you started

1600403
for-loop	loops
you could put it in your coding standard that for loops should be used only when the full for-loop construct is followed the index must be initialized in the initializer section the index must be tested in the loop-test section and the value of the index must only be altered in the counting expression section

1600421
implements	extends
and by the way extends abstractlist takes away most of the boring work of implements a list

1600441
google-chrome	safari
this is different from non-ie browsers where external requests from xhr -loaded documents are allowed or don t exist like in safari and google-chrome

1600442
postgresql	mysql
mysql is probably the rdbms most used with rails and hence the most supported but i use postgresql which is also very well supported and have had no issues with using it

1600484
put	get
the error message says only get put and delete requests are allowed

1600485
free	malloc
if you are using low level malloc free brk etc to implement new and delete you may reserve an overhead area and return the followed right usable area to the user too just as gnu c ++

1600486
hash	salt
if you control the message content you can perform simple authentication and validation by placing your data between some sort of begin and end lines and appending a salt hash

1600507
qkeysequence	qabstractbutton
it seems the only method is qabstractbutton setshortcut const qkeysequence key

1600508
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
by the way firefox google-chrome and opera all opens blank targets in tabs by default.

1600514
opera	safari
it also has improved css load detection which is disabled by default but helps in making sifr replace elements faster in safari and opera

1600531
textmate	scite
most ror developers use a simple text editor textmate on macos scite on windows - mostly because most features refactoring code completion of ides designed for languages like java c# can t be applied that easily on a dynmic language like ruby

1600531
postgresql	mysql
mysql and postgresql might be the best choices since they are the most used ones so you can hope for continuous support

1600561
typedef	typename
that typedef defining barbar is one that requires a typename in order for the compiler to be able to check the template for blatant syntactic errors before it is instantiated with a concrete type

1600582
int	chars
move the chars in question to the chars field and then your un-signed int field will have the ebcdic value you need

1600582
int	chars
you can get fancier by having a larger chars field and have an array of 1-byte un-signed int in the same place like this

1600582
int	chars
for each byte in the chars field assign its memory address to the pointer assigned to your 1-byte un-signed int field

1600586
division	multiplication
if your division instruction is not fast enough but the multiplication instruction is you can use the following technique and it sounds as if this is the technique you re after

1600586
multiplying	division
you can exploit this by realizing that division by a number n is the same as multiplying by 2 32 n then taking the more significant 32 bits of the result

1600593
division	multiplication
a division of an integer by an integer constant can be replaced with a combination of a shift and a multiplication

1600612
public	protected
as a user of the class you usually just need the public interface if you derive you need also the protected interface only if you are changing the class itself you need to look at the private stuff

1600631
folder	directory
i m currently trying to write a small service to delete one directory and all the files contained within it there is one issue which i don t know how to resolve which is that the users don t have persmissions to access the folder or update it so i m trying to run the delete as an administrator from within ad

1600707
interpolation	splines
a simple way of doing extrapolations is to use interpolation polynomials or splines there are many routines for this in scipy.interpolate and there are quite easy to use just give the x y points and you get a function a callable precisely

1600707
interpolation	splines
however i encourage you to play with the polynomial or splines interpolation from scipy.interpolate to see whether the results you obtain suit you

1600760
strcpy	strncpy
look into strcpy or strncpy or you can copy using for loops

1600835
for-loop	loops
now every time this loops is hit there is only one comparison instead of two on a one-core machine with a for-loop the condition is true for i 0 false for i 1 whereas the do while is false all the time

1600836
many-to-many	one-to-many
to quote from this page a many-to-many relationship is really two one-to-many relationships with a junction link table

1600836
button	checkbox
there are 2 ways of doing this - either add a checkbox to every row in your table and have one button labeled add relationships to selected rows wording needs improvement

1600840
implements	extends
login.html should be mapped to your logincontroller.java which extends basecontroller and implements a login method which takes at least a httpservletrequest and model as parameters

1600844
ienumerable	ienumerator
why do we need custom collection and custom enumeration by implementing ienumerable and ienumerator i know what ienumerable and ienumerator does and how to implement them

1600847
portrait	landscape
the problem is that my application is design for landscape mode and the camera control can only show in portrait mode

1600926
ienumerable	ienumerator
generics are quite powerful so i haven t had the need to write a brand new class that implements ienumerable and ienumerator in a long time

1600927
firefox	safari
on my top navigation i m trying to center everything it looks centered on firefox ie safari but on safari on mac it s not centered so i wanted to give it left margin that could only be visible on safari for mac

1600930
mouse	keyboard
without it you wouldn t get mouse keyboard or other system events

1600940
public	protected
don t create a private protected public member variable of these types instead create the formatters parsers in the methods where you need them

1600951
implements	extends
that s a very handy way to extends a class without having to define and implements whole new classes

1600953
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this bug is not present on the mac which runs java 1.5 but on windows running 1.6 - including ie firefox google-chrome safari but not opera strangely

1600988
ienumerable	ienumerator
of built-in collection class options that you can derive from you should very very rarely have to implement ienumerator or ienumerable yourself anymore

1600988
ienumerable	ienumerator
so in the great majority of cases a custom collection class should not implement ienumerable and ienumerator itself it should derive from one of the existing built-in collection classes that already do that for you

1601017
swt	swing
everything from swing to swt to j2me to blackberry to iphone includes this concept

1601033
ordinals	difference
declaring ordinals types const makes no difference because they are copied anyway call-by-value so any changes to the variable do not affect the original variable

1601124
atomic	interlocked
you need to understand the reason to avoid cargo-cult programming. marking strings as const makes a performance difference because you no longer need to use an interlocked increment and decrement of the refcount on the string an operation that actually becomes more expensive not less as time goes by because more cores means more work that has to be done to keep atomic operations in sync

1601126
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i do not have a mac to test on but this css seems to do the trick in safari google-chrome firefox opera and internet explorer on windows

1601220
vim	emacs
it took me ages to figure discover that the version of ctags that is preinstalled on my system was the emacs one and didn t have the --recurse option but now that i ve run ctags-exuberant on my copy of the openjdk sources to attempt to get some kind of code completion going vim hangs whenever i try to invoke it with c-n or c-p

1601283
mvp	presenter
it s a mvp framework for windows form which allows you to do dependency injection of your presenter in your view

1601300
document.write	window.open
you can open a new window window.open and write the content of the inner document stream programmatically using document.write

1601339
apache	nginx
using a more efficient web server like nginx to handle static file serving and then reverse proxy app requests to a separate apache instance

1601339
apache	nginx
implement php with fastcgi on top of nginx using something like php-fpm getting rid of apache entirely

1601341
post	get
now what i need to do is get related records for a post in a single query

1601341
post	get
it s easy to join one table and get related post but when it comes to different tables.

1601419
udp	tcp
for best efficiency you can design your own protocol on top of tcp ip using tcp or even udp and maybe even compress the data on the fly if network load is a big issue

1601438
moq	nmock
i m sorry but i ve never used nunit.mocks - but i do have some experience with nmock and moq which by the way i highly recommend

1601469
codeigniter	cakephp
cakephp s and codeigniter s communities are among the most helpful

1601476
public	protected
for example make methods and fields public protected and remove final

1601585
war	manifest.mf
just to add to the information here in case of a war file the meta-inf manifest.mf file provides the developer a facility to initiate a deploy time check by the container which ensures that the container can find all the classes your application depends on

1601610
opera	firefox
in this case it works in opera but not firefox

1601611
subnet	packets
you need to send the packets to the router of the other subnet so that it can get delivered

1601621
arp	tcp
in that case you can send an arp request and then send the packet to the mac address you get the reply from and it will arrive at host 2 - the same way tcp ip packets are usually sent over ethernet to hosts on the same network

1601646
decimal	ieee
i m performing some data type conversions where i need to represent uint long ulong and decimal as ieee 754 double floating point values

1601648
bmp	png
the scanned image is saved locally on the user s computer as a bmp jpg tif png file

1601661
int	double
double x will convert x from an int to a double

1601661
int	double
so int double x converts form an int to a double and then back

1601661
int	double
essentially the code is checking that the conversion to double is reversible and therefore that the double can store the exact value of the int

1601752
post	get
trying to hide the url for example by doing a post instead of a get to the image-generating page is just security by obscurity which is not a good idea

1601770
google-chrome	firefox
this works perfectly on firefox and google-chrome but on ie tried it on 6 7 and 8 it works only the first time after that it won t show the message

1601783
int	double
ieee 754 double has 52 bits for mantissa and you are converting from to int long so it quite easy to test

1601783
int	double
if your int consume less than 52 bits then it should be convertible without problem to ieee 754 double

1601783
int	double
so for sure int can fit in double without any problem both sign and unsign

1601791
strcpy	strncpy
i am trying to understand the difference disadvantages of strcpy and strncpy

1601792
junit	cactus
cactus api let you warp up junit test for servlets struts web app

1601792
junit	cactus
you can also run coverage tools like emma that let you know what percentage of the code is covered by your junit cactus tests

1601804
stdout	stderr
this option must be set to true to allow the parent to specify stdin stdout and stderr handles for the child in the startupinfo parameter

1601813
copying	overwrite
when you copy from src to dest it continues copying past the end of dest and overwrite part of src

1601879
uilabel	uibutton
you will connect your uikit related instance variables uilabel uibutton etc. in interface builder and therefore won t have to instantiate those objects in your initializer

1601915
x86	mips
i don t have a mips system lying around but on my x86 loonix box i tried #include and discovered that # is the comment character so i tried .include and that worked as soon as i quoted the file name .include something.i

1601930
actionscript	mxml
what the question says i want to use compc either command-line or ant to build a .swc from some actionscript and mxml code

1601930
flexunit	cairngorm
when i set up the flexunit cairngorm mock-as3 and hamcrest-as3 libraries as rsl libraries with the .swf location set to something that exists i get a runtime failure

1601938
ubuntu	debian
if you did go with debian you could most likely do all your development on ubuntu and then push to your embedded system

1601992
put	get	post	put	post	get
edit2 like jersey i am looking for rest support post get delete put

1602028
int	boolean
this includes going to and from boolean int floats and strings as required

1602078
google-chrome	firefox
ie 8 google-chrome firefox work fine

1602093
kerberos	ntlm
the problem we re seeing is every now and again on a refresh the token drops from kerberos down to ntlm

1602108
client-side	server-side
if a server-side control is hidden it doesn t render anything to the client-side markup

1602198
erd	entity-relationship
however if you re planning to invest some money toward erd tool spend it on entity-relationship studio

1602229
getter	setter
100 test coverage gui testing testing getter setter or other no-logic code etc

1602270
config	ini
i ve decided to use ini file to store simple key-value pair config for my java application

1602321
pull	push
2 - when i want to work on the code at work i m confused how do i go about making commits to the local repo on my work desktop and then at the end of the day push my changes to the bare repo on my vps so that i can pull the updates to my home desktop

1602352
accessor	properties
i am trying to see what the value of ball.center.x is at a certain point but because center is a properties accessor selector i don t get the value when i hover over it in the xcode debugger

1602378
hash	md5
the simplest renaming scheme would be to calculate an md5 hash of the filename and not of the file itself which is what md5sum does

1602384
unix	bsd
like mach and most bsd unix systems

1602386
interpreted-language	forth
as others have mentioned forth is an interpreted-language that has been used in a number of embedded environments as well as in quite a few bootloaders

google-chrome	firefox
if the page is served as text html then firefox and google-chrome the only two i ve checked in won t recognise the xml namespaces necessary for the svg to work

1602419
fast-forward	merge
if you leave some uncomitted changes you can finish commit before git pull but then you wouldn t get fast-forward but a merge

1602426
pull	push
you can then push to and pull from it on each computer when necessary simply using git push and git pull

1602427
m2e	pom.xml	maven	m2e	maven	pom.xml
the m2e plugin manages all the dependencies defined in the maven pom.xml file automatically

1602438
uiview	subviews
guys please note that i am not dealing a uiview and adding a tableview as its subviews but i am dealing with a uitableview

1602449
versioning	upgrade
that is to say if you upgrade the file to a new versioning it will not work with the old deserializer

1602467
ivar	subclassing
if you re subclassing uitableviewcontroller you get a tableview for free no ivar or nib required however since you re using a background i would stick with ib

1602478
folder	directory
i just added two new directory registration and openauthid in the main templates folder

1602507
serializable	deserialization
serializable and deserialization into an xml file c#

1602583
stdout	stderr
the most likely culprit is that unison is sending some output to stderr instead of just stdout

1602583
stdout	stderr
popen takes an additional stderr argument so you can try capturing that instead of or in addition to stdout

1602648
int	chars	int	boolean	int	double
for the primitives data types boolean byte short chars int float long double the shape is the size in bytes it uses or in bits here 1 byte 8 bits

1602648
int	chars
now you might assign an int 32 bits to a chars 16 bits or to a short 16 bits the problem would be that if the value holds than 16 bits 131 071 for instance

1602651
superclass	subclassing
you should use the proper constructor based on the subclassing you want to create instead of calling the superclass constructor and assigning type manually

1602663
wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe
if you re using wcf you shouldn t be using wsdl.exe but svcutil.exe instead

1602663
wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe
however from your code sample it would appear as if you re using the xml serializer and not the datacontractserializer - probably because you used wsdl.exe instead of svcutil.exe

1602666
boost	stl
the basic stl boost data structures should work but threading with boost could be a problem

1602680
int	chars
will also give an error because c + i will result in an int 32 bits and assigning it to a chars 16 bits may cause loss of precision

1602719
public	protected
if using a helper to expose protected members you have to declare the helper in the same unit that you use it unless you expose a public method which exposes the required protected members

1602731
sse	avx
this is an interesting development given that their 4-way simd sse instruction set is about to be joined by 8-way avx and 16-way larrabee instructions and in the interests of portability it ll likely be much better to code with an abstraction like valarray than say intrinsics

struts	stripes	struts	wicket	wicket	stripes
struts stripes wicket spring mvc

1602806
webkit	gecko
if you do have control over the computer or can instruct the user to install an application you d be best suited by building an actual application with embedded webkit or gecko

1602819
hide	show
you can also add some effects in the show hide through jquery s effects

1602824
hash	md5
md5 hash for the words

1602880
hash	salt
the password is going to be hash and salt anyway and

1602880
hash	salt
again it s going to be hash and salt so db size is not an issue

1602880
hash	salt
so the conclusion is even if you hash salt the password short passwords are still a risk

1602917
hash	salt
if your passwords are properly hash and salt rainbow tables are a non-issue incidentally

1602974
int	chars
the problem with ordering is that atoi is only reading the int ie it stops at the . chars

1602981
hash	md5
a hash function can be as simple as add 13 to the input or complex like a cryptographic hash such as md5 or sha1

1603088
postgresql	mysql
the advantage of mysql and postgresql is of course the starting price of 0 which is pretty nice in a usual self-funded startup

1603119
mouseleave	mouseenter
i want to bind handlers for mouseenter and mouseleave to a set of elements grabbed using the jquery selector

1603119
firefox	safari
this actually works fine on mac win firefox safari but on ie6 and ie8 only the first element grabbed by the selector displays the desired behavior

1603120
versioning	upgrade
you can start with the free sql server express edition and later if you need you can upgrade to the full versioning which supports clustering etc

1603122
min	max
you can also control the min and max number of threads in the thread pool by using setminthreads and setmaxthreads

1603127
postgresql	mysql
mysql i postgresql

1603130
cpu	processors	cpu	hyperthreading	processors	hyperthreading
kernels are constantly being updated based on new processors technology single cpu per socket to hyperthreading to multiple cores per sockets

1603138
daemons	launchd
cron is a common name for a gnu linux daemons that periodically launchd scripts according to a schedule you set

1603138
daemons	launchd
you add your script into a crontab or place a symlink to it into a special directory and the daemons handles the job of launchd it in the background

1603138
daemons	systemd
there is a variety of different cron daemons but your gnu linux systemd should have it already installed

1603140
cpu	affinity
for general-purpose applications there is no reason to set the cpu affinity

1603140
cpu	affinity
however there are instances where it is necessary to set the cpu affinity

1603140
cpu	affinity
for example in real-time systems where the cost of migrating a thread from one core to another which can happen at any time if the cpu affinity has not been set can introduce unpredictable delays that can cause tasks to miss their deadlines and which preclude real-time guarantees

1603140
cpu	affinity
you can take a look at this article about a multi-core aware implementation of real-time corba that among other things had to set the cpu affinity so that cpu migration could not result in missed deadlines

1603146
daemons	systemd
a mail alias will do this inside the mail systemd without you having to fool around with daemons or services or anything of the sort

1603206
put	get
use something like this - create an iframe from gwt maybe put it in lightbox or something similar populate it the way you want using the current state of the app and when the user is finished he ll just close the lightbox frame and get back to the main application

1603206
post	get
you could also pass around data in a hidden way no visible data in the url or even through post using the window.name hack - there s even a sample implementation for gwt to get you started

1603221
rss	feed
i like using niokrigi or scrapi for parsing the xml in the atom rss feed

1603229
move	drag
it must be in the 2002 or newer format you will not be able to drag and drop the tables to your datacontext so either manually create the objects in your dbml or you can use sql server migration for access to move it to a sql server and then drag and drop all you want

1603231
cpu	affinity
regarding cpu affinity

1603231
affinity	processors
so-called ideal processors affinity in

1603231
cpu	affinity
the article also warns that cpu affinity shouldn t be manipulated without a deep understanding of the problem

1603238
uinavigationbar	uinavigationitem
here s another way to insert a custom uiview directly into the uinavigationbar with uinavigationitem s property

1603238
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
and where navcontroller is the uinavigationcontroller that your view managed by uinavigationbar is in.

post	get
please repeat this procedure until the printed time is somewhat stable and post this line together with some comments on your hardware i used cpu-z to get the infos and operating system like this

1603422
public	protected
in an asp.net page you can bind directly to public protected properties of your page s code-behind class

1603431
button	checkbox
on the publish tab under the options button there is a checkbox for generating the page

1603437
xen	openvz
openvz does not give your processes the full amount of allocated memory due to overhead so for smaller memory vpses i would lean towards choosing kvm or xen

1603460
nhibernate	automapper
the only problem is that fluent nhibernate crashes when the automapper hits a class that s already been mapped in the classic fluent nhibernate style

1603467
inherited	properties
you need to set singular properties of your dojo.dnd.source which is inherited from dojo.dnd.selector

1603473
iasyncresult	idisposable
if iasyncresult was idisposable disposal of the object would take care of cleaning up the handle

1603492
disk	ram
at 78 million rows even just changing the clustering key to int identity will save you up to 60 bytes per row - that alone would come out to be up to 4 gbyte of disk space and ram usage in your server

1603535
getdate	sysdate
getdate for sysdate java.sql.date

1603535
getdate	sysdate
getdate for sysdate java.sql.date no change

1603575
mamp	mediatemple
mysql on mamp is 5.1.31 and on my host mediatemple is 5.1.26-rc

1603605
filtering	grouping	sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping
my problem is that i use the grouping sorting and filtering

1603605
sorting	grouping
that means if i were to limit the data with the linq skip and take methods or using something like a paginated observablecollection the grouping and sorting would be wrong because it would only be applied to the first page of data

1603609
int	chars
however 10 chars long numbers may be able to fit in sql server s int datatype depending on the size so int vs

1603613
post	get
if i follow the directions given by howard in this post i m able to get it running in debug mode

1603616
width	height
i have a fixed size uitextview say width and height of 150 150

1603674
stdout	stderr
but if the exec d process decides to close stdout or stderr and send them elsewhere - there s little you can do

1603679
mp3	ogg
but it does not support mp3 only ogg

1603679
google-chrome	safari
safari should work as google-chrome

1603714
coalesce	isnull
coalesce value 0 or isnull value 0

1603774
super	implements
then implements -layoutsubviews and call super in that method before setting the frames of your subviews and set the frame of the uitextfield according to the contentrect property of the cell

1603783
width	height
rectangle has 1.0 ratio for area height width when circle s ratio is about 0.78

1603798
gif	bmp
for example i have a scenario where i m showing a preview image but if that fails this is a real scenario where i m previewing images and certain gif bmp formats cannot be previewed it s simply a scenario where i display an alternate image instead of preview

1603805
pbm	pgm	bmp	png	bmp	pgm	bmp	ppm	bmp	pbm	tiff	png	tiff	pgm	tiff	bmp	tiff	pbm	ppm	pgm	ppm	pbm
it supports bmp dib jpeg jpg jpe png pbm pgm ppm sr ras tiff tif

1603811
int	chars
since key itself is a string php converts that to an int 0 and you get the first chars

1603833
x86	64bit
adding true support for edit and continue to the 64bit version of the clr is a fairly large work item and other features were prioritized higher due to the fact that there is a reasonable workaround in most cases target x86

1603866
int	double
i need to do maths on both floats and int with much bigger accuracies and magnitudes than offered both by int float double in .net

1603868
children	parent
you could probably clean up some performance by storing a reference to the parent and just getting children each time instead of re-running the selector

1603968
hex	binary
on windows and ms-dos fopen translates ms-dos line endings r n hex 0x0d 0x0a in the file to unix style n unless you append b to the file mode to indicate binary

1603971
post	get
after you ve managed to make page requests using the get http verb learn about how to make post requests and how to add headers like content-type to your request

1604023
postgresql	mysql
we have a software that runs on multiple dmbs mysql postgresql and ms sql server i m wondering why the oracle version of the product consume more resources than the other ones

1604026
nant	cruisecontrol
we always compiled our web apps but we migrated from vss to svn and then setup cruisecontrol and nant to automate our builds and deployments

1604062
trac	bugzilla
even if that were available then the problem becomes how to map trac data to bugzilla data.

1604066
super	extends
simply extends streamhandler in the constructor call super system.out

1604089
hide	show
basically what i m going to do is to toggle hide show

1604152
arduino	avr-gcc
1 the arduino programming language is based on wiring and is essentially c c++ several simple transformations are performed before passing to avr-gcc . 2 the goal of the arduino project is to make tools available that are accessible low-cost low capital investment flexible and easy-to-use for artists and hobbyists

1604161
ssl	https
we recently updated the iis server to use an ssl certificate and now the same application has a https url

1604164
hide	show
after that i want to hide the welcome screen and show the tabbarcontroller

1604165
jquery	simplemodal
i used a jquery plugin not long ago called simplemodal

1604165
button	checkbox
on the modal i had multiple checkbox and to carried the values of the checkbox back to the page the modal was on after a submit button was hit

1604173
hide	show
my recommendation is to always just have 1 frame and have layers which you hide and show as necessary

1604174
queue	fifo
the standard refactoring is to store the data you would otherwise be passing to the function in a lifo a stack or fifo queue

1604196
allocator	stl
i would like to use different instances of an stl custom allocator class to manage different memory spaces and then be able to specify an allocator instance to an stl container such that each container only draws from its assigned memory space

1604196
allocator	stl
i see how i can pass an allocator type into the template parameters of an stl container but i want something akin to passing an allocator instance into the constructor of an stl container

1604231
for-loop	loops
i have a for-loop executing and in that loops i call a dialog and implement onconfirm for the dialog

1604256
whenever	capistrano	jobs	cron
check out the whenever gem -- this may be stretching beyond what you re intending to do but it uses very simple ruby syntax and makes it dead simple to setup cron jobs within a capistrano deployment script

1604259
allocator	stl
then when the stl container constructs its allocator the allocator uses the memory spaceassigned to that allocator

1604259
allocator	stl
pass the allocator type to the stl container constructors as required

1604274
put	get
i don t get why one would have to do that but try to put wagon-ftp-1.0-beta-2.jar in m2_home lib

1604279
cvs	svn
just see how many famous open source projects are switching from cvs svn to mercurial and how many are switching to git

1604284
allocator	stl
the stl containers allow you to pass the allocator in as an argument to the constructor

1604301
allocator	stl
unfortunately stl allocator cannot have state or at least have to be very careful how that state is used - each instance of a particular allocator type must be equivalent for stl containers to work effectively with them

1604301
allocator	stl
i don t recall the details right now but i know that scott meyers discusses this problem at length in effective stl item 10 be aware of allocator conventions and restrictions

1604301
allocator	stl
for example see this paragraph from an article by anthony aue improving performance with custom pool allocator for stl

1604306
wav	caf
i m playing multiple wav files i tried using caf but same thing happen with avaudioplayer

1604374
viewdidload	viewwillappear
i also moved logic from viewdidload into viewwillappear in the root controller since i originally set the title in there and other things and that didn t help either

1604376
width	height
suppose i have a scroll view in a view a scroll view s size is 320 width 2000 height

1604402
activemq	rabbitmq
you could also consider using an more enterprise messaging solution such as rabbitmq or activemq

1604457
client-side	server-side
make the asp.net server validation logic available to client-side jquery by affixing special css class names onto the html elements representing server-side validation controls

1604463
children	parent
all children of first parent

1604463
children	parent
all children of second parent

1604463
children	parent
but that gives me parent first then the children

1604463
children	parent
i need parent and immediately its children

1604473
post	get
check ftp and other services check your code for where you get input cookie querystring post params etc but the most likely is you installed an old known vulnerable version of wordpress or some webapp and a roving worm found it and exploited it

1604475
width	height
the other guys are right...if your div is returning to its original size...it is because the page is being allowed to reload...in which case your initial div width height are applied by the browser...as your alternate width height are only applied by jquery onsubmit

1604522
onclick	onkeyup
obviously there are different ways of implementing callbacks but you said you knew the power of callbacks in js and they are always onclick onload onkeyup etc so i wanted to give an example that somewhat resembled that behavior

1604537
children	parent
all children of first parent

1604537
children	parent
all children of second parent

1604537
children	parent
5 1 all children of first parent

1604537
children	parent
3 2 all children of second parent

1604537
children	parent
but that gives me parent first then the children

1604537
children	parent
i need parent and immediately its children

1604581
post	get
also this can break the usage of the super globals get and post and can only be suppressed by logic to prevent their execution

1604604
hide	show
or with hide show how can i link to a certain part of the site

1604604
hide	show
i could have a copy of the markup as a separate file with the onload hide show different for each one and use the same coding file for functionality

1604636
stateless	stateful
ajax is the 3rd piece to making the stateless web application appear as stateful

1604702
uiview	calayer
if you want to test this yourself i highly recommend picking up the image editor opacity which can generate quartz code for a drawing including a full uiview or calayer subclass as well as output a png of that same drawing

1604703
namedtuple	dictionary
rather than using dictionary to represent your transactions a better container would be a namedtuple from the collections module

1604703
namedtuple	dictionary
a dictionary is a fairly heavy-weight object compared to a namedtuple which takes up no more memory than an ordinary tuple

1604703
namedtuple	dictionary
a namedtuple also has the added advantage of keeping it s items in order unlike a dictionary

1604710
decimal	ieee
floating point numbers are represented in ieee notation based on the powers of 2 so terminating decimal numbers may not be a terminating binary number that s why you get the trailing digits

1604717
folder	directory
so the fix is just copy that aspnet_client system_web 2_0_50727 folder into your website s root directory

1604747
versioning	upgrade
finally if you have upgrade from leopard to snow leopard and installed your own versioning of ruby on leopard you need to remove it

1604757
ssl	https
the best way to do this that i m aware of is via https via tsl ssl

1604758
listview	gridview
personally i wouldn t use a datagrid control since it restricts your control over your output and they ve been replaced by the newer gridview listview controls although datagrid is not obsolete so feel free to use it if you want

1604770
bash	zsh
also zsh and bash support this natively in echo

1604778
ido-mode	magit
the latest version defines a minor mode which turns itself off in a read-only buffer or the minibuffer allowing things like ido-mode and magit to work properly

1604800
sfx	zipfile
the sfx exe is also a regular zipfile that you can read and extract with winzip or other zip tools including windows explorer compressed folders

1604800
sfx	zipfile
the way it works is pretty simple in the code that produces the sfx copy your unzip stub exe winforms wpf or whatever to an output stream and then without closing the stream save the zipfile to the same stream

1604868
int	chars
the error reporting method is taking an int here and the pipe chars is bitwise or-ing their underlying int values together to achieve the final int passed to the function

1604874
uiscrollviewdelegate	uiwebviewdelegate
that means using the uiscrollviewdelegate methods is not an option to do what you want and the uiwebviewdelegate protocol does not respond to those scrolling event type of messages

1604926
post	get
if you ajax requests are always post then you could check the method and assume a post is an ajax call because it s pretty hard for the average user to create a post accidentally where as they can always get any url if they know of it

1604967
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
i found many css js menu scripts on various sites they work well is in firefox ie7 and safari opera if js is disabled but not in ie 6 and for ie 6 small js file need to add because ie doesnt support hover but my question is can we make pre css dropdown menu for ie6 because

1604979
versioning	upgrade
i d like to upgrade to the new versioning of xcode 3.2 and snow leopard but chances are my partner won t

1604986
pull	push
pulling a branch means you can make some evolutions within that branch due to some bugfix and adjustments to make once the code is on a production environment and push it back for all the other developer s repository for them to pull back and take into account

1604996
subtract	add
you must be knowing at what timezone your server is then make the time utc and add subtract the time to get the local time of the user

1605056
mouseover	mouseout
i don t know what your code looks like but when you display your options box using hover or mouseover mouseout just include the zero clipboard div.

1605066
regression	anova
regression linear anova qr svd and more

1605069
portrait	landscape
the first time you rotate portrait - landscape everything is fine

1605075
django	turbogears
templating turbogears django zope

1605081
folder	directory
apple used to include this type of example code in the xcode tools package under the developer examples bluetooth folder but upon downloading the latest version of xcode 3.2.1 these bluetooth examples have been removed from that directory

1605102
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome display the returned value as a multi-line comment just fine

1605125
superclass	subclassing
but if you then try to declare a subclassing of your singleton class the subclassing constructor wont be able to see the constructors of the superclass .

1605197
jobs	cron
you can probably use something like cfengine chef for deployment it can deploy everything - including cron jobs

1605218
firefox	safari
the middle column will collapse in recent versions of firefox and safari although apparently not ie7

1605218
firefox	safari
since both safari and firefox behave this way i assume this is officially sanctioned behavior

1605240
gentoo	ubuntu
i use ubuntu for my host system and a chrooted gentoo install for building apps for an embedded target

1605324
post	put
x also makes it possible to put comments into the regex itself so the things like # post title there are just comments

1605332
fileinputstream	filechannel
i am trying to figure out if there is any difference in performance or advantages when we use nio filechannel versus normal fileinputstream fileouputstream to read and write files to filesystem

1605333
cakephp	kohana	codeigniter	cakephp	codeigniter	kohana	symfony	kohana
stick with vanilla php and don t confuse it by throwing something like codeigniter kohana symfony cakephp or zend on top of it

1605355
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
but when it comes to large files fileinputstream fileoutputstream is much faster

1605385
client-side	server-side
javascript has strong restrictions about accessing files on the local file system i think that you are maybe mixing up the client-side and server-side concepts

1605403
folder	directory
preferably using the cms template folder directory structure.

1605427
for-loop	arrays
i am iterating through that table with a for-loop and populating an arrays of objects with data

1605478
teamcity	nant
we use teamcity nant and psexec to run a command on a remote machine as part of the release packaging

1605478
teamcity	nant
everything works fine when i run the nant from the console but when running from teamcity psexec hangs freezes 50 of the times

1605482
boost	stl
it s certainly possible to write c++ mex files which use stl and boost

1605500
inherited	properties
in this case icat inherited ianimal s color properties

1605619
children	parent
a children has a parent in one of the tables parent or parent2

1605621
imperative	declarative
postsharp provides a basic declarative pointcut system but enables you to develop imperative pointcuts so you can write code typically using system.reflection that evaluates the pointcut at compile time

1605629
ftpwebresponse	ftpwebrequest
use ftpwebrequest and ftpwebresponse

1605698
google-chrome	firefox
must work for ie firefox and google-chrome

1605744
width	height
assume we have an input position of 2 1 5 1 we have a zn z-near of 1 and a zf z-far of 10 and a w width of 1 and a h height of 1

1605814
post	put
so i don t know if is there any traditional way to retrieve this kind of call from url with methods like post delete and put on the requests etc.

1605814
post	get
hi so i managed to make get requests but now i m having a serious problem in retrieve post request for example i m using the update status api from twitter that in curl would work like this

1605814
post	get
i finally manage to get it working but probably there s a way to make it cleaner and beautiful as i m new on c# i ll need more knowledge to do it the way the post params are passed makes me very confused because is a lot of code to just pass params

1605816
yacc	bison
this tutorial is the best i ve seen for working with flex and bison or lex yacc

1605848
webclient	webrequest
for finer grained control you might find webrequest to be more useful but webclient seems the best fit for your needs

1605981
onreadystatechange	onload
as onload doesnt work in ie you need to add onreadystatechange

1606017
hide	show
i need to show toolbar with play pause buttons when i touch the respective picture boxes and hide when i touch the other one

1606018
graphics2d	bufferedimage

in other words because the bool will get promoted to an int your test will return true whenever the strings start with different chars tmp1 will be false which gets converted to 0 and so tmp2 becomes true

1606666
debian	linux
it sounds messy but basically it will be like the cacti or the opennms systems just google them and it s based on alot of technologies thing like ruby mysql to save the actions and to have users db linux i would use debian snmp agents cron to schedule the basic system working ssh telnet take a reaction of some harmful action php rubyonrails to build an web interface that can also connect to your database .

1606852
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	add	subtract	addition	subtract	add	multiplying	addition	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	subtraction	multiplying	add	multiplying	multiplication	addition	multiplication
then you also want to add subtract multiplying those 2n-bits integers and now you need 2n-bits general-purpose registers for storing the addition subtraction results and 4n-bits registers for storing the multiplication results

1606854
put	get
you can t put it in the dealloc-method because although it can access the static variable any instance method that is created that get s released will also release the sharedinstance

1606870
stdout	fflush
this is the default behavior - when connected to a pipe programs must explicitly fflush stdout for realtime results otherwise standard c library will buffer

1606917
int	double
i have some xaml textboxes that need to allow nothing but double and some that need to allow nothing but int

1606921
tcpdf	fpdi
i m using fpdi together with tcpdf to add a page to a already existing pdf-file

1606921
tcpdf	fpdi
i find no documentation in fpdi or tcpdf about this automaticly generated page counter

1606923
dictionary	map
if you would solve the problem in the object model using dictionary there is the option of directly map the dictionary as map but then the data is not in columns but in rows

1606923
dictionary	map
or you map the dictionary as dynamic component which will map to columns

1606925
hide	show
instead i prefer to just hide show elements as appropriate

1607031
realloc	malloc
if ptr is a null pointer the realloc function behaves like the malloc function for the

1607031

1607140
dia	visio
dia - best freeware flowcharting visio tool

1607143
int	double
my mistake the time is stored as an unsigned double instead of an int

1607169
dia	visio
there s an open-source program with features similar to visio called dia

1607201
int	chars
make a hash from the chars digits in your case to int for counting

1607214
agile	sprint
but it was my understanding that agile practices specifically scrum were based upon the concept of tasks being buckets that store individual deliverable goals and you add remove adjust them as the clients needs evolve after each sprint

1607274
terminate	timeout
however i want the process task to terminate with success after 5 minutes so i set the timeout to 300 seconds but it still terminate with a failure

1607423
ssl	https
however when setting up the webserver to support ssl it should not be any difference in how you deploy it as far as i know you just tell the webserver to respond to https instead of http

1607460
sharepoint	splist
you can catch the httpcontext in both splist and document libraries if you upload the document from the sharepoint interface internet explorer

1607478
cpu	processors
if several processors can each write to different places in the cache line then the cache line can ping-pong between cpus and that s a lot more expensive than if it the cache line goes to a single cpu and stays there

1607488
prepare	execute
passing a query to an execute method of a prepare statement or something guessing my oracle drivers is deprecated

1607533
postgresql	mysql
my 2 cents stick with mysql or postgresql simple sql and try not to make any stored procedures or use proprietary sql

1607538
profiling	debugging
if your code makes extensive use of template you might be interested in templight a tool developed by a hungarian research team for debugging and profiling c++ template metaprograms paper

1607539
gridview	detailsview
i would like to include a detailsview below the gridview that shows the information of the selected gridview row and allows the user to edite that row

1607541
client-side	server-side
but be aware that php is entirely server-side and javascript is entirely client-side

1607545
post	get
so basically what i need is a way to either restore viewstate to a control manually or to get the control s value from a post variable or the equivalent in c#

the default data location of mysql data folder after creating 32 000 database on that location i want to change the data directory to other location

1607824
filtering	grouping
it must come before the grouping by in the query and acts as a filtering before things are sum med which is how most of the answers here work

1607824
filtering	grouping
this can be used to filtering on the resulting properties of grouping after grouping ing - for instance

1607840
unsigned	short
also early versions of the windows sdk didnt use wchar_t for wchar but unsigned short

1607840
unsigned	short
the windows sdk on gcc gets interesting as - im led to belive that gcc 32bit has a 32bit wchar_t - on compilers with 32bit wchar_t wchar would be defined as an unsigned short or some other type thats 16bits on that compiler

1607915
uitableview	reloaddata
in the viewdidappear method of my uiviewcontroller i call reloaddata on my uitableview

1607995

3des	sha
the shared 3des key is itself encrypted using the sha hash value of the ltpa password padded with 0x0 upto 24 bytes

1608085

as some have pointed out this works fine because boolean are int a subclass specifically

1608116
put	get
once you ve done that you can just put the following code after your dial statement has returned callduration execute_agi get variable answeredtime

1608203
equals	gethashcode
surprisingly nobody advised to override equals and gethashcode

1608205
apache	nginx
try nginx - another lightweight alternative to apache fast and stable

1608241
bazaar	git
take a look at bazaar git or mercurial already mentioned above

1608259
width	height
true .getthumbnailimage height width null

1608276
postgresql	mysql
in addition to mysql postgresql and ms sql server you might also want to look at apache derby aka ibm cloudscape aka javadb

1608280
jar	.war
i assume because you explicitely say jar that your webservices are ejb endpoints and not jax-rpc servlet based webservices because those would be packaged in a .war

1608280
folder	directory
unlike servlets who are somewhat capable of finding files inside the project as long as you can express their location as an offset to the web folder you can determine theire real location with servletcontext s getrealpath ejb s don t have any automatic notion of directory

1608296
ssl	https
it is possible to use iis or similar to handle the ssl side of https communications

1608309
subtraction	addition
many time libraries already represent time as seconds since the epoch so this makes addition and subtraction of time trivial

1608314
tunnel	packets
you could setup a tunnel to the ssl server send the packets through the tunnel and then have that server forward the result on

1608368
int	double
_bool is a keyword in c99 it specifies a type just like int or double

1608413

a web installer project gets the files from the deployed folder and creates a virtual directory on iis with all the needed files

1608426
ready	each
for each round the candidate with the lowest votes is eliminated and the next preference votes for that candidate are transferred to the relevant candidates ready for the next round

1608432
folder	directory
the root directory copy will then appropriately link to that folder

1608473
awk	ksh
i am starting an awk script from a shell script ksh if it matters like this

1608516
bazaar	git
distributed version control systems mercurial bazaar git are nice in that they can be completely self-contained in a single directory .hg .bzr .git in the top of the working copy where subversion uses a separate repository directory in addition to .svn directories in every directory of your working copy

1608584
min	max
i don t like having to define constant values for the min and max and it seems like there should be a way to do this

1608594
getter	setter
getter and setter for the base properties of the object

1608611
keydown	keyup
i m working on a small program and i m having a problem where it seems that some of the controls on it inside groupboxes are not triggering the keydown event on my form when i press and release any arrow key just the keyup event

1608641
serializable	deserialization
if it were up to me i would choose viewstate since the asp.net runtime will handle the serializable and deserialization of your objects for you

1608707
regasm	regsvr32
update after further inspection we are able to regsvr32 u the old ocx file and use regasm to register our .net dll

1608722
imperative	declarative
ultimately you still need to put the rules that govern argument values somewhere - it just a matter of deciding whether you prefer an imperative style string.isnullorempty or a declarative one

1608900
width	height
then after the img has loaded i manually set the height and width of the image

1608925
rss	feed
if your blog outputs an rss feed you can use facebook s rss graffiti application to post that feed to your wall in facebook

1608934
typedef	struct
an alternative fix is to do typedef struct acct .

1609005
folder	directory
the e folder sounds like it is a mapped directory from another machine

1609162
folder	directory
or how best should i refer to an image in the templates directory without hard-coding it with the folder structure my site has

1609166
wkt	gml
st_askml is one of several output formats including wkt gml geojson etc

1609184
int	double
since there are many different kinds of casting each with different semantics static_cast allows you to say i m doing a legal conversion from one type to another like from int to double

1609224
rss	feed
this includes footer text a rss feed display and the display of menu items

1609252
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
if it s the whole page just set the width and height of the container to 100 and remove extra padding margin on the body or on the div

1609289
pop-up	dialog
if you assign a handler for this event the message script file name and line number are passed as arguments those are all things shown in the error dialog that pop-up

i ve been using php versioning 5.2 and now need to upgrade to versioning 5.3 windows apache

1609404
typedef	struct
place the struct definition outside of the class using a typedef

1609412
daemons	systemd
if you have systemd configuration access don t over-do it and set up some iptables pf etc to load-balance connections across n daemons instances processes as this will work out of the box

1609412
daemons	systemd
depending on how blocking the nature of the daemons n should be from the number of cores on the systemd or several times higher

1609412
daemons	systemd
if you don t have systemd access or ops can t be bothered you can use load balancer daemons there are plenty of open source ones instead of iptables pf etc and use also n service daemons like above

1609425
weka	orange
if you want to play around with different algorithms in simple intuitive package which requires no programming i suggest you take a look at weka my 1st choice orange or rapidminer

1609463
put	get
but you put a pretty open ended question on so and that s not a great way to get assistance

1609591
vbscript	jscript
windows scripting host wsh cscript.exe and wscript.exe only handles active scripting languages in most installs vbscript and jscript

1609600
opml	rss
you can also get opml file here to import to your favourite rss reader

1609606
post	put
if it is again such a problem it would be nice if you could post some rule on what to put into the header file and what into the code file since it s pretty confusing

1609613
put	get
when i put on the following address i get the message mentioned below

1609613
ssl	https
â if this is an https secure address click tools click internet options click advanced and check to be sure the ssl and tls protocols are enabled under the security section

1609622
width	height
if you know the size of the image or it s always going to be the same just set the div width and height to be the same as the image and it should display it all

1609666
soappy	suds
only replacing soappy calls with suds

1609669
calloc	malloc
i have a strongly recursive function that creates a very small std multimap locally for each function instance using new which recurses to malloc calloc in the std lib

1609678
vbscript	vba
unlike vba vbscript has only one data type â variant so you don t specify the data type when declaring a variable

1609693
mouse	keyboard
sigh i have some code from codeproject for hooking global keyboard and mouse events

1609766
prepare	execute
prepare statement is created and execute - so it should be no different from jdbc

1609794
subtract	add
the l distance between 1 2 is 2 subtract a add d

1609794
subtract	add
the l distance between 2 3 is 2 subtract b add e

1609799
apache	lighttpd
better is the x-sendfile header which isn t fully standard but works at least within apache and lighttpd

1609801
mouse	keyboard
simplified it receives all the os events keyboard mouse etc. and dispatches them to your program

1609827
put	get
you ll get an overflow when you try to put negative numbers into a ushort or when you try to put numbers over 32 767 into a short

1609868
unix	bsd
and something like c#+monodevelop or equally a scripting language like perl and glade gtk on linux bsd other unix s while on mac os then xcode and interface builder are the obvious choice

1609903
vb.net	vb6
if you have the source code for the original component apparently vbmigration partner can upgrade a vb6 com component to a vb.net component that has binary compatibility with the original vb6 component

1609914
vb.net	vb6
apparently vbmigration partner can automatically upgrade a vb6 com component to a vb.net component that has binary compatibility with the original vb6 component

1609959
put	get
when you get to the part where you re setting the text you can take out the reference to this.text and put in your own string

1609994
udp	rtp
take a look at rtp which runs over udp for a more network -survivable approach

1610029
getter	setter
i have always preferred to just use function overloading to give you the same name for both getter and setter

1610059
min	max
i unrolled the beginning and the end of the cycles to eliminate min and max from the code

1610062
for-loop	arrays
the following for-loop creates the inner arrays which are of type int using the jni function newintarray

1610076
getter	setter
while ed s comment is true i do prefer actual properties over the setter getter antipattern

1610081
int	double
that way it d be easier to see that it was in fact a double and not an int i guess

1610088
getter	setter
more recently a doubt began to make its way because that makes taking the address of a getter or setter ambiguous

1610092
udp	tcp
however note that tcp provides guarantee of delivery and order whereas udp provides none

1610095
cpu	processors
on the pc you have a nice processors register that gives you easy cheap access to the cpu usage

1610121
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this page works in ie google-chrome and firefox but not in safari or opera

1610125
getter	setter
personally i think getter and setter found in pairs are a code smell carried over from visual languages and their properties

1610125
getter	setter
i think the most common cause of getter and setter is not carrying the object model deep enough

1610125
put	get
etc. it just seems there wasn t enough thought put into how the class should be used and rather the author made the class easy to get at the data so he wouldn t have to consider how the class should be used

1610153
getter	setter
from my understanding it is a shortcut for having to write each member s getter and setter

1610155
folder	directory
all files are loaded in to a directory with in the application folder of the project layout

1610164
versioning	upgrade
i did something similar to upgrade to a newer versioning of the jasper report libraries in the jasper plugin and it worked for me

1610166
libc	tcmalloc
i d like to find a way to get gcc to globally link against tcmalloc like it does with libc .

1610180
getter	setter
second yes adding magic setter and getter is like adding setter and getter

1610203
int	chars
int getpwuid_r uid_t struct passwd chars size_t struct passwd

1610311
getter	setter
as a matter of fact here is where the getter and setter practice originated

1610311
getter	setter
so the magic getter and setter in php can be useful on many circumstances

1610311
getter	setter
now if you want to keep private variables and still use magic getter and setter

1610362
parent-child	one-to-many
edit just to expand on the previous point - i m hoping to have subsonic convert my object model to a relational db dealing with all the parent-child and one-to-many relationships that are implied

1610374
postgresql	mysql
use mysql or postgresql for production if they aren t

1610389

1610475
.htaccess	httpd.conf
apache configuration in httpd.conf or .htaccess

1610536
inherited	properties

1610563
interpreted-language	compiled-language
interpreted-language give programs certain extra flexibility over compiled-language

1610582
post	get
i m trying to come up with a way to effectively easily clean all post and get variables with a single function

1610622
inherited	subclassing
protected methods in the data access assembly with subclassing in the caching assembly could get around some cases but often times it s an abuse of inherited

1610664
postgresql	mysql
the established players in the free rbdms arena are mysql and postgresql

1610696
fieldset	formpanel
inside my formpanel i have a fieldset with a layout of column

1610698
hide	show
click to show or hide the elements as

1610725
post	get
it should be noted that this only clears out the post information not the get

1610758
folder	directory
in my case it seems ssh connects at the root folder instead of the home directory as ftp does

1610788
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
call myfunction in the root view controller s viewwillappear bool animated method or the viewdidappear bool animated method depending on when you want it to be called

i searched for this a while ago for vim or emacs and couldn t find anything so i started writing my

1610820
springsource	grails
well look at the resulting stack with java groovy grails as languages spring as container tc server as underlying application server hyperic for health and monitoring vmware for virtualization cloudfoundry as management and provisioning system vmware springsource has a complete stack for elastic cloud

1610820
saas	iaas
in other words while others are still preparing themselves for it vmware and springsource are already ready for the saas 1 paas 2 iaas 3 wave

1610883
pop-up	dialog
but before i head down this road i need to make sure it s not going to cause any pop-up and confirmation dialog to appear from the system

1610918
accessor	properties
implement the set accessor methods for the properties and use them everywhere

1610943
crypt	md5
either crypt md5 or sha1

1610946
post	get
unless i misunderstood the question it sounds like maybe you were thinking that forms have to get post to the same url that loaded the current page

1610947
min	max
unsigned max is 15 signed positive max is 7 signed negative min is -8 so abs -8 won t fit into a signed value

1610947
division	multiplication
sure you can represent it as -8 but then division and multiplication with the result don t work as expected

1610952
iboutlet	ibaction
if you want to keep a reference to it declare it the same way you would if you were using a nib without the iboutlet ibaction and use self when assigning it

1610959
post	get
if i get it done i ll post it here

1611037
width	height
important for this to work wmode must be set to opaque as noted by thebrain earlier the parent div must have a position set the child div must have position absolute and the width height of the flash animation

1611037
width	height
update the width and height of the parent div element must be set to prevent some uncovered borders to creep in

1611053
keydown	keyup
you can receive keydown and keyup events on a windows form using allkeys

1611103
apache	nginx
apparently nginx can do it but i really want to use apache

1611125
versioning	upgrade
i m leaving this answer as-is to help anyone who must maintain a legacy site that is unable to upgrade to the latest versioning of jquery and jquery.validate

1611146
icriteria	fluent
let s compare i have worked often with n hibernate icriteria queries which can be considered a fluent mapping to sql

1611172
width	height
a span is by default an inline element you cannot set the width height and other properties associated with blocks

1611172
width	height
on the other hand an element with the property inline-block will still flow with any surrounding text but you may set properties such as width height etc

1611186
ubuntu	linux
i have windows and linux ubuntu 9.04 in my machine and can program in both of them via gcc code blocks vim etc

1611186
boost	stl
sure it compiles but many issues will arise even with boost stl

1611187
put	get
you then select all the cells within this new column you can copy and paste into notepad or another text editor to save it as a plist file you may want to put some hardcoded text into a cell above and below your 200+ rows in order to get the required tags etc as well.

1611188
children	parent
make sure that the containing div is position relative to force it to become the offset parent which the position of the children are relative to edit in other words add the following rule

1611367
jar	war
so basically - i did jni project for the client where i will use such jar packaged within the war

1611370
cfstring	nsstring
the simple answer for why it s not simple is because nsstring and cfstring deal with all the complicated details of dealing with multiple character sets unicode etc etc while presenting a simple uniform api for manipulating strings

1611370
cfstring	nsstring
most of nsstring is actually implemented in with corefoundation cfstring so there s obviously a path from a cfstringref - -utf8string

1611370
cfstring	nsstring
but just because a cfstring says it s macroman cfstring encoding value of kcfstringencodingmacroman nsstring encoding value of nsmacosromanstringencoding doesn t mean that it has characters 128 in it

1611390
hide	show
instead of using offsets you can hide show the tabs with the display property

1611406
httpresponse	request
to try head you have to use the lower-level module httplib make a connection to the server call its request head url method call its getresponse to get an httpresponse object call the getheader method on the latter to get the content length header.

1611511

min	max
i had defined my own min and max macros in my completely unrelated vector math files

1611602
min	max
the solution was to remove my macros and put std in front of the min and max calls

1611630
inline	inlining
no inlining for functions with loops is probably a bit of some inline heuristic from some particular compiler

1611661
for-loop	loops
it looks like the prompt is inside the while loops but outside the outermost for-loop

1611687
firefox	safari
i ve tested it on mac firefox and safari and windows ie firefox with the same results so i don t think it s the browser and the fields post fine if i disable the dialog box

1611776
multicastdelegate	delegation
how do you know that the delegation implements somemethod when delegation is a plain multicastdelegate

1611781
free	realloc
what will happen is if there isn t enough room for the expanded object the old object is still valid and isn t free but realloc returns null

1611963

your final image can obviously only be a rectangle and have a height and width

it can deploy to a folder which you can then copy to somewhere else if you like an ftp site or to an iis virtual directory

1612004
ssl	https
having a form rendered in an http page even if the form is pointing to an https url defeats the purpose of ssl

1612026

for primitive types such as chars int is there any difference between

1612044
free	malloc
you should always use new delete new delete and malloc free pairs

1612090
calloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	malloc
for objects allocated with malloc or calloc you must use free

1612131
dlsym	dlopen
and instead of the windows loadlibrary getprocaddress and freelibrary there are dlopen dlsym and dlclose

1612154
free	malloc
for this reason it is wise to think of new delete malloc free etc

1612157
free	malloc
although it might seem in some logic way that you can mix new and free or delete instead of delete this is under the assumption about the compiler being a fairly simplistic that it will always use malloc to implement the memory allocation for new

1612222
getter	setter
all getter and setter are synchronized methods so i really shouldn t have any concurrency issues

1612251
ssl	https
also if your site needs the user to log in it s advisable to use https ssl

1612308

firefox 2.0 or 3.0 older safari or opera versions or google-chrome

1612312
jlabel	jseparator
instead you could use a jlabel with a jseparator there are examples in designgridlayout but this works with any other layoutmanager

1612335
jruby	mri
afaik ruby version manager rvm is targeted more at making it simple to work with multiple ruby versions 1.8.6 1.8.7 1.9.1 mri jruby etc etc on the same machine

1612366
ubuntu	linux
right now i only need a solution for linux ubuntu but the system also has to run on windows

1612376
client-side	server-side
clientid is indeed also unique on the page as uniqueid is but clientid is targeted at client-side processing and uniqueid for server-side pretty obvious the latter especially to route for postback data and events with composite controls

1612393
post	get
it seems that in order to get the validationsummary and validationmessage helpers to work i need the post action to be called the same as the get action index in this case

1612393
post	get
i changed everything so that i just have a get post index action and an if statement in the post action to see if the button was create or upload

1612568
apache	lighttpd
arch linux sets the documentroot to src http for both apache and lighttpd fyi

1612591
getter	setter
you can even use public attributes without getter and setter

1612591
getter	setter
the java-beanness of a pojo is that it s private attributes are all accessed via public getter and setter that conform to the javabeans conventions

1612614
button	checkbox
also note that radio button by default might look like checkbox square or circular but there should be a property attribute that you can adjust to make them look like button with pressed states

1612617

width 200 height 200

1612628
width	height
i want to determine the width and the height of the webview

1612662
hide	show
the show and hide are running but straight after one another there is no 1s pause between them

1612671
getter	setter
a javabean is a java object that is serializable has a nullary constructor and allows access to properties using getter and setter methods

1612671

the class properties must be accessible using get set and other methods so-called accessor methods and mutator methods following a standard naming convention

1612671
getter	setter
properties using getter and setter

1612677
children	parent
each node needs information both from it s parent and from a top-level tree class in addition to keeping track of it s children

1612677
children	parent
the problem is the n - g transition n needs to have children of type g and g a parent of type n

1612683
post	get
when i get the example done i ll update this post

1612698
pop-up	dialog
try installing the debug player in your browser and it should pop-up the stack trace dialog that should give you a clue what s wrong if the app throws an exception like gregor suggested

1612701
ant	cruisecontrol
if you feel like using a tool to handle your builds then there are lots about such as cruisecontrol which is ant based and has pretty deep integration with your source code control

1612701
put	get
i am just about to get it to put a label into cvs just before the fetch with the build number so i know exactly what code is in the jar

1612757
pop-up	dialog
essentially you are going to do something like so if you want to pop-up a dialog and browse to the system folder and select some files from there

1612776
profiling	debugging
is there any profiling sort of tool which can debugging which javascript object in the dom is causing the internet explorer to hang crash

1612800

icollection extends ienumerable

1612812
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
on firefox opera safari everything is fine

1612864
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
in ib when using uitabbarcontroller which has multiple uiviewcontroller which all separately have their own nib file assigned there are two places where you need to set your uiviewcontroller class file

1612879
hide	show
or even include all of them in the application as mxml tags and use the visible property to show hide them

1612899
getter	setter
i think there is no need for the setter in the total property however the getter simply recalculate the sum for every call

1612920
ant	maven
finally another option would be to use maven instead of ant which has a built-in version management feature as pointed out by cetnar

1612935
jlist	jtable
if you want the jlist and the jtable to be displayed next to each other you have to addthem both to a jpanel before adding that to the scrollpane

1612968
hide	show
if you want to show the next div just after you finish hiding the previous one jquery gives you a callback in the hide method to do exactly that

1612968
hide	show
also your original show hide functions seem to think string.concat behaves like a java stringbuffer

1613006
free	malloc
memory on the heap which is obtained using malloc new will stay around until you delete it using free delete

1613031
put	get
i d probably put it on customer since that s ultimately where i m trying to get to

1613072
versioning	upgrade
our problem is we receive monthly updates to the core xml files and we re supposed to put them in place and upgrade our custom documents to line up with the new versioning of the base documents

1613131
folder	directory
it s possible the file retrieval may be fine but if you need to do any maintenance on the folder it would be a huge headache as processes attempt ot enumerate the directory listings

1613131
folder	directory
what would improve the situation would be a number of sub directory under the images folder or two levels depending on how many images you re looking at storing so you have a hierarchy like this

1613237
opera	safari
haven t tried opera or safari i ve found that asp renders the site without any javascript code for the validators nor does it render the site with any javascript code for the ajax methods that i call

1613271
maven	pom.xml
you can use maven for vesion and read it from pom.xml

1613278
ienumerable	ienumerator
correct me if i m wrong but the only difference is the difference between ienumerable and ienumerator and since you specifically said you re not asking the difference both are a good.

1613283
width	height
as stated in the discussion here you need to create another swf call it a that loads the swf you want to embed call it b and read the dimension of b using a s loader s contentloaderinfo to get the width and height of b

1613327
move	drag
this also meant looking at how far the mouse move before starting a drag - because clicking on a selected item to unselect it could sometimes result in it getting selected again if mouse bounce started a little drag operation

1613334
touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchescancelled	touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchescancelled	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchescancelled
for some view and events like uitableview select you need to forward the touchesbegan event to nextresponder keep track of your gesture forward touchesmoved events to the nextresponder until you detect your gesture and when it s triggered you send a touchescancelled to the nextresponder and hide all other events from the next responder touchesended and touchescancelled until you receive touchesended or touchescancelled yourself

1613361
gif	bmp
this feature applies to bmp jpg gif

1613385
octal	hex
this is fairly trivial with characters like tab and newline but i can t figure out how to do this with hex and octal values

int	chars
int is usually 16 or 32 bits chars is usually 8 bits etc

1613424
min	max
the random function takes a max and min value this is your min and max id values then an optional seed value and returns a number

1613424
min	max
it s possible if you change the max and min this can affect the number generated

1613427
nginx	lighttpd
ps i also considered switching to nginx but given the current performance i can get and the even smaller user base of nginx i decided i would keep lighttpd

1613453
hide	show
third one show the element over 5 seconds and then hide as soon as it completes therefore is different from the first

1613454
rss	feed
i ve basically got the same data structure mine is actually an rss feed of products as in the above post but i want to list the description elements uniquely in sorted order where the file element contains a particular value

1613473
mouse	keyboard
well guess what install service pack 1 for vs 2008 and it would go away and if you have wireless mouse and keyboard turn it off

1613584
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
the function must work at least in latest versions of firefox opera safari and ie

1613683
swt	swing
bu tof course using good old swing or the more os agnostic swt does the trick as well

1613686
ant	maven
self-deployable since all the plugins are registered xml files the application must be self-deployable independent of the build system - of course there is an ant task and a maven mojo which are the links with the ourside world but in the end it calls the application and instruct it to self-deploy itself at a specific location

1613697
integer	unsigned
u stays for unsigned integer

1613707
public	protected
in more basic terms you can override any public or protected function that exists in the extended class es

1613707
getter	setter
this includes setter and getter of public properties

1613707
getter	setter
you basically want to use setter and getter when you want something else to occur base on the setting of a property - for instance when you set the data property of an itemrenderer you want to inspect the data and if it meets a certain criteria you want to change the styling of the renderer

1613722

1613834
python-daemon	daemons
you really should use python-daemon for this which is a library that implements pep 3141 for a standard daemons process library

1613867
implements	extends
the issue appears is when i have a class implements an interface and extends a class which implements an interface

1613882
pull	push
remember that tracking doesn t mean automatic update - it simply does things like specifying where the branch should push pull from and letting git status give those your branch is behind origin master by 5 commits and can be fast-forwarded messages

1613886
rss	feed
i have been asked to make this into and rss feed

1613897
rss	feed

1613922
unsigned	short
in vc6 where wchar_t was just a typedef for unsigned short this code

1613979
freemarker	velocity
often these would be freemarker or velocity templates the output of which would be unmarshalled into the application and sent

1613992
min	max
here is the issue even if i enable set to visible and declare min and max values as well as the smallchange and largechange for the horizontalscrollbar and verticalscrollbar they show up in the borders of the control but they are useless

1614004
qcombobox	qcompleter
for your second try you can add a qcompleter object to you qcombbox in order to filter your items as you want.the qcompleter member of the qcombobox is to offer an easy way to use qcompleter

1614013

1614174
imperative	declarative
i know that java and c# are imperative prolog declarative and sql somewhat declarative languages

1614174
imperative	declarative

1614196
hash	md5
i m trying to get an md5 hash of a value in coldfusion

1614196
hash	md5
edit i didn t see the built-in hash function but i saw the fact that encrypt lists md5 and sha as supposedly supported algorithms so i thought incorrectly it turns out that this was just how you got a hash in cf

1614420
tabcontrol	tabitem

and when i am done i need to convert nsmutablestring to nsstring to return it

1614490
postgresql	mysql
if you re on something like linux oracle solaris with an oracle postgresql mysql db i d use java but many on so would probably push python

1614494
apache	lighttpd
lighttpd supports it through mod flv streaming and i am sure there are similar modules for apache and iis

1614499
width	height
rectangle width height center and rotation angle

1614499
width	height
ellipse width height center rotation

nsmutablestring	nsstring
and it is good to know that i can use nsmutablestring in place of nsstring

1614629
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
there are significant differences between ie firefox opera safari etc over how things like css styles such as padding or margins are played out in the rendering of the page

1614691

file formats wmf bmp jpg png and tif and five network

1614702
regasm	gacutil
we have our assembly properly sent through regasm tlb and gacutil but i then noticed something strange

worst case you will have to create a few pairs of those serializable deserialization methods for different shapes

1614821
children	parent
you ll need to iterate over your first-level children and assign their parent to the wrapper element s parent

1614871
lisp	scheme
many people feel that structure and interpretation of computer programs which uses the scheme dialect of lisp is a book that should be on every programmers shelf

1614872
getter	setter
and you might take it even further by defining even smaller methods -- getter setter and so forth

1614882
lisp	scheme
i ll stick to common lisp here though scheme is also a superb language that has a lot to recommend it

1614890
hash	salt
adding something per user that won t change i use email as this is the username for my sites and add a hash salt is a short constant string i change per site increases resistance to attacks

1614896
puts	gets
i m kind of shooting in the dark here as i m not familiar with icc but the idea is to make sure the linker puts thr s path on the runtime linker s search path before the one on the ramdisk so that thr gets found there first

1614914
accessor	properties
most importantly if accessing the properties ever evolves beyond simply returning the reference of a field certain actions in the properties accessor then clearly you do not want to chase all instances in your code where you dereferenced the properties before passing it into various methods

1614918
base	fractions
in base 2 1 10 is the infinitely repeating fractions

1614925

1614932
subtraction	multiplication
cpus can do subtraction and multiplication in 1 op whereas memory lookups if they miss the cache can take a couple orders of magnitude longer

1614978
lisp	scheme
the general lisp idea is the same for common lisp or scheme or emacs lisp or clojure but the specifics will be different - so keep that in mind if reading graham s book which focuses mostly on common lisp with some mentions of scheme specifics. on lisp is probably not the best beginner book but it s worth going through it and just skimming over specifics you re not ready to follow in detail yet to see what is there particularly with regard to macros which on lisp really explores

1614986
children	parent
visually you were able to distinguish the parent group from the children item by giving the children padding

1615069
getter	setter

i put a lock on the whole function which allows to either read or write but i still get errors such as

1615122
jms	nms
unfortunately nms does not have support at least not yet for the queuebrowser api available in jms from java

1615127
width	height
when i try to do the same with css the div collapses to the size of the content rather than then height width specified

1615141
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
add padding and margin otherwise the browser ignores the height and width

1615158
cvs	rcs
cvs is a system that is layered ontop of rcs to extend the functionality to a bunch of files ie a project

1615247
width	height
setting them to display inline turns them into inline elements which don t play nicely with width height and other box model properties that are meant for block elements which the div is by default

1615311
inherited	properties
as such it inherited all the methods events and properties of a dataset

1615320

ie if i create a div containing markup can i measure its intended width and height without appending it to the dom

1615629

build up a list of nodes at the root level 0 iterate over each node in turn and look for direct children whose parent node is the node we are currently looking from level 1 when finished with level 0 move on to iterating level 1 and so on until you have no remaining unvisited nodes

1616367
children	parent
if you start at the root node and only visit the parent children of nodes you have already visited there is no way to traverse the tree such that you visit a node before visiting its ancestors

1616374

pascal delphi and now java and php

1616375
children	parent
if you have links to all children and to the parent as well then non-recursive algorithm is rather trivial

1617105
serializable	deserialization
i naã vely tried xstream to serializable a simple object created in jython and translated to java with pyobject s __tojava__ method but the result was expectedly pretty much gibberish because of xstream s heavy use of reflection it finds all jython s internals - and deserialization doesn t work maybe because of jython s dynamically loaded proxy classes or some other implementation details that i m really not familiar with.

1617126
hash	salt
the hash should include a salt that is changed each time the user s password changes

quicksort	heapsort
by comparison comparing strings sorted using heapsort or quicksort would be o nlogn on average with o n space where n is the larger string s length

1617194
quicksort	heapsort
three if you include the short circuit associated with range reduction. so ultimately it boils down to whether a quicksort heapsort or a radix sort would be better

1617261
int	boolean
example joel s answers passes int 1 or 0 to the client where you d arguably expect bit boolean

1617265
hash	salt
of course since you d obviously be hashing the password with salt and storing just the hash you couldn t know the actual length anyway

now during your presentation loop you iterate through your array to get the blog post so functions such as count will also give you the number of blog entries and when you display each entry you just iterate through the comments element

1617930

like i said i doubt it will make any difference because i m sure that drawimage checks the width and height of the bitmap and if there s no resizing needed just calls this overload

1617989
cpu	processors
i wonder if your fundamental problem is simply that your worker threads are very cpu intensive and hence rarely reach a point where they would naturally let go of the processors for example by doing some io or sleeping. if such is the case then you might include some calls to yield in those workers hence giving other threads more of a chance

1618019
vim	emacs
i don t know about emacs but i would recommend learning vim for a beginner in a heartbeat

1618025
cvs	svn	tortoisegit	svn

1618029
width	height
if you create an html element with a fixed width and height then yes - you can know the width and height

1618029

1618244
integer	unsigned
further originally had size_t an unsigned integer type being compared for values less than zero

1618274
jobs	cron
are not executed before cron jobs so a lot of environment variables that you normaly have in the command line will be missing

1618274
jobs	cron
regarding input and output there is obviously no user interaction for cron jobs so the programs should not expect input if they do provide it from an input file or directly in the script and any output should be redirected into a log file

1618276
postgresql	mysql
i don t believe that there s any silver bullet tool that would convert all of your queries from being mysql to postgresql compatible

1618290
public	protected
you will only have access to public and protected classes and methods however unit testing usually only tests public apis

1618295

1618562
min	max
the basic premise is that i m getting the duration of time between the first and last session of the target courseid and then i m subtracting the duration of any sessions that were not of the specified courseid but where the session request time fell within the min and max request times of the targeted courseid

1618597
versioning	upgrade
when they upgrade my application supports upgrade from any previous versioning

1618597
versioning	upgrade
so at versioning 5.1 the default was foo in 5.2 the default is bar and that is the only difference between the two versioning and the upgrade step is simply an update statement followed of course by the versioning metadata change ie

1618597
versioning	upgrade
to repro a customer complaint simply by running the upgrade sequence and stopping at the versioning i m interested in

1618597
versioning	upgrade
because the latest versioning of foo might have been upgrade 2 or 3 versioning ago and it wasn t changed since i need to look at the upgrade script for that versioning

1618599
trac	mantis
you can import your mantis bugs into trac with mantis2trac

1618621
udp	tcp
essentially you d have to build some overhead on top of udp to check what packets have been received tagging each packet with a unique id -- everybody who s tried to go this route will agree that more often than not you find yourself more or less duplicating the tcp streaming infrastructure on top of udp.

1618622
udp	tcp
once you ve decided which one to use you can write a server process the console application that listen to a specific port tcp or udp port depending on what you ve chosen that will serve your client process the asp.net application

but after an hour of googling and trying different scripts i have yet to find anything that successfully converts my rcs project tree to cvs

1619742
gif	png
png better compression ratios than gif some issues on some browsers like transparency on ie6

1619742
gif	png
of these gif is probably the least and png the most due to the compression algorithm with jpg in the middle

1619749
gif	png
if you have more than 256 colors then you will need png but if you are using less than that then why not just use gif and get the advantage of support across more browsers if that is an issue

1619757
powerpc	i386
will print like powerpc or i386 or x86_64 depending on the machine

1619892
aggregate-functions	sum	min	max
one important one that you missed was aggregate-functions sum average min max count etc

1619892
min	max
at least the database should be really good at doing min max count on indexed columns

1619925
folder	directory
make sure you are in the directory that contains the mypack folder

1619938
objectdatasource	formview
in a page i wish to display the information for the currently logged in user inside a formview powered by an objectdatasource

to get any reliable form of data you will need to pause the action until the ajax post goes through - the page will usually be terminated before that can happen

1619997
serializable	deserialization
since the serializable and deserialization of both of these objects are identical to the parent object i have implemented a standard xml serializable interface on the parent object

1619997
serializable	deserialization
the serializable works great but the deserialization of doesn t work because the deserializer calls the parents stub read file function instead of abcfile or xyzfile s

1620004

basically you fork in the child process redirect stderr and call exec call waitpid in the parent process and get the return value of dialog and if there was no error read the file to which you redirect stderr

1620110
put	get
i know this can be done but can t figure out how to setup the editor where to put the extensibility assembly to get it to work

1620112
stdout	stderr
this means you will have to capture stderr not stdout

1620112
waitpid	execvp	waitpid	fork	execvp	fork
so even if the above work i would highly recommend using a combination of pipe fork execvp fdopen and waitpid to get the result you re after

1620132
pull	push
however one of the things i d like to be able to do is to pull or push changes from the laptop to desktop or vice versa without first checking them in to the p4 branch being synced with git

1620281
interbase	firebird
another well supported approach as others have said would be firebird interbase

1620293
put	get
replace all content in the current site with tags and then put the different language in file or db tables sniff the users desired language do you have registered users who can make a preference or do you want to get the browser language tag or is it going to be url dot-com dot-fr dot-de that make the choice and then replace the tags with the target language

1620377
hide	show
i m trying to show and hide content

1620377

the way this example sits right now if i take the last closing div and move it up after the closing p tag it works fine but show and hide all hidden content divs which is not what i m after

1620510
fseek	ftell
consult fseek and ftell

1620532

i d look at using 64-bit unsigned integer with 2 bits for counting up to 2 occurrences and the extra 12 bits to add an overflow flag and to count up to 3 occurrences of e t a o i n s r h l d

1620551
post	get
if you re expecting an integer as a year get it from the post superglobal as

1620552

have a look at data.ratio which provides an easy way to test the equality of rational-numbers and automatically calculates the numerator and denominator of a fractions in its reduced form

1620579
width	height
some height width is based on the screen size so i can calculate the size using

1620585
inherited	properties
there isn t a direct mechanism to have one datatemplate inherited the properties of another one

1620587
serializable	deserialization
then you can use for instance the xmlserializer class to handle the serializable deserialization

1620610
libxml2	libxslt
you could do it in python with the libxml2 and libxslt modules.

1620611
hide	show
and the link to show hide the .login div is

1620611
hide	show
but this link only toggles the div to show and hide but i want it to also hide when the user clicks off the div i have a page wrapper in place but just need some help with jquery

1620653
google-chrome	safari
update just a note the google-chrome bug appears in safari too

1620732

best practice is to format the ebs volume with a filesystems that allows freezing such as xfs

1620798
ubuntu	linux
if i include the source files where is the normal location for writing them on the users system for linux and osx i thought usr local src but on my ubuntu machine supposedly chock-full of open source apps this directory is empty

1620905
inherited	properties
if you begin thinking about classes as fulfilling roles rather than just being a bundle of methods and properties then you can begin assigning multiple roles to classes using interfaces - which is not possible using straight inherited in c# as you can only inherited from a single class

1620975
equals	gethashcode
when you implement you must implement gethashcode so that any two equals objects have the same hashcode

1620989
websphere	ibm
it was my impression that it was licensed only as part of another ibm product like websphere mq or one of the rational tools which would mean you would have to license the other product on the machine before installing the jre and you would use the installer for the other produce to get the jre onto the machine

1621108
hash	md5
the next step up from that is digest authentication which doesn t require ssl because the username password are sent using an md5 hash

1621166
stdout	stderr
i would like to capture stderr and stdout separately in tk tcl

1621222
maven	pom.xml
while adding a full-fledged pom.xml to the project would defintely be the best approach this is a major chunk of work and inflicts maven on the project where the other users would prefer not to use it

1621236
versioning	upgrade
if you have a versioning of the server which is at least 1.5 as mentioned by chotchki and your repository has been created with such a versioning or upgrade the property svn mergeinfo is added to any directory in which a merge has occurred

1621239
listview	gridview
there is a strange bug in listview gridview in wpf when the selectionmode is set to single

1621283

use spy++ to find out what windows messages are sent to the window when it s shown and you physically click it with the mouse and then use sendmessage to send those messages directly

1621306
serializable	deserialization
we use xml serializable deserialization extensively in our project to pass data between multiple application

1621358

see this question safari doesn t set cookie but ie firefox does

1621596
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i ve checked other browsers and firefox google-chrome and safari all offer to save the password just fine

1621655
versioning	upgrade
overall i also belive that script based upgrade using metadata versioning is supperior to diff based upgrade because of reasons of testing and source control i had already talked about in the link to q1525591

1621659
ubuntu	linux
i have ubuntu linux

1621681
background-color	transparency
have you tried setting background-color transparency

groovy	gsp
groovy - gsp no grails at all

1621719
getter	setter
- one setter and one getter element.get for anything

1621730
lxml	beautifulsoup
the most popular in python is beautifulsoup and indeed lxml comes with it -- with lxml 2.0.3 or later you can use beautifulsoup as the underlying parser then proceed just as if the document had parsed correctly -- but i find it simpler to use beautifulsoup directly

1621730
lxml	beautifulsoup
the logic in lxml or beautifulsoup in lxml clothing is not very different just the spelling and capitalization of the various navigational operations changes a bit

1621739
sproutcore	cappuccino
fwiw i find sproutcore to be easier to work with than cappuccino if you re interested in heavier non-progressive enhancement frameworks

1621742
ada	pascal
pascal ada etc. so is assembly

1621743
struts	wicket	jsf	wicket
spring mvc can also easily scale up and be as complex as you need letting you switch from jstl to jstl with tiles or struts or jsf or wicket

1621745
versioning	upgrade
it is the job of each script to perform the upgrade for that specific versioning

1621745
versioning	upgrade
so when you find yourself needing to upgrade a client from versioning 130 to 180 you can safely apply the sql scripts in order and you will arrive at the correct destination

1621750
firefox	safari
on my joomla website the joomla poll extension down right or any other joomla poll only works in firefox safari and all the other browser but not in ie8 or lower versions

1621757
gmail	hotmail
the big ones are yahoo gmail aol hotmail etc

1621773
filtering	grouping
texture filtering is the algorithm by which a pixel or grouping of pixels within the texture are fetched and possibly combined in order to produce the result of a sampling of a texture

1621866
post	get
since mvc does not support overloading by action name unless you have a get post pair one with no arguments you could just check the nameid parameter and see if it is empty null before using it

1621879
pull	push
one branch can not be tracked both with svn via git-svn and with git via push pull

1621930
versioning	upgrade

1621968
drawrect	imagenamed
uiimage imagenamed navbar.png drawrect rect

1622097
width	height
alternatively all modern browsers and ie 9 support new css units relative to viewport height vh and viewport width vw

1622185
versioning	upgrade
for a released product you d probably want to have a set of tests that can deal with a versioning 1.0 database to make sure it can upgrade successfully to versioning 1.1 for example

1622193
folder	directory
installing setuptools in a folder created by virtual-python in a directory that is replicated between all the servers solved it

1622214
mockups	balsamiq
use tools such as balsamiq mockups for that here are many other similar tools

1622221
linqdatasource	entitydatasource
i recommend you look into linqdatasource entitydatasource the new domaindatasource the new queryextender and how these work with any iqueryable source

1622239
width	height
as this inherits from window you can set the height and width on this container

1622271
client-side	server-side
the client however only has the xsd xml schema file exposed by your service at its disposal - it will create a client-side class that has the same data signature on the wire - the same fields by the same name and type - but it cannot magically recreate any functions and or methods your server-side code has

1622291
gif	png
it may just be the tools i m using but gif files usually seem to be a bit smaller than a comparible png but using them just seems so 1987.

1622298
getter	setter
having read this question on generating getter and setter in visual studio and tried somewhat the techniques described i have failed miserably to graduate beyond the longhand way of writing getter and setter

1622298
getter	setter
while i recognize the conceptual advantage of encapsulation private members of a class in this case writing 25 getter and setter is a waste of space and my time

1622327
punctuation	words
i tried using b but bsor will match a sentence like mary s organ is broken. ie it treats punctuation as a words boundary and starts matching after them

1622343
filtering	grouping	sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping
this provides sorting and grouping but not filtering

1622350
hide	show
i m a jquery noob--using easyslider 1.7--buttons are over the slider--so effects muddle the jquery...using simple show hide right now and works fine

isapi	iirf
you can use your configuration as is in ionic s isapi rewrite filter iirf

1622413
getter	setter
after creating your member variables plus the getter and setter of these member variables you create a property for each getter setter pair

1622413
getter	setter
you can call it whatever you want because you have to specify the getter and setter for this property

1622414
qpushbutton	qwidget
you just need to create your qpushbutton or any qwidget indicate its parent qwidget and then display it

1622414

1622480
profiling	benchmarking
profiling give the best benchmarking since they diagnose all your code however they slow it down a lot

1622494
rdf	owl
if these relationships are expressible as rdf and owl you can use a tool with a sparql endpoint such as jena or a reasoner such as pellet

1622500
javadb	hsqldb
in java for example you could use an in-memory database like hsqldb javadb and use the featuers of that

1622525
getter	setter
i realize this goes against the rule of thumb that data should be encapsulated privately with getter and setter so that if the design of the class changes users of the class are immune to the changes

1622578
soappy	suds
actually by just changing the library from suds to soappy everything started working with no other modifications

1622578
soappy	suds
i skipped soappy because it seemed to have been abandoned and more complex to install compared to suds

1622639
margin	text-align
the key is text-align center on the parent and a margin 0 auto on the inner element

1622649
g++	gcc
the gnu compiler collection which includes gcc and g++ are a prime example of a portable cross compiler with hundreds of supported cpu types

1622650
x86	64bit
for example gcc can be configured in this manner so that i can run the compiler on a 32-bit x86 system but produce 64bit code for an x64 system and that s just the tip of the iceberg

1622651
serializable	deserialization
you need two steps - serializable deserialization which converts an object to a representation which can be stored on disk

1622651
fileoutputstream	objectoutputstream
first obtain a fileoutputstream then pass that to the constructor of a cipheroutputstream then pass that to the constructor of an objectoutputstream

1622660

i am implementing a few sharepoint lists that require a file upload putting the file in the list directory under a folder called lists listname recordid filename.ext

1622882
post	get
it s a school-related wicket app with reporting and editing and also a servlet which is used by automated clients to get post data via https

1622927
postgresql	mysql
there s no benefit to ordering rows that aren t the final result set when the query isn t using top or limit for mysql postgresql

1622994
put	get
this will almost certainly put you in a position of requiring you to support your customers and get them up and running with your api

1622997
width	margin
the margin is throwing things out in ie6 because it s being applied to outside the width of the area specified and pushing the entire section outward where the above width style on div#target is unable to account for

google-chrome	safari
google-chrome is also based on webkit the rendering engine behind safari

1623142
post	get

1623152
mouse	keyboard
well for mouse keyboard events on the page s dom or the window you can detect

1623159
post	get
the problem was that my form tag had no way to know that it was supposed to be post so it always defaulted to get

1623185
put	get
unlike an nsdictionary which returns keys in essentially random order you get them back as you put them in

1623217
hide	show
i want to hide show the page headers based on the page number

1623229
post	get
if your server-side uri wasn t called as a result of an explicit click on a link form get post etc

1623229
post	get
if you re trying to return an error message for a form and expect to get back the post you shouldn t be saving the state of the original post

1623252
post	get
i tried changing post to get but still facing the same issue

1623256

it s similar to order of operations that you learned in algebra division multiplication subtraction addition

1623379
win64	windows
however even if you re writing for windows you ll want to take this problem into account - win64 does enforce alignment requirements

1623398
queue	fifo
a and many other searching algorithms use a priority queue instead of a fifo queue

1623414
typedef	struct
one solution as others mentioned is to add a typedef before the struct declaration however since this is c++ according to the question s tag and not c a more idiomatic and shorter way would be to just drop the trailing string

1623419
g++	gcc
this actually compiles too when i tested with both gcc and g++

1623443
google-chrome	firefox
happens in google-chrome and firefox haven t tried ie but i expect the same

they talk about building on top of dxcore which is the base that coderush is built on

1624588

1624602
floor	sqrt
to round to the nearest integer just compute t floor sqrt 4n using the algorithm above

this means that lock contention can be reduced since while multiple threads may call malloc or free concurrently they ll only contend if they share the same arena

1624744

hide	show
if you don t have the information available at the outline scope to determine what links to hide and show then you ll have to find a way to fail gracefully when a file does not exist

1625154
post	get
then you could think about how those objects will interact with each other for example a post object may contain an array of comment objects and how they will handle the basic crud create read get update delete operations

1625189
folder	directory
i m assuming the following the jar file in your lib directory contains java sources has a gwt.xml file has a client folder next to the gwt.xml file and is for the client side of your project

1625263

collabnet	svn
slik svn is a nice build and doesn t require a registration like collabnet

1625431
jobs	cron
i think you could use cron jobs

1625607
hash	hmac
each object will contain a property called hmac that will contain a hash of the object s values itself but excluding the hmac field

1625662
bazaar	git
git subversion bazaar and mercurial are all supported

1625674
children	parent
as you pointed out you can use the pluginmanagement in the parent pom for the configuration of the plugin but if you really want to execute a plugin goal in children modules and not in the parent you might have good reasons to do this but most of time plugins won t have much effet on a module with a pom packaging that doesn t have any content you ll have to reference plugins in the plugins element in the children

1625691
button	checkbox
i m struggling to do multi-select for deletion not checkbox just the standard - delete button

1625805

width	height
and of course if you re using flash the application you can just click the stage and then go to the properties panel and set the width height and background color

1625818

1625876
public	protected

1626085
children	parent
this is not coolâ i want the parent #wrapper element s height to get the bigger height of the two children

1626122
width	margin
the ie box model actually works the way you would want once you declare the width of an element that s the width and then it subtracts from the inner width of the element the padding margin and border to give you the declared width

1626122
width	margin
all of the other browsers do the opposite they set the element width to the declared width and then add the margin padding and border

1626136
post	get
the form values will be available in either the _post variable or the _get variable depending on how you submitted the form whether the mode attribute of your html form tag was set to post or get

boost	stl
also i think stl and or boost has a foreach method

1626150
setinterval	settimeout
if the issue is that you don t know how to get the page to poll the server every x seconds you can do this with javascript using settimeout function milliseconds and setinterval function milliseconds

1626275
onfocus	onblur
to accomplish that you can use the two events onfocus and onblur

1626288
hash	salt
one simple approach would be to compute the sha-1 hash of the customer name plus some hard-coded salt

1626307
spaces	delimiter
both these productions are defined as containing multiple values of the appropriate type delimiter by spaces

1626309
int	chars

post	get
now if you don t need to use get in the result form just change the method to post and it will work fine

1626497
mouseleave	mouseenter
it might be that having something like mouseenter mouseleave events would solve this but they re not yet in a w3c recommendation

1626497
mouseleave	mouseenter
edit to be clear mouseenter and mouseleave are in the dom level 3 events working draft

1626532
setinterval	settimeout
use settimeout instead of setinterval

1626605
post	get
additional steps may be needed to get nant to recognize the sdk please refer to this page brook s blog post

1626607
textblock	itemscontrol
since the ivalueconverter suggestion did not work due to the xpath engine doing a pre-coercion here s what i suggest you do instead of binding to a single textblock bind to an itemscontrol instead and define the itemtemplate for the itemscontrol to be as follows

1626724
int	chars
you can get the unicode values as int making up the string via string.codepointat or get the chars via charat followed by a getnumericvalue for each chars

1626738
width	height
since you re using a background image a for the button give the button a height and width otherwise it will display as a small gray blip because there are no words on the button

1626740
post	get
in the 2nd post of the thread he mentions registry entries that he deleted to get it to work msdn help corrupt or missing

1626770
put	get
if you put those two together you ll get something that s unique for the moment but is subject to change at any time

1626787
division	multiplication
at least multiplication and division of several rows would be easy

1626837
post	get
however it may be more flexible to initiate an execution via a post get a receipt a number id whatever and then perform a get using that 5 mins later and perhaps retry given that your procedure won t take exactly 5 mins every time

1626882
put	get	post	put	post	get
try loading the path inside of another page if you re using get put the variables into the string if you re using post try posting synchronously with a test form

post	get
if anyone decides to add the handling for generics and arrays please send me an updated copy so i can post it back on my blog and you ll get an honorable mention

1626954
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
the easiest way would be to use a objectinputstream objectoutputstream on client server side and then the client trying a read from the stream

1626966
children	parent
so the methods that the children must have are declared in the parent but not implemented

1626969
outputstream	inputstream
send the data using the connections inputstream and outputstream

1626983
persistent	transient
but when i try to persistent the entity with this field s value null an undeclaredthrowableexception caused by invocationtargetexception caused by propertyvalueexception not-null property references a null or transient value exception is raised because system is trying to hit the database with null value on a non-nullable field

none of the other browsers -- opera safari firefox google-chrome -- have this issue

1627255
width	height
you have to resize your object tag as well i just had the same problem i had signed the onsizechanged event and changed the height and width of the container div however in ie6 that didn t worked so a co-worker told me that in ie6 you need to resize the object as well so place an id on your tag and use it on this

there is the .classpath file in the project root that defines which directory are source folder

1627453
children	parent
create a single root representing the entire screen and give parent pointers to their children

1627453
children	parent
just add a my.root add pointers from parent to children and traverse

1627467
hide	show
i can use simple show hide script to get the paragraph from the first div to show and hide properly but once i add more image divs to the mix the code either opens only the first image s or all the at once

1627509
hide	show
since the jquery show hide functions alter the element.style and not

1627518
inherited	properties
as a workaround you can use the designer to create a none generic usercontrol with a public type properties and then create a generic class that inherited from it and passes t into the base classes type properties

1627521
setinterval	settimeout
what i intended with this method was to have a delay using setinterval or settimeout however that makes the whole script fail pretty badly

1627531
webstorm	aptana
if you re focussing on pure client code then i find webstorm to be an excellent javascript html ide - even better than aptana

1627582
post	get

1627653
knuth-morris-pratt	rabin-karp	boyer-moore	rabin-karp	boyer-moore	knuth-morris-pratt

1627660
superclass	subclassing
i m trying to invoke a method that takes a superclass as a parameter with subclassing in the instance

1627689
spaces	delimiter
the key difference here is that the search term is just a fragment of the column content that need not be delimiter by any special characters or white spaces

1627689
spaces	delimiter
basically you just pass on which of the available indexes you want to query and the search terms fragments spaces delimiter

1627689
jtextfield	jtable
but the results are fantastic i currently have a sample data set of approximately 500.000 records with 8 columns indexed and my test application triggers a search across all 8 columns for the contents of a jtextfield on every keystroke while being edited and can update the results display jtable in real-time

1627692
onfocus	onblur	onchange	onfocus	onchange	onblur
or i need to do the onfocus save value onblur compare and possibly call onchange but only if onchange was not already called because the user just navigated away by clicking vs say a keyboard trigger

1627743
subnet	packets
given that these machines are on the same subnet there is no router in the way which could be dropping packets

1627754
hide	show
set it to false where you use hide and true where you currently use show and see if that makes any difference

1627764
nstimer	nsrunloop
i ve also thought about creating a separate thread nsrunloop to run a nstimer second-counter keeping it away from ui interactions

1627764
nstimer	nsrunloop
also i m not sure if this would work accurately in the event the cpu gets pegged by another application photoshop rendering a large image etc... causing my nsrunloop to be put on hold for long enough to mess up its nstimer

i am a python newbie and i am not sure why python implemented len obj max obj and min obj as a static like functions i am from the java language over obj.len obj.max and obj.min

1628230
post	get
if you have the ajax use get rather than post this is simpler then you can test the response by just viewing the page with the appropriate query string

1628232
pull	push
so there you have it the idea seems to be don t pull the display aspects of the model into the controller push the model display stuff out to the view processing machinery

1628241
mp3	wav
if you ask if a uncompressed wav which contains pcm data is better than mp3 then yes but the question sometimes is how much this better really matters to the human ear and how much postprocessing you have to perform on that data

1628257
g++	gcc

max and min are the oddbal exceptions

1628295
hash	salt
encrypting isn t a good idea - salt hash the password to do a one-way thing

1628318
min	max
on the other hand min and max do work on iterators which gives them a use apart from any particular object

1628318
min	max
if a container is sorted on the same key that you re searching min max are o 1 operations instead of o n and the only way to expose that is by a different inconsistent method

1628318
min	max
you can t do that with min max or len though since they re not methods of the object they operate on

1628360
rsa	dsa
it uses rsa but it should be quite simple to switch over to dsa

inherited	subclassing
we have is-a extends derives subclassing and simply inherited

1628509
inherited	subclassing
i most often uses a subclassing b very direct or a inherited from b modestly more circumlocutory

1628509
inherited	subclassing
is-a is a relationship constraint that inherited must respect liskov s principle and holds between instances left side and classes right side -- so you can say x is-a foo when x is an instance of foo or any subclassing of foo but bar is-a foo where they re both classes seems wrong it would cause confusion in languages where classes are also instances of meta classes such as python

1628514
inherited	subclassing
i like to say derived because it strongly implies the class subclassing relationship but would be reasonably accurate in the more exotic cases like multiple inherited interface implementation and mixins

1628517
folder	directory
ideally reusable apps should be outside of your project directory anyway so consider creating a folder such as etc django lib to contain reusable apps and appending that to sys.path in your wsgi handler too

1628519
fiddler	pac
you should find that fiddler now registers as the system proxy using a simple pac script rather than manually specifying 127.0.0.1 8888

1628524
outputstream	inputstream
properties.store uses an outputstream and properties.load uses an inputstream which you could probably subclass to filter the unicode escapes but that seems an awful lot of work for what looks like dubious benefit

1628549
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i don t quite follow what navigation problem you re having but if there s no navigation bar when you need one i suspect you need to create and add a uinavigationcontroller somewhere that you re adding a uiviewcontroller subclass

xlsx	xlsm
i d recommend using a library such as the one suggested above to work with it as an xml file and distribute it as a xlsx xlsm based file

i d like to use the most canonical way to find icons mime-type file type descriptions and associated applications on both kde and gnome and i d like to avoid any shelling out to the command line and low-level routines as well as avoiding re-inventing the wheel myself no parsing the mime-types file and such

1629172
kde	gnome
i don t care about qt in particular any more i m just looking for the most cannonical way to find the mime type via c++ c function calls on both kde and gnome especially gnome since that s where things confuse me most

1629172

1629657
testcase	fixture
testcase class per fixture

1629679
implements	extends
the trick here is that you need to create a new authenicationtoken maybe extends usernameandpasswordauthenicationtoken and as emills says you need to then implements a new authenciationprocessingfilter to map the request values to the token and submit these to the authenicationmanager

1629681

1630038
hide	show
if this is about the scrollbars you mentioned that in your comment you can hide show them using stylesheets - try the following

1630095
allocator	stl
the stl allocator design makes it difficult to do this

1630095
allocator	stl
some stl containers have a constructor that lets you pass an instance of an allocator but not all containers support this

1630228
int	double
the compiler will implicitly convert the int to a double

1630238
spoofing	traffic
otherwise anyone spoofing your service could use any certificate made out to an arbitrary domain machine name and get your traffic - not what you want

1630243
listview	gridview
i do google search asp.net offer gridview and listview but they all require a datasource which mean that table directly bind to the database

sml	prolog	ocaml	sml	ocaml	prolog	lisp	sml	lisp	prolog
production compilers are often written in c or c++ for performance reasons but languages such as ocaml sml prolog and lisp are arguably better for prototyping the language

1630381
ocamllex	ocamlyacc
there are ports for other languages such as ocamllex ocamlyacc and many other similar tools.

1630395
gridview	objectdatasource
my advice is to use a gridview with which you can use an objectdatasource which can take its underlying data from a class method that you specify

1630469
folder	dir
from outlook files are opened to a temp dir on your drive you could check to see if its in that folder vba source as follows

hide	show
put both levels in the same pane indenting the subordinate objects under each superordinate object and usually providing controls to hide and show the subordinate objects for each superordinate object

1630591
ilist	icollection
arrays of t are assignable to icollection of t as an array of t implements ilist of t

1630591
ilist	icollection
ilist of t itself extends icollection of t so you can simply assign an array to an icollection

1630620
width	height
try to set the width and height of dummy_tabs2 before dolayout

1630671
ant	maven
i have built a script to migrate ant builds to maven

in addition it can be tough to get feedback or to perform code review practices that i have found useful in my development experience

1630701
firefox	safari
our website www.phototulip.com displays fine in safari and firefox but not in ie7

1630705
getter	setter
well since no one mentioned it adding an underscore to member variable allows you to name your getter and setter with the conceptual name of the variable

1630737
error-handling	exception-handling
this is exactly what exception-handling were designed for to replace error codes with a more robust and structured error-handling mechanism

1630740
int	double
now for your problem actually as you noticed you will have to define both flavors of the operators int and double rather than using a generic template

1630740
int	double
but if you use boost.operators you only provide complex operator int and complex operator double and the stand-alone versions will be automatically deduced

1630768
kde	gnome
check the documentation if your desktop framework kde or gnome and where fedora configured the framework to put the shared files

the is required to make opera not show the broken image placeholder

1630859
opera	firefox
this worked for me in opera firefox and ie8

1630862
postgresql	mysql
as i ve been looking into the differences between postgresql and mysql it has struck me that if what i read is to be believed mysql should be disclaimer by reading the rest of this sentence you agree to read the next paragraph as well the laughingstock of the rmdb world it doesn t enforce acid by default the net is rife with stories of mysql-related data loss and by all accounts and the query optimizer is a joke

1630908
prepare	execute
both the prepare and execute statements will return false on error

1630939
post	get
in a traditional web application when everything was a post or get it s easy to handle errors and session expiration and present friendly messages to users

1630947
innodb	myisam
use innodb by default the only reason to use myisam is for full text search

1630949
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
i imagine it like dropdownlistfor of items with checkbox

division	multiplication
you need to put parentheses around the multiplication like to make sure it s performed before the division takes place

1631139
put	get
the data repository can check for the existence of the data in the cache and return that or get the data from the ws or db put it in the cache and then return it

1631147
actionscript	mxml
you ll see here though that you still need to use a bit of mxml to init the actionscript class

1631157
ssl	https
this means that you must configure the server to force ssl usage by redirecting http requests to https or not accept unencrypted connections at all for that url

1631182

postgresql is completely free and is a suitable replacement for mysql

1631330

httprequest	httpresponse
work of all the classes have a tendency to be ones that tie you to things like io fileinfo directoryinfo or iis httpcontext httprequest httpresponse

1631477
client-side	server-side
as you can see the generated html is correct and has the semantic you want so this is not a server-side issue but a client-side one

1631483
x86	64bit
when i run the deployed application built for x86 on 64bit system i now get badimageformatexception immediately before the application even starts

1631483

as you can see i calculate actual size of data struct with the code int actuallen sizeof chars + sizeof int

1631502
redmine	bugzilla
i ve used bugzilla for a while but redmine get my vote

1631571
serializable	deserialization
ixmlserializable will allow you to customize xml serializable deserialization

1631605
firefox	safari
parser errors are common i have often also had a case where firefox works fine but safari pukes on the same script because of missing extra commas

1631702
serializable	deserialization
it might be prudent to simply write an archival class that wraps your storage and provides methods for serializable and deserialization of primitives and then an open ended method that you can specialize as needed

1631873
stdout	stderr
i would like to copy stdout and stderr of my perl script to a file while retaining it also onscreen and preferrably using some trick inside the script itself

1631877
relaxng	schematron
however xml schema is far from being perfect just try to read the spec or a book on xml schema... and many alternatives have been developed since then schematron examplotron relaxng

1631878
int	chars
sbyte byte short ushort int uint long ulong chars float

1631900
rss	feed
i agree with craig to try using an rss feed reader perhaps a user control widget unless you need the blog fully integrated with the rest of your site

1631900
rss	feed
if the blog is a separate entity website though definitely just rip from the rss feed into your custom container

1631906
listview	gridview
in my wpf application i am using listview gridview and i implemented a functionality that is associated to mouse double click

1631916
cpython	ironpython
in practice it will be immediately closed in some versions of cpython but closed only when the garbage collector gets around to it in jython ironpython and probably some future version of cpython

1631967
onsubmit	onbeforeunload
perhaps you could handle onsubmit and set a flag that you later check in your onbeforeunload handler

1631987
width	height
i would like to get the absolute position of each of the text nodes within the svg document the svg documents have width 743.75 and height 1052.5

1632037
put	get
this is not an ideal situation but if you put things into a queue then browsers will begin to timeout after a while or users get impatient and click the submit button over and over as it is taking too long

1632045
strdup	malloc
fact is that npapi takes care of the allocated string from that point on and when tries to destroy it it cannot since strdup uses malloc and not npn_memalloc

1632058
getter	setter
i can t decide which approach is better for creating objects with a large number of fields 10+ all mandatory the constructor approach of the getter setter

1632071
hash	salt
instead store an irreversible hash of the password and a random salt

1632101

return different renderers at gettablecellrenderercomponent jtable table object value boolean isselected boolean hasfocus int row int column according to your business logic

1632119
unix	bsd
i could launch my beloved turbo c in dosbox an ubiquitous enough platform but i want to learn c such that i can develop something that compiles naturally on any bsd or unix platform

1632145
min	max
the c++ standard template library stl declares the min and max functions in the standard c++ algorithm header

1632158
getter	setter
if you use a var then you can create your own getter and setter and if the value is already set don t change it

1632163
min	max
i always use the min and max macros for ints

1632163
min	max
the big gotcha with min and max is that they re not functions even if they look like them

1632163
min	max
as such its best practice in my org to never call min or max with things that aren t a literal or variable

1632175
min	max
std min and std max are template functions defined in header which work on any type with a less-than operator so they can operate on any data type that allows such a comparison

1632178
min	max
i would prefer the c++ min max functions if you are using c++ because they are type-specific

1632178
min	max
also the c++ min max functions will work with user-defined types as long as you have defined operator for those types

1632190
min	max
std min and std max are templates

1632194
min	max
min and max are template functions that allow comparison of any types given a binary predicate

1632196
postgresql	mysql
postgresql has no commercial version and is much safer legally to use than mysql plus it very similar to oracle pl sql so the skills needed for it are almost the same as oracle and easy to find

1632201
ubuntu	linux
i m trying to compile the zpipe.c example in my linux ubuntu 8.04 with gcc but i m getting some errors take a look

1632222
min	max
you just use templated std min std max in c++ and use whatever is available in c

1632228
udp	tcp
it is not clear from the code you ve provided but my guess is that you are transmitting the data using tcp as opposed to udp

1632228
udp	tcp
if you want that behavior use udp instead of tcp

1632231
int	double
your 64-bit int will be converted to double which will at least usually have a significand that s smaller than 64-bits

1632267
integer	unsigned
fmin and fmax of fminl and fmaxl could be preferred when comparing signed and unsigned integers - you can take advantage of the fact that the entire range of signed and unsigned numbers and you don t have to worry about integer ranges and promotions

1632293
cassini	iis
i m trying to run a test version of a web using the file system the cassini web server built-in to visual studio 2005 rather than iis 5.1 on my win xp dev pc

to start with open a named pipe in readonly mode fileinputstream in process1 open it in write mode fileoutputstream in process2 so anything you write in process2 will be read in process1

1632303
listview	gridview
i m having issues using a gridview as a listview s view what i want to do is fire an event when a user makes a selection from a combobox within the gridview and pass the selected item within the event

1632313
getter	setter
it looks like you re trying to merge the getter and setter created by attr_accessor

1632313
getter	setter
the reason this isn t working is because you re overriding the getter with the setter when you call alias

1632336
getter	setter
if you want to use a single getter setter method beware of using nil since you may want to set your attribute to nil

1632390

the strange thing is on my local machine running ie8 it looks great even on the server using firefox google-chrome it looks great

1632391

voip	sip
i am writing a sip server and i have it taking calls and then connecting them to a voip phone the problem is when you hang up the voip phone there s something wrong with the forwarding of the bye message where my cell phone doesn t end the call

1632499
voip	sip
here is the sip message log i replaced my server s phone number with 1234 and my cell phone s phone number with 5678 my server s ip has been replaced with x s and my voip phone s ip has been replaced with y s -

1632541
equals	gethashcode
you need to override the equals and gethashcode methods for the contains method to be able to do comparisons as you expect

1632574
equals	gethashcode
you need to override equals and gethashcode for contains to do what you expect otherwise it is using equals which is just a reference comparison

1632574
equals	gethashcode
in this case you may find it easy to implement equals and gethashcode by just passing your implementation onto string s

1632591
int	double
this is because you will have to constantly convert between nsnumber and primitive types like int double long etc

put	get
put this at the end of your bootstrap file or at the end of all your individual files and you can get a list of every file that s been included or required

1632768
equals	gethashcode
as you can see i have overridden equals and gethashcode

1632816
equals	gethashcode
you have not overridden equals and gethashcode

1632816
equals	gethashcode
the simplest fix would be to override gethashcode and equals directly rather than implementing a comparer comparers are generally only interesting when you need to supply multiple different comparison types case sensitive and case insensitive for example or when you need to be able to perform comparisons on a class which you don t control

1632817
eiffel	spec#
but if you want to do that take a look at jml spec# or eiffel

1632824
tostring	gethashcode
i overrode the tostring and the gethashcode methods and viola key lookup worked fine

1632836
firefox	safari
browsers to do this in safari or firefox preferably safari

1632842
awt	swing
i have a lot of experience with java programming gui programming with swing awt and non-gui c# programming

1632882
ssl	https
at this point you have a keystore that you can use to create the ssl socket to talk to the https web server

1632885
mouse	keyboard
if i have time to investigate and figure that out i ll repost but it might rank as a case where the return on investment isn t worth it customizing swing classes handling lower level mouse keyboard events directly etc

1632931
folder	directory
make sure that project1 is an application whose base folder is the project1 directory and that project2 is an application whose base folder is the project2 directory

1632950
inherited	properties
i have solved this problem in the past by creating a new control that inherited from radiobutton but adds a new groupname properties that is used to render the name of the control

1632957
free	malloc
if you re using low level malloc free routines zombies buy you nothing for those allocations

1632960
coalesce	isnull
i do not know about createcriteria but hibernate hql supports coalesce ifnull or isnull depending on your underlying database only in the where clause

1633017
int	boolean
the parse logic is a switch statement with some boilerplate for parsing int strings and boolean

1633020
try-catch	exception-handling
my general rule of thumb for exception-handling handling in guis is to have a try-catch block in all the event handlers that logs the exception-handling to a file and notifies the user of an error

1633024
public	protected
keywords public protected or

1633047
min	max
use std min and std max

1633077
move	drag
if you mean that you wish to extend the form in the designer to the left in order to make space for new controls i don t believe you can do it - you need to drag out the right side of the frame then select all the other controls just drag around them all with the selector tool and then drag them to the right you can also move them with right arrow key to ensure they stay at the same y position

1633112
tiff	png
did a quick google and found this link with info on saving png data instead of tiff data

1633117
submit	submission
the problem the form doesn t actually submit so i don t know how to track submission and the client wants to know the percentage of people clicking each button

1633117
post	get
i can t track actual submissions because obviously nothing gets post ed or get ed and i can t track google analytics clicks because ga only tracks clicks on links not on form buttons

1633119
gif	bmp
the icons are 28x28 16-color bmp files placed in the main resource file resources.resx the resx for the main form has the same problem and gif files don t work either

decimal	ieee
short answer types like double conform to ieee 754 which dictates data types which may have a decimal point anywhere floating

1633310
width	height
depending on your situation you may need to overide updatedisplaylist as well to properly set the actual height width positions of the children

1633363
inherited	properties
never use legacy classes any more they don t behave correctly with respect to properties and much else besides and for backwards compatibility they can t -- in python 3 legacy classes have finally been annihilated so every class is new-style without the requirement to explicitly inherited from object any more

1633471
extjs	mootools
compare the trends between jquery extjs and mootools

1633472
profiler	aqtime
aqtime s memory profiler works well for this

1633503
google-chrome	safari
i use firebug and the equivalents in safari google-chrome and ie 8 to see what s going on with the internals of a particular element on a page

1633522
width	height
height are dictated by the outer div and the height and width of the input control are 100

1633523
google-chrome	firefox
firebug is really good for getting to the bottom of wierd browser issues but generally i have ie google-chrome and firefox open when i m coding html css and i just make sure i hit the refresh button often enough in all three of them to make sure i don t get any nasty suprises after writing a pile of css

1633559
verilog	vhdl
since verilog and vhdl used for chip design fpgas and asics are similar to software development c and c++ it would appear to make sense

1633568
cells	tablecell
the same parameter can be used with tablerow and tablecell objects to format rows and cells

1633582
width	margin
an html-element s width is calculated i think as the defined width + borders + margin + padding

1633596
sudo	passwd
sudo requires a passwd which presents 2 problems

1633598
goto	break
its a label - the break statement supplies the label and this means it will be treated like a goto except that in java a break to label will take you to the end of the block declared after the label

1633608
versioning	upgrade
i had done an upgrade of the sitecore versioning and added the forms module among some other minor edits

1633666
folder	directory
because we have the externals and the directory folder structure set up this way you should in theory be able to checkout or export a solution to an empty directory and have it build successfully from scratch subject to all the necessary tools being installed and therefore teamcity or whatever your continuous integration server is should be able to also be build it from scratch

1633761
children	parent
i m having to explicitly deny access to all children in a tree when i only expect to deny access to one parent

1633804
versioning	upgrade
i have done this before with previous versioning by making an upgrade vs2010 branch and merging changes back and forth between it and the trunk vs2008

1633862
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works in firefox but not in google-chrome ie8 ie7 or safari

1633894
postgresql	mysql
if i had to support a huge number users on a reasonably simple application and had the team to build a heavily partitioned and replicated database with eventual consistency i d pick mysql over postgresql for the low level data storage building block

1633905
google-chrome	firefox
i just saw that on firefox it works fine but in google-chrome it starts the cursor from start

1633935
folder	directory
the use case is that i have a folder which site administrators can create directory in and i want to force them to only create directory in that folder

1633959
mp3	wav
load an mp3 wav file

1633959
mp3	wav
overlay another mp3 wav file ontop of it

1633959
mp3	wav
render as a new mp3 wav file

1633994
google-chrome	safari
this did not happen in google-chrome safari ie8 ie8-compatibility or ie7

1633999
put	get
i have a very small utilty app written in c# that works fine on my local machine but if i put it on a network drive and try to run it from there i get the following securityexception

1634002
super	self
there must be a problem with super invitemanager self .get_query_set here but i don t know what to use

1634032
pylons	turbogears
this is what the pylons framework uses by the way and turbogears 2 which is built upon pylons also

1634049
jndi	jta
where appserver jndi path would need to be replaced with the jndi path of the jta transaction manager that comes with your application server although you can use a standalone jta transaction manager such as jotm as well

1634049
resin	oc4j	weblogic	resin	weblogic	oc4j

this technique is the same no matter whether you use mfc windows forms wpf qt gtk fltk or any other framework

1634071
hide	show
note that if javascript was disabled by user or if an unhandled error occured while loading you will unable to show hidden elements back and even request to enable javascript in case if you hide body

1634095
uitableview	nsindexpath
a category on nsindexpath similar nsindexpath uitableview that makes it easy to use index paths to address rows columns and optionally if you want to implement them sections

1634100
pull	push
i set up gitosis but even when i can clone pull and push to the gitosis-admin repo i can t create new ones

1634139
folder	directory
for example if email messages are stored as individual files and folder are represented as directory then moving an email to the spam folder would be done as a file rename move

1634142
post	get
a control which does this would also give some feedback to the user as the upload progressed which you wouldn t get with a simple http post

1634192
mp3	wav
it doesn t support mp3 for patent reasons but libsndfile is a very nice open-source lgpl library for loading and saving audio in a variety of other audio formats including wav

1634212
width	height
but i solved my particular problem by simply redefining the subview.view setframe 0 0 width height after returning from editing

1634229
postgresql	mysql
basically once postgresql started to hit the io-seek wall mysql was long dead and xapian kept blazing fast

1634234
switching	screens
this would always display two buttons at the bottom of the screens which the user could use at any point in time to switching between the two modes

1634234
switching	screens
it would automatically handle the switching of views a and b within the main part of the screens

1634247
google-chrome	firefox
..does what you want in firefox and google-chrome - wraps the lines but preserves whitespace

1634248
postgresql	mysql
after some consideration i settled on writing a web app in python ruby or php + postgresql mysql db

1634293
post	get
when data that has been entered into html forms is submitted the form field names and values are encoded and sent to the server in an http request message using method get or post or historically via email

1634345
udp	tcp
the general advice for most real-time action based games counter-strike left4dead quake iii is to use udp ip transport protocol sending messages as unreliable packets in favor of the guaranteed delivery of tcp because of issues with resend and latency issues you can t easily control

1634345
udp	tcp
the other advice is to build a reliable udp protocol that lets you optionally gurantee delivery of udp packets while still not being able to guarantee delivery order such as a tcp stream as long as your game can handle out of order packets

1634359
strstr	substr
i am trying to find a similar function to strstr that searches a substr starting from the end towards the beginning of the string

1634374
fixed-point	fractions
the only other possibility would be to use fixed-point vector components perhaps with very limited fractions parts

1634425
hash	md5
sig unhackable signature of this api call - md5 hash

1634439
uiview	subviews
the only thing i can think of is to have the mkmapview a subviews of some uiview and catch all of the user input in this parent view scale the images on zoom and relay to the subviews

1634484
jruby	mri
i am a little confused about the state of jruby and whether it is a viable alternative to switch to from the mri

1634484
jruby	mri
i am still weighing up a lot of options including mri on windows mri or jruby on opensolaris etc

1634518
rsa	dsa
a mac can be created and verified by anyone who shares the secret key the term signature is normally reserved for public key schemes like dsa or rsa

1634518
hash	md5
i m not sure if you missed it by accident or on purpose but a method that seems on the surface to be equivalent md5 k || msg is quite insecure because a quirk in how md5 and most other hash functions are designed means that if you know h m you can easily compute h m || m2 for any m2 - so if you were using md5 k || param1 5 someone could pull this off the wire and then create md5 k || param1 5 param2 666

1634518
hmac	md5
however while md5 k || msg is probably fine you are better off using something like hmac because it was actually designed as a mac

1634525
jruby	mri
yes because all the tutorials beginner docs and most of the devs who will normally be able to help you out are assuming mri so for each issue you have you must first eliminate a jruby related cause

1634536
jruby	mri
performance in jruby still isn t quite as good as ruby 1.9 but in a lot of cases it s comparable to mri 1.8

1634574
spaces	delimiter
as a side note when using q you always have the nuclear option of using spaces as the delimiter

1634603
hide	show
you should use display none to hide things and display block to show them again or display inline

1634642
firefox	safari
it s like this on all of their examples - tested in firefox and safari at least

1634649
firefox	safari
it works on firefox and safari but with displaying issues

1634666
postgresql	mysql
i d rather suggest postgresql as a first choice but mysql is a nice product too

1634666
postgresql	mysql
an argument that may influence your decision is the big difference in licensing between the two mysql is gpl or commercial licensed including the client library postgresql is licensed under a bsd licence

1634666
postgresql	mysql
this table contains some tech points of comparison between sqlserver mysql and postgresql

1634671
postgresql	mysql
the replication story is more coherent for mysql than postgresql

1634689
int	chars
the way you have it you re reading single chars instead of int and i think you didn t intend this

1634697
vim	textmate
i use netbeans textmate and vim but usually netbeans

1634697
jruby	mri
in theory choosing jruby or mri should be inconsequential but don t hold me to that

1634738
cpu	irq
if you send the pic s io port the proper sequence using the out instruction you can map the irq in such a way that it doesn t conflict with the cpu interrupt from a floating point exception

1634743
stdout	stderr
you need to redirect stderr after stdout as in

1634778
min	max
each concrete type int32 float etc defines their own min and max values and they share no common interface for something like this

1634781
min	max
an alternative solution would be to redesign your class slightly add _isminspecified and _ismaxspecified boolean members and consult these in your contains method -- if neither a min nor a max had been specified you would always return true

1634786
min	max
there is no generic way to know the min and max value for a type

1634805
folder	directory
i ready in the book the definitive guide to windows installer phil wilson - chapter 14 - bootstrappers and temp folder that a bootstrapper should not run an msi from the temp directory because the temp folder can be removed all too easily

1634832
versioning	upgrade
i ve just received an assignment to upgrade an old delphi 3 project that i wrote in 1999 to a newer versioning and add features i previously discussed this in related questions here and here

1634852
gdk	cairo
it provides the widgets gets its message queue and internal communications from gobject relies on gdk to abstract and simplify its graphics and event communications with x11 and uses pango and cairo for text rendering and layout

1634956
queue	fifo
in the body of the handler you could use a linked list as a fifo queue to follow the order in which the rows are visited

1634968
post	get
that class will do the correct thing to send the data as either a post with parameters in entity body or as a get with parameters encoded as query string arguments

1634975
uinavigationbar	uinavigationitem
i guess the uinavigationbar displays the uinavigationitem s in a subview and you were adding your uiimageview on top of that subview

1635005
udp	tcp
tcp is easy since it is a stream but if you re using udp keep in mind the maximum size of udp packets and thus how big your message can be

1635027
pop-up	dialog
i want the simplest possible way to pop-up simple dialog in python scripts

1635027
kde	gnome
work on windows os x gnome kde

1635027
pop-up	dialog
to pop-up a simple standard dialog should require only minimal code

1635027
pop-up	dialog
essentially you re just saying pop-up a standard dialog with this text or pop-up a dialog with question x and feed response into variable y

1635027
button	checkbox
i give it the text to put in the window and or button and or checkbox it returns what the user clicked on

1635047
kde	gnome
i read that zenity is gtk+ only but i tried it in gnome and kde and it looks native in both

1635113
post	put
in rest you create a resource ie add data either by using http post if the server assigns the resource name or http put if the client is assigning the resource name

1635130
int	chars
i m using strcmp to compare chars arrays in c++ but i get the following error for every occurrence of strcmp error invalid conversion from int to const chars followed by error initializing argument 2 of int strcmp const chars const chars

1635131
struts	wicket	wicket	seam
some contenders include java server faces wicket seam spring mvc and apache struts 2

1635139
jruby	mri
jruby is definately a good alternative to mri ruby but if you are following tutorials it may just add the level of wtf as you learn that may well be counter productive but if you do go to windows jruby is probably the best way to go

1635141
rss	feed
i would like to programmatically retrieve google reader s feed stats for my own site s rss feed

1635142
jboss	weblogic
liferay sun java system portal server weblogic portal server jboss portal server gatein and many more. you can run these locally on your development machine network - so your gadget can just run locally

1635192
np-hard	np-complete
matching regular expressions with backreferences is np-hard which is at least as hard as np-complete

1635194
ant	maven
as for how to do this in netbeans - not sure off the top of my head - i usually use intellij and or eclipse and usually build the jar through ant or maven anyway

1635299
16-bit	64bit
you could create a 64bit iv from say 48-bits of random data plus a 16-bit counter

1635310
versioning	upgrade
why upgrade to a versioning that is not the latest it just guarantees an earlier next upgrade

1635327
put	get
the out put i get is

1635413
onclick	onsubmit
the onsubmit event for example the default action of this event is send the form data to the server or an onclick event on an anchor element the default event action is to follow the anchor s href

1635444
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
on the whole svn s branch and merge is still pretty weak compared to the distributed vcs family git hg bazaar darcs etc but if you follow these guidelines it does the job

1635448
width	height
oh don t forget that your new tableview should has frame with x y width properties identical to your self.view s ones and tableview s height property should be a bit smaller

1635468
mockito	easymock
why don t you try easymock or mockito

1635469
junit	jmock
junit with jmock

1635492
equals	gethashcode	equals	tostring	tostring	gethashcode
anonymous types override gethashcode equals and tostring in reasonably obvious ways - the default equality comparer for each property type is used for hashing and equality

1635514
versioning	upgrade
at some point you will have to explain why you cannot upgrade to more nearly current versioning of the software

1635546
onclick	onmousedown
i ve figured out that i can solve the problem by tracking an onmousedown event rather than an onclick event

1635548
free	malloc
if additional memory is requested successfully and the received chunk is bigger that what the malloc caller asked for the block in chunk is divided - one part is marked as occupied and returned to the caller and the other one is added to the free store

1635578
junit	mockito
it seems that mockito runs quite well on java 1.4 and junit 3 as stated in this blog post

1635588
google-chrome	firefox
it is a .net version of the openoffice google-chrome and firefox spell checker hunspell and has all these features

1635612
versioning	upgrade
but if you have time and resources to upgrade to delphi 2010 it will be better options because sooner or later versioning from delphi 2009 and later will be the standard versioning

1635619
mockito	easymock
mockito originally based on easymock s code uses similar paradigms for mocking but automates several tasks such as switching mock object states namely record replay verify reset

1635619
easymock	jmock
since your requirement is jdk 1.4.2 support that unfortunately means you can choose an old version of easymock or really old version of jmock

1635706
innodb	myisam
sfussenegger is correct in that myisam doesn t support transactions use of the mysqldialect dialect doesn t exclude the use of transactions it only means that the hdm2ddl table generation will create innodb type tables

1635726
dictionary	map
you said dictionary you probably meant either a map or an ordered map

1635805
bibtex	latex
usually whatever is inside a bibtex file gets copied verbatim to the latex source code with some formatting maybe and case changings c. such as book titles authors c

1635805
bibtex	latex
so your bibtex file encoding has to match the one used by your latex file otherwise things get funny

1635840
put	get	debian	linux
but when i put it in production linux debian + apache passenger it only accepts .gif and i get the following error for .png and .jpg

1635846
folder	directory
i am making a software that needs to only be able allow people to select files and folder using the openfiledialog that are in the same directory as the program and that are in deeper folder

1635848
notepad++	scite
notepad++ is an open source programmer s text editor for windows based on scite

1635869
strdup	malloc	free	strdup	free	malloc
the reason i m using free is because i used strdup and malloc in creating the char pointers

1635869
strdup	malloc
the reason i m using malloc is because i used strdup to begin with in most code paths

1635871
ubuntu	linux
i am setting up a linux development machine ubuntu 9.0.x

1635884
free	malloc
no if you match calls properly free for memory allocated with malloc and delete for memory allocated with new it will work fine

1635885
postgresql	mysql
because i have built the app on mysql and need to start using postgresql for gis component of my app only

vim	emacs
vi vim and emacs xemacs can be very powerful take a look if you have time

1636074
ant	maven
to sum up i strongly recomend to look up ant seam an maven parametrization profiles

1636074
ant	maven
those solutions have another advantage ant or maven script can be run in ci server like hudson and let run test simultaneously all your profiles

destination rectangle of the draw method is set to panel width and height

1636168
inherited	subclassing
your table structures are similar to what is used in joint table inherited but they certainly don t correspond to concrete table inherited where all fields of parent class are duplicated in the table of subclassing

1636182
squeak	visualworks
such are squeak and friends visualworks smalltalk x va smalltalk

1636222
hash	md5
obviously the theory is the same for an md5 method just take some sample data run it through a 3rd party md5 hash tool and then use the input output data pairs to validate that your method gives the correct output

1636258
ireport	subreports
to compile only the subreports using ireport

1636268
button	checkbox
when the checkbox is unchecked the button is disabled

1636277
stateless	stateful
i ve read some books on creating stateless websites i ve read some about stateful client applications but a lot of complexity comes along when you have to combine both

1636282
opera	firefox
what i want is that i want this portion of html code to be hidden from ie6 and ie7 but not firefox opera or ie8 but conditional comments not working properly on this portion....i am using separate css with conditional comments in the head section but conditional comments for opera are not working and also sometimes firefox shows strange behaviour

1636319
button	checkbox
in your situation however instead of changing the text of the checkbox find the button control on your page and change it s disabled property

1636361
width	height
if you re planning to use this for a favicon like the example you link to use 16 as the width the bash script will default height to the same

1636367
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
browsers that support queryselectorall safari firefox 3.5+ opera 10+ ie 8+ will return the elements in document order other browsers will currently return them in the order specified

1636434
width	height
try to give fixed width height to your checkbox whenever you fix the height width of your controls containers it becomes eaiser for layout manager to render them rather then keep on calculating and adjusting items

1636440
jython	pypy
for example google are working on optimizing python to improve performance relative to the main stream interpreter which has different performance characteristics to the iron python jython stackless and pypy implementations of python

urllib	httplib
but to do that you need to drop down to httplib instead of the more general urllib

1636708
wan	lan
on a typical lan setup where the entire lan is connected to the internet via a router each computer on the lan would share a external wan ip assigned to the router but each of them would have a internal lan ip typically 192.168

1636708
wan	lan
in that scenario all external requests by any computer on that lan would appear to come from the same wan ip

1636708
wan	lan
the router alone would be aware of which computer on the lan the request belongs to so there would be no way for your php to detect the lan ip but only the wan ip via the _server remote_addr element

1636708
wan	lan
in short the server only knows the ip of the device that sent the request regardless of whether that ip belongs to a lan wan or any other sort of network

1636723
hide	show
using the above triggers just show hide that div when you want the default value to dis appear

1636737

it s nearly impossible or at least without extreme effort to create selfcontained modules instalable like copy this folder into your modules directory not sure about django but from what i head it s simplier there.

1636739
sum	coalesce
i found coalesce sum price 0 good for always ensuring the field returned 0 if there was no result

1636760

1636884
crossover	mutation
after that you use evolutionary algorithms that use techniques inspired by evolutionary biology such as inheritance mutation selection and crossover

1636888
inherited	properties
this way my-plugin-client will inherited all properties defined in the my-plugin pom.xml and also from java-base-pom project

1636895
put	get
this all works a treat until i get to the next stage of my learning which is to perhaps put 2 variables into dosomething

1637023
put	get
you can do this with the standard java 2d graphics libraries - create a bufferedimage from the image get its graphics and use drawstring to put the text on top

1637072
bionic	libc
android s c runtime library bionic is not binary compatible with the libc which most linux distributions use

1637173
client-side	server-side
i thought i d just add that these are php debuggers and since php is a server-side language it s not going to help you debug client-side actions such as clicking a link

1637192
ubuntu	linux
i m a linux noop and i was trying to get monodevelop up and running on my ubuntu 7.1 box

1637209
rss	feed
you could use rssa.at - just put in your url and it ll create a rss feed for you

1637238
put	get
all testing will have to take place on a more modern machine. you now have to get all of the libraries and headers for cocoa foundation appkit libc etc from your target machine a ppc or x86 mac and put them somewhere that the gcc on your 68k can find

1637240
expression-blend	silverlight
i m trying to learn expression-blend and silverlight

1637271
persistent	transient
but don t confuse persistent state with transient session

1637326

it would be possible for you to execute another script with root rights through sudo but that would also require storing your user s passwd in the script to pass in to sudo which is a terrible idea from a security standpoint

1637326
chown	chmod
there are also alternate chown chmod methods in the os package you should look at

1637387
post	get
one possible solution could be simple http get or post request but that wouldn t be secure

1637466
hex	binary
you can also change your fieldpackager to a binary type see if binary and use an hex representation

1637475
union	distinct
in option 2 you read t2 then read t2 join them together and then join the merged set distinct or not depending on the use of union all to here

1637492

note onselectstart returning false is only sufficient in ie and safari google-chrome

1637503
hide	show
when the user changes the selected option i want to hide show different content areas on the page

1637503

this works in firefox and safari but in ie the change event doesn t fire

1637510
post	get
one possible solution could be simple http get or post request but that wouldn t be secure

so in the parent pom configure your plugins in pluginmanagement javadoc and pmd for example and reference them within the plugins element in the desired children only in my-plugin-server here

1637594
freebsd	linux
i m no developer but i think you can also use similar packages similar to unix freebsd of which os x is partially based on along with darwin and linux

1637619
width	height
this text and link is being displayed in a small popup window - height 100 width 400

1637626
gridview	repeater
not necessarily better than the repeater suggestion but another option is to use a gridview control and a datatable data structure

1637679
rss	feed
i have an iphone application that reads rss feed from a youtube channel

1637724
ienumerable	ilist
you should really just have a method or writeonly property like you do that takes a possible ilist or ienumerable of your custom object and binds it directly to your datalist

1637724
gridview	repeater	gridview	datalist	datalist	repeater
if you change it from a datalist to a repeater or a gridview you have to change it everywhere you bind to your user control

1637734
automake	autotools
see man automake or google for autotools

1637769
put	get
you could also compute the relative path when copying the script and put an include in there with the proper number of .. to get out .. .. template template.php

1637850
versioning	upgrade
with my database upgrade scripts i typically just have one long script that makes the necessary changes for that database versioning

1637889
post	get
you d have to fetch it from the datastore in your get handler although without setting a session id in a cookie or something this isn t going to implement sessions at all but rather allow anyone getting to use whatever value was send with a post request whether it was sent by them or someone else

1637889
post	get
responding to a post request should be done in the post method not through a redirect to a get method

1637900
serializable	deserialization
if you have to have explicit control over the order of your objects serializable and deserialization i suggest you implement the iserializable interface for a

1637958
int	chars
any chars repeated up to so many times you ll have to format your regex if your is an int

1637966
children	parent
many related processes children of the same parent will have a file descriptor that was opened by the parent

1637978
mbunit	nunit
resharper nunit xunit mbunit are just some of the things that spring to mind

1637986
google-chrome	safari
expected behavior occurs in ie7 ie8 ff2 ff3 google-chrome and safari

1638010

the eventual solution involved writing piece of code which monitored the gmapcreator output folder moving files into a directory heirarchy based upon their filenames

1638227
setinterval	settimeout
note that the function you pass to settimeout or setinterval will be passed lateness the number of milliseconds late the timer actually fired as the first argument

1638263
free	malloc
as you can see it allocates new structures using malloc but it never free s them

1638266
verilog	vhdl
and max plus ii is a very old bit of software - get a hold of quartus and learn vhdl or verilog if you must

1638269
button	checkbox
11 fields below the button find clob and click the checkbox to enable long text retrieval clob

1638319
setinterval	settimeout
you should instead use setinterval or fire off a new timer from your settimeout handler

jhat	hprof
jhat - sun tool that analyzes hprof file starts up an embedded web server so you can analyze the heap thru a web browser view reports

1638330
folder	directory
especially when removing many files consider using the folder remove trick to reduce the directory index file size

1638379
put	get
but the problem is when i put it to debug and run it i get a message

1638394
getter	setter
furthermore while i agree that the functions can do what they need to do with the public interface of a in my opinion that s largely the result of people writing classes that have getter and setter for every data member of class a

1638413
portrait	landscape
this link monotouch rotate view in portrait landscape say to use

1638442
getter	setter
you have one property that can have some combination of a getter and a setter

1638460
accessor	properties
making a properties with get and set accessor allows you to make functions that behave like a variable

1638460
accessor	properties
if you make a labeltext properties wh ith get and set accessor instead of getlabeltext and setlabeltext they could simply write

1638460
accessor	properties
when you write a properties you write the get and set accessor like regular functions

1638489
wicket	uibinder
looking at gwt 2.0 uibinder today reminded me how annoying it was in wicket to have to match the xml component tree with the one created in java

1638493
post	get
the problem is that the return url in redirect is executed only ad an http get not http post as i wanted

1638493
post	get
i d like to authenticate and then redirect to the submit page post but it tries to execute a get on the same url

1638504
getter	setter
of course if they deal with an object s state by means of getter setter to private data then that s more than questionable

1638504
getter	setter
in fact i find getter setter questionable anyway

1638563
getter	setter
hence inorder to provide consistency in the data of an object while either reading setting we have getter and setter resp

1638586
websphere	ibm
at a minimum i need to declare a resource-ref for the remote connectionfactory in my case ibm websphere mq in order to enlist its connections in the jta transaction

1638596
gridview	datalist
it is really useful to make controls such as gridview datalist even login control look really appealing

1638643
m2e	pom.xml
that way when one developer changes her pom.xml the local files get updated using m2e all of them get committed together and other developers will see all changes

1638667
bazaar	git
i use git myself but am familiar with hg bazaar etc

1638792
decoder	encoder
no you need an encoder decoder

1638813
toolbar	docking
gradually mfc started to get external control library support particularly docking toolbar libraries so my tools like 3d model viewers and level editors all looked pretty sweet

1638837
terminate	timeout
so each client proxy - in your case each thread - gets a separate instance of the service class which will keep serving that particular client as long as the session isn t terminate by the client by a timeout or by a fault

1638842
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git	bazaar	cvs	cvs	svn
there are two kind of revision control centralized svn cvs and distributed mercurial git bazaar

1638861
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
i personally prefer git but some people find svn simpler to use and some people like mercuiral bazaar or darcs

1638866
fink	macports
avoid sw and opt as they are often controlled by fink and macports the two popular unix package managers on os x

1638913
pop-up	dialog
now when the user clicks on the icon they re also clicking on the invisible input which pop-up your dialog

1638916
ienumerable	ienumerator
since ienumerable has a single function which returns an ienumerator it can be used to iterate the collection multiple times multiple passes

1638929
onmouseover	mouseenter
secondly both onmouseenter and onmouseover fire when the mouseenter the boundary of an element

1638965
folder	directory
in my head i envisaged having each skin in a directory under the views directory in the folder structure then maintaining a data structure which maps hostnames to skin directory

1639022
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
we had this problem and it was very much firefox specific -- could only repro in that browser safari ie8 google-chrome etc were all fine

1639054
put	get
you can also put some condition-wait pthread_cond_wait instead of just some nanosleep which will get signaled when intended when a new file gets fopened

1639228
versioning	upgrade
set of upgrade versioning of dual

1639235
versioning	upgrade
in addition to the modules in vanilla perl strawberry will also include the entire dependency tree for bundle cpan as well as an additional set of upgrade versioning of dual cpan core modules that have win32-specific fixes

1639263
background-color	transparency
my solution was to set the background-color to a default color then tile a square grey image with a transparency corner knocked out over the top - so it shows the background through it

1639274
versioning	upgrade
this is also useful if you want to be able to at runtime upgrade a type to a new versioning ie load a remote assembly and reload it later

1639328
scheme	racket
update plt scheme is now known as racket which also has opengl bindings

1639335
datediff	difference
the datediff function in mysql gets the difference in days

1639467
ironruby	ironpython
basically if you want to port your own dynamic language to .net like ironpython and ironruby did you will have to use expression trees

1639483
nunit	mstest
you could either use mstest or nunit as the test runner however a good rule of thumb would be to separate these tests out into their own respective assembly or category so they are not ran every time your fast unit tests are ran

1639548
put	get
and if you still need java to play with that data put it in a place where java can get to it

1639552
uilabel	uitextview
if you need scrolling which is probably why you used a uitextview and not a uilabel then you need to do more work

1639571
post	get
better you call your post data get function from function data method

1639598
put	get
there is no need to put this in + void initialize for a singleton since it will only get called when you first attempt to use the class

1639660
.htaccess	httpd.conf
try adding to your .htaccess or preferably your httpd.conf and restart

1639680
getter	setter
without compiling it i already see a problem with properties that the code has to check whether interface defines getter and or setter and verify the right method s instead of blindly assuming the getter

1639743
webclient	httpwebrequest
i tried both httpwebrequest and webclient and both of them throw exception

1639753
public	protected
visibility public package protected private is important too because it defines who can access the actual method

1639781
folder	directory
check the permissions on the files and directory in the projects build folder

1639790
width	height
apparently this is taking too much memory because i am getting an exception when trying to set the bitmap s width and height saying not enough storage is available to process this command.

1639860
folder	directory
i am using a web setup project to install my asp.net app which needs to write to a folder that exists under the main virtual directory folder

to get it to map on startup you can put this in a batch file

1639871
put	get
if there is too much finish put on your mock up you will get hung up on the big blue button syndrome where people are more concerned with how a button looks and less concerned with what it does

1639964
128bit	64bit
altivec operations despite being 128bit are treated as if they were 64bit

1639982
r-tree	quadtree
if you roll your own you can do a lot worse than picking the r-tree or quadtree algorithms

1640100
switching	screens
if these are two separate textures in memory and i draw a grass tile then a gravel tile then a grass tile to the screens the gpu will load the grass texture then switching it out to load the gravel texture then switching the grass texture back in to draw another grass tile

1640100
put	get
the easiest way to get around this is to have a spritesheet where you put your grass and gravel tiles into one texture and just tell spritebatch to draw from a different area on the same texture each time

1640106
uilabel	uitextview
it sounds like what you actually want is a giant uilabel inside a uiscrollview and not a uitextview

1640152
next	except
next for your your itemtemplate you use a just like you normally would except now when you add columndefinition s you set the sharedsizegroup attribute to a name that is unique for each column

1640182
try-catch	exception-handling
i had been using a try-catch to capture the exception-handling and log it to the list as well

1640221
put	get
if you think of this as like a state monad executing one instruction followed by the next then a put will send the state value backwards in time to any preceeding get

1640244
monodevelop	sharpdevelop
i like the monodevelop ide even better than sharpdevelop but i m not sold on installing and using mono s compiler just yet nor do i know if it can even handle the latest vb.net c# language features

1640248
postgresql	mysql
i need to move a database with a django schema from postgresql to mysql running on amazon s rdf

1640275
mouseout	mouseleave

1640277
mouse	keyboard
i wanted keyboard users to be able to have the same experience as mouse users so i m duplicating the functionality found in my hover event handler in my focus and blur event handlers

1640315
postgresql	mysql
if you backup your postgresql database and choose the insert commands option you will end up with a text file of sql insert statements that in theory you can run against a different sql database in this case mysql

1640315
postgresql	mysql
in practice it s going to depend on the database types that you are using since not all postgresql and mysql data types map directly to each other

1640360
google-chrome	safari
i ve found how-to s on using a custom build of the webkit safari google-chrome etc engine to generate png screens

1640369

1640477
decoder	encoder
free working library implementation encoder decoder and source-code examples available under a bsd-style license

1640479
hash	md5
you d only have to make sure that the digital signature stays private just like the md5 hash

1640514
accessor	properties
another bonus would be that it can serialize objects that have read-only properties or atleast with the get accessor marked internal

1640527
rss	feed
you can find a basic usage example in the aggregator_refresh function in the aggregator module from drupal core where it is used to fetch rss feed

1640535
ivar	subclassing	nsobject	ivar
should i be subclassing uiview or subclassing nsobject and have an ivar of uiview

1640540
children	parent
i cannot change the title of the children so i need to find a way to append them to the parent

1640600
filtering	grouping	sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping
after you create your collection view you can set filtering and sorting and grouping

1640643
coldbox	model-glue
there are a few popular mature mvc frameworks model-glue coldbox fusebox ontap etc that you can work with or you can run up your own framework using a pattern that suits your style

1640713
client-side	server-side
a bidirectional communication link always involves two participants a server-side and a client-side

1640727
width	height
the larger images to be swapped in will have the same width but a different height

1640779
inherited	properties
this works because textblock.foreground is an inherited properties

1640812
inherited	properties
it also has greater flexibility in inherited mapping better integration with stored procs database functions custom sql triggers support for formula properties and so on

1640848
getter	setter
i am currently using xcode for some c++ development i need to generate getter setter

getter	setter
the only way i know is generating getter setter in objective c style

1640857
width	height
now as far as width and height i am pretty sure there are some cross-browser compatibility issues with how browsers handle a defined width but an undefined height when you swap out the images

1640871
ubuntu	linux
i was thinking in start to develop ipod applications the thing is that i use linux ubuntu hardy and i don t know if i can develop on it then i m here asking for some resources and tutorials to begin

1640882
width	height
you might be able to speed this up by setting the image height and width because the dom will not know where everything is placed until the image size is known

1640884
profiling	debugging
the first one generates profiling information for gprof you may need it and the second one includes debugging information in executables

1640922
width	height
when the user uses the normal height width properties however or drags the corner i don t know how to tie them to the default height and width

1640922
min	max
i intercepted oncanresize and created an event handler and tried to confirm that the new size is within the min max

1640922
min	max
if it s not set to the min or max as required but if within the boundaries then update

1640924
put	get
get the mysql connector-j jar put it in your classpath and read the docs

1640940
hide	show
in my program i toggle the registry value of hidden files to tell explorer whether to hide or show them

1640959
ssl	https
the only added info i can supply we are using apache mod_proxy_balancer along with https in front of our mongrels however this problem was occuring before we turned on ssl

1640970
vb.net	vb6
i realize that vb.net and asp.net are the successors of their seemingly obsolete classic counterparts but i have noticed that some job descriptions still list vb6 and classic asp as requirements

1640981
vb.net	vb6
whether you should learn vb6 or vb.net depends on your goal

1640994
multiplying	add
if i have another character i have to multiplying the first by 10 and then add the latest character

1641050
equals	gethashcode
it would be possible to do with reflection the mbunit test framework does something along these lines but with a heavy performance penalty and a good chance that it wouldn t do quite what you expected anyway and you should implement or equals and gethashcode by hand

1641091
free	malloc
you also have to ensure that you do not destroy free the old block if the malloc fails - you just return 0

1641130
free	realloc
the point of realloc is that it tries to merge the block of memory with a free one behind that if possible

1641170
free	realloc
ideally a realloc would simply see if there s enough free memory beyond the current block and if so just adjust the arena data structures to expand the current block in-place

1641170
free	malloc
by doing a malloc free if you have 100k in the arena with a single 60k block allocated calling your mm_realloc to adjust the size to 50k will fail

1641189
versioning	upgrade
relying on this or that method of some other object being atomic in a given implementation and versioning typically leaves you at the mercy of this atomicity not being a strong guarantee just an implementation artifact for the specific point release c you re using and therefore subtle very hard-to-debug race conditions being introduced with any upgrade or port to other python implementations

1641189
queue	fifo
if your profiling tells you that queue s strong and general guarantees are being a bottleneck for your specific producer-consumer use case make your own simpler guaranteed-to-be-threadsafe fifo queue stream

1641219
public	protected
in java we have been taught about public private protected variables

1641269
groupbox	panel
tabpage groupbox and sometimes panel in the case of radiobuttons

1641295
post	get
or the service you defined expects http get rather than http post

1641305
public	protected
in java we have been taught about public private protected variables

1641396
uiview	subviews
i have a graphics app i am writing that has a uiview that has several uiimageviews as subviews added to it over time

1641398
next	except
except importerror #no test jobs for this module continue to next one

1641398
put	get
this allowed me to put per-module tests in their own test.py file so they didn t get mixed up with the rest of my application code

1641472
subclass	accessor
and then you can simply map the value accessor to one of those fields in each subclass

1641482
twitter	myspace
in this case it might make sense to create a generic extractor interface class and then have subclasses for twitter myspace facebook etc but this really depends on how site-specific the extraction is

1641592
pop-up	dialog
if i understand you re question properly you have a pop-up window or dialog or some such and you need to retrieve information from it after it has been closed or some command is issued

1641631
cpu	processors
i m looking for a windows utility to consume cpu at a specified percentage so that i can test my app under conditions of restricted processors resources

1641675
getter	setter
on an unrelated note you should have any non-boilerplate implementation in your dp getter and setter

1641675
getter	setter
remember that the binding and styling system will bypass the getter and setter and talk directly to the underlying storage

1641688
gtk	gdk
if you want a good reference on how this stuff works take a look at the glib gdk gtk open source libraries

1641702
getter	setter
you can simulate an object by writing constructors setter getter and destructors with the hidden this pointer called out explicitly

1641732
aggregate-functions	sum
group by will be more helpful if you want to use some aggregate-functions like count or sum

1641751
getter	setter
no exposing non-api methods or allowing unfettered access to public variables - everything should be done with setter and getter

1641794
jar	war
the -0 option tells the jar command to not compress the member files when creating the war file

1641794
jar	war
edit depending on how the war file is structured it may also be necessary to use jar -0 .

1641829
int	double
the following is thanks to dribeas the compiler is not allowed to make implicit type conversions during template deduction so by passing a complex with t being double and then another t being int when trying to match the function treating t as double causes the second argument to mis-match and vice-versa

1641846
filtering	grouping
then when you go to display a list of records to a user you filtering based on the conjunction of the two grouping

1641847
profiling	instrumentation
don t add instrumentation code yourself - use a profiling to do this for you

1641853
int	double
the route from an int via a double to a is just marginally too contorted convoluted for the c++ language to follow it according to the standard and with the huge complications already arising from free-wheeling conversions and cohercions it s hard to criticize that aspect of the standard

1641853
int	double
i guess the super-special case of allowing uncasted int s as operands to its operators was just not deemed frequent and important enough to warrant specifying template specializations for that extremely individual case considering how trivially easy it is for the programmer to cast the int to double when that s what they actually want

1641916
client-side	server-side
if you control both sides of the wire the server-side service and the client-side then you could do the following

1641916
client-side	server-side
if you d use add service reference then visual studio will inspect the service based on its metadata and create a new set of client-side objects which look the same in terms of their fields and all but they re a separate distinct type and thus you wouldn t be able to use your shared validation on both the server-side and the client-side objects

1641922
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is when i opened the report inside mozilla firefox 3.5.4 and google-chrome 4.0.233 it showed me the binary string content of the pdf file instead of triggering the adobe acrobat plugin

1641922
google-chrome	firefox
i have checked this by putting a pdf file in the htdoc folder and call it from firefox and google-chrome it worked just fine

1641950
hide	show
for state a hide this field in this control for state b show this icon etc

1641959
openfire	ejabberd
may i know what integration technique that you folks use to implement external component to an existing xmpp server ejabberd or openfire

1641978
ubuntu	linux
i am using ubuntu 9.04 linux

1642117
strcpy	strncpy
and it is safer to use strncpy than strcpy in void test setname

1642156
children	parent	inherited	properties
because that an fd number is a per process and might its children properties so only when a parent process had own an fd of an openning file a child forked in general could accept the inherited fd number as command parameter and use it

1642156
stdout	stderr
otherwise no way unless using well-known stdout or stderr etc

1642177
qapplication	qcoreapplication
the event system you re looking for is probably the main event loop provided by the qcoreapplication or the qapplication classes

1642203
accessor	properties
the way i recommend is to bind the array controller then implement kvc-compliant array accessor methods for your properties and use those everywhere in your app except in the class s init and dealloc methods

1642395
formview	detailsview
first thing i would suggest you use formview to replace your detailsview you will have more control on gui

1642470
google-chrome	firefox
i tested in google-chrome firefox and internet explorer all of them cleared the textarea correctly

1642487
int	chars
one is declared to point to a function accepting an int the other one - to a function accepting a chars

1642489
int	chars
you ve declared g to be a function taking one argument of type int and returning an int and h to be a function taking one argument of type chars and returning an int result

1642491
int	chars
g is a pointer to a function which takes an int and returns an int whereas h is a pointer to a function which takes a chars and returns an int

1642492
int	chars
the function pointers both return an int while g accepts an int as input and h accepts a chars as input parameters

1642492
int	chars
although you can sometimes mix int and chars you are mixing function pointers so the compiler correctly gives you a warning that you might be doing something wrong

1642506
int	chars
one function pointer takes a signed int as an argument the other chars signedness depends on your system

1642528
implements	extends
note that the interface itself doesn t extends idictionary - it s just that the implementation also implements idictionary

1642541
udp	tcp
i am getting confused between tcp being connection oriented and udp being connectionless so please somebody clarify this

1642541
udp	tcp
every communication between two computers whether its tcp or udp is via packets

1642541
udp	tcp
there is no hard wire connection between two peers whether its tcp or udp

1642553
ubuntu	debian
and for ubuntu that s a debian package right

1642586
installation	upgrade
my snow leopard installation is an upgrade and not a fresh installation

1642588
udp	tcp
the connection is a tcp logical concept which adds the reliability of packet delivery that udp lacks

1642588
udp	tcp
however routers are only interested in ip the tcp udp whatever else are layers on top of ip

1642602
trac	bugzilla
you cannot use it for example in bugzilla or trac

1642606
super	extends
it seems that the inner class loaderimpl by extends the classloader class and by not calling an explicit super constructor should reference as its parent class loader the system class loader

1642614
ceil	floor
i need to mimic the exact functionality of the ceil floor and round functions on bcmath numbers i ve already found a very similar question but unfortunately the answer provided isn t good enough for me since it lacks support for negative numbers and the precision argument for the round function is missing

1642672
xsl-fo	xslt
then use an xslt to convert that xml to xsl-fo

1642674
inherited	properties
this properties is inherited from cim_printer

1642683
put	get	post	put	post	get
anyways we put the logic of submitting data from out site to the legacy site into a jquery plugin which handles any form elements in the form by escaping each value before posting the form - actually the landing old page requires the data in get format so we just end up setting window.location to the resulting querystring - but i guess we might as well have submitted the form with a normal post if we wanted to

1642689
rss	feed
subscribe to an rss feed of guidance

1642793
submit	submission
this one gets called right when the user submit the form you can then do anything you want in js like submission the form values via ajax and if you return true when you handled the form successfully in js the true gets inverted to false and the form will not submit via browser

1642793
put	get
the advantage of this is that you can get the desired form html via ajax generated by php and you can put the exact same html inside tags for those with deactivated js by calling the same php function to get the html

1642799
udp	tcp
i don t think i can improve on those definitions but let me attempt to explain it from socket programming perspective understanding that socket is the programming interface for tcp udp

1642799
udp	tcp
specifically if you program server sockets say in java you would notice how this connection-oriented and connection-less nature of tcp and udp respectively affects the programming model

1642799
ready	each
notice that there is also no serversocket#accept step necessary. in other words each client and server can just send datagrams around without having to care whether the other end-point is ready to receive the datagrams or not

1642911
pdcurses	ncurses
ncurses unix-only i think or pdcurses portable is the way to go

1642921
folder	directory
it is supposed to ignore all pdfs that are at an arbitrary depth under multiple datasheet directory under the current root folder

1643002
decoder	encoder
however these bugs are usually very easy to fix once you ve figured out where in the encoder decoder classes the problems lie because it s almost always those two classes

1643009
division	multiplication
the tostring should be slower than parse since division is generally slower than multiplication

1643019
ubuntu	debian
but for ubuntu creating a debian package should suffice your needs here

1643021
iboutlet	ibaction
you need to use iboutlet and ibaction if you are using interface builder hence the ib prefix for your gui components

1643021
iboutlet	ibaction
iboutlet is needed to associate properties in your application with components in ib and ibaction is used to allow your methods to be associated with actions in ib

1643021
iboutlet	ibaction
you need ibaction and iboutlet for these connections to exist in ib

1643029
iboutlet	ibaction
ibaction and iboutlet are used to hook up your interface made in interface builder with your controller

1643029
iboutlet	ibaction
but in reality most of us use interface builder once you want to get some interactivity going in your interface you will have to use ibaction and iboutlet

1643039
iboutlet	ibaction
ibaction and iboutlet are macros defined to denote variables and methods that can be referred to in interface builder

1643039
iboutlet	ibaction
ibaction resolves to void and iboutlet resolves to nothing but they signify to xcode and interface builder that these variables and methods can be used in interface builder to link ui elements to your code

1643039
iboutlet	ibaction
if you re not going to be using interface builder at all then you don t need them in your code but if you are going to use it then you need to specify ibaction for methods that will be used in ib and iboutlet for objects that will be used in ib

1643064
aggregate-functions	sum
i have group by clause everywhere where i use aggregate-functions sum

1643077
ilist	icollection	ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	idictionary	ienumerable	icollection	idictionary	ilist	idictionary	icollection
in my mind it is good to be aware of anything that implements icollection idictionary ienumerable and ilist

1643094
iboutlet	ibaction
iboutlet and ibaction are purely there as markers that interface builder looks for when it parses your code at design time they don t have any affect on the code generated by the compiler

1643095
hide	show
this coupled with conditional statements to show or hide data controls or the asp .net loginview control should allow you to do what you want

1643112
docx	xlsx
apache poi 3.5 have added support to all the ooxml docx xlsx etc.

1643117
jquery	scriptaculous
i think this can be done by any javascript framework jquery scriptaculous mootools dojo as vrinek says

1643140
try-catch	exception-handling
the simplest way would be to wrap the call in a try-catch block and log the exception-handling

1643149
mockito	easymock
i know you are using easymock but changing to mockito is easy and it s much better

1643184
int	double
default t will be null for reference and nullable types 0 for numeric types byte int double etc and new t for structures which cannot be null

1643198
post	get
i was under the impression that the validation is supposed to get triggered by the model binding during a post

1643248
hide	show
choose one to show then hide them all filter by the class you want to show and display it

1643289
google-chrome	firefox
this worked for me in firefox and google-chrome when i added it ad the very end of my document before body

1643296
expression-blend	silverlight
silverlight 3 in vs2008 or expression-blend

1643299
tinyint	varchar
i d go with the massive overhead of a varchar 5 field with a tinyint pk

1643307
super	self
super newuserfullform self .clean to ensure that the inherited fields are cleaned as well

1643395
put	get
but if the features are unrelated i d commit everything to dev rebase -i to put the uncompleted feature on top of everything and then get the id of the last completed commit

1643440
imperative	declarative
another problem of the declarative language is that some problems are easier to solve in a imperative manner

1643446
rss	feed
i like giving my users the full text rss feed but i also have a few sites which pull the rss feed and link to us from it

1643460
vb.net	vb6
i m a small developer in vb6 and vb.net and use for bugtracking a simple excel

1643471
filtering	grouping
the having clause indicates that we want to filtering after the grouping to only show the grouping which have more than one entry

1643482
ggplot2	lattice
have a look at the graphics view on cran and this series of posts on the learnr blog about lattice and ggplot2

1643537
debian	linux
gcc debian 4.3.2-1.1 4.3.2 on a 64bit gnu linux os hardware

1643537
int	chars
i assumed the version using chars variables would run slower than that using int s due to the conversions but on my 64bit dual core ii system the int version is slower

1643542
lua	scheme
javascript is more like scheme than it is like smalltalk which supports method not defined or lua

1643543
dreamweaver	fireworks
we are looking to upgrade our microsoft visual studio office iis7 etc and adobe macromedia fireworks dreamweaver flash products

1643721
punctuation	words
during the tokenization words parsing in this case process look for patterns that may define expression boundaries such as punctuation particularly periods and also multiple lf cr separation use these

1643744
keydown	keyup
many people experience issues with the keyup and keydown calls being dismissed or dropped and alot of people have resolved their problems by placing a small buffer amount of time between the two to assure that all commands are transfered

1643775
children	parent
attach the list of children to the parent entity

1643818
gmail	hotmail
i can prove that i own yahoo hotmail gmail and many others with your proposed verification technique

1643887
postgresql	mysql
quick write me sql to paginate a dataset that works in mysql oracle mssql postgresql and db2

1643901
width	height
if you use image .width it should reset the width back to what it was before you applied any width changes to it similarly for height

1643904
fast-forward	merge
checkout master branch and merge in dev branch this should result in fast-forward

1643923
subtract	add
in the arithmentic operator overloads add a validation that the two vectors being added or subtract have the same dimension

1643953
hide	show
i ve had success using jquery show hide code to create the effect in a stand-alone panel but i can t get it to work properly on multiple panels it either opens all hidden at one time or noe at all nor can have i been able to integrate the effect into the step carousel viewer s onpanelclick function target parameter

1643977
opera	firefox
the fact that opera doesn t use a browser plugin like ie and firefox do is merely an implementation detail in opera and doesn t really reflect on java itself though it does reflect on the usability of java if you have a lot of opera-using customers

1644071
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
i ve used this in ff2 ff3 ff3.5 safari 4 win opera 9+ google-chrome 2 google-chrome 3 and they all work

1644092
min	max
because it is doing the min and max comparisons before the join test is a valid user entered value in the jobquestion table but should not be returned when jobquestion is joined to price

1644134
updatepanel	ascx
assuming you have an updatepanel around your custom ascx

1644150
inherited	properties
there are maybe a few solutions i could think of - make dataseries inherited series instead of have one - then likely i could new the points properties if the error still persists

1644223
spaces	delimiter
these are followed immediately no spaces is allowed to prevent ambiguity with the left-shift operator by an identifier or string that specifies the ending delimiter

1644223
spaces	delimiter
doing this also allows you to use spaces in your delimiter

1644223
spaces	delimiter
this is the same as using a single identifier except that it allows spaces within the delimiter

1644247
put	get
if you want to get those effects put a inside the table cell and apply the effects to the

1644329
png	tga
since the images are all stored as targa tga files i have to preprocess them into png files

1644374
inherited	subclassing
think about what it would mean to force all subclassing to have an inherited constructor

1644410
superclass	subclassing
the parameters needed to construct a subclassing are often different from those required by the superclass

1644416
filesystems	fat
i have a fat filesystems mounted in linux with the vfat driver

1644427
inherited	subclassing
i don t know any language where subclassing inherited constructors but then i am not much of a programming polyglott

1644450
post	get
from the php manual an associative array of variables passed to the current script via the http post or get method.

1644453
inotifypropertychanged	icommand
i answered like inotifypropertychanged icommand ivalue convertor

1644462
disk	ram
however in almost all cases the difference is 20 - unless the 64 bit application does not have enough memory causing the os to start paging ram to disk

1644474
superclass	subclassing
because constructing your subclassing object may be done in a different way from how your superclass is constructed

1644474
superclass	subclassing
you may not want clients of the subclassing to be able to call certain constructors available in the superclass

1644478
inotifypropertychanged	icommand
baked in support for icommand and inotifypropertychanged are the two biggest benefits

1644510
hide	show
since you re using hide and show it does something different then what your intended css wants it to do

1644530
xpages	lotus
with lotus domino 8.5.1 one can use standard java classes into server side javascript embedded into an xpages or java classes available in the web-inf lib folder

1644577
put	get
wpf is probably not finished yet with sizing and placing the child controls in memory because when i put my code in the onloaded event handler of my control i do get correct locations for my child controls

1644579
put	get
when you build up a string with internal quotes you need to use eval to get the shell to put the quotes back together

1644585
versioning	upgrade
if the your versioning is equal or higher the backup can be restored and and upgrade with a limit not all past versioning are supported

1644595
int	double
stores an int not a double

1644621
rss	feed
in drupal core the default rss feed is at rss.xml

1644621
rss	feed
every taxonomy listing page also has an rss feed associated with it

1644621
rss	feed
to expand further on those options make use of the rss feed display in views the views datasource module to add even greater varieties of data json output for example and even the rdf projects if you want to be on the cutting edge

1644622
google-chrome	firefox
ie firefox and google-chrome happily load content as long as i add the ca to the trusted root cas

1644681
filesystems	fat
fat s dos attributes do not map well to the unix filesystems model so linux s vfat driver does not reflect them

selecteditem	selectedindex
use the selecteditem or selectedindex property of the listbox control

1644724
int	double
unboxing requires the same type you can t convert directly from a boxed int to a double

1644724
int	double
by first unboxing to an int and only then casting to double

1644736
ssl	https
if you use transport security you ll be using https addresses and ssl must be enabled on your network but on the other hand you don t need to identify the service with a certificate

1644737
put	get
but it dosn t seem to be working even if i put some text in the rewriterule as so i get a url like

1644828

it decodes correctly when get is used but does not work when post is used

1644916
subtract	add
while you can take the union or intersection of shapes or add and subtract them curves tend to deform with repeated boolean operations sometimes quite dramatically

1644946
versioning	upgrade
i was using mysql .net connector dll of versioning 5.1 i have just upgrade to 6.1 latest and its working fine without any error

1645050
cout	cin
std cin and std cout globals

1645112
memset	calloc	memset	malloc	calloc	malloc
your core graphics surface should be cleared to all zeroes before you render to it so i recommend using calloc instead of malloc or adding a memset after the malloc

1645130
children	parent
then jquery can find the parent .collapsiblepanel but is unable to traverse the children

1645181
gif	png
the board has an lcd and i would like to be able to take screen shots convert them into a gif or png

1645181
gif	png
i can get the raw data by doing the following cp dev fb0 screen.raw but i am stumped on how to convert the image into a gif or png format

1645183
hash	salt
this is because the salt is added to the password before it is hash so it effectively adds to the total number of entries the rainbow table must contain to have a list of all possible values for a password field

1645186
put	get
update i put a bounty on this question because i still cannot get it to work

1645190
hash	salt
a salt is a random set of bytes of a fixed length that is added to the input of a hash algorithm

hash	salt
adding a random salt to a hash ensures that the same password will produce many different hash

1645190
hash	salt
the salt is usually stored in the database together with the result of the hash function

1645190
hash	salt
this is only true if the salt is stored separate from the hash

1645190
hash	salt
8 character case-sensitive alpha-numeric passwords with 16 bit salt hash to a 128 bit value would take up just under 200 exabytes without rainbow reduction

1645190
hash	salt
a salt is not a secret key instead a salt works by making the hash function specific to each instance

1645190
hash	salt
with salt hash there is not one hash function but one for every possible salt value

1645190
hash	salt
a secret salt is not a salt it is called a key and it means that you are no longer computing a hash but a message authentication code mac

1645190
hash	salt
this ensures that an attacker has to attack every salt hash separately

1645190
hash	salt
the point of the salt is to be distinct for each hash password

1645190
prng	random
using a random salt obtained from a cryptographically secure unpredictable prng may be some kind of overkill but at least it provably protects you against all those hazards

1645190
hash	salt
store the salt along with the hash password

1645190
hash	salt
stackoverflow.com non-random salt for password hash

1645190
crypt	salt
usenix.org unix crypt used salt since 1976

1645234

filtering	grouping	sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping
pull this trace into a table and do some filtering sorting grouping focusing on duration and reads

1645247
gridview	detailsview
i can bind it to a gridview or detailsview but not the accordion

1645259
children	parent
by watching the children s onrender you re implicitly saying that you want to start drawing after measure and arrange have occurred but before the parent starts drawing itself

1645259
children	parent
this can be made equivalent to the parent s onrender - which wraps the children s onrenders

1645259
children	parent
you might also be able to do this in the parent s arrangeoverride which wraps the children s arrange pass which is where iirc the values visualtreehelper.getoffset accesses actually get set

1645260
hash	md5
i m trying to represent the result of an md5 hash in the shortest possible string

1645260
hash	md5
one idea i have had is getting the md5 hash of my input as an array of bytes and constructing a bigint with it

1645264
g++	gcc
i m using g++ instead of gcc and it should work i found similar examples over the web but it seems that ast_node is not known when defining yystype because i get this error

1645295
folder	directory
in which case all classes from myjar1.jar myjar2 jar and some classes folder directory will be available to you

1645309
unsigned	short
is this a reference to void cast as an unsigned short pointer and then offset by 3 mesh etc... + batchnum

1645328
identifier	ambiguous
in some contexts an identifier that starts with one of these would lead to ambiguous code

1645333
onclick	onchange
which mirrors the onclick event which is currently implemented and i m trying to convert to the onchange

1645353
boost	stl
you can easily build such a queue on top of stl and boost though - just wrap std queue and boost mutex in your custom class

1645354
bazaar	git
mercurial git and bazaar all just put a single directory at the root of the project

1645446
unsigned	short
this is casting 0 to an unsigned short pointer

1645446
unsigned	short
this will be used for computing a memory offset computed in terms of the size of an unsigned short

1645453
interpreted-language	compiled-language
in interpreted-language you deploy the source while you deploy the compiled binary for compiled-language

1645466
spaces	linefeed
you need a few more spaces or linefeed printf d d n printf d n

1645471
inherited	properties
if gives you the properties behaviors and inherited and composition chains between types

1645489
google-chrome	firefox
this seems to work on google-chrome haven t tested on ie however when i run the app on firefox with multiple tabs activated if i close the browser and open again im still authenticated and the cookie is still there

1645502
profiling	instrumentation
if it s still slow after that hook up instrumentation and profiling it

1645578
put	get	post	put	post	get
it works over http and you use the standard http commands of get put post delete to manipulate data you can query using browsers and clients are simple http clients

1645591
post	put
form_for will then look to use the account_feeds_path with post when feed is a new record and account_feed_path feed with put when feed is not a new record

1645652
dlsym	dlopen
not for the feint of heart but you can use dlopen and dlsym to get the address of globally declared variables

1645672
bazaar	svn
bazaar seems much more like svn with branches just being separate directories so maybe not

1645674
put	get
when you are sure your script is perfectly working you can get rid of warning and notices like this put this line at the beginning of your php script

1645707
integer	unsigned
t specifies that a following d i o u x or x conversion specifier applies to a ptrdiff_t or the corresponding unsigned integer type argument

1645799
postgresql	mysql
it s certainly not a drop-in replacement for oracle postgresql db2 mysql what have you

1645811
bazaar	git
bazaar differs from git in that you can t switch the branch represented by the working directory

1645853
disk	ram
seems it stores on the disk cookies suposed to be stored on ram to recover the tabs when you open the browser again

1645961
octal	decimal	octal	binary
i know of several general formulas for converting between binary decimal and octal but i was wondering if java has any built-in methods or classes that convert between the three

1645961
octal	decimal	octal	binary
in particular i am looking for methods to convert from octal and binary to decimal and between octal and binary

1645979
hide	show
specifically when we have a child control on a page and the child control itself hosts a report viewer and the report has a document map the postback on the show hide document map button seems to be lost so the document map never disappears

1646010
hex	binary
so to turn f hex into 1111 binary

1646041
equals	gethashcode
the problem here is that does not in fact declare gethashcode so it s much easier to forget to implement that method properly contrasted with the equals method that it does declare

1646041
equals	gethashcode
provide a proper implementation that implements both equals and gethashcode

1646056
french	turkish
at present these support danish dutch english finnish french german hungarian italian norwegian portuguese romanian russian spanish swedish and turkish

1646093
passenger	thin
i m suspicious of nginx passenger because i just switched to that last week from nginx thin and now these are happening

1646116
getter	setter
then synthesize the getter setter like this

1646142
postgresql	mysql
postgresql doesn t need to rewrite the table to add a column mysql does and it s pretty slow

1646155
twitter	myspace
xml and xslt - send them facebook friend requests - join their myspace page - follow them on twitter - take them out for cocktails - get them liquored up and laid on the hottest silicon you can get your hands on

1646157
jobs	cron
my standard advice for running cron jobs is always to run a shell script which sets the environment if necessary before running the real task

1646186
changeset	cherry-pick
then merged via carefully cherry-pick just the desired changeset back around the tree or via a baseless merge

1646232
nhibernate	automapper
soon after i posted my question i found gabriel schenker s 3 part series your very first nhibernate application while browsing some of the other so questions with automapper tags

1646290
google-chrome	firefox
we have an app that is being developed that renders fine in firefox and google-chrome but is suffering greatly under ie

1646326
versioning	upgrade
and i fear that if python is installed before and i upgrade to a new versioning this could break something else.

1646326
stdout	stderr
i execute the plug-ins from command line and read the stdout and stderr output

1646368
solaris	aix
if you don t have an aix machine to test it on the install works the same way on solaris or linux so you could write your documentation based on that

1646368
folder	directory
basically you ungzip the tarball file use tar to unpack the archive change directory to the unpacked folder run a shell script to install it tell the shell script what directory to place it in and wait

1646414
internationalization	translation
i haven t used the internationalization features of django so i can t really help with the translation

1646492
draggable	droppable
i have a droppable container with 1 draggable in it

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
so far this works great in all the browsers i ve tested ie8 firefox google-chrome safari except ie6

1646568
keydown	keyup
note that this code is only applicable to previewkeydown keydown previewkeyup and keyup events

1646614
put	get
make sure you cast your uint64 s to int64 s before you put them into the database or you ll get an argumentexception

1646650
folder	directory
i have an ant build script that deploys a war folder into my jboss deploy directory

1646654
hash	md5
rather than convert the above subroutine to php here is a subroutine to convert a string to its md5 hash in vb.net

1646713
implements	modifiers
in your code you have implements the interface explicitly without making the access modifiers public therefore loginuser method is visible only when the variable s declaring type is the specific interface

1646734
rss	feed
that example will help you setup a php script that will generate an rss feed to subscibe with errors from your server logs

1646741
asp.net-mvc	html.actionlink
when you convert this page to asp.net-mvc then replace the hyperlink with a html.actionlink or url.action call and pull the raisepostbackevent logic into your controller

1646761
post	get
all a user has to do is click a button on the page and it post all the info to get them to authnet s hosted payment form

1646761
post	put
i m ok with jquery and can send the post request via an ajax call but that doesn t exactly put the user on the authorize.net page

1646807
division	multiplication
simple numeric operations like multiplication division with overflow checking or wrapping around

1646812
post	get
i m following the post redirect get pattern so i don t have a problem if f5 is pushed but the back button still provides the opportunity to resubmit the form

1646818
tostring	compareto
i would recommend not to use tostring so frequently when you need to switch between types the better way is to use custom object to at least specialized versions of methods for comparison like compareto

1646871
calloc	malloc
if you want to simulate limited memory calloc not malloc a gigabyte or two of memory in bogdown.exe

1646885
chunked	transfer-encoding
transfer-encoding chunked

1646901
int	chars
over and above the other answers it looks to me as though the argument to function_points should be int points rather than chars lettergrade so that you are not using an uninitialized variable in the function

1646913
implements	extends
it s also easy to remember easy to implements and easy to extends to any number of fields

1646928
jar	war
you can also create an archive that is both an executable jar file and deployable war file at the same time

1646991
int	chars
your function should return a chars and take in an int

1646991
int	chars
in the function header chars is the return type pointstolettergrade is the function name and unsigned int points is the data that the function takes in

1647023
innodb	myisam
i had to list some advantages of myisam over innodb and why it s still being widely used

1647037
innodb	myisam
innodb supports row level locking whereas myisam only supports table-level locking

1647067
accessor	properties
you can change the name of that accessor by setting the related name properties of the foreignkey

1647078
innodb	myisam
i am not sure if this is no longer true myisam is faster than innodb for reads

1647078
innodb	myisam
personally i still believe that the advantages of innodb triumphs myisam and myisam also has problems with data integrity from my experience

1647114
innodb	myisam
i had to list some advantages of myisam over innodb

1647114
innodb	myisam
ok there are some cases where myisam is faster than innodb but rarely enough that it s worth putting up with the lack of acid-compliance

1647172
gwt	dwr
technologically java is quite good for non-standard web things - like heavy use of ajax gwt dwr comet spring to mind mobile where you generally need lots of session data and less front-end bling really simple things that are going to be put under immense load it will definitely trounce apache mod_xxx every time the only thing faster in wide-spread use is native code

1647173
post	get
after searching around for quite a bit i found a blog post which stated that you can get 64-bit eclipse for windows at eclipse downloads

1647182
apache	cherokee
this seems to me to be a pretty basic thing but even with the excellent apache documentation i m at a bit of a loss been using cherokee too much lately

1647190
affinity	processors
basically i iterate through each processors visible to windows set thread affinity to that thread and then make a sequence of cpuid calls

1647192
post	get
but what about a variation on post redirect get where the final get is not actually the final get

1647306
nsmutablestring	nsstring
if currentsummary is already a nsmutablestring you shouldn t attempt to assign a regular nsstring the result of stringbyreplacingoccurrencesofstring withstring to it

1647327
typedef	typename
note that if i change const typename container pointer to simply typename container const_pointer it compiles fine however as far as i can tell the const_pointer typedef is an extension i don t see it mentioned in the c++ standard container requirements 23.5 table 65 and so therefore i don t want to use it

1647343
hash	md5
well here hash is what we call a one-way function like md5 sha1 etc

1647367
jar	war
you can deploy the web application and the web service in the same war but this is just a deployment choice you could package the business logic in a jar and use it in several wars

1647391
folder	directory
i want to add a folder projects scripts so i can use require script where script is a ruby file in this directory

1647396
getter	setter
just plain getter and setter

1647402
allocator	stl
20.1.5 table 32 allocator requirements state that allocator for the stl containers shall have an allocator const_pointer

1647409
mapply	grepl
mapply grepl df letter df food

1647412
sqldatasource	objectdatasource
however i ve heard many warnings about staying away from using any of the built in controls objectdatasource and sqldatasource

1647412
sorting	filtering
i haven t really dabbled in sql but with a bit of reading i m sure i could create my own custom server side paging filtering sorting

1647413
rss	feed
i have a youtube rss feed set up to show youtube videos in a tableview

1647485
strlen	substr
i believe the argument against mbstring.func_overload is that if you use any 3rd party libraries code whatsoever that code may be relying on the normal functionality of the functions in question -- it may be calling substr to truncate a string containing binary data at an exact byte boundary or using strlen to get length in bytes rather than length in utf-8 characters

1647526
put	get
i put my selectors at the edge of the code so i can get to them quickly and step through them under the debugger

1647568
pycrypto	keyczar
i m using pycrypto keyczar and i ve figured out how to import export rsa keys in pkcs8 format but i really need it in pkcs12

1647578
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
graphaã l currently supports firefox 3.0+ safari 3.0+ opera 9.5+ and internet explorer 6.0+

1647602
single-sign-on	shibboleth
if you are looking at a secure single-sign-on solution something like shibboleth will come to mind

1647634
implements	extends
i was wondering whether or not i can extends the enum type in c# to implements my custom enum.getvalues type and call it like enum.getmycustomvalues type

1647658
children	parent
i ve taken a look at addhierarchychangelistener but it seems to only detect changes in parent not children

1647672
vim	emacs
pick a cross platform editor that is powerful enough like vim or emacs learn to really use it and use it everywhere

1647747
google-chrome	firefox
i turns out that google-chrome and firefox really don t like the response.clearheaders call for some reason ie was ok with this once i removed it the downloads functioned as expected again.

1647753
filtering	grouping
if what you really want is to express filtering over your grouping data take a look at the having clause

1647754
qabstractitemmodel	qstandarditemmodel
create a subclass of qabstractitemmodel or qstandarditemmodel depending on how much coding you will want to do override the flags method to return the appropriate flags including qt itemisusercheckable in the columncount method add an extra column to include the checkbox and in the data method for the column where you want your checkbox to appear return the checked state qt checked qt unchecked for the qt checkstaterole

1647766
pull	push
much of this stuff doesn t need to be run every single time you push pull in particular i usually wouldn t want to dump a new data fixture that frequently

1647786
put	get
they put checks like that in there because they don t know why sometimes they get strange results from functions

1647792
client-side	server-side
ria services simplifies the client-side programming model so that it matches very closely with your server-side domainservice and entities

1647795
background-color	font-size
also note that the css properties that contain dashes like background-color or font-size are accessed removing the dash and capitalizing the next word

1647796
apache	nginx
after putting nginx in front of apache i noticed that the ip in the apache logs was always 127.0.0.1

1647847
inherited	properties
the most effective way to do this is to inherited from vb.net s windowsformsapplicationbase class which can also be used in c# and set the issingleinstance properties to true

1647914
folder	directory
i have been working on a branch for a while and deleted a directory folder that i do not need

1647945
apache	nginx
i know when it happens as an apache module it gives a blank screen--wouldn t be surprised if a 502 error happened under nginx and the fastcgi interface

1648031
win64	windows
win64 is defined by the windows platform sdk or whatever they re calling it this year when targeting a 64-bit platform

1648087

if it s not possible in general then are there any safari opera firefox ie etc

1648144
post	get
i have seen the examples of net openid consumer lite on cpan but i was hoping to get a single script that uses post method

1648144
post	get
if nobody has this than i will post my solution back here once i get it working

1648161
post	get	rss	feed
to get the entrants i have to parse the rss feed of the contest seems to only list the last few post so i would probably have to interact with the twitter api in order to get all messages

1648216
jobs	cron
would you have any cron jobs that might be competing for disk or memory

1648418
dictionary	map
s key uses a dictionary of 2048 words to map 64 bit numbers to a sequence of 6 predefined words syllables

1648440
post	get
validate every input don t assume users can t change your javascript post get s

1648464
hash	salt
my understanding is that a salt is not intended to be secret it is merely intended to be different from any centralized standard so that you can t develop a rainbow table or similar attack to break all hash that use the algorithm since the salt breaks the rainbow table

1648464
hash	salt
in a widely-used piece of open-source software the salt would be widely known and this opens you up to attacks because now they can simply attack the salt version of your hash and create rainbow tables that include the salt data

1648464
hash	salt
the first is to change the salt with every new version of the software but this is no good because new versions of the software would no longer be able to test against old password hash

1648464
hash	salt
the downside is that the salt have to be associated with the password hash in some way probably just by sticking them right next to the password in the database

1648464
hash	salt
is there any extra risk associated with storing the salt directly with the password it hash

1648481
hash	salt
this is a near dup wtb password hashing salt and storage of hash values

1648516
hash	salt
unix systems traditionally even store the hash in the same field as the password the salt is a fixed-length prefix of the password

1648532
hash	salt
these take care of generating a per-password salt and they use a proper hashing algorithm its not enough to just use a cryptographic hash such as sha1

1648532
hash	salt
the salt strengthens a password by making the hash value incomparable to the same password in the same or other database and invalidating large pre-generated lists of common password to hash lookups rainbow tables

1648532
hash	salt
if the system uses a single random salt for all users in the same system then two users who by chance have the same password would have the same hash and guessing one user s password would trivially compromise the other

1648539
lxml	beautifulsoup
beautifulsoup is more suitable for html parsing than lxml

1648554
hash	salt
for example if you simply add and a lot of salt to the end of each password before hashing an attacker could construct a table of hash values generated by lots of strings all those strings ending with and a lot of salt

1648582
opera	google-chrome
i m interested in internet explorer opera and google-chrome

1648582
google-chrome	firefox
my default browser is google-chrome on windows and linux but if i do something in javascript i end up having to switch to firefox to get the error messages from the error console

1648594
firefox	safari
this code works in ie firefox and safari

1648594
opera	google-chrome
but don t work in google-chrome and opera

1648594
google-chrome	safari
i tried to use this topic how do i print an iframe from javascript in safari google-chrome

1648619
nexus	artifactory
for the record i m using both nexus and artifactory

1648619
nexus	artifactory
i can clearly state that while nexus is very simple and operative though i sometimes have problems with the installation process on ubuntu its free version cannot compete with artifactory s community free edition

1648619
nexus	artifactory
excluding artifactory s awesome web 2 ui its main features such as security management periodic backups and accessibility issues are way beyond those of nexus

1648632
hash	salt
the problem with this though is that your application has to know the salt to be able to do the one-way and compare the resulting hash

1648720
emacs	aquamacs
i just used aquamacs emacs to load a diff file and it provided some highlighting

1648741
sorting	grouping
however finding all products that have one attribute would be at least lousy in case you have attributes as comma-separated you need to use like and in case you store attributes as serialized arrays they are completely unusable for any kind of sorting or grouping using sql queries

1648741
sorting	grouping
using separate table for multiple relations between products and attributes is far better if they are of any importance for selecting grouping sorting other data

1648773
macvim	textmate
if you d rather go graphical use macvim which is free or textmate not free

1648779
hash	salt
context dependent but you could just store the hash of the key plus a salt constant string easy to obscure

1648779
hash	salt
then when if the user enters the key you add the salt calculate the hash and compare

1648779
hash	salt
the salt is probably unnecessary in this case it stops a brute-force dictionary attack if the hash can be isolated a google search has also been know to work

1648854
addeventlistener	preventdefault
if you instead set an event via an event handler property on the dom element or using addeventlistener attachevent then just returning false from that function does not work in every browser and you need to do the returnvalue and preventdefault stuff from my other answer

1648868

it should be ideally protected but it can be public

1648875
tcpdf	fpdf
personally i d rather go with tcpdf which is an ehnanced and mantained version of fpdf

1648901
button	checkbox
i have three radio button with same name and different values.when i click the third radio button the checkbox and textbox going to be disabled.but when i choose other two radio button it must be show.i need the help in jquery.thanks in advance..

1648931
hash	salt
when i had to do this i did put some innocent looking string into the code a copyright notice for example or some faked user prompt or anything else that won t be changed by someone fixing unrelated code encrypted that using itself as a key hash that adding some salt and used the result as a key to encrypt what i actually wanted to encrypt

1648994
button	checkbox
i m guessing you probably want to bind a click event to a number of radio button read the value of the clicked radiobutton and depending on the value disable enable a checkbox and or textbox

1649060
ubuntu	debian
avoid obscure distros that may miss packages go for debian or ubuntu or fedora or one of the biggest ones and you ll be fine

1649070
getter	setter
no virtual methods all data members are private no protected getter setter helpers

with four grails projects under my belt preceded by two tapestry projects and one wicket project i m seriously looking at play next

1649131

one of the things i thought was cool about grails is that everything s groovy. that is you use groovy to write everything except the html and the css -- domains controllers services page templates gsp tag libraries hibernate api gorm unit tests gunit and build scripts gant

1649152
spaces	delimiter
of course this only works if spaces are genuinely a delimiter between fields

1649191

the blog post suggested by matt is the best source of information you can get

1649281
dropbox	skydrive
i have some confidential data i might need on the road mostly usernames passwords stored in a truecrypt volume located in my dropbox with a copy on my skydrive

1649359
actionscript	mxml
this is also why actionscript classes and mxml components interoperate very horribly you might have noticed mxml doesn t have the concept of interfaces execution flow and thus time whereas as3 doesn t have the concepts of events or bindings which are native in mxml but are built on top of as3 using some metadata and the flash.events package looking very nice in mxml but being an impressive number of calls and instantiations in as3 .

1649375
children	parent
i think you have to delete all the children before you delete the parent

1649436
put	get
i hope this will become a good experience all in the end but to make it good we have to put more efforts and build attitude to get through this

1649488
children	parent
all its children call their parent constructor

1649586
webclient	httpwebrequest
in the scenario given you should be able to use the async nature of things like httpwebrequest webclient which will support all this already using completion-ports rather than just threads

1649614

i have to call an external program from my ruby script and this program sends a lot of useful but cryptic info to stdout and stderr

1649711
stdout	stderr
while the program is running i d like to parse the lines it sends to stdout and stderr and

1649711
stdout	stderr
etc. but i can only retrieve stdout stderr after the program is executed not during its execution

1649715
versioning	upgrade
smooth upgrade to new versioning

1649749
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
i would start by looking inside the view lifecycle methods - viewwillappear viewdidappear etc

1649815
post	get
just take all the post data from the previous page that you care about and get them into the current page s form

1649824

1649829
firefox	safari
works fine in firefox and safari but i get nothing in ie7 it doesnt swap the first class on document ready nor does it swap anything on click

1649884
icmp	tcp
ping is an icmp packet and doesn t create a tcp connection hence you won t see it in netstat

1649885
client-side	server-side
the second is just wrong as mvc apps can leverage traditional server-side controls if they wish as well as make use of the rich library of client-side controls and libraries

1649919
elgg	moodle
i like elgg only because it is being used by a growing number of online education sites and i think it integrates very nice with moodle

1650014
folder	directory
set the working directory to the original build output folder so that file names are still valid in the temporary test folder

1650089
children	parent
you could look into using the parent and children functions

1650123
int	double
if you want your comparison to return true if and only if the double precisely matches the int value has no fractions component you should cast your int to a double to do the comparison

1650123
int	double
if something like 1.1 would be considered equal to 1 you can either cast the double to an int if you want to ignore the fractional component altogether or round the double if you want say 1.9 to equal 2

1650129
post	get
in the log looks like typically on a save there s a post request that returns a 302 status followed by a get returning a lovely 200

1650129
post	get
on ie8 looks like sometimes post works but get doesn t

1650150
apache	nginx
if you were to then use nginx as a front-end for apache put apache on 8080 and nginx on 80 you could do this in your nginx config

1650150
apache	nginx
so if nginx discovers a cache entry with that key it will serve it directly from memory and you never have to touch php or apache

1650201
memcached	apc
since you already have apc installed it can be used similar to the memcached recommendations to store objects

1650211
vim	emacs

1650236
post	get
even if i echo the value of variable after post i get 12 ãƒâ 5

hash	md5
you could probably generate a md5 hash of the current datetime random number and truncate it to the length you need 5-8 characters and store it as the id field

1650349
gtk	clutter
the gtk docs usually don t contain examples for every single function because that would clutter them up and the documentation of functions like gdk_pixbuf_new_from_file is usually pretty straightforward

1650357
richtextbox	linklabel
i am sure using a child linklabel or richtextbox to render my control s text will solve this but i don t like the idea of using a child control just to underline a few words

this doesn t come out of the box with asp.net-mvc but you can find a number of options that will do the trick like castle-windsor or autofac

1650533
hash	salt
since unix became popular the right way to store a password has been to append a random value the salt and hash it

1650533

1650573
spaces	delimiter
any sequence of spaces tab newline is used as delimiter for splitting

don t be queasy about summing boolean python boolean are sharply defined as a subclass of int with exactly two instances which have peculiar str repr but otherwise behave exactly like the plain int 0 and 1

1650689
floating-point	integer
binary floating-point numbers have interesting precision characteristics since the value is stored as a binary integer raised to a binary power

1650703
for-loop	loops
your for-loop loops only once there is only one element to loops on which is the string

1650718

it gets my name right but then it s puts my day job in as the company at the top of each page

1650893
put	get
it seems anonymous types get a debuggerdisplayattribute put on them where

1650910
put	get
timestamp fields are unable to handle this data accurately for reasons i ll explain if your system is set to a dst timezone then what you put into timestamp may not be what you get back out

1650945
int	chars
with pack you can get the resulting int as a string base64_encode makes it a readable string of up to 6 significant chars 6 bits per byte so this could be your function

1650980
disk	ram
when you start the second instance the memory allocated by the first instance is paged out to disk making room in ram for the second instance

1650989
fitnesse	jbehave
technologies like fit fitnesse jbehave cucumber .

1650995
int	chars	int	boolean	int	double
another example of types that are not classes are the primitive types boolean byte chars short int long float and double are types but they are not classes

1651012
post	get
eg php with magic quotes on will escape the values in post and get before your script begins executing and if you then call mysql_escape_string as well... well it would be a mess

1651130
put	get
just don t let them save strings and send to other people -- also don t put the values in the url via a get so that it can be emailed

1651166
postgresql	mysql
the hosting company does not support mysql or postgresql

1651171

1651222
width	height
just use a single-dimensional dynamic array of width x height elements and calculate 1d indices from 2d coordinates as yourself

1651241
width	height
when i drop an html image onto my page vs2005 the height and width attributes are not specified

1651260
opera	firefox
i think the best bet is to wait as in late 2007 there was blogs for firefox and opera to have 3d support in canvas

1651278

1651323
nsstring	nsdata
if the receiverâ s contents are all property list objects nsstring nsdata nsarray or nsdictionary objects the file written by this method can be used to initialize a new array with the class method arraywithcontentsoffile or the instance method initwithcontentsoffile

1651346
superclass	subclassing
the problem was that uipickerview already has a delegate member variable and you were declaring another one in a subclassing which was what was being set while the superclass s delegate variable remained nil and therefore any delegate methods would not be called on the class you expect it to be called on

1651346
implements	extends
if you need to extends the given protocol do so have a class implements that then just set the class as the uipickerview s delegate

1651361

1651417
cpython	ironpython
the differences between cpython and ironpython and jython for that matter which applies the same concept as ironpython to the jvm -- jim hugunin was the originator of jython long before he moved to microsoft where he originated ironpython both projects now thrive are chiefly in garbage collection and threading ironpython and jython rely on their underlying platforms so you get mark-and-sweep garbage collection and free threading cpython rolls its own so it s mostly reference-count gc with mark-and-sweep once in a while to resolve reference loops and threading hampered by a global interpreter lock

1651468
for-loop	loops
and not to be nitpicky or anything but your first while loops would probably suit your needs better as a for-loop since you need a counter anyways

1651525
folder	directory
i am sure i have the right symbol file directory set and source folder are set as well

1651559
mouseleave	mouseenter
use the mouseenter and mouseleave events instead new in prototype 1.6.1 but not new in ie

i have no problems with it or it s support for version control systems such as svn cvs and clearcase

1651618
post	get
in the second inner .ajax call i need access to the record_id variable that i ve defined just inside the for-loop in order to update the correct record in the database however i can t seem to get access to that record_id variable inside the success function of the inner ajax post

the point of a queue is to provide a fifo fifo interface abstraction

1651862
x86	64bit
on x86 the fastest way to atomically write an aligned 64bit value is to use fistp

1651870
disk	ram
also since the clustering key is being added to each and every field of each and every non-clustered index on your table you re wasting a lot of space - both on disk as well as in server ram - when using 16-byte guid vs

1651871
hide	show
for example if a user hide the sports news container it won t be show on users next visit

1651893
filtering	grouping
then run the results through a filtering in the calling script to grouping them together

1651936
std	ostream
right now passing std endl into a ostream generates the cr character only for newlines

1651951
cassini	iis
my assumption as mentioned in my comment earlier was that ie is working in a different rendering mode depending on whether you are using iis or cassini and this is causing the layout differences

1651985
installation	upgrade
for some context i just upgrade ubuntu which broke my existing gitosis installation see here bug #368895 and have just reinstalled gitosis from packages

1652045

my.cnf	mysql.sock
i m thinking maybe i missed something in the install process since i can t find the my.cnf or mysql.sock file on the system

1652286
getter	setter
if you want a mirror set_n instead of something which manipulates the data then you should probably drop the getter setter as you d be using them incorrectly and make the data member public

1652288
inherited	subclassing
note that twitternotification is a subclassing of notification implemented using single table inherited

1652330
kerberos	ntlm
finally this is perhaps splitting hairs but it should be kerberos authentication not ntlm because ntlm does not allow for constrained delegation and your normal application will need to be enabled for delegation if it accesses anything outside the local iis host

1652457
wordpress	joomla
cmss like wordpress drupal or joomla are widely used which keep all the data organized and do all the work of generating the page for you

1652519
onkeyup	onkeydown
try binding to one of the following events onkeydown onkeypress or onkeyup

1652561

1652575
rss	feed
i m trying to create a gadget for win 7 that retrieves the rss feed from a site

1652583
pascal	delphi
pascal and by extension delphi uses name equivalence rather than structural equivalence for array types including dynamic arrays

1652614
inherited	properties
the os already defines the tap on the status bar gesture to mean scroll to the top of the current view. uiscrollview has a properties scrollstotop that controls this behavior and uitableview inherited it

1652657
google-chrome	firefox
i ve also found that some browsers won t work with clickonce firefox without a plugin and google-chrome requires the setup.exe file to be download and started but the machine in question is using internet explorer though i m not 100 on the version

1652682
int	boolean
assuming i have a large number of int and boolean

1652683

1652909
equals	gethashcode
it s much better to implement equals and gethashcode manually so that you get the results you expect

1652932
profiling	debugging
build your project in debugging mode with the new provisioning profiling

1652949
post	get
the 302 post pushes to browser to the 200 get but if the browser never processes the 302 then the django or the server will not log a 200 get because the browser never opened the page the server can only log what is accessed ergo the browser is not making the call

1652997

inside the brackets means it ll match everything except the next char

1653011
google-chrome	firefox
this works for me in firefox google-chrome and ie8.

16-bit	64bit
actual hardware doesn t use 32 bits to add 16-bit at a time only one extra bit of carry is ever needed for addition and almost all cpu s have a carry status flag for when an addition operation overflowed so if you are using a 32 bit cpu you can add 64bit operands in two 32 bit operations

1653050
spaces	delimiter
spaces are the delimiter for that config file

1653057
g++	gcc

post	get
you probably would have to change your view to call your getloja regardless if the request is a post or get

1653381
superclass	subclassing
however if you need to use it polymorphically then think about what that function would mean for other subclassing of the superclass

1653449
post	get
your repository can then use getdatacontext as outlined in that blog post to get the context instance

1653512

get the data as a byte array then you can put it in a session variable save it as a file and send it as a response

1653522
postgresql	mysql
any decent dbms postgresql mysql if you re using the proper storage back-ends can give you acid guarantees and transactional support

1653535

1653769
yacc	bison
most people user specialized parser- and lexer-generating tools like antlr or yacc bison with lex

1653777

i am surprised that ie6 7 or 8 are all pretty quick as is google-chrome but firefox seems to take quite a few seconds for exactly the same task in this case

1653788
lxml	beautifulsoup
i would suggest writing your own using python with the scrapy and either lxml or beautifulsoup packages

1653843
children	parent
this code below selects all the given children from the parent

1653875
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops

implementing equals and gethashcode isn t much hassle

1653883

the example code checks for interfaces only since array ensures implementing interfaces only ilist icollection ienumerable

1653983
inherited	subclassing
if you inherited from it and apply the attribute to your subclassing the serializer will throw an exception because it cannot serialize the base class members

1653985
innodb	myisam
myisam is a nogo for that type of workload high concurrency writes i dont have that much experience with innodb tested it 3 times and found in each case that the performance sucked but it s been a while since the last test

1653985
postgresql	mysql
if you re not forced to run mysql consider giving postgresql a try as it handles concurrent writes much better

1654019

this should return the directory listing of the current folder

1654023
ubuntu	linux
i need to run develop a mono-based application on a new dedicated server and the isp i usually use only offers 64bit linux of which i ll take ubuntu

1654032

division	multiplication
another approach might be useful in contexts where integer multiplication and division is considered too costly which should be getting pretty rare these days

1654684
vb.net	vb6
unfortunately i can only suggest a workaround not a solution if you do not find a suitable activex control for your vb6 application you might consider migrating the communication part of your application to vb.net

1654684
vb.net	vb6
since vb6 ide support ended in april 2008 you will probably want to migrate your application to vb.net sooner or later anyway

1654897
stdout	stderr
if the subprocess is writing to stdout while you are writing to stderr that could explain the odd interleaving

1654971
hash	md5
if you end up with the same answer neglecting the infinitesimally probable case where two different but very similar files have two identical md5 hash then the files are apparently identical and tsvn has some problem

1655014
width	height
btw grid with no defintions is the same as one with one column with a width of and one row with a height of

1655023

bazaar	git
the big three of distributed version control git bazaar and mercurial each treat branching fairly differently

1655235
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
in my mind bazaar s approach of one branch one repo makes branching more of a pain than git s approach to use a branch in bazaar i have to first create the branch then cd out of my current working copy then check out the new branch like i would in svn

strcpy	strncpy	strlen	strncpy	strlen	strcpy
don t use calls like strlen strcpy - use the length-limited versoins like strncpy etc

hence i tried reinstalling eclipse by copying from inside the .zip directory of the installation folder and pasting it inside the eclipse program directory

1656334
hash	md5
one of the points that i go over in my paper is md5 being only one-way and the only way to crack an md5 hash is to continuously make strings and use an md5 function then compare it with the hash you want to crack

1656360
hash	md5
it is not true that the only way to crack an md5 hash is to generate every possible string and look for collisions

1656373

rss	feed
i have this script to generate an xml file for an rss feed

1656584
datamapper	activerecord
i also had another look at my copy of patterns of enterprise application architecture and while it seems that the activerecord pattern is intended for a direct mapping of class to database table if you chose not to follow the repository approach from ddd then datamapper would be suitable for a composite mapping

1656626
rss	feed
this is a known bug in chrome that has yet to be fixed chrome does not display xml rss feed with any formatting whatsoever

typically 3rd party datagrids should be fairly customizable and you should be able to make it look however you want - and take advantage of the built in sorting editing grouping etc

1656979
fseek	ftell
you should be able to use the ftell and fseek functions to do that assuming your long type is large enough of course

1657026

_bool is a predefined type in c99 much like int or double

1657026

multiplying by an integer 1000 preserves the fractions number perfectly and may be a little faster too

1657454
put	get
what i don t understand is how to get back html that will display a form that allows you to edit the details of a user and ultimately send a put back to update the user.

1657472
tar	md5sum
create a tar archive file on the fly and pipe that to md5sum

1657486
post	get
browsers typically only support post and get for form actions - but doing a post to a resource that already exists isn t restful

1657512
min	max
it s definitely worth understanding the key-extraction approach even if you think you ve just solved your problem with a custom-comparison approach instead not just for performance but for future-proofness python 3 and for generality the approach also applies to min max itertools.groupby .

1657512
put	get
as you see once you get the reverser and key extraction concepts you pay essentially no price for using key extraction instead of custom comparison the code i suggest is 4 statements for the reverser class which you can write once and put into your goodies bag module somewhere three for the key extraction function and of course one for the sort or sorted call -- a total of eight vs the 4 + 1 5 of the custom comparison approach in the most compact form the one using either cmp with a sign change or cmp with swapped arguments

1657516
substance	jide
this is a technique i ve used successfully to wrap swing laf substance alloy jide as osgi bundles

ncover	testdriven.net
personally i like ncover along with testdriven.net for visual studio integration

int	chars
0 is a chars which has a decimal value of 48 when coerced to an int

1658041
int	chars
c is a chars which can be converted to an int using a widening conversion 8 bits to however many bits an int has on your platform

1658041
int	chars
the ascii values for the chars 0 to 9 are sequential so for chars in the range 0 to 9 subtracting the value of 0 from the value of c gives you an int in the range 0 - 9

also at least in my opinion a counter is almost never a double you should use an int type such as plain old int

1658492
printf	fgets
if you have a you can use functions like fscanf printf and fgets etc

1658544
superclass	subclassing

there s no reason to use mysql over postgresql

1658679
hide	show
which toggles the visibility show hide of some panels div s

1658693
nettcpbinding	net.tcp
i ve tried basichttpbinding wshttpbinding nettcpbinding with the net.tcp service running on both machines

1658749
icomparable	compareto
stupidstupidstupid the custom type has to implement icomparable as well as it seems the sortdescription uses the old fashioned non-generic version of compareto

1658751
uiview	calayer
i m able to composite my colors using quartz to draw an uiview but i want to separate each component into calayer uiview consume more resources

1658755
min	max
iinfo only offers min and max but finfo also offers useful values such as eps the smallest number 0 representable and resolution the approximate decimal number resolution of the type of arg

1658760
width	height
so i have approx 10 subviews uiimageview uilabel and i need to place them programatically considering their unpredictable contents different height width for the uilabel s depending on the text property

1658762
put	get
the best approach to get the visibility you ask about is to put this def statement in a module say fit.py import fit from any other module that needs access to items defined in this one and use fit.fitnesscompare in any of those modules as needed

1658769
opera	firefox
just to add to my question there is no trace of this problem in firefox or opera

1658816
pull	push
once you think it s time for a release you tag your stuff probably as beta push it to origin go to your beta server and pull that tag from there for public testing

1658816
pull	push
the solution is simple though a has to pull from origin merging all changes introduced by b into a and then it can push .

1658896
width	height
i read all the php docs but there s nothing good to do this even imagegrabwindow sucks because of its high load browser limitations and also no x y or width height control

1658914
tostring	string.format
code often mixes concatenation + stringbuilder.append string.format tostring and other string operations using stringbuilder in such cases is hardly ever effective

1658934
width	height
one thing that make my div s bad is the float height and width - when you forget one of these in another div your problem -div maybe is wrong because of that

1658961
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
certain browsers like firefox google-chrome and safari are pretty close to being standard compliant

1658972
webkit	gecko
for example we have webkit in safari and gecko in mozilla

1658984
int	boolean
or you can just use the read annoteted property of each instance which being an int will obviously evaluate to the correct boolean value for unread books

1659038
post	put
but it s shows 2 dialogs and not until the page has come back from the server which makes sense as that s the way i ve got it coded do a post then take the result and put it in a dialog

1659041
pop-up	dialog
after you pop-up the modal dialog use a settimeout to call your processor-intensive code

1659044
for-loop	arrays
in my opinion the arrays is overkill but you could have just as easily used it to get refernce to each clip as you added each circle reference in the same linear order they get added to the display list the same for-loop but ran against the arrays length instead of the container clips numchildren

1659051
post	get
scenario ii get post based input handling

1659051
post	get
otherwise if you want to display on the basis of get or post input you can place something default value as

1659079
mp3	wav	mp3	ogg	wav	ogg
it would be nice if the tool could handle as many as possible of ogg mp3 and wav files

1659085
put	get
you just need to get an imgur developer key and put it in linup_control.py

1659092
implements	extends
the sortedlist extends a collection by implements icomparer to provide the sort functionality

1659115
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
this does not include internet explorer so you will probably want to use safari firefox or opera

1659223
int	double
my best thesis unsupported by the data above is that somehow you have not got the conversion from int to double taking place in the calls to the constructor but i confess i don t understand how that could happen

1659287
post	get
this nice setting up sun s visualvm on mac osx blog post explains how to get it working on mac osx

1659292
int	chars
maybe use the streamwriter.write chars buffer int index int count overload

1659297
cos	sin	cos	sqrt	sin	sqrt
in a complex number the real and imaginary parts behave like real numbers so all of the operations + - sqrt sin cos etc can be inherited form the class of objects called real instead of having to be written in code

1659322
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add
your complex class would need to handle the extra logic needed around how to add subtract multiplying divide etc two complex numbers together

1659344
visualvm	yourkit
visualvm and yourkit as pointed out by the others here are both good as well

1659371
keydown	keyup
your best be would probably to use timeouts with keyup or keydown events -- restart the timeout timer every time the event is fired

1659371
keydown	keyup
you will need js handlers to handle the keydown keyup events

1659377
rss	feed
i ve been thinking i could use xslt to translate the rss feed into html and display it within the page but that would leave out any commenting functionality

1659400
int	double
it might be getting confused when trying to do the translation from int to double

1659401
terminate	timeout
but it seems barring any bugs in the code of the two that if your java connection client has a timeout set lower than the default heartbeat for couchdb continuous changes then the connection could get terminate by the java client

1659421
int	chars
now in the datatype world of common languages like c and java you ll never find a complex type given for primitive type int chars etc

1659447
yacc	bison
software for doing this includes antlr yacc bison scala s cala.util.parsing.combinator.syntactical library and plenty of others

1659452
nginx	lighttpd
you can direct the subdomain to a different server that is running a lighter weight web daemon such as nginx or lighttpd

1659471
addclass	removeclass
also i think what you are looking for instead of a delayed switchclass that might not trigger the live event handler try using instead with the above addclass removeclass

1659478
for-loop	arrays
yet the conditional on the for-loop which michael showed to be your problem subtracts another 1 from questioncount which means that your for-loop will never reach the last element in the arrays

1659617
bash	zsh
if you mean i m going to be extensively typing it in at a shell prompt i want the mysterious but utter conciseness of bash or zsh

1659617
bash	zsh
- -- in which case very different considerations apply wrt real scripting languages such as bash or zsh or lua or tcl for a different definition of scripting language

1659646
for-loop	arrays
your for-loop assumes you ll access the objects by their index but then after each iteration you re deleting something out of the arrays which shifts all the indexes after that point

1659651
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
use fileinputstream and fileoutputstream to specify the file to save it into

1659663
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
you could use a very simple approach based on the java.util.properties class which has indeed a load and store methods that you can use in conjunction with a fileinputstream and fileoutputstream

1659698
inherited	properties
server is properties of the page class that your page inherited from it not a

1659714
pop-up	dialog
i want to pop-up a dialog box that says saving... and once the operation is completed it simply disappears

1659748
profiling	instrumentation
it can profiling java application but you won t come close to the level of details you will get with tools built to instrumentation java

1659748
vmware	virtualbox
you can run a virtualized linux i use vmware fusion but you can use the foss alternative virtualbox and run your tomcat there

1659793

easyhook	detours
only a side note easyhook - the reinvention of windows api hooking is an open source lgpl project developing a successor to detours

1660037
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i know google-chrome and safari have script debuggers built in or there is venkman the firefox plug-in

1660109
boost	stl
these smart pointers are present in the new c++ stl or boost

1660111
firefox	safari
this works for me in firefox safari

1660270
tolower	toupper
if you want to change the case for comparison it s recommended that you use toupper rather than tolower

1660276
int	chars
chars fgets chars restrict s int n

1660276
stdout	fflush
fflush stdout

1660301
width	height
the problem is that the canvas and its contents should autoresize when the grid resizes width and height

1660323
mouse	keyboard
my guess is that one qapplication would accept the mouse event or keyboard event and therefore the other would not get it

1660334
free	malloc
i imagine it s something to do with malloc free but i don t know which one

1660358
free	malloc
it is not really malloc free which causes the exception it is new which is definitely in c++ part of your application

1660417
int	boolean
now whenever my efficientadapter gets a data object which is a separator it returns false for public boolean isenabled int position and public view getview int position view convertview viewgroup parent inflates two different layouts depending on if the current data object consists of real data or is just a separator dummy

1660421
disk	ram
we also got one gigabyte i-ram google it for information which is basically a ram hard disk with battery backup

1660421
ssd	sata
the new pcs have intel core i7-2600k cpus overclocked to 4.6 ghz with intel 510 series 120 gb sata iii ssd 16 gb ram and a large cpu cooler

this works because apache first look for the .htaccess file in the requested directory if it does not find one he looks in the parents folder and so on until it reaches the public directory

1660538
gridview	repeater
and if you bind person object to anywhere in gridview or repeater to any datasource you only bind person and it get a default bind value from one of its properties

1660628
google-chrome	firefox
works for firefox and google-chrome and does not for ie while using

1660639
put	get
actually you tend to get the first row in mysql storage order which a lot of the time will be the first one you put in the database which is a bit of a trap because sometimes that s what you want so it looks like it s working until the order changes for some reason and everything goes wrong

1660671
children	parent
if you use xsl variable without the select attribute you always create an implicit parent with the variable and the contents of the variable are the children underneath it

1660687
wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe
you can do this using svcutil.exe for wcf or wsdl.exe for legacy web services

1660772
vb6	vba
-- in vb6 vba

1660832
tcplistener	tcpclient
use the standard .net tcpclient and tcplistener classes -- they are trivial to use and do what you want

1660838
cpu	processors
as adathedev says if it s using 100 cpu then the issue is with your algorithm not how windows is allocating processors time to the thread

1660901
translation	localization
you could use localization libraries such as gettext to manage translation

1660903
yacc	bison
there are other other tools like parser generators yacc or bison that are designed for such structures and can handle them well

1660915
jstl	taglib
jsp is a view technology which provides a template to write plain vanilla html css js in and enables interaction with backend java code with help of taglib like jstl and expression language el those things

1660938

1661015
sorting	grouping
what happens here is a staged grouping and sorting so that the eventual result is grouping and ordered by ref line and type

1661038
cpu	processors
the cpu of most processors manufactured in the last 15 years have some special instructions which are very powerful

1661055
outputstream	inputstream	outputstream	bufferedinputstream	bufferedoutputstream	inputstream	bufferedoutputstream	bufferedinputstream
have the huge data somewhere in a database or on the disk file system and obtain it as an inputstream the default way from db by resultset#getbinarystream or from disk by fileinputstream and write it to the outputstream through a bytebuffer and or bufferedinputstream bufferedoutputstream

expression-blend	silverlight
for wpf itself a gui api there s expression-blend which is a tool afaik written in .net that focuses on graphical design for wpf and silverlight applications

1661117
ubuntu	linux
for example i use ubuntu linux and perl is a component of the system

1661117
ubuntu	debian
but the ubuntu system perl interpreter is not in good shape due to some dubious setup decisions by the debian people so installing things like cpan modules is tricky

1661123
jquery	jqtransform
i am using a jquery plugin called jqtransform

1661170
ubuntu	debian
the ubuntu debian way to do this is as follows

squeak	visualworks
in particular swazoo runs in gnu smalltalk visualworks squeak pharo gemstone and dolphin

1661265
post	get
so your gadget can only post delta s and get notified on updates but could by definition not participate in conflict resolution and the like

1661293
hide	show
even though i declare the item s root layout to wrap_content and each component in the item to fill_parent the view i hide show which is supposed to change the item s height is simply cut off at the bottom instead of its parent the item layout growing in height to fully display it

1661296
floating-point	fractions
floating-point numbers are imprecise especially since they work in binary fractions 1 2 1 4 1 8 1 16 1 32 ... instead of decimal fractions 1 10 1 100 1 1000 ...

1661316
16-bit	64bit	floating-point	integer
however big arrays provide more space-efficient storage of integer and floating-point elements in particular because they support â œsmallâ types such as single-precision floats and 8 and 16-bit integers in addition to the standard caml types of double-precision floats and 32 and 64bit integers

1661318
width	height
have a silverlight page use 100 width height of the html page

1661331
post	get
the dml above is not the actual since i cannot post my company s code here but you get the picture

ienumerable	icollection
ienumerable does not when you do tolist it converts it into a list which implements icollection

1661341
mp3	wav
i am developing one j2me application to play wav mp3 file

1661383
octal	decimal
in this case it doesn t matter because a single digit octal constant has the same value as the equivalent decimal constant but in c

1661383
octal	decimal
whether an integer literal is expressed in octal decimal or hexadecimal once it is parsed by the compiler it is just treated as a value

1661385
octal	decimal	octal	hex
octal is a numbering system based on 8 instead of 10 for decimal or 16 for hex

1661392
octal	decimal
for 005 both the octal and decimal representations are the same and should not bother you but still it s asking for trouble unless you specifically meant the octal representation

1661392
int	chars
in general x d will print an int x chars wide and will pad with leading spaces

1661433
vb.net	vb6
i am having trouble converting some code from vb6 to vb.net i don t have as much experience with .net

1661443
jhat	jvisualvm
a heap dump might be able to tell you what lingers where jmap and jhat are included in the jdk or you can use jvisualvm if you want a gui

1661462
asihttprequest	cfnetwork
asihttprequest is an easy to use wrapper around the cfnetwork api that makes some of the more tedious aspects of communicating with web servers easier

1661462

it is suitable performing basic http requests and interacting with rest-based services get post put delete

1661473
put	get
i have put what i believe to be the most permissive crossdomain.xml possible in the wwwroot folder and still get the errors

1661498
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
for leaks through not closed fileoutputstream you can use findbug mentored above or try to find article how to patch standard java fileoutputstream fileinputstream where you can see who open files and forgot close them

1661503
ant	maven
a build tool like ant or maven

1661523
hide	show
basically i have simple animations that show hide div layers and also that move top down - left right some of the div layers

1661567
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works as expected in ie firefox google-chrome and opens the links on the opener howeve safari opens all links in a new window and not the opener

1661587
superclass	subclassing
originally i had a design problem where i needed five subclassing of a superclass where all but two would use the same generic method of doing things and the other two classes would need special handling

1661587
superclass	subclassing
i could of course make an abstract dosometing method in the superclass and make each subclassing implement its own version but that would duplicate code in three of the classes

1661597
submit	submission
if i prevent the redirect then i see the output but that s not a typical workflow for form submission - i submit to the same action validate and process and then redirect where i want the user to end up. this is an established web app

1661686
floating-point	integer
on a philosophical note i wonder most computer cpus today have built-in support for integer arithmetic and floating-point arithmetic but no support for decimal arithmetic

1661713
dia	argouml
without i know dia and argouml

1661722
width	height
if it still is no the case then check that your timeaxis has not a fixed width or height or a defined horizontal verticalalignment

1661753
hide	show
i need to show or hide some of the buttons when the mouse enters the toolstrip

1661753
mouseleave	mouseenter
the toolstrip s mouseenter event fires when the mouseenter but mouseleave does not always fire when the mouseleave

1661823
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i m having trouble popping a uiviewcontroller off of a uinavigationcontroller even though the reference to the nav seems to be correct and a count on viewcontrollers shows the right number

1661846
udp	tcp
i am aware that i probably know only about a drop in the oceans worth when it comes to udp and even tcp

1661846
peer	p2p
could and should i consider p2p peer to peer for multiplayer

1661855
parentviewcontroller	navigationcontroller
why aren t you just accessing the navigationcontroller property of your view controller rather than casting its parentviewcontroller as a uinavigationcontroller which is a bad idea regardless

1661881
matplotlib	scipy
also i ve gotten away with using python numpy scipy and some plotting like matplotlib libraries in the past which gives you some more options in terms of libraries

1661889
maven	m2e
i use m2e to import maven java projects in eclipse

1661889
folder	directory
this directory isn t in the list of sources folder while src main java or src main resources do

1661956
udp	tcp
considering modern webservers can staurate 1gbit ethernet with http over tcp the lower overhead of udp means that you re probably going to be able to saturate 1 gbit ethernet with udp as long as your computations hold up

1661969
inherited	properties
the isclass properties of the system.enum type returns false even though system.enum inherited from system.valuetype and typeof system.valuetype .isclass return true as expected

1662000
octal	decimal
the only thing worse than c s unfortunate use of leading zeros to make a number octal is javascript s handling of leading zeros to sometimes make a number octal the number is octal if the rest of the digits are ok - less than 8 - decimal otherwise

1662022
maven	m2e
as far as maven is concerned src main webapp isn t a source folder in the sense that it s contents aren t compiled copied to target classes so from m2e s point of view this is correct behaviour

1662023
slideup	slidedown
now i want to use jquery latest to make the slideup slidedown effect

1662023
mouseover	mouseout
i first tried mouseover and mouseout but when i used that function the mouseover worked and when i wanted to go to the sub the menu slided up but mouseout event occours

1662027
getter	setter
in fact i don t usually test my migrations and it s certainly not worth your time in general to test getter and setter

1662029
min	max
anything else ie employeeno employeename department address city state country version will need an aggregate statement ie sum max min

1662079
datalist	repeater
you said the repeater sits inside a datalist

1662079
datalist	repeater
the datalist is itself a kind of repeater - the controls inside of it don t exist until the datalist is bound to a datasource and the controls in the template are created once per item in the source

1662097
hash	salt
hash user passwords with unique salt for each users so that when your database can be accessed by an outsider they cannot decrypt the passwords and the salt mitigates rainbow table attacks

nltk	lingpipe
i can t really comment about whether nltk or lingpipe is best suited for this task although from looking at the answers it looks like there s quite a few other resources written in java

1662366
many-to-many	one-to-many
your many-to-many on customer will become one-to-many collections of vouchers used by this customer if you need it as maintainable property

assuming your timeaxis user control doesn t have any internal settings affecting measure replacing the height and width settings with the following should cause your usercontrol to resize automatically

1662457
adam	adlds
if you just want to do ldap queries then adam adlds will do the trick

1662538
base	fractions
so we know that fractions such as 0.1 cannot be accurately represented in binary base which cause precise problems such as mentioned here formatting doubles for output in c#

1662572
bazaar	git
popular dvcs include mercurial git and bazaar but in the end it doesn t matter which tool you choose there is lots of information here on so about comparisons

i ve implements a custom imagecellrenderer extends the jlabel and on getlistcellrenderercomponent i create the thumbnail if there snt any for that element

1662645
folder	directory
is there a way to download the contents of a webpage directory like this without having to click on each folder and download each sourcefile one at a time

1662672
for-loop	loops
it s up to you how much loop-related logic you want to put inside your generator or other iterator and how much you want to have outside of it just like for any other use of a function class or other mechanism you can use to refactor code out of your main stream of execution but generally speaking i like to see the generator used in a for-loop that has little ideally none loops control logic code related to updating state variables for the next loops leg and or making tests about whether you should be looping again or not

1662699
folder	directory
the real d3d9.dll should be in the system32 folder but the game first looks in the current directory and instead loads ours

1662710
maven	cargo
i m struggling with a mac os x 10.5.8 that i ve started using recently for development.i successfully installed tomcat and create launchd.conf for my environment variables.i believe it works fine.coz i can build a project with netbeans using maven and cargo plugins succesfully so i found online a script for start and stop the tomcat

then you can databind your clean to your gridview repeater listview or similar control for generating the html output

1667700
listview	gridview
i recommend using the listview control for all purposes as it allows you to generate the exact html you want and offers all the functionality you get with the gridview control of easily configurable alternating rows databinding events etc

1667740
fasta	biopython
my suggestion is use biopython to perform the parsing of the fasta file

1667765
persistent	transient
i say persistent because it generally is long-lived over many connections unlike the older cgi based transient processes that were around 10-15 years ago when servlets were dreamed up

1667765
tapestry	struts	tapestry	wicket	tapestry	seam	struts	wicket	wicket	seam	jsf	tapestry	jsf	wicket	jsf	seam
struts 1 2 spring mvc jsf seam wicket tapestry etc are all web frameworks that are built up on top of the servlets specification

1667786
put	get
to get a better idea what is happening either in ie8 use the web developer toolkit for me i hit f12 and debug then put in a break in the create function or do the same with firefox using firebug and debug

1667828
getter	setter
i don t think that there is an easy way for automation in generating getter and setter

1667836
punctuation	words
this is non-trivial as you need to modify the xml of the flow document to be able to add adorners and you need to be smart about filtering out punctuation etc. as well as when and how often to check the spelling of words paragraphs

1667843
outputstream	inputstream
in that case simply provide an inputstream reader from which to read your data or accept an outputstream writer to which you write your data

1667843
outputstream	inputstream
the inputstream reader outputstream writer idea is basically the same concept applied to the java api

1667850
outputstream	inputstream
without more information it s impossible to give you a better solution but i d say that one common abstraction for writing data to multiple locations is to use the java.io classes inputstream outputstream or reader writer

1667862
outputstream	inputstream
in fact inputstream reader stdin and outputstream writer stdout provide just that

1667872
getter	setter
unfortunately there s absolutely no way to do that currently as get and set prefixes are hard-coded in generate getter setter wizard code

1667882
ssl	https
the issue is this - on the .net client if i set my security mode transportwithmessagecredential i must have ssl else i get the fun error invalid scheme expected https

1667919
mouseup	mousedown
the issue was mouseup and mousedown events did not fire

1667954
javassist	cglib
another point is make sure you have all the required jar in your classpath such as cglib or javassist

1667972
innodb	myisam
convert to all myisam tables to innodb you can search myisam vs innodb in stackoverflow.com and search engines to find out why

1667993
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
firefox google-chrome and safari behave as expected at least as i expect

1668001
min	max
i suspect that some implementations of these functions may use the cast you describe as the platform-optimal way to get at the min max

1668004
integer	unsigned
c99 â 6.2.5 9 ...a result that cannot be represented by the resulting unsigned integer type is reduced modulo the number that is one greater than the largest value that can be represented by the resulting type.

1668007
postgresql	mysql
mysql and postgresql are my options

1668069
postgresql	mysql
to make it more clear i want to use something available in mysql postgresql

1668138
capitalize	uppercase
take a look at capitalize first letter of each word and at c# uppercase words in string i posted in two languages perl and c# because you haven t specified the language that you re using

1668152
dmz	was
i move it to the dmz i get an error reading an unsecured or incorrectly secured fault was received

1668183
integer	fractions
my main problem is how to get the fractions part as integer bit manipulation it not my strongest asset

1668227
firefox	safari
safari and some extensions for firefox allow you to change your browser s user agent which can be useful

1668240
hash	md5
quote bruce schneier w e already knew that md5 is a broken hash function and that no one should be using md5 anymore.

1668259
qlist	qhash	qlist	qmap	qhash	qmap
for example they can be used to populate a qvariant and then a qsettings with some limitation though only qlist and qmap qhash whose keys are strings are accepted

1668275
hash	whirlpool
i like whirlpool personally - if you re using php check out the supported algorithms at the hash function docs

1668311
children	parent
in a wpf treeview i am trying to automatically check the children if the parent node is being checked

1668348
accessor	properties
documentation - see the collection accessor patterns for to-many properties section

1668392
internationalization	localization
you might also check microsoft s documentation on internationalization and localization

1668402
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i have a uinavigationcontroller that gets uiviewcontroller pushed onto it

1668433
client-side	server-side
it would seem that if one has to provide this extra key to all parties he wishes to engage with on the client side it would seem to make client-side ssl not as scalable as server-side ssl

1668447
sudo	passwd
sudo may prompt you for a passwd

1668487
folder	directory
i have the 2.2.1 sdk in the proper directory of my developer folder

1668505
rss	feed
i ve been using the asp.net rss toolkit to consume rss feed

1668535
post	get
if you require the ui to be used one option you have is using django s test client which allows you to pragmatically write get post requests just like you were to be someone browsing the web page

1668537
jobs	cron
how about using cron jobs you can call urls with cron job which can be your servlet that handle the logic

1668548
hash	salt
the formula should not be heavily weighted toward the first 6 digits of the card bin number though and no trace of the formula should be stored in the same location as either the salt or the final hash

1668548
hash	md5
i don t have any benchmarks handy but i m pretty sure 1 million hash operations per minute is not unreasonable for md5 or any flavor of sha on a suitably powerful machine

1668552
union	distinct
- he s right it s distinct union of sets otherwise you d get repeat employees wherever an employee belongs to more than one department

1668582
implements	extends
my class extends compositecontrol where i implements design-time support

1668595
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
instead shore an md5 hash or something using the username as a salt perhaps

1668598
hash	salt
only store the hash of the password + salt

1668614
superclass	subclassing
this will pass to you subclassing this touches however you can t cancel the touches to uiscrollview superclass

1668625
int	chars
it s easy to convert an int to a unicode chars provided of course that there is a mapping for that code

1668643
superclass	subclassing
this will pass to you subclassing this touches however you can t cancel the touches to uiscrollview superclass

1668651
button	checkbox
accessible custom designed checkbox and radio button inputs styled with css and a dash of jquery

1668661
pop-up	dialog
but running the following in cmd pop-up an about dialog

1668665
put	get
you need to put the plain regular expressions in delimiters to get a regular expression in pcre format for example with as delimiter

1668724
folder	directory
had to copy web.config from root views directory to the area views folder

1668761
folder	directory
none of the other folder in this directory have underscores and it looks stupid

1668800
decimal	ieee
if you put a float in the arguments where printf is told to expect an integer the output will be a decimal representation of the ieee floating point bytes -- probably not what you intended and not what a true cast would have done

1668834
disk	ram
the dlls and executables are loaded using memory-mapped-files so they re not actually copied to ram they are still on disk just having their bytes mapped to process virtual address space

1668851
put	get
i can t put it in a packagemaker package and somehow get the windows installer to figure out how to read it for example

1668880
button	checkbox
they contain different types of fields text boxes radio button checkbox single or in groups

1668886
for-loop	loops
and i want to convert it to a while loops mostly because i want to play with the value of i inside loops to go backwards and forwards and my co-worker thinks that doing this in a for-loop is prone to problems

1668914
for-loop	loops
and i want to convert it to a while loops mostly because i want to play with the value of i inside loops to go backwards and forwards and my co-worker thinks that doing this in a for-loop is prone to problems

1668962
put	get
before now and again i would get duplicate key errors and also i put in a log trace on the constructor and it appears that 1 petition is overwriting the other - hence the static versions of mapper

1668963
min	max
i know all those transactions have a date max min

1668970
client-side	server-side
however you can generate the client-side code from the server-side

1668970
post	get
post or get to a url - this could be

1669020
children	parent
you seem to be either recording children before or at the same time as their parent which is possible but kind of odd

1669020
children	parent
your data model suggests children know about their parent therefore the data suggest a parent to be inserted before its children

1669043
post	get
if you post your efforts you may get some feedback and you can compare your results with others

1669067
versioning	upgrade
i have an app that worked just fine in versioning 2.2.1 of the iphone but have ran into an issue when i upgrade my dev iphone to 3.1.2

1669137
mp3	wav	mp3	aiff	wav	aiff
by the way audiere can also play certain audio files mp3 wav aiff mod s3m xm it by itself

1669137
flac	speex	flac	ogg	speex	ogg
ogg vorbis flac speex with external libraries not just pure generated tones

1669218
min	max
then you can grab and to get min and max

1669229
min	max
this will leave min max null if there are no elements in the array

1669229
min	max
will set min and max in one pass if the array has any elements

1669234
getter	setter	division	multiplication
you could attempt to obfuscate your score values in memory to make them harder to find with cheatengine for example storing them as a multiplied value then in your getter and setter for the score value include a multiplication division of the values to get set the proper score for your views and score submission widgets

1669243
setinterval	settimeout
you can either use setinterval or settimeout depending on how you want to do things

1669266
implements	extends
of course you would have to implements the queryinterface _addref and _release methods and extends the interface to do something more useful

1669347
children	parent
if you want a parent to have 1 or more children use a parent attribute on each record and have root nodes have a parent of id 0 or some other meaningful value

1669347
children	parent
if you want nodes may have multiple parent and children use a separate table to store the relationships

1669362
consistency	acid
it has very robust features for guaranteeing important reliability properties called acid for atomicity consistency isolation and durability and has great performance but from the programmer s perspective it s a simple map structure

1669462
rss	feed
i am trying to proxy through php for a js rss feed

1669495
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
not so sure about google-chrome opera safari etc

1669500
post	get
see the post following the linked one for how to get around this by defining your own character class

1669508
postgresql	mysql
so i am forced to use a heavier database like sqlserver mysql postgresql or oracle

1669510
tabs	tabpanel
this control could internally use a private custom panel to lay out these elements tabcontrol uses a special tabpanel for laying out the tabs

1669513
ssl	https
the method of using a network monitor like wireshark as described here or using microsoft network monitor is no option since the externl soap web service only provides an ssl https url so the payload of the http packages are encrypted and not viewable

1669546
google-chrome	firefox
i have checked it in ie 8.0 firefox google-chrome

1669602
aggregate-functions	sum
i have tried to look up for pivot examples but all of them are either for sum or other aggregate-functions

1669676
hex	binary
the only way i can think is to convert hex value to binary

1669702
hide	show
to hide or show the search bar control i call this method myviewcomposite is the top level control that owns the search bar and all the other contorls

1669764
oodbms	acid
you re biggest challenge with an oodbms will come with finding good documentation good acid capabilities and dealing with scale and disaster recovery scenarios

1669784
pull	push
if there s a project on github that i want to contribute to i just fork it pull it down hackhackhack push up and send a pull request easypeasy rather than making a checkout hacking creating a diff trying to find where to email it to and hoping that the diff doesn t break before the developers get around to merging it in

1669823
nant	cruisecontrol
getting up and running with cruisecontrol i used cc.net isn t that hard with subversion i got us from no build process to speak of to completely automated build and deployment with cc.net and nant in about a month interleaved with other responsibilities of course

1669837
getter	setter
have a data class with code type and id properties and the appropriate public getter setter which is just a javabean class which represents a single row of the table

1669870
bmp	png	tiff	png	tiff	bmp
if you need to alter and save an image without losing any of the data you need to use a lossless format such as tiff png or bmp

1669870
tiff	png
i d go with compressed tiff since it s still lossless even though it s compressed or png

1669903
folder	directory
you ll need to delete the hidden .svn directory beneath each folder after you ve copied the directory of course

1669909
mouse	trackpad
if you enumerate the list of devices you can attach for each device trackpad and mouse

1669936
bazaar	git	bazaar	perforce
you may also want to take a look at why git is better than x a site that attempts to convince you of the superiority of git over mercurial bazaar subversion and perforce

1669967
post	put
this should work - you might want to put better sanitizing on the post value just in case

1669985
folder	directory
but in case you no longer have connectivity with the svn server you might as well delete by hand all hidden folder from the copied directory

1670011
processors	hyperthreading
cpuid results are different between intel and amd processors at least for the interesting stuff like hyperthreading and cache topology and are not particularly stable across different processors versions

1670023
button	checkbox
after the user selects which data they want by clicking on checkbox the user presses a button or some other event at which time you go directly to the underlying table of data and query only those rows that were checked

1670047
rss	feed
any apis or application that could be used to pull a rss feed and put it on a configured facebook twitter .

1670066
folder	directory
why don t you set the cache directory to something a little more windows-y like c temp and make sure that folder exists

1670067
int	chars
i once participated in the clean up of a large codebase where the previous authors had thrown int hresults std string chars random classes.

1670151
clang	llvm
for example you could write a self-modification core in c++ to interface with clang and llvm and the rest of the program in c

1670177
nsmutablestring	nsstring
basically in the assignment you re assigning an to a variable of type which is not necessarily safe note that nsmutablestring inherits nsstring not the other way around

1670207
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox google-chrome - these all are horizontally aligned on a single line

1670256
put	http-method
or if you need to use a different http-method perhaps put

1670295
wav	riff
for the pc you can use the mmiodescend api to walk the riff structure of the wav file

1670304
gif	png
i m using the latest sdl gfx libs on fedora 10 and i m trying to render a png or gif

1670304
gif	png
when trying with transparent png gif files the code was the same except i did not call sdl_setcolorkey

1670309
put	get
if i put a where clause on the query i simply get an empty list

1670320
memcached	apc
when the application starts feeling sluggish if it generates enough revenue maybe i can get a dedicated server if not there are always solutions such as apc memcached beanstalkd etc

1670337
rss	feed
i want to check for updates on a rss feed

1670364
rss	feed
there s also a railscasts episode showing you how to do a similar thing for rss feed

1670418
postgresql	mysql
i ve successfully converted a mysql database to postgresql with it --it should support sqlite

1670441
min	max
we know the ints are bounded by a min and a max

1670441
min	max
i think you could achieve the same results without making any assumptions by finding the min max of the list first and using a sparse array ranging from min to max to hold the data

1670475
folder	directory
i am trying to hide files in a directory on a webserver by using random folder names

1670488
hide	show
for hide uinavugationconttoller i don t need to show to user navigation bar during the login.

1670528
google-chrome	firefox
by default on winxp firefox google-chrome ie - the check is green

1670543
put	get
it doesn t get rid of -i. but you can put relative paths in your #include directives

1670554
min	max
if you want the first occurrence change max to min

1670561
mouseleave	mouseenter
when the mouseenter a tooltip comes out when the mouseleave it sets a delay for it to disappear

1670615
mouseover	mouseout
this way when you change your selected class to unselected or vice-versa the live event will update note hover is not supported with the current version of jquery so you d have to use mouseover and mouseout

1670617
put	get
you could put the math into the where statement directly but it would get recomputed on each item so i prefer to keep the starting time out of the statement

1670620
google-chrome	safari
try this it works in ff3 and ie7 and i assume safari and google-chrome

1670651
ironruby	ironpython
however as things stand right now ironpython is much more mature and has much better performance than ironruby so you may prefer to use that

1670651
ironruby	ironpython
i d strongly recommend going with either ironpython or ironruby over creating your own custom language.

1670665
post	get	submit	submission
for example if your form which could be rendered anywhere in your site was submission to you would create an actionresult method named save on the home controller to handle the submit likely post get method

1670683
vxworks	qnx
get a real-time linux distro or grab vxworks or qnx - something purpose-built for io intensive requirements

1670691
int	chars	int	boolean
the primitive types are defined to be the same on all machines and in all implementations and are various sizes of two s-complement int single- and double-precision ieee 754 standard floating-point numbers a boolean type and a unicode chars chars type

1670698
put	get
i also agree with the suggestion to use a synchronized wrapper if you only need to synchronize the get put calls and don t have any bigger synchronized blocks

1670773
put	get
i have even put a break point on the getter in the dependancy property and it does not get hit

1670799
folder	directory
i used this to copy required libraries into my lib folder compile the flex sources using the ide build which has eclipse-integration with error messages which a pure ant-based commandline build would miss and copy the result to a common deploy directory renaming the wrapper html file in this process

1670801
configure	libtool
my guess is libtool and my guess is that after upgrading you re running make in your source dir or vcs checkout without rerunning autogen.sh or configure as appropriate

1670805
ssl	https
ssl through https then it ll request

1670811
superclass	subclassing
at runtime you can substitute a subclassing of superclass this is the liskov substitution principle

1670818
stdout	stderr
additionally you need to consume stdout and stderr concurrently in order to avoid blocking and a possible process hang

1670837
post	get
make the form submission use post and then after saving have it send a 303 header and send them to the post-submit url via a location header which will be fetched via get and a refresh will not be re-posting data

1670866
cpu	processors
as gman points out this code obscures your intent from the compiler and the processors so the performance may be worse than using a temp variable especially on a modern cpu

1670884
getter	setter
yes this is acceptable private fields should be used to enforce encapsulation by controllingb access to these field through getter setter methods if required

1670892
getter	setter
breakpoints in dependency properties don t actually work - wpf bypasses the getter and setter once the binding is established

1670910
stdout	fflush
automatically fflush stdout without printing a newline

1670915
width	height
the first button is in the upper right corner with width 62 and height 35 and initial title 0.99

1670918
hex	binary
if you want to count the bits it would be simpler to set up an array that tells you how many bits are set in each hex digit indexed by character code and then add things up without explicitly converting to binary

1670926
public	protected
this is generally be a good principle to start with as protected and public member variables should only be used when you have a good reason to do so

1670928
ant	maven
this is a system built with ruby rubygems and rake that provides many of the features found in maven and ant but with a much cleaner syntax and simpler build scripts

1670941
post	get
so when you build your link you control the state of the _request variable using the query parameters get or post and the hidden parameters cookies

1671138
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i am working on linux mint ubuntu btw

1671141
fadein	fadeout
fadein operates on an existing element s and animates the opacity of the element just like fadeout

1671143
children	parent
if the children have non-leaf grandchildren model these as one-to-many relationships between parent and child table

1671157
pull	push
the opposite of ienumerable pull can be expressed as it s dual in iobservable push

1671179
versioning	upgrade
if the versioning is different upgrade is send back to the utility other wise good

1671179
versioning	upgrade
if the utility receives upgrade it sends the users to a predetermined url to download the newest versioning of the utility

1671214
implements	extends
if you need to implements the iterator yourself it may help to extends abstractiterator in that same package

1671265
width	height
if you modify any of the following properties of a movieclip object that contains a motion tween flash player stops the playhead in that movieclip object alpha blendmode filters height opaquebackground rotation scalex scaley scale9grid scrollrect transform visible width x or y

1671267
intersect	contains
if you take the intersect of two lists as it looks like you re doing the result will be a single list that contains all of the elements that are in both of the lists

1671272
width	height
then set positon to 0 0 and width and height to 100

1671328
filtering	grouping
in ms sql we currently grouping sum filtering about 30gb of data in 4 minutes somewhere around 17 million records i think

1671373
dictionary	map
edit to jim ferrans re java big-n faster than perl comment below the benchmarks you referenced are primarily little arithmetic loops rather than something that does a few hundred mb of io and stores it in a map hash dictionary associative-array for later revisiting

1671417
pull	push
however one of the two will have to pull from origin before it can push

1671420
yourkit	jprofiler
you can download an evaluation license of jprofiler or yourkit

1671428
rss	feed
the problem is that i can t find in the dict i get from the rss feed the content of the news just the title

1671428
post	get
the keys i get in this post are just the title summary date etc.

1671445
daemon	cron
if your private key does have a passphrase you might want to run this script as a daemon rather than a cron job

1671507
children	parent
i use container displayobjects and let each displayobject manage its direct children parent tell children what to do

1671600
rtp	rtsp
you may also want to look at wowza media server as it is much friendlier with input devices supports rtp rtsp mpeg-ts h.264 aac ingest

1671601
portrait	landscape
the main issue i see is that 480px is the width only in landscape orientation not in the sometimes default portrait

1671603
lapply	tapply	mapply	tapply	mapply	lapply
the apply family apply sapply lapply mapply tapply are also alternatives

1671607
entity-relationship	diagram
for a relational database that represents the current term enrollment at a large university what is the entity-relationship diagram for a schema that takes into account all the assertions given

1671626
folder	directory
the vod directory in applications inside of your fms installation folder is a good place to start

1671629
entity-relationship	diagram	entity-relationship	entities
the actual counts 100 200 800 should be irrelevant on the final entity-relationship diagram but they should give you a good clue as to the types of relationships 1 to n n to 1 n to m that the entities have with each other

1671639
width	height
animate height width work - i m just trying to simplify the function

1671679
pull	push
a push or a pull moves all the changesets from one repo to another that aren t already in that repo

1671679
changeset	cherry-pick
however the drawback to using import export transplant and cherry-pick in general is that you can t really move over g without its ancestors because in mercurial a changeset s name is its hashid which includes the hashids of its parents

1671686
magento	oscommerce
there is also a tool from magento which allows you to migrate from oscommerce to magentocommerce

1671690
post	get
you would do that by doing a get request of post request to a php page and then display the content from that page

1671705
pop-up	dialog
i have a jinternalframe window that needs to pop-up a modal dialog box when a jbutton is pressed

1671709
mouseup	mousedown
dblclick mousedown mouseup

1671709
mouseover	mousemove	mouseover	mouseout	mousemove	mouseout
mousemove mouseover mouseout

1671709
keydown	keyup
keydown keypress keyup currently not

1671736
hide	show
you can load the data all at once when the page loads then just show hide as needed

1671736
hide	show
using javascript jquery recommended when a tab is clicked hide all content and then show that tabs content

1671752
post	get
so for example if you don t own a certain post say #3 yet you try to drop its id in post destroy 3 you will get shut out

1671753
nunit	moq	mbunit	nunit
i have had success with both mbunit and nunit along with something like rhino.mocks or moq so that you can create mock objects within your tests

1671771
width	height
to achive the hoverpulse effect i think you need to change the height and width of the element but also it s position to make it looks like a zoom instead of a resize

1671771
width	height
after you calculate the new height width top and left attributes if the element is absolutely positioned you can use animate like this

1671807

1671844
pop-up	dialog
every time dialog pop-up a huge div is being created on the background and ie keeps changing vertical scroll bar s thumb size and if there was a huge page downloading in the background

1671853
put	get
if you put it in the body then you get to be lazy and not worry about ever doing it again but your going to lose control because everything on the page will have the line-height set to 1.5

1671969
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is in the ie 7 screen shot the area shown with the red crossed box should be black like it is in the firefox screen shot and how it is in google-chrome

1671999
profiling	benchmarking
just start the profiling run the old code stop it and note your benchmarking

1672093
int	boolean
if you want to treat the string command line parameters as int or boolean you are expected to do the conversion yourself

1672095
int	boolean
strings can be used to transmit any sort of information into the main program including int and boolean

1672113

1672142
put	get	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout
the same thing happens if i put the handler on document or document.body except that surprisingly document.body does not get mouseover mouseout events when the mouseenter or leaves an empty part of the window such as the empty vertical space created by absolutely positioning an element with bottom 0

1672142
mouseover	mouseout
for that space document and window will get mouseover mouseout events with the target being html but document.body will not.

1672142
mouseover	mouseout
also register a mouseover handler and detect cases where mouseout is not proceeded by or followed shortly by a a mouseover

1672149
int	chars
so in your example r is a pointer to a pointer to an int and it s value is the address of p a pointer to a chars

1672168
nunit	moq
i suggest you combine nunit and moq for object mocking

1672221
stringbuilder	stringwriter
the underlying reason is that when you call xmlwriter.create with a stringbuilder it creates a new stringwriter instance which always has an encoding of utf-16 and creates an xmlwriter around that stringwriter

1672239
opensuse	linux
i know that it is possible to read out vendor id and firmware version of the cf card somehow i saw it on an embedded system but i don t know how to achieve that on my linux box opensuse 10.3 and a usb cf card writer

1672242
integer	unsigned
or are you trying to have an unsigned 32 bit integer variable

1672250

if it is anything farther than height width of the window you left the actual window

1672250
width	height
and possibly if it is exactly the height width or exactly top 0 or left 0 then you left the window

1672260
hash	md5
the md5 algorithm is a broken however your mac is immune to the prefixing attack to generate hash collisions because the beginning of the your secret

on ie you could instead use mouseleave which is a non-bubbling version of mouseout

1672424
mouseout	mouseleave	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout
ie has events called mouseenter and mouseleave that are non-bubbling versions of mouseover and mouseout

1672424
mouseleave	mouseenter
this makes it possible to implement mouseenter and mouseleave in other browsers

1672446
google-chrome	firefox
if you the click back again here s where i get differing results in ie6 7 and firefox google-chrome ie8

1672672
children	parent
each item in my list can have multiple parent and multiple children where the starting item has no parent which defines it as a start element

1672672
children	parent
now all i need to do is get the co-ordinates for each element so that everything is positioned correctly with the parent above the children in a centered position

1672672
children	parent
if an element has only 1 child then the child is placed below the parent on the same x co-ordinate if the parent has more than one child then the children are placed with equal spaces apart and the parent needs to be in the middle above the children to two equal length lines join to both the children from the parent

1672673

1672790
google-chrome	firefox
nothing is wrong onabort and onerror are not supported in firefox and apparently in google-chrome too

1672837
int	chars
once there you can use optimization like comparing 4 chars at once as 32-bit int

you need to create a servlet which can access the httprequest and httpresponse objects and read out the parameters you sent with the jsp file to that servlet using the get or post method

1673522
int	boolean
to test if an int has two digits you could use the built-in greater than and less than operators with the boolean and operator

1673522
division	modulo
to separate the two digits you could use the built-in integer division and modulo operators

1673554
ant	maven
java has three main players in this area ant maven and gradle

1673584
put	get
i want to separate the letters from the numbers and i ve succeeded in doing that when using a list but since i start out with an atom i get a string as result to put into my splitwith function.

so if you want to separate the letters from the digits you ll have to do comparison with the int representation of the chars

1673628
bcel	cglib
this you will need something like cglib or bcel

1673641
hide	show
with this what i do is using a javascript function and having a string of letters with the labels that go to that function on click hide or show depending on the letter the corresponding table

1673645
innodb	myisam
you can even change the underlying engine of the replicated table a common scenario is to replicate a innodb table to another server change the engine to myisam and add a full-text-index to the appropriate table columns

1673664
udp	tcp
you might also use udp or tcp ip but i guess that using named pipes is better for local communication though i ve never done it really

1674148
int	chars
the problem is arising from trying to assign an int into a chars

1674148
int	chars
since an int is 32-bits and chars is 16-bits assigning an int can potentially lead to a loss of precision hence the error message is displayed at compile time

1674167

1674588
heapsort	in-place
sort foo in-place in o n log n time with heapsort

1674598

1674863
post	get
here it explains to enable http get post calls for web service for calling a service directly through the browser

1674863
post	get
get post instead of soap where does

1674882
post	get
if you re using get post with .net web services soap doesn t come in to the picture at all

1674882
post	get
you ll also notice that as your service gets more complex you lose the ability to call the service through get post because the complexity of soap is needed to wrap the data

1674889
rational-numbers	base
a rational-numbers p q with can be expressed a finite representation in base b if and only if every prime factor of q divides b

1674889
rational-numbers	integer
that is the only rational-numbers p q with that have a finite representation in binary are those where for some nonnegative integer k

1675051
stdout	stderr
now most people would react by trying python -h |less but that only works if you send the output of -h to the stdout instead of stderr

1675083
titlebar	window
every window opened by javascript will have a titlebar

1675096
restructuredtext	asciidoc
a spec should be written in a plain text editor and utilize lightweight markup such as restructuredtext asciidoc etc

1675117

overriding the properties says this properties s implementation is part of my identity. passing a constructor argument has a different connotation i m setting a value in this other thing which just happens to be my base class. it implies composition has-a rather than inherited is-a

1675128
bitwise-and	bitwise-xor
scheme has a function called bitwise-and ... which is equivalent to the operator in c there is also bitwise-xor ... bitwise-not .. etc. which do the expected thing

1675151
children	parent
and if a child is unticked then if all the other children are unticked then the parent needs to be unticked

1675151
children	parent
i m doing this with event handlers on the checkboxes but i ve come against the problem where checking a child with the cursor then programmatically checks the parent which then programmatically checks all it s children

1675154
getter	setter
i have a model class with getter and setter methods and the occasional static methods

1675157

typedef	struct
if you use the typedef you don t need the struct prefix anymore

1675443
post	get
if post satisfies the semantics of your resource and how you intend to manipulate it switching to get just to use jsonp feels ugly to me

1675446
typedef	struct
you can define a function with the same name of the struct as the identifiers are kept in different spaces but you cannot define a function with the same name as a typedef as those identifiers collide

1675455
put	get	post	put	post	get
under sinatra you define routes that obey to four main proposes get put post and delete

1675462

and don t forget to close the registrykey object when you are done with it or put the statement to get the value into a using block

1675964
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
in order to be optimal you should use manualresetevent or autoresetevent so that your thread is resumed as soon as the dependent operation finishes

1675988
width	height
it looks like in the demo the div that the picture sits in is a set height and width

1675988
width	height
the pictures that are displayed are all the same set width and height the same width and height as the containing div

1675988
width	height
in order for you to have the same look as the demo you will have to make your images and thumbnails a uniform height and width

1675991
affinity	processors
i would assume the threading classes would be implemented now or later with more robust threading code to handle maybe thread affinity on multi core processors

1675992
qgroupbox	qpushbutton
so far i am using stylesheets but can only figure out how to assign a background color to a widget such as qgroupbox or qpushbutton

1675997
mxmlc	compc
this configuration works fine when compiling in flex builder but when moved over to a task that compiles the library with compc and the application with mxmlc the library is unable to read the metadata tags in the app

1676030
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
if it s i need to wait until the other thread finishes for reasons other than resource access then use an autoresetevent or manualresetevent

1676056
folder	directory
i wanted to check-out the tag revision from the repo of fluent nhibernate from which 1.0rtm was created.but even after looking through the directory structure i couldn t figure out which one was that. its pretty simple for nhibernate though since they have a tags folder with the periodically released tags

1676197
crossover	mutation
although there is some tendency to use crossover rate on level 0.7-0.9 and mutation on 0.1-0.3 it really depends

1676223

1676464
int	chars
3 chars s 3 bytes 2 int 2 4 bytes so 3 + 8

1676464
int	chars
this is because you cannot fit three chars s and an int into that 4 byte word and so there s one byte of padded space there which pushes the int into it s own word

1676492
google-chrome	firefox
everything is fine in firefox and google-chrome but in ie 6 7 the sifr titles do not appear in any divs apart from the first in the cycle

1676501
junit	testng
junit and testng are initially unit testing frameworks but can be used for integration testing as well

1676505
post	get
because of the difficulties inherent in trying to use javascript to make soap calls and the limitations of vxml as in making external resource calls are pretty much limited to http requests get and post

1676512
rdf	owl
i guess my question is also is sparql rdf owl ready for serving large real-world data warehouses for an enterprise

1676516
httphandler	httpcontext	httphandler	httpmodule	httpcontext	httpmodule
well for starters page.response implies that you have a current valid page object httpcontext is static and can be called at any time - like in your global.asax or and httpmodule httphandler

1676530
freebsd	linux
in your case if you re sure your .bashrc is going to be used only on gnu linux and on a bsd system you can check for switches that exist in one of the ls but not in the other for example -d doesn t seem to be an accepted switch by ls on my bsd machines freebsd and mac os x whereas it is for gnu ls

1676537

1676641
folder	directory
you can copy the exe over yourself go to the bin folder in the directory your source code is in and copy it there

1676679
hash	salt
transactions and otherwise sensitive material could easily be hidden with a salt + hash string and stored in another column in your database if you wanted to but if you re still not validating user input which in web programming clearly could be navigating through the uri you re missing the point

1676690
ubuntu	debian
for the stripped-down version of vim shipped with debian ubuntu by default type s # in the third step instead

1676749
xsl-fo	xslt
advantages if you understand html and xslt creating output with xsl-fo is not a lot harder than creating html with xslt software is open source

1676829
width	height
width of all images and on sum of all image height

1676916
subtract	add
so i would already know what the numbers were for a year a given month a given week and a given day for a store and if they ask for a particular range i use the various scales to quickly add up something that gives the right results but i don t have to necessarily reprocess the full data set i just retrieve four or five records and add or subtract them

1676920
move	drag
i want the user to be able to touch drag on the screen inside or outside of the large circle and it will move the smaller circle in that direction

1676931
filesystems	fat
the fat filesystems stores times as local times which means that it s just completely screwed

1676966
interpolation	splines
the converse would apply at higher levels of zoom - to the point where you would need to use interpolation like linear polynomial splines etc on the data to estimate at the values between your data points

1677036
rss	feed
i m using a third-party ajax slideshow for a website that takes an rss feed as its picture source

1677036
rss	feed
i would like to randomize the order of the pictures but that s not a feature of the slideshow or the rss feed i m pulling from

1677036
rss	feed
surely it shouldn t be difficult to write a short function in php that takes an external rss feed randomizes the items and re-publishes the same feed out of order

1677072
width	height
essentially i want to have a fixed height on the field and stretch it horizontally across the width

1677092
folder	directory
your webserver should be setup with a virtual directory pointing to the published folder and it would be a good idea to have a default.aspx page in the folder since the webserver looks for this page as it s starting point

1677114
inherited	properties
interfaces do not define implementations thus ilocation doesn t inherited the properties of ilocationsource

1677143
button	checkbox
you can add image and even controls like button and checkbox to tricheditwb

1677186
int	double
actually i see you using a function outvalue.aslong which i would expect to return a long value which is an int instead of a double value which is floating point and it ll be more convenient to deal with an int in this case

1677186
put	get
we get the value into long_value and then use the sprintf function to put the value into string_value

1677208
ant	maven
another approach i ve seen in java is a build-time approach where you use ant token substitution or maven build profiles to build environment-specific packages

1677232
stringbuilder	bufferedwriter
since you re ultimately writing to a file a better approach would be to write to the bufferedwriter more often instead of creating a huge stringbuilder in-memory and writing everything at the end depending on your use-case you might even be able to eliminate the stringbuilder entirely

1677276
mouse	trackpad
if it is based on iokit device properties i suspect you will need a kext that emulates a trackpad but actually communicates with the mouse

1677291
stringbuilder	bufferedwriter
if possible use bufferedwriter from the beginning on instead of stringbuilder to save memory

1677306
google-chrome	firefox
if the extension is registered try opening google-chrome backtosearch content backtosearch.xul in firefox by copying that to the location bar -- if any errors appear you should fix them

1677418
vbscript	autoit
note i can set the fields just fine without the form being submitted using perl vbscript python autoit etc

1677421
width	height
just compute the center of the jframe and subtract half the width height of the jdialog to get your dialog s upper left corner

1677422
rss	feed
rss utilities by rodrigo oliveira will make it dead easy to parse rss feed it wont handle subscriptions etc you d have to do that

1677464
google-chrome	firefox
unfortunately not cross-browser i did test this in firefox ie and google-chrome

1677482
x86	mips
it s the case in x86 powerpc mips sparc ee and the cell spus

1677543
versioning	upgrade
but there may be downsides such as having to stick with the versioning of castle that nhibernate is compiled against rather than being able to upgrade the ioc container when i choose

1677553
tax	shipping
else a diversified approach could potentially reduce shipping bank or even tax overheads

1677579
firefox	safari
edit strike that it works both ways in my test case under safari 4.0.3 and firefox 3.5

1677584
uicontrol	uibutton
your view can derive from uicontrol if you d like it to be clickable as a whole otherwise you can use a uibutton in place of the uiimageview

1677595
postgresql	mysql
i m migrating a db from mysql to postgresql

hex	binary
i d like to be able to detect binary data and convert it to hex for easier readability debugging

1677645
post	get
i suspect the pivot operator is what i need according to this post anyway but i can t figure out how to get started especially when the number of question_id rows in the table can vary

1677692
udp	tcp
lccs sounds like a fuller solution for offering p2p gaming as well as standard client server udp or tcp based gaming

1677692
udp	tcp
it attempts p2p udp if that fails it can fall back to client dedicated server tcp or udp communication

1677735
int	chars
because on your machine an int is four bytes but a chars is 1

1677743
int	chars
on most modern architectures an int will be exactly the length of 4 chars s.

1677745
int	chars
you are using a chars size pointer to write into an int size memory space

1677745
int	chars
-1 happens to be 0xff for a chars and 0xffffffff for a int so after writing four 0xff you get one int sized -1

1677768
memcmp	strcmp
the main differences differences between memcmp and strcmp are

1677768
memcmp	strcmp
memcmp often runs just a little bit faster than strcmp

1677781
actualheight	actualwidth
i have installed snoop and i have determined that the actualwidth and actualheight is always zero if i put the same media element on the main window just randomly placed it does show

1677781
width	height
also if i set the width and height manually it still doesnt show up

1677789
put	get
you can t get them to work for the end even if you put the end on top but you do have control on the last line and you haven t done anything else to it

1677829
libxml2	tinyxml
i don t know anything about tinyxml but i have been using that kind of class design with libxml2 for several years now and it has been working fine for me

1677864
postgresql	mysql

1677893
post	get
i am using the post and get methods for ajax calls and have a general question

1677958
int	chars
flyweight int chars etc

1677964
rss	feed
there is no rss feed for profile walls due to the complexity permissions and the amount of posts to walls

1678068
int	chars
i would like to understand why on .net there are nine int types chars byte sbyte int16 uint16 int32 uint32 int64 and uint64

1678087
post	get
i click on that and get the next 15 post and append it to the container containing the 1st 15 post through insert_html

1678100
vb.net	vb6
when you open a .vbp vb6 project it asks if you would like to automatically convert it to vb.net

1678107
post	get
can easily switch between get and post requests in the future.

1678123
maven	pom.xml
the pom.xml and pom.properties files are packaged up in the jar so that each artifact produced by maven is self-describing and also allows you to utilize the metadata in your own application should the need arise

1678139
subtract	add
when i want to display the date time to the user view do i simply just add subtract the offset

1678163
subtract	add
don t just add subtract the offset use the c# datetime functions to convert between utc and local time

1678235
junit	mockito
you can start with junit and you can use mocking framework like mockito to mock parts of your code that involves using frameworks

1678248
width	height
you will want to use android layout_above +id btnok for your webview and do fill_parent for width and height of the webview

1678256
put	get
containers like hashset rely on the hash function to determine where to put it and where to get it from when asked for it

1678256
put	get
if you put a in with value v and look up b you should expect to get v back since you ve said a.equals b

1678259
post	get
i think a better approach would be to post back using jquery get your result set from whatever database you are using and return that back to the view as apartial view

1678341
int	chars
you can have null pointers and null empty strings and there s the null chars 0 equal to 0 when converted to an int

1678341

the name sethost should be reserved for a setterâ one of a pair of methods accessor in objective-c parlance that get and set a properties

1678347
punctuation	words
i am reading a text file which contains a words with a punctuation mark on it and i would like to read this words into a string without the punctuation marks

1678361
gwt	dwr
you can build this mechanism by your own or use some existing ajax framework like gwt dwr even zk to accomplish it

1678397
punctuation	words
you can also use the boost tokenizer library for splitting the string into words after you have removed the punctuation marks

1678415
free	malloc
the array is allocated on the stack but in terms of the code style it s a lot like if you used malloc you don t have to free it though that s done automatically

1678424
pull	push
so this will prevent you to lose history try a git pull first resolve potential conflicts and git push the result

1678433
boost	stl
sun studio on solaris for example can t work with boost without the use of stlport but any 3rd party commercial library you want to use will require sun s version of the stl

1678485
versioning	upgrade
this will upgrade the settings from the previous versioning if it s the first run of the new versioning

1678496
debian	linux
debian linux for example ships with bookshelves worth of manpages

1678538
vmware	virtualbox
i m interested in programming a virtual machine nothing as fancy as virtualbox or vmware but something that can emulate a simple architecture be it cisc or risc say the zilog sparc mips or 80686 architecture models

1678575
put	get
i have an extension method to get the root domain of a uri and another to determine whether it s my domain but can t put them in a lambda here because they have no supported translation to sql

1678582
range	infinity
the limit of that as n tends to infinity is in the range to operations for some constants c1 and c2

1678602
int	double
yes i know that s a contrived example but we don t know the intent of the coder from just the type on the left especially if it s not being assigned to a variable at all such as being passed as an argument to an overloaded function that can take one of int float double decimal et al

1678613
haskell	ocaml
f# caml ocaml haskell and boo have type inference that generally behaves like what you are describing

1678637

performselector	delegation
and then just call delegation performselector selector if you need it

1678680
put	get
i cant seen to get the php sessions to work im trying to create a form that saves the data then put its against regular expressions to verify its legit information

1678683
post	get
generally when passing lots of data to the server to be processed or stored using post is a good idea since get has a lower limit than that of post

1678688
post	get
what is wrong is to post some form as get like it make long url the user can bookmark it and that a bad move

1678688
post	get
also has good form policy i advice you to take a look at the post redirect get policy

1678697
post	get
the practical problem with get requests that modify data is that they might get followed by mistake - think bookmarks back forward buttons many browsers display a warning if you try and re-submit a post request this way search engines following links etc

1678727
post	get
when post is better than get

1678727
post	get
when get is better than post

1678727
post	get
if you decide to get uber-strict on page expiration no-cache and the whole business when users click back on their browser pages generated with post data will not resend the post data to create the page where as the get request will remain the same as it was originally

1678741
superclass	subclassing
you also have to decide whether the subclassing module decides whether to throw the error or the superclass module

1678763
post	get
i always use the post redirect get method on my forms

1678785
disk	ram
putting an index on whatever you search for could well help but it could also be an issue related to sql having to get the image off the disk into ram and them sending it out across the network

1678791
post	get
afterwards otherwise you will still get the post warning on a refresh

1678791
post	put
you could serialize the post vars you want to return and put them in the query string sent via the header

1678826

generate some number n of random integers between min and max inclusive

1678966
mouse	keyboard
one cheap workaround if you re using linux is to use a window manager that lets you easily adjust the transparency of windows with a keyboard mouse shortcut

1679018
hide	show
an alternative may be use the setvisible boolean to show and hide widgets instead of adding and removing them

1679035
folder	directory
users are required to register and upon sign-up a folder is created for them in the uploads directory

1679035

hash	md5
up to now passwords are stored in a 1-way md5 hash meaning people must be given a new generated password if they lose the old one

1679316
hash	md5
since asp classic doesn t have native hash functions you ll probably need to port your md5 vbscript code to your .net language or to use a common cryptography component due some error on your legacy code

children	parent
basically measurespecs are about size and layoutparams helps parent view to distribute available size between its children

1679927
postgresql	mysql
i have encountered a problem where i need to copy only data from a postgresql database to mysql database

1679940
postgresql	mysql
alternatives are mysql postgresql oracle mssql derby etc

1679952
google-chrome	safari
ie and safari google-chrome work fine

1680019
hash	md5
server-side program creates an md5 hash list of all the files in

1680019
hash	md5
client-side program creates an md5 hash list of all the files in

1680025
teamcity	nant
however when i instruct teamcity to build my nant build file and instruct it to process the test targets i get no test output to teamcity

1680049
dotnetzip	sharpziplib
i ve spent some time wading through the zip spec and actually i wrote dotnetzip which is a zip library for .net unrelated to sharpziplib

1680049
zipoutputstream	zipfile
just for the curious in dotnetzip you will get bit 3 set if you use the zipfile class and save it to a nonseekable stream like aspnet s response.outputstream or if you use the zipoutputstream class in dotnetzip which always writes forward only no seeking back

1680055
firefox	safari	width	height
i had the same problem and i ve solved only for firefox and safari by fixing the width but not the height and playing with the values padding top and bottom line-height and if needed setting the vertical-align to middle

1680069
postgresql	mysql
it looks like you might be trying to load data into mysql with the postgresql client tool

1680101
getter	setter
now the name property is readonly external to the class but can be changed by the class through property syntax or setter getter syntax

1680105
width	height
then you can check the desiredsize property of that view to see what the probable width and height is of that region

1680189
accessor	properties
the java bean specification says that the names of accessor should be getx or isx but since the fields are final there is no setter and the fields are more like attributes than properties

1680196
getter	setter
also worth mentioning that plain java beans in many frameworks depend on the fact that getter setter are conveniently named getx and setx

1680209
put	get
however when i try to get the information from the tracker i either timeout the tracker is working or get empty data depending on what form i put the url in

1680214
windows	wow64
edit 2 clarified that on 64-bit windows you need both folders not just the wow64 one

1680313
integer	fractions
my integer parts are pretty small 1-10000 and fractions part big

1680343
mbunit	nunit
i am looking at moving from nunit to mbunit for my unit testing framework as it has a couple of features that i like one of them being the parallelizable attribute

1680343
mbunit	nunit
reason for asking the first question is that i have as a test simply swapped the nunit framework for th mbunit framework and in a particular test class sets of tests tend to fail when run in parallel and pass when run sequentially

1680352
instances	transient
ec2 instances are transient

1680408
post	put
create edit delete is straight forward just need to do the put post delete in the good database

1680409
hide	show
i ve been having nothing but problems with this script for a simple hide show gallery of testimonials

1680409
firefox	safari
as a side note this is working fine in firefox and safari

1680441
for-loop	loops
1 not equal to one then the for-loop returns true and loops and method are exited

1680448
width	height
i need to get the value after for example this one but i have no idea how can i do that and i will also need to replace the width and height propertis

1680459
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox

1680504
rss	feed
i m designing a small system to parse rss feed and i have two classes feed and feeditem

1680527

1680554
folder	directory
creating a branches task version1.0 directory create folder on task

1680565
iprincipal	iidentity
i have defined a custom iprincipal and custom iidentity based on a website that defines both valid identities and their permissions

1680565
iprincipal	iidentity
the question is when using the declarative principalpermission attribute on top of my assembly classes how to enforce that my custom iprincipal and iidentity classes are in use and not some other iprincipal iidentity that might be authenticated

1680625
firefox	safari
a click event on a disabled form field does not fire events in firefox and safari

1680625
mouseup	mousedown
opera fires the mousedown and mouseup events but not the click event

1680625
mouseup	mousedown
ie fires mousedown and mouseup but not click on the form

1680633
integer	unsigned
all document ids must be unique unsigned non-zero integer numbers

1680634
iprincipal	iidentity
security-aware code is split into two parts the identifying party ip which authenticates users and generates iidentity and iprincipal objects and the relying party rp which makes use of them

1680634
iprincipal	iidentity
that way you ensure that you only ever generate your custom iidentity and iprincipal objects

1680640
width	height
rectangle explicitly compares each field x y width height

1680641
public	protected
iâ m trying to test if a protected method is called in a public interface

1680755
move	drag
there is just one way to make the window manager move the window add a drag bar

1680755
move	drag
if there is no drag bar then your app must move the window itself by setting the new position you must handle the mouse click+move events yourself

1680775
mouse	keyboard
--open the keyboard mouse pane

1680775
mouse	keyboard
display dialog sorry an error occured while altering keyboard and mouse settings return theerror buttons ok default button ok

1680934
versioning	upgrade
hi i want to upgrade the versioning of compact framework in my htc touch phone

1680934
versioning	upgrade
but when i try to run the application it just shows the message to quit the application and upgrade the framework versioning

1680952
put	get
to get scrolling support you should put your vbox in a gtkscrolledwindow

1680956
int	double
if you marked every decimal on the number line in blue and every double in red except for the int there would be very few places where the same value was marked in both colors

1680959
public	protected
get_class_methods will pick out only the public methods not the protected or private ones

1680995
inherited	properties
implement iserializable and do serialization manually or do what the exception message says - rename the properties in inherited type in your serialization stream

1680997
children	parent
each class has a static contructor that registers with its parent so the parent knows about its direct children this was c++ i think this step is not needed in languages with good reflection support

1680997
children	parent
when a packet came in i ve simply passed it to static constructor method of the main parent class called packet which in turn checked all of its children if it s their responsibility to handle that packet and this went recursively until one class at the bottom of the hierarchy returned the instantiated class back

1681035
pop-up	dialog
i then try checking in something to that project and a little dialog pop-up saying

1681070
int	double
from my tests it appears to be any basic scalar type int long decimal double etc plus any struct that doesn t have a .equals override and contains only simple types recursively

1681089
ant	maven
you can try to use the maven tomcat plugin or if it does not give you everything you need you can always use an ant task here is a reference on the task

1681129
memcpy	strncpy
remember that strncpy will not zero-terminate the result in this case so you ll have to do it yourself which btw means that it makes more sense to use memcpy instead of the virtually useless strncpy

1681154
wsdualhttpbinding	basichttpbinding
now callback contracts require two way duplex communication so if you re just using basichttpbinding now you would need to switch to use wsdualhttpbinding or some non-http binding altogether which blows interop for this service out of the water

1681225
octal	decimal	octal	binary
but woe betide the programmer who tries to assign decimal 3735928559 or octal 33653337357 or worst of all binary 11011110101011011011111011101111

1681243
pop-up	dialog
when we try testing this code in our winforms shell the appropriate dialog the one hosted in the active mdichild pop-up when all 3 controls exist but in the vb6 host the wrong dialog usually appears it seems to always be the dialog for the first control which was created

1681263
getter	setter
as recommended in the tutorials i wrap the message builder in a class of my own that implements getter and setter methods to access the message s properties

1681413
udp	tcp
one over tcp and the other one over udp

1681452
google-chrome	firefox
im trying to implement slideshow2 but i have problems with ie as you can see in this test the slideshow works ok in firefox and google-chrome but is not working on ie7

1681461
nant	cruisecontrol
i used cruisecontrol with nant extensively but not msbuild

1681493
int	chars
it supplied the types int and chars arrays of them and pointers to them declared in a style typified by

1681493
int	chars
the semantics of arrays remained exactly as in b and bcpl the declarations of iarray and carray create cells dynamically initialized with a value pointing to the first of a sequence of 10 int and chars respectively

1681498
put	get
i tried using registery key in which i stored the path of the folder in a registery key and get that path and put it in place of utility.dll but this did not work..

1681516
folder	dir
go to install dir of xampp htdocs create a new folder mydir then create an index.php and write in it

1681606
opera	firefox
it looks perfect in firefox and opera but it is absolutely horrible in ie

1681613
post	get
it inserts tracepoints into the kernel and has some post processing to get some of the kind of statistics you re asking about

1681625
accessor	properties
it is a factory properties that is used to return an instance of an object singleton accessor properties come to mind

1681625
accessor	properties
singleton accessor properties

1681637
mouse	keyboard
this is not usual because normally to close a dialog the user have to use the mouse or the keyboard and then the drag drop operation is automatically canceled

1681641
post	get
post part of the crash report on pastebin or the like maybe some can get some info out of that

1681667
int	boolean
in this case matrixes of boolean but i can easily pack them into 64 bit int

1681695
ironruby	ironpython
the dynamic language runtime is part of .net 4 ironpython and ironruby and is also available standalone

1681695
ironruby	ironpython
john lam the lead developer of ironruby created a little library called repl-lib which implements a simple editor repl hybrid for ironruby and ironpython which you can just drop into your application

1681756
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
so i have to create a uitabbarcontroller and the items instead of being the direct views are the uinavigationcontroller s with a default view inside

1681803
config	ini
your options include a use an ini xml config file in a location that doesn t require admin rights to access or b modify the security on your own subkey in hklm using a tool like setacl public domain

1681820
ramaze	merb
based on the feedback i d like to clarify when you start a new web app - no matter how small - you are going to use ruby or merb or ramaze or what have you

1681820
csv	tsv
you could potentially argue that i just have one view - console or that i even have multiple - let s say my script needs to run daily and update some .xls file on a share but also output it as csv and maybe tsv file and be able to do xml for consumption by a client service

1681826
google-chrome	firefox
on windows regardless of the browser ie firefox google-chrome this increase the form submit button and give the button spacing padding of 6px

1681838
nsstring	nsdata
your static method newdata is a perfectly ok practice and you can see similar methods throughout the cocoa api just for example nsstring string and nsdata data

1681854
button	checkbox
safari will not style button or checkbox or drop down menus etc

1681855
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
the uitabbarcontroller represents its sub-tabs as an array of uiviewcontroller s not an array of uinavigationcontroller s

1681855
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
therefore your approach is exactly right use uinavigationcontroller s subclass of uiviewcontroller in place of standard view controllers when you want to achieve navigation within a given tab

1681898
children	parent
a parent div should naturally expand to fit its containing elements if they aren t it s usually an indication that something else has gone wrong - in your case when you mention clearfix it suggests you re using floats inside the parent and it s not extending past its children anymore

1682007
formview	detailsview
i d stay away from any of the built in controls detailsview formview for anything other than simple crud forms as it s not much more effort to manually create your own data-entry forms

1682014
post	get
pass in request - get post etc

1682022
tiff	png
look at png or tiff

1682051
profiling	debugging
you can try to attach a profiling to the database honestly i have only done that for sqlserver and run the procedure since the profiling will show any query made to the db you will be able to pick it up there and do the necessary debugging

1682075
hide	show
jquery provides the show and hide effects that allow you to easily toggle the visibility of an element or elements

1682083
jobs	cron
i have seen some libraries like cronedit which let you run cron jobs using ruby

1682091
mp3	wav
as the title says i need to be able to create a wav or mp3 file using sapi on windows xp

1682092
width	height
i think your better off having the rootviewcontroller have it s own uitableview which is set to a dynamic height and width using the uiview autoresizingmask property

1682135
int	boolean
the open table approach makes it difficult to model with ar since you have to worry about the types of the data boolean int string etc

1682142
children	parent
the children of the class with frinedship need to ask there parent to do the access for them

1682144
width	height
however when i place an instance in the designer the auto value for the width and height fields is no longer available as it is with the default treeview

1682158
bash	zsh
i defined a function zsh minor changes - bash

1682193
folder	directory
by calling some stylesheets images scripts or even entire directory can be put into a web-visible folder

1682199
slideup	slidedown
delete the slideup slidedown functions from jrails and presto

1682207
ilist	icollection
edit also note that the c5 collections implement the system.collections.generic icollection and ilist interfaces where appropriate so can be used as the implementation even in systems that expect those interfaces

1682233
ostringstream	std
there is a bug in visual c++ with std ostringstream when _has_iterator_debugging is disabled

1682243
post	get
also you say it works for the get but not for the post

1682247
ilist	icollection
as well the c5 library collections implement the system.collection.generic icollection and ilist interfaces where appropriate and so can be dropped in as the implementation even if a library is only expecting an scg.icollection

1682256
width	height
you may be running into a quirk of ie which has nothing to do with jquery in order for opacity to work elements must have layout which is an ie-specific boolean state which is triggered by css such as height width zoom etc

1682272
xsl-fo	xslt
xslt is was invented for transforming one data format to another xslt 1.0 only xml xslt 2.0 any unicode data format xml to html or xml to xsl-fo or another xml or text format

1682274
cairngorm	flex
i seem to be getting the following error when i try to access a remote java class on spring blazeds from the flex cairngorm application

1682275
public	protected
if a public constructor in an abstract class can only be called by their derived classes it should be functionally equivalent to a protected constructor

1682284
public	protected
i believe there are some weird reflection tricks you can do with public constructors on abstract classes but from a standpoint where you are merely providing base class functionality to other developers writing subclasses stick with the protected constructor

1682315
public	protected
a public constructor in an abstract class is functionally equivalent to a protected constructor

1682347
getter	setter
getter and setter are no longer needed for most decent toolsets they will use annotations instead--just be ready for a few people to take a few extra seconds typing get followed by ctrl-space and not finding what they are after

1682388
decoder	encoder
payload changes have a problem that if you don t control the encoder and decoder you need to make sure the other end accepts both payloads and that they ll switch payloads correctly and fast enough for you - there s no requirement on that

1682412
post	get
we would then have two controller actions that display this view one for get and another for post

1682437
coalesce	isnull
i do have isnull and coalesce but i m not sure if they will help me with this one

1682472
vmware	virtualbox
i use the same feature on virtualbox all the time but vmware has it as well

1682482
hide	show
i m having a lot of trouble with a simple jquery show hide effect

1682482
fadein	fadeout
the problem is they fadein fadeout when you hover over a button

1682486
implements	extends
igor wojnicki has developed for his phd a rule-based inference engine extends knowledge processing capabilities of relational database management systems a prototype system implements his jelly view technology called redares but it seems not available for download

1682487
richfaces	icefaces
the problem is that i canâ t get icefaces and richfaces work together.

1682495
width	height
for example setting maximum height and have the width resize correctly

1682508
vb.net	vb6
we use a number of vb6 authored activex controls in both vb.net and c# applications

1682518
free	malloc
this means locking every malloc free

1682520
width	height
on windows this increase the submit button size height and width as desired .

1682520
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
regardless of the browser safari firefox ie google-chrome

1682529
width	height
i don t think some browsers like when you define width height inline as anything but a numeric value

1682560
mouseover	mouseout
my theory is that the mouseout and mouseover events are being fired one after the other when you mouse over a button

1682560
hide	show
stick and alert inside the hide and show functions and see if that s the case

1682566
django-haystack	sphinx
you could try to use tools like sphinx django-haystack etc

1682579
ilist	icollection
c5 has a much more robust interface that actually exposes all of the features of its underlying implementations and is interface-compatible with the system.collections.generic icollection and ilist interfaces meaning that c5 s collections can be easily substituted as the underlying implementation

1682604
int	double
all c# types including primitive types such as int and double inherit from a single root object type

1682604
multicastdelegate	delegation
similarly all delegation types derive from multicastdelegate but c# requires you to not say that

1682614
point-in-polygon	convex	concave	point-in-polygon	concave	convex
if your world can consist of convex polygonal regions where each side of the polygon is either a solid wall or a portal to another concave space you can easily determine whether a body is within a region with a point-in-polygon test and simplify collision detection by only looking at bodies in the same region or connected regions

1682633
retaincount	dealloc
this way by balancing your retains and releases you ensure than when the retaincount gets to 0 dealloc will be automatically called and your object freed

1682644
nsxmlparser	nsurlconnection
typically you ll use an nsurlconnection to asynchronously connect to the web service return your results as an xml document parse the xml with an nsxmlparser and react accordingly

ironruby	ironpython
the outer layer which is available on codeplex and ships w ironpython and ironruby and is in microsoft.scripting.dll and microsoft.dynamic.dll

1682671
robocopy	xcopy
that would at least get the required files onto the servers and i could use xcopy robocopy and migrator.net to deploy the updates

1682681
post	get
i have read numerous blog post and articles and it sounds like it is possible to read a config file in for a dll but i just can t get it to work

1682742
ienumerable	ilist
you should consider deriving from ienumerable ithings as you re already doing which is atm superflurous since list also implements that interface or if you need the list interface and not only the ienumerable implement ilist and keep a private list object

1682785
clang	llvm
for extra clag scrubbing power set the compiler type to clang llvm

1682795
persistent	transient
if you don t need this values to be persistent annotate them with transient and put the initalization this way

1682854
int	double
i want the user to be able to insert only int in the first three and a double in the fourth

1682867
mouseover	mouseout
hover takes two function parameters one for mouseover and the other for mouseout

1682867
fadein	fadeout
if you want the fadeout and fadein to be concurrent don t put the fadein in the callback of the fadeout

1682867
fadein	fadeout
the way you have it the fadein doesn t start until the fadeout is done

1682873
firefox	safari
wrapping the list in a now works in firefox 3.0 but not in safari 4.0

1682873
firefox	safari
this is why safari was automagically closing my paragraph before the list although firefox let it slide

1682888
inherited	properties
because this is so unwieldly i like to create an inherited attached properties that automatically applies validation rules so all i have to say is

1682895
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
specificially i have a uitabbarcontroller with a uinavigationcontroller inside displaying a uitableviewcontroller which is the view that displays the subview and also the view that gets shifted up

1682897
margin	height
the h2 has a height attribute and a margin

1682909
gentoo	linux
my arch linux kernel has no mention of arch but i believe my gentoo install indicates gentoo linux

1682955
rel	attr
i added the rel attr to the tags

1682962
children	parent
they are siblings applied recursively so any identical parent elements are merged and combined before their children are considered

1683002
put	get
we had put for all our tags and applied the svn revision keyword to them so that every time we push a new copy of code out to our production boxes we know all clients will get the current revision

1683059
min	max
i believe this finds the min and max dates for a given an_id and a_date within a 2.5 hour period

1683113
lisp	scheme
in scheme i think in lisp too language .... means multiply all expressions in braces so 2 means simply 2

1683121
keydown	keyup
you should already have one or more of the following events for your control keypress keyup and keydown

1683132
keydown	keyup
i ve managed to capture the enter key event must use keyup instead of keydown but i m not sure how to make the dropdown re-appear at that point

1683190
wowza	ffserver
if we use a streaming media server like fms wowza ffserver prevent people from downloading videos

1683214
post	get
the data in a custom attribute doesn t get send back to the server on post back so it will only know by way of the view state what value the attribute had when the page was rendered

1683219
trac	bugzilla
i ve never used trac but bugzilla works really well as a free bug tracker

1683263
int	chars
int execve const chars filename chars

1683289
post	get
basically you can write a totally normal controller whether accessed by get or post method and add your list of users to the model before returning ther name of your json view

1683289
post	get
you can google up the documentation for the ajaxform module in order to learn how to post instead of get and to send grab only certain fields and send them to a url that is not the intended url of the form

1683334
pop-up	dialog
for example if i open the program.cs a warning dialog pop-up if you edit this you are gonna die

1683341
wsimport	wsdl2java
use your wsimport tool jax-ws or wsdl2java jax-rpc to generate the stubs and write your groovy class as usual

1683465
hash	salt
create a shadow table that hash every filed with a key salt only you and the application knows about

1683518
min	max
right now my only idea is to store the min and max x position for every y position something like limits 300 30 30

1683536
put	get
using s3 you d then upload the images using http put and both the editor and web browser would access the images as usual using http get

1683546
width	height
height_field and width_field if you use them are supposed to be names of fields on the model which contain the height and width information

1683559
keydown	keyup
i had some trouble with the keypress event which has a different signature but the keyup and keydown work fine this way

1683579
put	get
when found these regions would get rendered in a special way put a border around the region do a semi-opaque fill to fade the region place the message over the middle of the region or the middle of the visible part of the region

1683579
dxcore	coderush
developer express uses their free dxcore framework to create coderush and refactor pro

1683591
width	height
your problem is with and these should not contain the height and width you require but rather the names of fields in your model that can have the values for height and width save in them

1683598
next	except
in the scope of things no one gives a crap about readability except the next unlucky fool that has to take care of your code

1683659
rss	feed
i m trying to setup a cron job which regularly poles my facebook notification rss feed and then fires off the latest change to my iphone as push message using prowl

1683659
rss	feed
i ve already managed an identical task with a quote-of-the-day rss feed however my facebook rss feed always 302 redirects me to a incompatible web browser.

1683665
put	get
i was finally able to find a download link for vidal s boost.process on an external site and will use that for now but i m quite amazed at the effort i had to put in to get my hands on a cross platform c++ library to interact with external processes

1683696
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
printfs in custom malloc realloc free proxy functions or even an electric fence -style custom allocator might help if its as simple as a buffer overflow

1683700
hide	show
edit your css file to show hide the link based on the combination of the body tag class and the class on the link

1683707
range	infinity
with normal distribution the random variable s range is from negative infinity to positive infinity so if you re looking for positive numbers only then it is not gaussian

1683751
next	except
i am successful except i would like to navigate the pages in design time by clicking the next and previous buttons

1683776

i also saw your post over here that said you were able to get it working using option 2 that justin cave suggested

1684093
free	malloc
that said nedmalloc bills itself as a replacement for the standard malloc free and at least with the ms compilers i think the c++ runtime library will forward new delete to malloc free so it might well just be a case of building your executable with nedmalloc

1684182
next	except
i asked martin buchholz since he happens to be sitting right next to me and he said there wasn t a really particularly great reason except that at the time things were still half-baked -- too few jdk apis had been retrofitted to accept charset and of the ones that were the charset overloads usually performed slightly worse

1685180
implements	extends
but i believe the named pipe approach is the cleanest and would be the easiest to implements extends

1685214
jar	war
first you have to get hold of the ear war or jar file locations of all deployed apps

1685214
jar	war
in the above code we get the path to the war ear jar or the exploded folder and passes it to the packagefinder class s findpakages method which does all the work

1685242
pop-up	dialog
i also need a delete link preferably an image link that should pop-up a yes no delete confirmation dialog

1685270
folder	directory
one way to do this when deploying is to simply make a virtual directory under project_1 that points to the common images folder

1685270
cassini	iis
in development you could either copy the folder into the projects or run them under iis instead of cassini built-in vs web server

1685270
folder	directory
personally i just copy the folder into each project during development because i move the images folder outside of the project directory and use virtual directory when deploying anyway

min max can be solved like this

1685845
cstring	bstr
if you compile for unicode - just assign the encapsulated bstr to the cstring

1685855
ssl	https
https means http and ssl

1685855
ssl	https
so to create a https website you need to create a normal website and a ssl layer to ensure the secure connection between your web server and web browser

1685870
children	parent
if a parent s visible property is set to false none of its children will be visible in the stage

1685933

the compiler knows that hide and show are implemented in form and the above code compiles just fine

1685999
int	double
built-in int double pointer - value

1686088
updatepanel	contentplaceholder
you can put your contentplaceholder control onto an updatepanel in the master page

1686112

post	get
check out the blog post i pointed you to and you should get a thorough understanding of when to use each and why you would use them

1686268
width	height
instead of image maps you can use div s by positioning them as absolute and adjusting the top and left co-ordinates and width and height

1686288
width	height
i am not able to retrieve x y height width of button widget.

1686391
rss	feed
i m building an automated rss feed in asp.net and occurrences of apostrophes and hyphens are rendering very strangely

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
see for example firebug s net panel in firefox or web inspector s resources panel in google-chrome or safari

1686479
spweb	spsite
try creating new spsite and spweb objects before getting items and get them from new webs

1686486
prng	random
it s unlikely your prng has enough bits of state to express every possible shuffle however so the real question is if your prng is random enough with regards to the set of shuffles it will actually produce and whether your seeding strategy is secure enough

1686494
integer	unsigned
a 4 byte unsigned integer can represent a value up to 4294967295 which means if you want to move more than 4g you need to use lseek64

1686540
httphandler	httpcontext
i m trying to send a file in chunks to an httphandler but when i receive the request in the httpcontext the inputstream is empty

1686557
min	max
of course you will do all this in binary so you will not be checking to make sure the address is between a min and a max value instead you will use the subnet mask to get the prefix of your address and the destination address then check that they are equal

1686587
gridview	datalist
scottgu has a detailed blog post here using a datalist but this is equally applicable to gridview

1686705
range	max	range	min	min	max
and a point x y find users where the point is within the min and max latitude and longitude range of users where min and max long and lat current position minus or plus radius

in my web application i have a button when i click i want to open a new page the page should width 220 height 300 like this please help me thank you

1686977
getter	setter
i actually happily design and develop java ee applications for quite 9 years but i realized recently that as time goes by i feel more and more fed up of dragging all these ugly bean classes with their bunch of getter and setter

1686977
getter	setter
it would still be possible to mix annotation and written down getter or setter to cover cases when it should do non-trivial sets and gets

1686977
getter	setter
in other words annotation would auto-generate the getter setter code piece except when a literate one is provided

1687024
disk	ram
ram 350+ gb hdd usable hard disk

1687028
onclick	onsubmit
trapping onclick for every link on the page plus onsubmit on every form is slightly more reliable but can still be fooled due to the delay

1687030
getter	setter
project lombok partially fills this hole it handles the generation of getter and setter and other stuff

1687030
getter	setter
but using the field-access syntax to access getter and setter isn t possible this way

1687139
equals	gethashcode
if you implement iequatable you should also override the base class implementations of object equals object and gethashcode so that their behavior is consistent with that of the iequatable equals method

1687161
firefox	safari
firefox and safari ask me if i want to resend my form data

1687209
accessor	properties
you either just expose the structure as a properties in which case you have to set get the whole thing or you write custom accessor that walk into the fields of the strucutre

1687261
prepare	execute
i prepare a statement using placeholders then execute the query

1687310
min	max
in one dimension if min 0 then x must fall between 0 and max or x must fall between min + 360 and 360

1687310
min	max
similarly if min 0 then x must fall between min and max or it must fall between 0 and max - 360

1687310
subtraction	addition
if you move the addition and subtraction of 360 to the x and y parameters the comparisons become constant and probably speed the query dramatically

1687313
getter	setter
or add several wrappers for the getter and setter of size into square

1687326
width	height
in my application a canvas object has height 90 px width 86400 px indicating number of seconds in a day 60 60 24

1687332
dom4j	xom
this answer is part of my evaluation of xom as a potential replacement to dom4j .

1687341
jobs	cron
the php functionality contains system calls exec to merge edit create files with gnu software nix environment as well as api calls to rest services for uploading these files this will be done with cron jobs however

1687351
x86	mips
it uses glr for parsing builds an ast uses ssa as its intermediate form does inter procedural optimizations and generates code for x86 arm mips powerpc sparc and others

1687355
try-catch	exception-handling
this is wrapped around a try-catch loop so within the catch portion i had it dump the exception-handling to stdout

1687363
hide	show
if there were a show hide function taking a boolean parameter it could be even shorter

1687366
stdout	stderr
in createprocess you pass a startupinfo where you can specify handles for sdin stdout and stderr

1687386
width	height
so long as the behaviour of those components remain the same same width height area otherwise you might want to declare them as virtual in the base class in order to be able to override them if necessary

1687511
move	drag
but what i want is when i drag the item than it should reach at some point where i drop it and again from the drop point it should move to the other point

1687520
int	double
i think you can do without the mprotect if it is that important to you declare the pointer as static in your lookup.c or whatever it is called and then have a non-static double get_sine int index

1687521
folder	directory
one option is to add the file containing the class to a sub directory of the app_code directory and set compilation to vb for that folder

1687594
serializable	deserialization
serializable deserialization becomes a bigger bottleneck when you scale out to a session server or use sql server to manage session state

1687610
put	get	post	put	post	get
sys.net.webrequest offers a way to specify the verb get post put and delete but no built-in callback for a failed request they all seem to use the same callback success or fail

1687610
post	get
sys.net.webserviceproxy seems to only do get post via the useget parameter on the invoke method

1687624
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome firefox safari on a netbook

1687680
implements	extends
you implements your own date either by extends java.util.date like in option 2 or wrapping it with some timezone object

1687690
getter	setter
in order to access the composed class i would define wrappers for its member functions if the class is small has only a few functions like size or would use getter setter to the whole composed object if the class is big

1687807
int	chars
basically i have a seq of int representing ascii chars

1687809
folder	directory
note in order to do this you must put a copy of your exe file or whatever assembly contains the type passed to createapplicationhost in your asp.net folder s bin directory

1687875
post	get
there s a simple implementation of just creating a form that post directly to paypal and you can optionally use ipn to get info about the transaction

1687881
mouse	keyboard
i have been able to use autoit for some ms office vba projects where keyboard or mouse input was the only way such as when ms office does not expose something in the object model but it exists in the gui

1687896
touchesbegan	uiscrollviewdelegate
you should add touchesbegan withevent on your uiscrollview not on the uiscrollviewdelegate

1687948
awt	swing
you can only run a swing awt app as headless if there is truly no gui

1687987
firefox	safari
the following code doesn t work in ie and safari but works fine in firefox

1688139
opera	safari
also there is interesting project called fauxconsole simulating a firebug safari or opera debugging console in microsoft internet explorer with faux console

1688140
put	get
without a temporary table you can t since you must find a way to put all the values of bunit into a table of some kind and then join mytable against that table to get the null values

1688145
stdout	stderr
writing the output stderr or stdout maybe happening through a callback or some other thread

1688187
vtune	gprof
if your function is a long running one you have to use some sort of profiling tool like gprof it is very easy to use intel s vtune application which i have not used for a long time

1688187
gprof	callgrind
after seeing art s answer i changed my mind from gprof to callgrind

1688187
valgrind	memcheck
i used only the memcheck tool of valgrind in the past and it was a magnificent tool

1688226
profiler	callgrind
the open-source callgrind profiler for linux is a really awesome way to measure performance

1688226
valgrind	callgrind
callgrind is part of valgrind

1688293
children	parent
now you can bind an event handler to a single parent element and that handler will get executed whenever the event occurs on any of its child nodes and any of their children in turn

1688299
implements	extends
if your goal is education and not ease of implementation you would probably be better served by extends the uicomponent class and using the treeitemrenderer code as a reference to create a class that implements the same interfaces

1688378
scheme	prolog
you won t see main in scheme or prolog for instance

1688444
puts	gets
the underlying idea is to dedicate a thread to entirely own a shared resource or subsystem and have all other worker threads access the resource only by gets and or puts on queues used by that dedicated thread queue is intrinsically threadsafe

1688478
for-loop	loops
as the variable s context is loops a new instance will be created each time because we have moved the variable inside the local context the for-loop

1688482
comparator	comparable
typically if you want to be able to reorder a list using a comparator you don t need to implement comparable only good for one ordering you create new comparator objects which can be written outside that class and can specify any ordering possible by the getters in that class

1688500
comparator	comparable
based on your code you seem to have some confusion between the comparable and comparator interfaces

1688500
arraylist	treeset
a better approach of course would be to use a treeset rather than an arraylist

1688505
pop-up	dialog
in other words by clicking a certain button in form1 form2 needs to pop-up like a dialog box

1688520
hide	show
you can put these controls on a panel or other docking control so that users can hide it and show it as required

1688528
vb.net	vb6
i found that the easiest solution was to create a class in vb to call those functions since vb.net does support optional parameters and then call that vb6 class from c#

1688528
vb.net	vb6
in the class written in vb.net i followed the proper method overloading to provide several methods to call that one vb6 function

1688528
vb.net	vb6
example - say the vb6 function has three parameters the first one required and the second two optional i d create three functions in the vb.net component

1688543
button	checkbox
for every item you place in the list item that is focusable button checkbox etc you need to set the android focusable attribute to false

1688550
restrict	shared
there might also be a problem if you run the application from a network shared then it runs with restrict rights

1688566
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i m trying to get rid of a server hit to improve responsiveness of an ajax app but i might only be able to do it for firefox google-chrome opera and safari if there s no way to coax the info out of ie

1688670
fseek	fread
when you do fseek ..seek_end the position inside the opened file is at the end whenever you call fread you are getting 0 bytes as you re at the end

1688723
isnull	nvl
for mssql replace ifnull with isnull or for oracle use nvl

1688817
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
much to my surprise it works great in ie google-chrome safari and opera - but it pretty much sucks in firefox

1688833
vmware	virtualbox
use a virtualization tool like virtualbox or vmware to install a fresh copy of windows and your application

1688855
post	get
they say to get this to work it has to be a form post multipart form-data but i m not using a form

1688871
width	height
first guess - width and height in tags

1688871
width	height
use css properties width and height sic instead

1688897
gridview	objectdatasource
there is also objectdatasource connected to the gridview

1688897
gridview	objectdatasource
i thought that this value is evaluated just as objectdatasource connects to gridview and this theid property should get the valu from the objectdatasource

1688918
bazaar	git	bazaar	cvs	bazaar	perforce	perforce	cvs
software configuration management version control cvs subversion git mercurial bazaar perforce etc

1688918
trac	bugzilla
issue tracking bugzilla trac fogbugz etc

1688942
int	chars
in my program there are no way to know which is the type of variable arguments it can be a chars an array an int an short an function point etc.

1688983
hash	md5
i have used md5 successfully but i have read that it is possible to generate a hash collision with md5 though i have never done it

1689026
yslow	pagespeed
you can use firefox plugins yslow and pagespeed to test for load performance bottlenecks

1689027
lisp	smalltalk
but it is not necessarily a language that is the best suited for those who are approaching their problem from a strictly high-level perspective lisp smalltalk java c#

1689073
sorting	filtering
that would make the data call a lot faster and then you could implement filtering sorting etc

1689097
nginx	lighttpd
there is a unofficial memcache module for lighttpd but it does not seem stable i have also heard a memcache module for nginx but don t know whether is this possible or not

1689110
versioning	upgrade
they have an enterprise versioning but to be honest after using community versioning for almost a year in a environment with about 150 users - i really don t see the need to upgrade

1689126
width	height
the width and height fields were specified to 300 in the custom control s xaml when it was created i didn t notice

1689182
ubuntu	linux
update i m running on ubuntu linux and the reader objects are sockets

1689227
ant	maven	ant	pom.xml	maven	pom.xml
it was getting so hard to write up a pom.xml that i generated a ant build.xml from one of maven s tasks which is a nice handy task...

1689243
mouseup	mousedown
so the effect that i was seeing in firefox and ie was a result of a slight delay between mousedown and mouseup

1689243
google-chrome	safari
i tried it in safari and google-chrome and they worked fine as usual

1689248
ffmpeg	libav
finally if you want you can write computer code in c or c++ using ffmpeg s libav libraries or java using xuggler to programatically do this but that s pretty advanced for your use case

1689256
implements	extends
you would just extends the class defaultftplet and implements onuploadend onrenameend ondeleteend

1689284
memcached	apc
if you are only using a single server i would suggest you make a switch to apc which provides both opcode caching and a caching mechanism faster than memcached for a single server application

1689290
ienumerable	icollection
ienumerable or icollection

1689320
pop-up	dialog
i needed to have my js pop-up login dialog box support localization

1689366
width	height
width and height undeclared

1689441
integer	unsigned
this will always print out as an unsigned integer in hexadecimal which is far more useful than a signed decimal integer

1689447
ant	pom.xml
it is not common to enrich a pom.xml with ant clutter

1689447
ant	pom.xml
however some special tasks or legacy ant tasks are sometimes embedded into the pom.xml lifecycle but these are exceptions and not the common case

1689451
ant	maven
they use maven for dependency management and then do their building with ant

1689451
ant	maven
this undermines some of the benefits maven is supposed to bring such as the fact that a normal build is simpler to specify in maven than ant

1689505
ubuntu	linux
this is on a linux ubuntu system

1689550
hash	md5
if you want to know why other smtp auth mechanisms use base64 its because typically the data they re sending is actually binary data of some sort like a md5 hash of the shared secret and a token provided by the server

1689607
post	get
one workaround i use to get around the lack of this feature is an extension method like what s described in this blog post to allow code like this

1689609
post	get
a suggestion - use the link below how to post data code on a forum to get the best help

1689644
width	height
for instance if i start would with 32x32 buttons that need to shrink to fit all of them in the layout i want them to shrink proportionally so that the width to height scale is maintained

1689697
ant	maven
one of the reasons i eventually switched to maven though is that for many of the mojos similar to ant tasks you don t have to understand how to configure them

1689713
des	rsa
determining strength is a very hard thing to do in the general case although some algorithms have been given enough attention that their strengths and weaknesses are fairly well known des rsa etc

1689739
opera	google-chrome
my feeling is that it s a problem doesn t lie in the code at all but in the rendering of the div and or its contents in google-chrome and opera a css problem or something along those lines where the innerhtml of the div is updated but because of styling or positioning you don t get the visual result you were looking for

1689771
width	height
in the css for my web site i have specfied the height as 800px width as 1050px

1689771
width	height
the entire application width and height should be this size

1689771
width	height
i need to specify the entire width and height of the application to the blue color with no white space at either edge

1689791
postgresql	mysql
they are loaded from .net assemblies so you can write your own provider if you want to but mono already has ms sql and oracle plus postgresql and mysql provide their own .net assemblies

1689804
width	height
do not set a width and height on the body this is unnecessary

1689804
width	height
if you want to restrict your application from leaving the 800x1050 margins while retaining the background just put a wrapper div around the site and set the width and height there

1689805
post	get
the only way to get data into appengine is to call up a web app of yours as a web app and feed it data through the usual http-ish means as parameters to a get request for short data or to a post if long or binary

1689841
disk	ram
you then make a system call to read some data from the file and the os fetches it from the disk and copies it into some region of ram that you specify that would be a character byte array in your program

1689841
disk	ram
if you re interested in what the os actually does behind the scenes to get data from the disk to ram well.

1689861
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
for instance i would like to store mozilla firefox safari google-chrome ie etc.

1689874
cdr	cons
a cons statement is used to allocate a pair whose car is obj1 and whose cdr is obj2

1689902
scrollable	panels
since the imagecontainer is the class being added to your scrollable panels that is the panels which needs to exceed a certain size to make things scrollable

1689909
equals	tostring
tostring and equals too

1689919
free	malloc
no - malloc ed memory is only ever free by an explicit free

1689921
button	checkbox
i believe it has something to do with bindings and the control views i have in my nib file because when i remove the bindings from the checkbox and radio button from the nib the window can close an unlimited number of times and not crash

1689950
tolower	uppercase
but for the uppercase to lowercase conversion youâ ll either need a mapping like the internal tolower function or you use php for both

1689964
dictionary	map
to answer your question of what can go wrong the hashcode generated by your function will be used to find the place for instances of your class if you put it in a hashtable dictionary map

1689967
onkeyup	onkeydown
to respond to the arrow keys you need to use onkeydown or onkeyup

1689981
postgresql	mysql
also dbs are designed to handle thousands of inserts and deletions - any major db - sql server mysql postgresql shouldn t have any problem with it

1689987
codeigniter	kohana
kohana a fork of codeigniter is worth checking out if you are still looking for a good php framework

1689988
rdf	owl
bigdata r comes packaged with a very high-performance rdf store supporting rdf s and owl lite inference

1689996
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
malloc realloc free memory management is not actually aware about threads

1690016
subclass	accessor
the first is preferred because if you go through the accessor it can trigger kvo notifications which can cause weird issues if your subclass the object

1690023
lisp	scheme
lisp including scheme are dynamically typed and the lisp way is to have many functions over a single data structure rather than different data structures for different tasks

1690059
ant	maven
maven uses convention over configuration with lots of useful defaults directory locations a defined life-cycle a set of common plugins that know how to build and assemble software maven provides a common interface to build project unlike ant you know how to do things like running tests packaging etc with every project no need to open the build script to find out how it s done maven implements reuse through maven plugins build logic is embedded into plugins for dry purpose you don t have to repeat yourself over and over you don t have to copy paste parts of your build scripts maven has a project object model that allows you to describe your project through meta-data this enables dependency management remote repositories reuse of build logic tool integration artifacts search...

1690059
ant	maven
ant + ivy if you want maven vs

1690059
maven	buildr
buildr maven vs

1690059
ant	maven
this might seem tempting because you have the feeling that you regain control because you understand what is happening with ant but you are actually repeating yourself again and losing all advantages of maven

1690182
children	parent
basically you would call this function passing in the parent control and it would recursively loop through all child controls and any children they had

1690194
xmltype	clob
the data is currently stored in oracle as xml documents not using the xmltype but normal clob

1690217
postgresql	mysql
another option is to use postgresql -- unlike mysql it has timezone support for datetimes built-in

1690244
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
google-chrome firefox opera ie

1690267
puts	gets
currently we use for searching and for gets puts deletes of a single product

1690287
post	get
you post or get a single thing a single product

1690300
width	height
in this case with w width and h height it s

1690310
post	put
typically you use post to create a resource when you don t know the identifier of the resource in advance and put when you do

1690310
post	put
so you d post to products or put to products new-id

1690435
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
you can do a getelementbyid to get the menu then getelementsbytagname for the lis which will return an array say items

1690438
for-loop	arrays
your for-loop can start with the second element of the arrays because you have already initialized maxvalue with the first element

1690463
for-loop	arrays
also since it is an arrays you shouldn t use the for...in statement a normal for-loop it s enough i think something like this

1690521
put	get
if you put that somewhere like in your application delegate s applicationdidfinishlaunching method you ll get the picture taker window startup

1690526
converter	multibinding
step 5 use a multibinding to bind the textblock s text property using your converter

1690669
serializable	deserialization
another way to approach the problem is to design the object tree that you ll use in-app first then write serializable and deserialization routines to save and load the contents from a file

1690730
nsstring	nsdata
overriding these messages to return your nsstring as either nsdata or nsinputstream might work

1690730
nsstring	nsdata
converting an nsstring to nsdata is easy

1690735
button	checkbox
you could also set the property directly in interface builder by selecting the checkbox as shown below however in your app you are going to need to wire the button up to an iboutlet anyway to implement your conditional logic.

1690748
innodb	myisam
my mysql server restriction is i can t use innodb tables only myisam

1690754
alloca	malloc
there is also the problem that the caller will have to know that you used malloc and not alloca or new or something else

1690847
converter	multibinding
in this case your converter class will need to chain to the previously declared converter you ll have to clone the binding and install the new one they are immutable once they have been used and you ll also have to deal with multibinding if you want to support them

1690927
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
unfortunately rgba is only supported by more modern browsers firefox safari google-chrome but is fantastic to use

1690942
wildfly	jboss	wildfly	glassfish	jboss	glassfish
in case you re using apache s el implementation instead of oracle s el reference implementation when you re using tomcat tomee jboss etc instead of glassfish payara wildfly websphere etc then you need to re-escape the backslash

1691050
int	chars
normally range of int is much wider than that of chars

1691050
int	chars
when you try to squeeze into a chars an int value that doesn t fit into the range of chars the value will not fit of course

1691050
int	chars
in your case 3000 is an int value that doesn t fit into the range of chars on your implementation

1691052
int	chars
chars is used to hold a single chars and you re trying to store a 4-digit int in one

1691124
bazaar	git
if i were faced with this i would use something like git or bazaar to handle the version checking and just call add then commit from your script and monitor which files have changed and therefore need to be uploaded

1691125
int	boolean
anyadults ages int - boolean

1691158
width	height
if i understand you correctly you have a silverlight grid which fills the web browsers height and width no matter what size the browser is something like this mine is light green

1691158
width	height
except you re not wanting to have the grid s height and width set statically correct

1691192
valgrind	callgrind
for determining the execution you could try valgrind specifically the callgrind module

1691194
udp	tcp
tcp is a stream udp is a message

1691196
implements	extends
it is the teaches that creates one class only that extends the student s class and implements the interface

1691197
udp	tcp
you should note that normally we refer to tcp streams and udp messages

1691218
udp	tcp
also beware that this only works with udp -- there s no such thing as multicast tcp -- and that getting it to work across routers may be difficult

1691238
hide	show
if you want to have the div show and hide when the drop-down changes you need to bind to the change event for example

1691242
udp	tcp
and see if anything is listening on those tcp or udp ports

1691248
ironruby	ironpython
similarly with .net and ironpython or ironruby -- then the engine is microsoft s clr just as for c# boo and so on

1691299
many-to-many	many-to-one
the django admin happily supports many-to-one and many-to-many relationships through an html select form field allowing selection of one or many options respectively

1691317
interpreted-language	compiled-language
one useful distinction between scripting interpreted-language and compiled-language is that you can typically embed a scripting language s interpreter in a compiled project such as a game engine

1691320
cas	opensso
this will not be the most elegant solution but if you are looking for something more enterprisy try sso solution such as opensso or cas

1691385
mvp	presenter
fowler separates mvp into 2 patterns supervising presenter and passive view

1691389
width	height
for your second method create a bitmap with the full height of your drawing area with any width

1691504
factors	matrix
if it works in eclipse then logically it s definitely some diff between the 2 runtimes eclipse and non-eclipse if the matrix checks out fine then see if you can factors out the commonalities in the 2 then work out the differences -- your answer should be in there

1691570
mbunit	nunit
the mbunit framework has the concept of row tests and i believe there is an nunit add-in for 2.4 that provides similar functionality for nunit

1691596
jobs	cron
i m not really thrilled with mechanize for bugginess like this and a problem i had with mechanize handling two submit buttons poorly but it s very simple to install seems pretty portable and can run offline via simple cron jobs easily compared to other testing frameworks like selenium seleniumhq dot org which looks great but seems a lot more involved to actually set up and use

1691618
put	get
in the program i then put each value in the set through an algorithm to get a new value resulting in all the values being transformed

1691658
jar	war
these dependencies will actually end up in the web-inf lib directory of the war beside the jar of your javaapplication

1691658
ant	maven
these steps are typically automated with tools like ant or maven

1691669
jar	war
if you have an eclipse project with your application and another with your web frontend then you can let your application export the necessary resources which the export war in eclipse java ee can wrap up in a jar file and put in web-inf lib for you

1691729
integer	unsigned
it is a typedef for a suitable unsigned integer type

1691729
strncpy	malloc	printf	strncpy
you can no longer call malloc strncpy printf .

1691748
spaces	delimiter
big boys including this site are using denormalised schemas for tags for scalability reasons storing comma pipe or spaces delimiter tags in text type field for each row and separate table for tags with counts

1691748
codeigniter	kohana
i ve posted full tag model in pastie here with methods to handle counts kohana specific but if you know codeigniter you ll feel home

1691749
accessor	properties
all your test harnesses would need to use this in the properties accessor for values you want to compare in your tests

1691759
boost	stl
in some cases boost libraries extend stl so should it be expected that i would be using boost also as i may sometimes confuse which function came from which of the two libraries

1691759
boost	stl
i am used to thinking within the limits of what stl and boost give me and staying within the lines

1691780
debian	linux
tested with ruby 1.8.7 and 1.9.0 on debian linux - please tell me if it works on windows too

1691808
goto	break
one exception i ve discovered is control-flow if you write most of the later manipulations to work on a tree form it can be difficult to cater for statements like break continue and goto even the structured form

1691839
versioning	upgrade
i don t know of any other program that allows you to get free upgrade for the next versioning

1691855
yacc	bison
yacc bison and friends were designed for an era of machines with 64k of memory

1691873
google-chrome	safari
however on webkit browsers safari and google-chrome the vertical scrollbar persists even when there is sufficient room for the page without the scrollbar the scrollbar is grayed out

1691876
int	double
int long double float biginteger etc.

1691996
switching	screens
iirc mmc used to have a splash screens and the s switching would suppress it

1692022
mvp	presenter
i ve been exploring the mvp pattern with asp.net but i have had trouble keeping all of the presentation logic in the presenter when using a databound control on the page

1692029
unsigned	short
short 2 byte 65k unsigned

1692050
hash	md5
if it doesn t need to be statistically random perhaps feed the timestamps to md5 and truncate the hash

1692062
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add
add two fractions subtract multiplying divide - do you want these to be static methods or object methods afraction.add anotherfraction or fraction.add afraction anotherfraction

1692120
udp	tcp
you ll open a network connection of one flavor or another raw tcp or udp or a higher level protocol like http with one side acting as a server and the other acting as a client

1692137
pexpect	subprocess
as i ve often said use pexpect not subprocess etc to run subprocess when you need to get their continuous output

1692137
pexpect	subprocess
pexpect fools the subprocess into believing it s running on a terminal so the subprocess will provide just the kind of output it would give on a real terminal.

1692179
filesystems	ntfs
1k files are not very efficient to store as filesystems fat32 ntfs have cluster size and each file will use the cluster size anyway even if it is smaller than the cluster size

1692180
int	chars
the pointers are less adulterated than the int or chars and the void pointer is the purest of them all

1692232
filesystems	ntfs
if you can do not let them format as fat32 at least ntfs or some recent filesystems of unix flavor

1692235
width	height
schema simplicity if you allow file uploads you ll also need to add meta data about the mime-type file size height and width

1692264
post	get
if you want to cater for people who have javascript disabled check to see if there is a post get as appropriate variable named dummy as this only gets sent if that submit button is actually pressed

1692359
ready	each
before each deploy we trigger the builds for all projects in a well-defined order which gives us ready deploy-artifacts to deploy to some 7 different servers

1692390
cakephp	kohana	symfony	kohana
some will argue you need a framework codeigniteger kohana zend cakephp symfony etc but you don t

1692391
rss	feed
i wish to create a dynamic rss feed to represent my site s content

1692456
put	get
put your test cases into the plugin and try to get that unittest

1692500
width	height
i want to find the height and width of an image file in javascript

1692500
width	height
i don t actually need to show the image in the page just the height and width

1692500
width	height
at the moment i ve got the following code but it s returning height and width 0 in mozilla 5

1692500
width	height
the file definitely exists it s in the same directory as the html and it doesn t have height and width 0

1692507
width	height
if the image is not loaded it won t have its height and width set

1692561
freemarker	velocity
for example freemarker and velocity are often referred to as scripting engines

1692561
perl	tcl
this includes things like awk perl tcl python ruby and so on

1692602
hide	show
in this in the bottom it is showing as twitterizer but i don t want to show the tool name to my users..is there any way to hide that twitterizer or is it possible to rename as my application name

1692608
firefox	safari
what i would like to do is to basically use standard for firefox and safari however for ie i would like to use javascript

1692692
crossover	mutation
...then you can use the double values for interpretation of the solution fitness value and the bits for breeding crossover mutation

1692730
pop-up	dialog
if you don t want to hardcode a password into your setup project then leave it blank and a pop-up dialog should appear asking for this during install

1692737
subtract	add
the tokenizer splits your text into chunks and then each tokenfilter can add subtract or modify tokens

1692749
ant	maven	ant	pom.xml	maven	pom.xml
it was getting so hard to write up a pom.xml that i generated a ant build.xml from one of maven s tasks which is a nice handy task... i had to tweak the build.xml that was generated by maven

1692749
maven	pom.xml
you can use maven archetype plugin to generate pom.xml

1692749
ant	maven
it s a big project that grew up with ant and now is difficult to build entire project solely in maven but that is going to happen in near future

1692758
post	get
this is a decent blog post explaining how to build an app and server and apple has sample code showing how to get the device token here

1692784
getter	setter
another things is probably an interface consisting entirely of getter and setter

1692784
getter	setter
in case of point in particular you might get the temptation to store the data as instead and in this respect the getter and setter might have a meaning but one might also always consider the ease of use vs ease of implementation

1692792
ubuntu	debian
ok here s my solution i ve tested it with debian 5.0 and ubuntu 9.04 so i m not sure if it works with the udev-implementations of other distributions

1692794
width	height
anyhow this method will ensure a complete flexibility regarding height and width of the box and the layout within the box always works the way it should unaffected by the corners

1692797
hide	show
the options seem to be to either redirect to a new view with the success message or have hidden controls on the view and show hide them using values returned in the viewdata

1692799
subtract	add
all that is known is that time_t is arithmetic type but results of arithmetic operations are not specified - you cannot even add subtract reliably

1692846
int	chars
used only with integral data types int short byte chars long

1692864
free	malloc
so you are on your own as far as calling free on anything you ve malloc ed in the mean time

1692864
free	malloc
in the c case you have to do explicit memory management though normally you d free it in the function which malloc d it before calling longjmp as it makes life simpler

1692893
qabstractitemmodel	qabstracttablemodel	qabstractitemmodel	qabstractlistmodel	qabstracttablemodel	qabstractlistmodel
models subclassed from appropriate pyqt base abstract model classes qabstractitemmodel qabstracttablemodel qabstractlistmodel etc.

1692893
qtableview	qtreeview
views which are implemented in qt library and often do not require any modifications examples qtreeview qtableview and others

1692896
folder	dir
you can do so and netbeans will create only a nbproject folder within your project s dir and all should be fine

1692900
int	chars	int	boolean
for primitive types int boolean chars long float .

1692949
width	height
i then use the append and appendto functions to basically provide and i try and determine the height and width but get js exception errors per below

1692949
width	height
popupwindow is shown for the append command but then it is impossible to get width height elements as they arent visible inside ff-dom

1692951
rss	feed
well if you are developing some javascript app you might want to get any rss feed as json to overcome cross-domain querying issue

1693017
vim	emacs
my editor is emacs although i do use vim for quick stuff like editing configuration files

1693052
google-chrome	safari
i doesn t work at all in safari windows and google-chrome windows the h2 stays where it is

1693065
getter	setter
all fields that have getter and setter methods that are named properly

1693101
google-chrome	firefox
also its not only firefox google-chrome doenst show the image also but explorer does..

1693106
put	get
personally i don t get an exception but it very much depends on what you put inside #template

free	malloc
there should be no code changes as it can simply replace the built-in malloc free

1694098
free	malloc
if you write a wrapper using entirely c-based api s only c-compatible structures memory managed by malloc free etc. then you might be able to use pobedim s solution

1694099
cos	sin
plus you should compute the sin and cos values once store them in temporaries and reuse them

1694125
explode	implode
user seperates colors by comma along with quantity so color quantity match when i explode implode them into arrays thus allowing me to manage the quantity whenever something is purchased by their keys after doing an array search for the color

1694388
webclient	webrequest
i read somewhere that webclient is a high-level wrapper for webrequest response

1694388
webclient	httpwebrequest
so far i can t see anything that can be accomplished with httpwebrequest response that can not be accomplished with webclient nor where httpwebrequest response will give you more fine-grained control

1694401
webclient	httpwebrequest
instead in silverlight you ll want to use webclient or httpwebrequest

1694673
post	get

if you have enjoyed this article consider subscribing to our rss feed

1694834
atomic	compare-and-swap
thinking about the trades between lock-based and lock-free concurrency is analogous to the metacircular evaluator problem one can implement locks in terms of atomic operations compare-and-swap or cas and one can implement atomic operations in terms of locks

1695050
google-chrome	firefox
i switch between firefox google-chrome

1695067
children	parent
so if i have a list item and inside of that i have a unordered list with more list items the flash object made in the 1st li which will cover the rest of the sublist items too is too bid so you see space under the children until the next parent li comes up

1695071
int	chars
i would be tempted to read each line of the file as string split it on the . chars and parse the resultant substrings as int to get the month number and the rainfall for that month

1695101
width	height
i m not definig the outer canvas width and height but if i do it does t solve my problem

1695101
actualheight	actualwidth
at runtime i can see that this canvas grid occupies the entire window space so every rectangle inside it has actualwidth s and actualheight s

1695142
post	get
maybe you should be thinking about raw tcp ip or basic http get post

1695152
getter	setter
in your example if you want to define a custom getter setter then just reference the value directly without the self qualifier

1695152
getter	setter
it probably makes sense to use the getter setter or dot notation everywhere else for good encapsulation

1695154
ssms	sqlcmd
i tried the generate scripts tool and thought that was going to make it - the export to my local disk worked but when i went to import using sqlcmd the script was 1gb so ssms errored when i tried to open it there it told me there was a syntax error a few thousand lines in

1695225
children	parent
so i have a treeview and it has about 7 parent nodes that have 3-5 children each

profiler	aqtime
for optimizing it i would run it through a profiler like aqtime from automatedqa with a representative subset of your production data

1695271
getter	setter
by doing so the object and subclasses can customize getter setter behavior as needed

1695271
getter	setter
however there is little difference between property access and invoke the getter setter method

1695327
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
i ve wrestled with this a couple of times and my usual reason for needing some sort of onload event triggering is to be able to interact with the html dom and have getelementbyid getelementsbytagname or various other dom selectors return something other than nothing

1695344
sorting	grouping
grouping and sorting is performed in memory to offload the sql server

pop-up	dialog
i d put them on a list in a separate modal dialog or pop-up if you must let the user scroll through and click the name they want

1695464
for-loop	loops
therefore your logic is almost correct if it were to do nothing in the found case the one thing missing would be to return true systematically after the for-loop since if it didn t exit with a false value within loops then all items of l2 are in l1...

1695478
int	double
just cast one of your variables to double and it will promote the entire expression to be evaluated as floating-point only rounding to int at the end

1695487
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
i tired opera google-chrome ie 8 safari none of them work

1695501
strlen	strncpy
you need to either use strncpy or use strlen to check the lengths of the strings

1695505
superclass	subclassing
notice that if the superclass handles the instance variables a u and x then there is no need to set them in the subclassing you just invoke the correct constructor via super

1695506
strcpy	strcmp
you need to use string functions like strcmp and strcpy to do the string manipulations

1695518
actualheight	actualwidth
actualheight and actualwidth are not set until the control is measured and arranged

1695524
vim	emacs
get familiar with a more powerful text editor be it vim emacs or whatever

1695561
ilist	iqueryable
wraps the iqueryable functionality of an ilist collection but maximises some of linqtosql s deferred execution functions and

1695729
int	chars
i m not sure i d trust system.out to be able to handle non-ascii chars though - you may want to find a different way of examining strings such as printing out the individual values of chars as int preferably in hex and then comparing them with the charts at unicode.org

1695730
int	chars
in c are primitive data types such as int long chars unsigned .

1695739
int	chars
but the compiler needs some primitive or fundamental types such as chars int and so on which are built into the compiler and not defined in header files

1695741

mouseleave	mouseenter
might consider using hover which is essentially mouseenter and mouseleave

1696102
mouseout	mouseleave	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout
the difference is that mouseover and mouseout will fire when you move into a child element of the element to which the event handler is attached whereas mouseenter and mouseleave a.k.a

1696103
mouseout	mouseleave	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout

1697569
post	get
django form models aren t just about rendering forms they re more about processing and sanitizing form get post input which is what you want to do

1697569
post	get
when the post or get data from your ajax request reaches your server it s essentially indistinguishable from form data

1697569
post	get
sure they re called form models because that s usually where get or post data comes from but it doesn t have to be from a form

1697570
dictionary	map
the unsorted dictionary is probably a hash map so lookup is almost o 1 assuming not too many collisions while a lookup in a sorted list is best case o log n

in all other browsers firefox safari opera probably ie8 it works nicely and fits to minimum width

1697906
stdio	fflush
this basic_filebuf contain it s own buffer by inheriting basic_streambuf and actually contain a __basic_file itself containing an underlying plain c stdio abstraction file or std __c_file in which it fflush the buffer

1697918
put	get
might be an issue with the way you structured your productsummarycontrol because even if you don t put binding the datacontext will get automatically inherited to the control

1697928
ocaml	sml
also not really what you re looking for at the moment but if you want a good ml book it s actually a dialect of ocaml but old enough to not be that different from sml then look at cousineau + mauny

1698206
subtraction	addition
if you are going to implement the swap of two characters without a temporary variable which is a neat trick but not something that you should actually use in practice it would be prudent to either use the bitwise exclusive or instead of addition subtraction or use unsigned char instead of char because overflow in signed arithmetic is undefined in the c99 standard and guess what gcc started to make use of this undefinedness for optimization purposes

1698213
google-chrome	firefox
i tried the following code in firefox 3 google-chrome and ie 8 and in all cases nothing reflowed

unfortunately at the moment there is no ie support and to get the other browsers that support it to be happy you have to use both wav and ogg or mp3

the more effort you put in asking a question the more you will encourage others to post more code

1700904
accessor	properties
an easy way to make sure this happens is to declare soapresults as a properties and synthesize accessor for it

1700919
opensuse	linux
i am using linux specifically 64bit opensuse 11.1 so it would be best if i could create it in that environment

1700919
ssl	https
any help would be appreciated on the differences between an apache https ssl cert and an object-signing cert or a how-to or faq or something on the steps to take using openssl or some other similar utility

1700932
hide	show
basically 2 buttons operating like tabs to show hide stuff

1700963
ready	each
another approach is to always have a blank record in each pane ready for the user to fill out eliminating the need for the add record menu item

1700963
hide	show
however it would help if you provided easy ways for users to resize and hide show each pane

1700979
slideup	slidedown
you could use slidetoggle instead of checking for visibility and then using slidedown or slideup

1701055
int	chars
when i convert an unsigned 8-bit int to string then i know the result will always be at most 3 chars for 255 and for an signed 8-bit int we need 4 chars for -128

1701055
decimal	ieee
assume a regular c c++ double ieee 754 and normal decimal expansion no e printf-formatting

1701074
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i m building an iphone app that uses table views contained within uiviewcontroller pushed onto a uinavigationcontroller very similar to the contacts app

1701079
floating-point	fractions
decimal fractions don t have exact floating-point representations

1701186
mvp	presenter
i m currently trying out some mvp patterns sample and i have been told not create concrete presenter objects in the view

1701189
pivot-table	crosstab
the keyword here is pivot-table crosstab but a pivot-table lies also in that direction and no mysql cannot do this directly

1701239
post	get
to answer the actual question from the title of your post assuming you re still wondering to get environment variables simple import os and the environment is available in os.environ

1701286
atomic	interlocked
interlocked uses atomic assembly instructions for compareexchange cmpxchg increment inc etc

1701340
width	height
one of the page-related options in the cms is background image and stretch page width height to background image width height. so that with large background images the whole thing becomes visible

1701370
put	get
what you probably want to do is to put a comma separated string like bak log dfd in the settings then you can split it to get it as an array

1701426
rtp	rtsp	udp	rtp
for data streaming my plan is to use rtp rtsp transport over udp for desktop data the internal protocol will be vnc rfb but the transport will be rtp itself

1701426
rtp	rtsp
i have seen jmf java media foundation which seems to have support for rtp rtsp audio and video capture display but this package look very outdated

1701429
put	get
however when i scroll down the page and put the element outside of the viewport and then back in i get a broken image

1701431
superclass	subclassing
the superclass only has the methods every subclassing needs

1701436
put	get
i don t know the answer to the question yet but to get past it i took the redirectmode attribute out of my web config and put custom logic in the global.asax application_error handler to do what i wanted

1701438
aptana	radrails
but aptana has a quite good support of rails development with the radrails plugin

1701470
superclass	subclassing
alternately you can use a superclass and extend it using a subclassing that only extends the functions that subclassing needs

1701484
rss	feed
feel free to modify this very basic rss class that i wrote a long while ago to create a very simple rss feed

1701534
pow	math.h
generally math.h or a vendor-specific file included by math.h provides the prototype for pow its declaration but the implementation is buried in some library file such as libm.a

1701543
google-chrome	firefox
my primary target is ie8 but would like to support firefox and google-chrome also

1701551
pull	push
these statements pull the bytes out of the array and push them back into the value

1701574
google-chrome	firefox
no not in firefox and google-chrome

1701575
textmate	aptana
i d say it s probably better than aptana or netbeans but i use textmate fulltime and haven t revisited it in a while

1701591
width	height
the following creates a 9 page pdf without having to calculate height and width

1701637
hex	binary
i had to use another object and convert the string values into hex values in order to write binary values into the registry field as below

1701676
children	parent
i have an bll that does validation on user input then inserts a parent poreo and then inserts children porboxeo

1701739
emacs	textmate
i ve been trying to use textmate as a replacement for emacs

1701756
width	height
if device s screen is not square its width and height should change

1701760
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
in general i d suggest developing in ie and one of the standards-compliant browsers side-by-side firefox google-chrome safari opera

1701779
spaces	delimiter
problem is when calling sqlcmd i m assuming that s what sqlcmd resolves to from a command window the values for any and all -v parameters are spaces delimiter -- that is the parser hits -v reads the next characters through the as the variable name then reads all characters after the and through the next spaces or end of line as the value to assign to the variable and that embedded spaces will mess you up bigtime

1701837
hide	show
so as my moon example stated you either render everything out to start and show hide it with javascript

1701881
required	placeholder
each haml page or partial can then add their own required files to those placeholder

1701887
google-chrome	firefox
i think it s related to this bug about firefox textareas and its font mozilla 3.0.8 and google-chrome height in em bug workaround

1701958
post	get
all it does is read data either from an environment variable for get requests or from stdin for post requests

1701997
jar	war
however you should make a standard jar war other with ant for your project and include ivy dependencies inside that jar

1702003
dotnetzip	sharpziplib
i ve tested with sharpziplib and dotnetzip to the compressed byte array

1702015
gridview	repeater
your original code doesn t work not because it s incorrect but because you probably have more places with trcomment in which case it should error or because your current code is inside a template of some sort in a gridview a repeater

1702064
aptana	rubymine
notepad++ doesn t have great autocompletion rubymine is too slow and not that great and netbeans aptana are too heavy

1702083
jython	pypy
for example app engine is still using python 2.5 apparently upgrading its specialized sandboxed python runtime and all it relies on is not a zero-effort proposition so they prefer to keep putting their energy towards adding engine features instead -- so i believe are implementations such as jython and pypy i think ironpython s in the process of migrating to 2.6 but the current production version is still 2.5

1702094
put	get
once i put something on both text boxes and press search i get a result list gridview from a ms sqlexpress 2008 database

1702131
updatepanel	scriptmanager
the button1 is inside an updatepanel and the scriptmanager is on the usercontrol

1702144
gridview	rowdatabound
my suggestion would be to add a handler to the rowdatabound event of the gridview control and change what the column displays based on the toggle value

1702180
getter	setter
c# 3.0 offers us getter and setter with compiler generated backing fields - this is really great but there are plenty of times that you still need to use a backing field

1702193
children	parent
if your parent object has 100 children you would run 101 queries which is not good

1702193
children	parent
one way to try to optimize this is to join everything using an outer join clause in the sql that way both the parent and children objects are loaded at once in a single query

1702193
children	parent
thatâ s what a join does the parent rows are repeated for each children

1702389
inherited	properties
if it s impossible to have the different classes all inherited the same interface you can get all the properties defined in an object as a collection and then their value through key lookup where the key is the name of the properties

1702399
google-chrome	firefox
this works correctly in ie8 firefox google-chrome

1702418
aptana	rubymine
works everywhere and linux rubymine aptana vi emacs netbeans

1702421
inherited	properties
you should introduce a new interace containing the common properties and let the other two interfaces inherited from your new base interface

1702426
ssl	https
i ve read that networkcredential doesn t support ssl and i m hitting an https site

1702511
jar	manifest.mf
netbeans automatically creates a manifest.mf file inside the application jar and also creates a folder called lib which includes all dependencies

1702522
width	height
the nwidth and nheight parameters must specify a width and height that are supported by the current display driver because the system cannot create cursors of other sizes

1702522
width	height
to determine the width and height supported by the display driver use the getsystemmetrics function specifying the sm_cxcursor or sm_cycursor value

1702617
udp	tcp
since the designers of boost took this into account for tcp sockets i have a hard time imagining they wouldn t do the same for udp sockets

1702630
jsf	seam
for almost a year know i developped applications in ejb3 jpa for persistence and business and seam jsf for presentation

1702630
jsf	seam
i don t need the list of possible options for gui or data access or business layers but the easiest ones when you know ejb3 jpa seam jsf etc

1702646
mouse	keyboard
i know about the getlastinputinfo method but that would only give me the duration since last user input - keyboard or mouse

1702666
jboss	weblogic
ejb is just supported by heavy application servers like jboss or weblogic the only thing that comes to my mind is to use spring hibernate without ejb and have an embedded servlet container like jetty or tomcat

1702666
jsf	seam
this way for the view you d use jsf seam

1702668
swt	swing
with you java knowledge you have three choices swing swt or javafx

1702680
hide	show
in your css try setting the div s overflow property to either auto show scrolls bars or hidden to just hide the content if it goes outside s the div

1702721
qabstractitemview	qabstractitemmodel	qtableview	qabstractitemmodel	qtableview	qabstractitemview
one way is using qt model view classes with base at qabstractitemmodel but they need that you widget inherits qabstractitemview this is widgets like qtableview etc.

1702742
integer	unsigned
in this case we know that it s between 0 and m-1 because we re starting with an unsigned integer

1702754
serializable	deserialization
one possible solution assumes chosen deserialization method allows private field serializable

1702832
postgresql	mysql
bonus points if you can tell me how to do this in postgresql or mysql

1702833
min	max
in addition i noticed that you also have a possible exceptional scenario for your full constructor when the min value is greater than the max value

1702855
min	max
i don t think you need orderby in the inner query at all - use max or min

1702860
hide	show
toggle actually calls hide show so in onready call show on the desired ul

1702869
profiling	debugging
it also works well against remote application servers you need to enable profiling agents and turn on remote debugging in the jvm but it lets you run profiling against pretty much any j2ee environment

1702877
decltype	auto
c++0x is going to introduce a type inference using the decltype and auto keywords

1702885
min	max
i would also extract the default min and max into a constant probably so that the test would look like assert.areequal defaultminimum mynumber.minvalue

1702885
min	max
i would have a test checking that an invalid min max throws an exception

1702894
jar	manifest.mf
or if it is a jar file then you need to specify it in the class-path entry of its manifest.mf file

1702897
accessor	properties
you can use regular properties mark them with the datamember attribute and make the set accessor private

1702928
letter-spacing	font-size
you can set the font-size letter-spacing etc

1702976
submit	submission
common causes for this are the html form fields not being contained within the form element or the submit button having a nonstandard javascript function fire instead of submission proper

1703025
post	get
by the way you are sending the parameter padid via get and post

1703128
queue	fifo
queue are typically fifo while stacks are lifo

1703141
put	get
if i leave them off i get sqlexception invalid column type but if i put around the variable i get a warning from groovy

1703153
client-side	server-side
i suggest you use a customfieldvalidator and write your own javascript validation or make use of a server-side validation scheme which should probably be done anyway as i find it to be a bit more reliable than the client-side stuff that gets automatically generated

1703158
min	max
then perform the processing for min max and average later on

1703166
min	max
print out min max sum lines.count .tostring 000.00

1703240
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this one doesn t work in ie and opera but seems to work for firefox safari and google-chrome

1703269
google-chrome	safari
in safari google-chrome

1703285
width	height
the object has a width and height of w h

1703294
rss	feed
i am developing a rss reader which uses a nsmutablearray _stories to store the contents of the rss feed

1703294
rss	feed
if the user wants to load more posts from the rss feed i am starting another parse operation passing the _stories array as a reference to the parser which appends other posts to the array

1703294
uitableview	reloaddata
by the end of the parsing the uitableviewcontroller method reloaddata is called and then the uitableview is updated

1703307
postgresql	mysql
they have two products support fb which are ibdac which is direct access components to ib fb and unidac which is universal direct access components and has support for ib fb beside other many like oracle sql server mysql postgresql and odbc links too

1703313
swt	swing
swing or swt aren t bad options

1703411
post	put
stack overflow only let s me post 1 hyperlink initially so i ll put the css in a comment

1703424
public	protected
the same argument for can be made for using protected properties as can be made for using public properties instead of exposing member variables directly

1703424
getter	setter
if this just leads to a proliferation of simple getter and setter then i think the damage to code readablity outweighs the benefit of being able to change the code in the future

1703427
int	chars
if the machine is little endian and you need big endian int floats you just swap the relevant chars

1703472
maven	m2e
maven and the m2e plugin handle the building side of things great

1703540
superclass	subclassing
it is the contract of subclassing that when a superclass calls a method on itself if that method has been overridden it will be the subclassing method to be invoked

1703543
post	get
i ve read get file icon used by shell and the other similar post - and already use shfileinfo to get the associated icon for any given extension and that works great

1703577
uiview	uiwindow	uiview	subviews
every uiview and this the uiwindow has a property subviews which is an nsarray containing all the subviews

1703582
dreamweaver	aptana
although i regularly look around for dreamweaver replacements and i ve certainly been impressed by aptana i still tend to use dreamweaver in my development stack simply because whereas i can compensate for some of the more coding-orientated features it misses i find the wysiwyg nature of the editor invaluable

1703587
put	get
spreadsheetgear for .net will let you load an excel workbook put values in cells calculate get results as raw values or formatted text and more

1703598
width	height
put the scrollable portion of my content in a separate 100 width height div with overflow scroll

1703638
icomparer	iqueryable
i am trying to call orderby using a custom icomparer on a subsonic iqueryable like so

1703671
expander	grid
the xaml code below works fine except i want the expander button to be between the listbox and the grid

1703730
post	get
you d then get a post array you could reference like this like this

1703759
int	boolean
update this is even stranger when you use large int values 255 as only the byte that is used for the boolean is being modified to a 1 thus changing 0x0f00 to 0x0f01 for the b.bvalue2

1703789
width	height
i m accepting any file that getimagesize accepts meaning it has a width height i m just checking that it doesn t return false although my real scope would be jpg|jpeg|png|gif|bmp|tif|tiff

1703837
ubuntu	linux
in ubuntu linux i give the command

1703865
post	get
i ve noticed that if you make the post all call too often more than once every few minutes you ll get throttled

1703865
post	get
if you don t need to get all of your post you should try using the v1 post recent call with whatever options you may want

1703880
maven	pom.xml
i d love to have a command line tool that can implement the i need this as a dependency go get it functionality of maven possibly even using the pom.xml files of various packages

1703959
children	parent
when i drop a toolstripcontainer on a mdi parent and assing fill to a property dock it hide all the mdi children

1703978
union	distinct
if you can use all the tables in one query you can use a union to get the distinct rows

1703985
lisp	scheme
in a sense any real-world development in lisp or scheme can be considered language-oriented since you are developing the language of your application and its abstract tree as you code along

1704001
post	put
now if i missed some language please post and remember to put the link

1704015
hash	md5
you may wish to consider using another build system such as scons which does not rely solely on the timestamp but actually computes the md5 hash of source files and bases its decisions on the hash

1704068
vim	emacs
i m sure there are scripts for both vim and emacs

1704117
clang	llvm
that probably also the reason why the developers of llvm also came up with clang and started from ground-up

1704168
width	height
layout is triggered by css properties such as width or height

1704168
width	height
if you remove the width and height from the center div you ll see that it no longer contains the float because it no longer has layout

1704168
width	height
in any case this is what the html would end up looking like with the width and height removed from the center class

1704175
put	get
try creating a new connection in each thread or create a pool of connections that the threads can use keep them in a queue each thread get s a connection and put s it pack when it s done

1704178
int	boolean
this makes sure the boolean are marshaled as an int 4 bytes in .net

1704186
nsmenu	nsstatusitem
the nsstatusitem is using an nsmenu not a custom view

1704222
public	protected
in addition to the other answers mentioned here public protected members that begin with an underscore are not cls-compliant in that there is no requirement for .net languages to support members with leading underscores so someone inheriting from your class in a different .net language may not be able to access that particular protected member

1704226
getter	setter
i think if you want to save data to your actual model you might have to implement the getter setter method in your model.

1704239
fgets	strtok
i would probably use fgets to read in the string first followed by the use of strtok to read the first token the command

1704254
hex	binary
it could be that somebody sat down with a pen and paper and worked out the binary codes corresponding to the program that they wanted to write and then typed that stuff out in a hex editor

1704255
hide	show
then you can set the current page of the stacked widget based on whatever logic you want to use such as clicking a button and it will hide everything from the previous page and show the new current page

1704259
cvs	svn
cvs and svn identifiers are scattered throughout the binary image

1704277
min	max
min max count stdev variance avg

1704324
chi-squared	multinomial
i m looking for distribution functions normal binomial chi-squared logit and regression linear non-linear multinomial and if possible predictors arima

1704379
pcm	music
you have access to the music library database and can launch a music player to play a certain song but under the sdk you have neither access to the song files themselves nor to the actual pcm data of the music

1704386
int	chars
given a 64-bit int you can calculate that you won t need any more than 11 digits in the result so using a static 12 chars buffer will certainly help improve your speed

1704406
mp3	wav	mp3	ogg	wav	ogg
what is a sound library i can use to easily manipulate sound files mp3 ogg wav etc

1704435
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

mkdir	chdir	rmdir	mkdir	rmdir	chdir
at offset b1b0 is p.u.s.h.d followed by mkdir rmdir chdir md rd and cd

1704533
google-chrome	firefox
i m targeting ie8 but would like to be compatible with firefox google-chrome also

1704556
strcpy	strtok
note that since s0 points to a string literal it should not be used as an argument to any function that would try to modify it strtok strcat strcpy etc.

1704562
postgresql	mysql
however i don t know whether databases in my case mysql maybe postgresql would be better at handling compressing option a in contrast to option b

1704611
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox google-chrome you could link to

1704626
hide	show
what you really want to do is give your rows different classes depending on which set they belong to and then show hide based on the class

1704678
id3v2	id3-tag
in this case you can use the id3-tag s magic number id3v1 tags are stored in the last 128 bytes of the file starting with the bytes tag hexadecimal 544147 while id3v2 tags are stored at the beginning of the file so the first 3 bytes of the file are id3 hexadecimal 494433

1704775
pop-up	dialog
when a dialog box pop-up there is a x in the top right hand corner

1704807
persistent	transient
if you want to specify a field or property of an entity that is not persistent you need to mark it with transient but this is not what you want here

1704823
width	height
it creates a width x height x 9 matrix filled with zeros

1704844
post	get
additionally if you absolutely have to validate this you might send the intended user with each post get request in addition to the cookie then validate that the cookie matches that user

1704899
subtract	add
when clicked they would add or subtract from an integer which would then be displayed on a tlabel

1704920
ssl	https
as far as i understand https is http plus ssl tls

1704933
jhtmlarea	jwysiwyg
i am not able to get my jwysiwyg and jhtmlarea text editors to work within an ajax loaded jquery ui tab

1704940
iprincipal	iidentity
so in subsequent requests we can correctly set the iprincipal and iidentity based on the user object in session

1704952
ssl	https
to be completely clear - https is http on top of tls ssl

1705070
onclick	onmouseup
instead of using the onclick event use the onmouseup event

1705072
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
i also tried to call this from a silverlight client and i was getting a security exception this is where i found out about clientaccesspolicy.xml and crossdomain.xml i added clientaccesspolicy.xml to the service and the silverlight client works great so i decided to try crossdomain.xml and nothing the applet still does not work

1705092
hide	show
since you are using a navigation controller though you will want to hide the toolbar you get by default by unchecking the show toolbar box in your mainwindow.xib when the uinavigationcontroller is selected attributes tab in the ib inspector

1705146
client-side	server-side
verify client-side and server-side everything

you are talking about post though you cannot do a post the above line does a get

1705270
affinity	processors
at times i want to set the processors affinity on some these processes

1705334
pop-up	dialog
in the dialog that pop-up uncheck the box labeled contact all update sites during install to find required software

1705336
children	parent
i have a legacy db which uses a guid to map children to the parent entity

1705336
children	parent	dictionary	map
the parent would then map each child.id to child in the children dictionary

1705336
idictionary	ilist
to simplify my problem i started by trying bag semantics replacing the parent s idictionary with an ilist

1705354
inherited	properties
the datacontext set at this level then is inherited by any element in the window unless you explicitly change it for a child element so after setting the datacontext for the window you should be able to just do straight binding to codebehind properties from any control on the window

1705355
portrait	landscape
in certain places such as mail.app the top navigation bar is thinner in landscape mode than in portrait mode

1705367
junit	testng
third i d recommend using junit 4.4 or better yet the testng idiom - annotations

1705426
fadein	fadeout
can you try to remove the fadeout and only have the fadein

1705449
children	parent
i m trying to pass data from my parent process to all children

1705468
for-loop	arrays
if the alignment information of the arrays that can be vectorized is unknown gcc invokes a pass for-loop versioning

1705485
post	put
i would log to isolated storage and provide a way for users to submit the log back to the server using either a simple put post with httpwebrequest or if you re feeling frisky via a wcf service

1705492
post	get
the first method performs a post the second performs a get

1705507
toolbar	docking
i ll just add to it by saying that if you re past the basic level and you want an example of how to use mvvm in a real-world app that has menus toolbar options dialogs docking tools windows etc. take a look at soapbox core and this demo using soapbox core

1705567
children	parent	inherited	properties
you can define a base form with your processcmdkey handler implemented and then make all your other forms the mdi parent the child windows of the mdi parent and any independent forms you create not children of the mdi form inherited from the base form. just make sure the ismdicontainer properties is set on the form you wish to be mdi and the child windows you add to the mdi form are not toplevel and have their parent set to the mdi form

1705599
nswindow	nsstatusitem
i managed to create a custom nsstatusitem which popups up an nswindow but the problem is that the app that currently has focus will the focus to my custom nswindow

the value 0200 is an octal which is 128 in decimal

1705673
width	height
what you re trying to accomplish is a simple full width and height layout aligned to the top left with no scaling

1705673

then you just need to position your display objects using the width and height values you pass in to your swf

1705677
google-chrome	firefox
the following codes works in firefox and google-chrome but ie6 does not render the connect button

1705688

there is difference to get local resources and global resources if you are trying to put your localized resources to global resources then you need to change your code as well to access resources like.

1705904
codeigniter	cakephp
on the other hand there s php frameworks like cakephp codeigniter zend framework or the one you mentioned akelos who just help you doing some tedious tasks in php like templating database access etc

datamapper	activerecord
i searched for that error and saw a lot of rails-related stuff about activerecord and conflicts between competing to_json methods but nothing really about datamapper

1706060
versioning	upgrade
the full idea i hope to try is creating a paver script that controls management of the bundles making it easy for users to upgrade to newer versioning

1706092
disk	ram
for ultimate speed keep the file stored in a ram disk

1706108
firefox	safari
firefox and safari are case-insensitive in this regard

1706108
firefox	safari
however if your processing.js code has even one little syntax error i can t really categorize which kinds but trying to use .equals will do it your routine will probably fail silently in ie8 whereas in safari or firefox your rectangles may lose their outlines stroke will quit working

1706108
firefox	safari
ie on vista and safari on the mac have both exhibited stronger syntax checking than safari or firefox on vista which will blow by certain errors and render a defective graphic

1706108
firefox	safari
5 text invoked using the text function renders in firefox in an unchangeable font of firefox s choosing but as far as i can tell not in ie8 or safari

1706253
memcpy	strcpy	memcpy	memmove	strcpy	memmove
yes you can use strcpy memcpy memmove or std copy to do this

however in some cases manually setting cpu process thread affinity could be beneficial

1706482
processors	hyperthreading
for example say we have 2-socket quadcore processors and the processors supports smt hyperthreading

1706482
processors	hyperthreading
here is a snapshot of task manger in windows 7 with 20 load on core i7 quadcore with hyperthreading 8 logical processors

1706482
cpu	affinity
so there could be good reasons you may need to manually set cpu process thread affinity

1706506
disk	ram
disk io - even ssd - is many orders of magnitude slower than the ram that the hashing is going though

1706506
hash	md5
ensuring low collisions is a design criteria for all hash and all mainstream hash do a good job of it - just use a mainstream hash md5

1706582

1706930
versioning	upgrade
ultimately i would take matt s advice and upgrade to the latest stable versioning anyway

1706938
innodb	myisam
what sort of storage engine is best suited for my website do i use myisam innodb etc

1706938
innodb	myisam
consider resorting to myisam only for a fulltext search and b specific cases where performance under innodb isn t good enough it s fairly rare that this is significant but some types of data can benefit from myisam s profile

1706938
innodb	myisam
however innodb also typically performs better in write-biased access to a large table due to myisam s unfortunate table-level locking

1706976
vim	emacs
i use emacs vim and netbeans

1706980
vim	emacs
small programs like id-utils vi vim and emacs plus the cli tools make the entire system into a sort of hybrid development system

1706989
virtualenv	yolk
i guess virtualenv is stopping python from accessising the windows registry somehow i have tried running easy_install within the virtualenv with no luck i assume this does exactly the same thing copying over the site packages dir from my main python install means that yolk will not see it

vim	emacs	anjuta	kdevelop
many people use editors like emacs or vim and then others use ides like eclipse netbeans anjuta kdevelop etc

the multiplying by 180 over pi is just the scale from radians to degrees as in the question but with the division by a division simplified the +180 makes sure its always positive 0-360 deg rather than -180 to 180 deg

1707261
bash	tcsh
if you are trying to syntax check your first simple bash tcsh script you can use bash -n tcsh -n

1707521
fink	macports
of course macports or fink is always an alternative

1707580
cpu	processors
when you re dealing with a cpu-bound operation using more threads processes than you have processors will almost never 1 improve matters - if the cpu utilization is already at 100 more threads processes won t magically increase its capacity - and will most likely make things worse by adding in more context-switching overhead

1707620
width	height
we cannot define a feature with a width and or height of 0

1707832
put	get
no you get the html code as a string and you have to put the string back after changing it

1707832
put	get
however that would not be efficient if you wanted to apply more than one change which is pretty much the point of chaining methods as it would have to get the html code and put it back for each change

1707832
put	get
when you get the html code as a string you can do whatever you like with it and put it back when you are done with it

1707880
expression-blend	silverlight
silverlight apps are easy to program once you have a c# asp .net background and in addition to visual studio expression-blend makes a great companion to create edit and animate stuff for silverlight

if you know the width of the ul then you can simply set the margin of the ul to 0 auto

1708133
awt	swing
no idea on how to solve the problem with native swing or awt - although java supports gif89a with transparency and animation

versioning	upgrade
also with separate databases you can have minor modifications to one customer without affecting them all either for customized solutions or different versioning if one doesn t want to upgrade etc

1708141

should i have a local master repo for local push pull and a local integration repo for remote push pull

1708202
setinterval	settimeout
the only difference between that and setinterval is that setinterval repeats and settimeout does not

1708243

if you could add two more symbols so that it is converting to base-64 your modulo and division operations would turn into a bit mask and shift

1708546
vb.net	vb6
i have an application i am converting over from vb6 to vb.net 2.0 3.5

1708552

1708611
put	get
the problem comes when i put in a less than 5 digit number and i get random behaviour

1708623

1708658
selecteditem	selectedindex
i see you are using the close event and setting a variable called selecteditem to the selectedindex property of the combobox

1708670
width	height
one of the values left or right should suffice for the position then you just have to set width and height

1708677

you can use javascript to get height and width and send those values as startup params to silverlight application

1708876
updatepanel	calendarextender
when the calendarextender is outside an updatepanel it works perfectly on ie8 however when inside it it doesn t show

1708976
awt	swing
first of all the image support in swing is based on awt so doing it with swing does not make much sense

1709046
versioning	upgrade
oh i m using 3.5.2 and don t tell me to upgrade because i can t because of the versioning of jasper server

1709051
openmap	geotools
i looked quickly at geotools but it seemed like getting started at least a year or two ago was more complex than what we had already accomplished with openmap

1709051
worldwind	openmap
openmap requires little in horsepower versus worldwind which needs pretty decent video card

1709079

1709130
int	chars
it s used a little differently than most chars pointers because the algorithm starts at the end of the buffer and moves toward the start that s because we produce the digits from the end of the int

1709137
int	double
but i am stuck going forward because pantheios requires inserters an api to convert fundamental types to string to handle for example int double float pointer etc

since you are programmatically submission the form there is no explicit user action on an individual submit button so nothing is sent

1709358
inherited	subclassing
subclassing activerecord base and have every model inherited from your subclassing achieves the same as 1 but every model in your app needs to extend an unconventional class so why go through the trouble

1709367
client-side	server-side
client-side code is not compiled and not compressed with iis default settings - pointless whitespace in client-side script is like adding pointless thread.sleep calls in server-side code

1709368

i ve populated a treeview control with a multi levelled multinoded tree think organisational chart or file folder dialog and i want to use drag and drop to move nodes within the tree

1709613
post	get
this post help me get my settings straight when using mysql with django

1709625
maven	pom.xml
if not i guess i just have to look through the pom.xml for each new maven project to figure this out

1709664
post	get
it at least sounds like that it fired for example a plain get request instead of a post request to the server and or that the server ignored the particular request because it didn t recognize the url pattern and or the request parameters

1709681
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
it has width height padding margin and border properties

1709698
imperative	declarative
while at a first impression this seems like a bug to the imperative c like programming mind set it is the right thing to do for declarative set oriented world of sql

1709705
postgresql	mysql
i had to migrate from a mysql based ruby on rails app to using postgresql

1709938
lisp	prolog	lisp	smalltalk
using a language which has very few concepts that integrate cleanly smalltalk lisp prolog ruby rather than languages which are made up of every syntax hack in the world - making it impossible for mortals to understand the semantics of code like c++ and perl

1709945
min	max
my strategy is to look at all the points in my set determine the min and max and then calculate a number between 0 to 1 accordingly and use stretch fill to stretch each polyline to fill the grid cell

1709945
min	max
my desired effect would be that a point at 0 .5 would be vertically in the center of the cell but in reality the polyline gets stretched vertically to fill the entire cell depending on what the min and max y value is

1709945
min	max
if .5 is my max and .7 is my min in the polyline then .5 will be clear at the top of the cell and .7 clear at the bottom rather than .5 in the center and .7 7 10 to the bottom

1709945
width	height
the reason i m using 0 to 1 values is because i want the width and height of the grid cell to be easily changeable via a slider or something to adjust the height of the graph or dragging the window wider to adjust the width

1709955
firefox	safari
it works as intended in safari firefox etc

1710024

ubuntu	linux
this is python 2.6.4 r264 75706 on linux ubuntu 9.10

1710082
post	get
a nice way to enable real-time updates to state of the app is by using comet which is essentially a geeky codename for keeping an alive long standing unterminated get post request to the server that server finishes and responds to when something happens on the server

1710127
versioning	upgrade
then when you want to upgrade to use django 1.1 you simply change the versioning number in your requirements file and re-run the setup

1710140
cpython	ironpython
in cpython they happen to be very reliable and predictable as long as cycles aren t involved ie when deletion is handled by reference counting but in other implementations jython and i believe also ironpython deletion happens when the garbage collector gets around to it which could be much later

1710157
spaces	delimiter
if you have spaces in your city name you either need to use delimiter or define the city name field to be fixed length

1710220

1710327
post	get
in general what should i do if get post parameters that should be there are instead mysteriously missing

1710350
width	height
if your window can be re-sized absolute layout is not recommended - it may be a good idea to use width 100 and height 100 and then use the minheight minwidth maxwidth etc

1710350
width	height
in your case you could set the minimum width height of the spacer between 2 components so that the page scales proportionately

1710357
children	parent
the key to this algorithm working is that the children are placed under their parent - wherever they are - in one pass

1710359
firefox	safari
the images are showing up in safari and firefox but not ie6

1710416
cvs	svn
alternatively you can use cvs which deals with branches in a far superior way than svn does

fast-forward	merge
however when pull -ing git will only merge other-branch if it can perform a fast-forward merge

1710474
fast-forward	merge
a fast-forward merge is a merge in which the head of the branch you are trying to merge into is a direct descendent of the head of the branch you want to merge

1710474
fast-forward	merge
for example if you have this history tree then merging other-branch would result in a fast-forward merge

1710474
fast-forward	merge
however this would not be a fast-forward merge

1710483
folder	directory
put static files in the public folder within the app s directory

1710504
junit	unitils
using a tool like unitils to glue together hibernate dbunit and junit has worked exceedingly well for me

1710543
ssl	https
it has great ssl https packet analysis and will be a tremendous help debugging and finding the problem

1710574
try-catch	exception-handling
the unhandledexception event does not capture the exception-handling in the traditional sense like a try-catch block to the best of my knowledge it is merely an information point allowing you to perform logging and such tasks

1710652
codeigniter	kohana
but if codeigniter has a bit too much bloat for you maybe you can try kohana which is a bit less bloated than codeigniter started as a fork

1710657
rar	zip
also i wanted to know if there are any unrar libraries for air or someway to read rar archives with air kind of like how you can with fzip and zip files

1710718
rss	feed
i am looking for an open source component that can help me track a large number of rss feed 10k rss sources

1710718
rss	feed
i don t care about the programming language but it should be something with a simple api where i can add or remove rss feed and asynchronously receive notifications every time an rss is updated

1710734
spaces	delimiter
it is ok for throwaway code but that data looks suspiciously like comma separated values and the third field may even be spaces delimiter chunks of data

1710734
spaces	delimiter
and if those spaces delimiter chunks might get longer then this

1710769
post	get
you may want to get a list of comments within the context of a given user that user s commenting history for a given post all the comments on that post or maybe just all of the comments period though this is not terribly likely

1710850
udp	tcp
maybe in some cases you would prefer to connect and send udp datagrams maybe in other situatinos where performance was less of a factor you would send using tcp ip

1710856
multiplying	add
the operations are simple things add two numbers multiplying two numbers etc.

1710892
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
safari google-chrome and firefox support at least 80 000

1710919
folder	directory
this will recursively exclude all .svn directory from the various source folder

1710943
post	get
you ll need to post a code example to get more specific help if you still need it

1710959
stdout	stderr
you can use system.setout and system.seterr to redirect stdout and stderr to instances of printstream

1710977
hebrew	thai
it works for russian german but not for chinese hebrew thai

1710990
aggregate-functions	sum
for aggregate-functions sum stdev etc.. you have to pull all data into application layer and calculate or maintain aggregate entities which update on each data insert update

1710994
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in ie and google-chrome but in firefox the element remains disabled

1711047
int	chars
sbyte byte short ushort int uint long ulong chars string

1711047
dictionary	map
note that string is handled via a dictionary map to an integer

1711106
onmousedown	onmousemove
the one clever thing we do if i may say so myself is to pre-populate two sparse arrays with snapping coordinates onmousedown so that they are easy fast cheap to look up onmousemove

1711169
versioning	upgrade
for example if your server is upgrade from versioning 1.4 to 1.5 or to 1.6 it s interesting to make a dump then a load of your repositories to take full advantage of the improvements

1711179
getter	setter
a class properties are derived from the private and public getter setter methods

1711204
ienumerable	iqueryable
but you re working with iqueryable not ienumerable

1711224
uiview	subviews
personally i wouldn t use a uiscrollview - i would just subclass uiview and deal with dragging myself positioning the uiview subviews as the touch moved events occur

1711225
haskell	ocaml
i m not sure if that s true for scala but coming from ocaml haskell it seems right.

1711229
getter	setter
for example eclipse will allow you to generate the getter setter methods of your choice for your class

1711243
int	boolean
a given value of enum int boolean or string type can only be one value so it makes sense to switch on such a value

1711249
free	malloc
at least they overload malloc free to track leaks so it seems as usable point to add anything you want

1711289
screens	tablet
it turns out that on tablet pcs you have to turn off hardware acceleration for flash to go full screens

1711300
capitalize	capitalization
capitalization will be based on how you capitalize your directory name control name - but in either case should highlight appropriately

1711301
rar	zip
sharpziplib might help i m not sure if they support rar but you can compress the files in other formats i.e zip

1711307
put	get
but if you still want to avoid frames and put the contents into a div with the id externalconent you could request the stylesheets the same way you get the other contents and prefix every rule in them with #externalcontent

1711328
public	protected
regarding public or protected - in general it is more question of how you intend to control access to destructor

1711350
jquery	curvycorners	width	height
i am using the jquery curvycorners plugin i can get this working on a div tag but as most of the content is empty and the width height is 90 of the page the corners are only rounded at the top

1711353
interbase	firebird
because we re using a few different systems in a variery of versions interbase versions 4 and above firebird mysql my orm wrapper class not sure what to call it is bound to grow big

1711369
windows	wow64
to launch a system32 located 64bit app from a 32bit app at least on vista 2k8 7 doesn t work on x64 xp or 2k3 run it from the sysnative directory c windows sysnative telnet.exe alternatively disable wow64 but that is generally a bad idea

1711392
post	put
http put and delete for example should always be idempotent but http post may or may not be

1711455
getter	setter
the html 5 audio element appears to have a volume getter setter on it so you could do something like this in jquery

1711455
firefox	safari
this seems to work in safari 4 though i couldn t get it to play with firefox 3.5

1711466
ffmpeg	libavformat
you can always do it yourself in c or c++ with libavformat and libavcodec ffmpeg libraries if you re looking for a project but you will have to get your hands very dirty with compositing the video yourself

1711490
int	boolean
so far i ve been returning either nothing an int or a boolean to java via the jni interface

1711532
firefox	safari
however when testing on safari and firefox the service always returns -1

1711536
serializable	deserialization
also there was framework which allowed serializable deserialization of these containers using higher layer abstractions

1711589
pull	push
then you copy your work into it and hg push and hg pull to sync between the google repository

1711590
jstl	taglib
you just use jsp servlet further the usual way the jsp as being a view template technology can just be used to write the necessary html css js in and the output can be dynamically controlled with help of taglib such as jstl and el

1711595
xsd.exe	svcutil.exe
use the wcf svcutil.exe utility with the dconly switch instead of xsd.exe - this will attempt to create a class based on the wcf datacontractserializer which can handle a few things better than the standard .net xml serializer

1711605
apache	nginx
compared to other cms it sucks plenty of processing power and ram from your server and - unless you are going to have a very small site - i recommend to deploy it in conjunction with nginx rather than apache

1711605
wordpress	joomla
if your site is contrarily a small-scale one with standard functionality plus a few custom bits maybe wordpress joomla could fit your needs better not because they are less powerful but because drupal strengths would be unused in this case while wordpress joomla simpler architecture would probably represent an advantage in this scenario

1711607
chown	sudo
i hate to accept my own answer after kyle gave such a good response but i don t need the pythonpath fix to make it work now that i did sudo chown -r +r opt google_appengine google_appengine_1.2.7

1711622
pull	push
for #3 to update you local copy hg pull -u and to commit your change hg commit followed by hg push

1711632
width	height
the div content is empty but has a height and width vaule...this causes problems in ie as only the top of the div tag is cornerd the table isnt at all

1711658
internationalization	translation
translation system - this is pretty complex simply because internationalization is fricking hard to do

1711658
postgresql	mysql
database restrictions - as of drupal 6 database support is mysql or postgresql only using a drupal specific abstraction layer which obviously isn t one

1711699
strdup	strtok	strtok	getline	atoi	strtok	atoi	getline	atoi	strdup
getline strtok strdup atoi

1711725
mouseover	mouseout
my problem is that the mouseover and mouseout functions are being called inconsistently when a user moves the mouse quickly through the list over the child elements

1711725
mouseover	mouseout
here are the mouseover and mouseout functions

1711729
multiplying	add
i think your best bet is to use rand to generate a random float between 0 and 1 and then multiplying to set the range and add to set the offset

1711734
width	height
does anyone know how to get the width and height in actionscript for a flex application running inside the flash player in the web browser

1711779
post	get
if that doesn t get you what you want need post an example of your input and your php code that s not working

1711785
oncreate	onnewintent
i did both of these things and onnewintent never fires and oncreate fires every time

1711811
uiview	calayer
the reason this is so is because uiview assumes that if a calayer s delegate is a uiview then that calayer belongs to the uiview and the uiview is part of the hierarchy

1711811
uiview	calayer
however if you create your own calayer and assign the delegate to be the uiview the uiview will end up calling itself as part of the recursion

1711917
inherited	base-class
in our homegrown mvp-framework we had a typed base-class that all pages inherited from

1711932
put	get
but if i take acts_as_taggable and put it into a module that class a includes i get an error

1711956
mp3	wav
i am working on an application that requires the ability of saving the text as mp3 and wav file

1711963
many-to-many	one-to-many
having the association table mapped though will mean that you have to create a one-to-many property from formula to the association table formulaingredient and then you have the option to include also or not it is up to you the many-to-many property to the ingredients table

1711983
rss	feed
iphone web app from dashcode rss feed template works when deployed on simulator but not on an iphone

1711983
rss	feed
if i run the simulator and enter that address it fetches the rss feed and displays it

1711983
rss	feed
no rss feed

1711983
rss	feed
the rss feed is

1712017
children	parent
i m just having trouble with inserting into the array...and having the children branch off from the root or parent

1712126
getter	setter
there is no getter setter for arbitrary properties in javascript

1712126
getter	setter
in firefox you can use javascript 1.5+ s getter and setter to define x and y properties that square their values on assignment eg.

1712159
implements	extends
then your real class simply extends your mystream class implements the two or three remaining methods that you really need

1712175
hide	show
if you want to show hide the validation marks maybe you can have them all declared in the html next to you text boxes like this

1712175
hide	show
and show them or hide them with this jquery code

1712246
mp3	wav
i don t think there is built-in support in .net for converting to mp3 but this should be straightforward with the help of a 3rd party library utility like lame once you have the audio data as wav

1712250
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
google wave did this and came up with a great product that works cross browser firefox google-chrome safari opera

1712308
post	get
however usually things get out of order in the application on the receive side if you post multiple buffers to the socket with wsarecv or socket.beginreceive or networkstream.beginread it is very easy to find yourself processing them out of order

1712347
stdout	stderr
i want to do a popen python s subprocess.communicate from haskell - start a program give it stdin and get its stdout stderr

1712352
children	parent
mdi children are listed in z-sorted order in the mdi parent form s mdichildren property

1712366
gif	png
i was wondering how can i create a piece of php code that will check a jpg gif png or any other types of images using the getimagesize

1712366
portrait	landscape
and then check if the images width is smaller then the width in the following css code below if so then the php code should re-size the image all while keeping the images aspect ratio no matter if its in landscape or portrait

1712408
min	max
1140 mixing of group columns min max count ... with no group columns is illegal if there is no group by clause - select email count as records_found from emails where email email address

1712421
folder	directory
unzip the files or upload individual files folder to directory configured by iis management

1712446
ninject	spring.net
other good di frameworks include spring.net and ninject

1712455
min	max
if you want to use aggregate functions min max count you need to provide mysql with information on which columns to perform the aggregation on

1712481
post	get
let s take a post service in which you want to access the db to get a post

1712497
yacc	bison
because c syntax is context-sensitive it very difficult if not impossible to parse using traditional parser-generator tools such as yacc bison whereas pascal syntax is easy to parse using the same tools

1712532
division	modulo
after performing the division you will need to store the result back to the timeval probably making use of the remainder after division or modulo x y

1712552
int	double
when you re working with plain old data types int double you can divide

1712562
rss	feed
for my software development programming class we were supposed to make a feed manager type program for rss feed

1712562
getter	setter
i mean i get why they do it maybe later on they want to validate the data in the setter or increment it in the getter

1712567
decoder	encoder
oh also it has a json encoder decoder built in based on crockford s json2.js

1712567
firefox	safari	decoder	encoder
that native json encoder decoder is already available in safari 4 firefox 3.5 and ie8

1712569
getter	setter
here s a nice long so discussion on the subject why use getter and setter

1712592
put	get
i gather that this may have something to do with the array size being a variable i don t get this message when i put an integer literal there like

1712597
getter	setter
if you don t need validation then you don t need a getter and setter you re absolutely right

1712604
ubuntu	linux
i m imagining something like a website where you can input rudimentary code or a browser add-on or even just a standalone application that steps you through lisp something that runs on linux ubuntu

1712628
lisp	scheme
it accepts scheme syntax which is a variant of lisp

1712652
vbscript	vba
however you re in luck as you re likely to be able to move all your vba code out of access and into your vbscript which is quite compatible with vba

1712652
vbscript	vba
as a start try porting your vba code to vbscript and then post back here for help with what doesn t work

1712757
tcplistener	tcpclient
so to use a tcplistener on a pc i can use any port as long as it is not restricted and establsihed to listen to an incoming tcpclient

1712766
mouseover	mouseout
maybe because mouseover and mouseout still work even i m on child div

1712778
put	get
i can use one of the http bindings and get the service to work correctly when i put my machine s network ip address as the endpoint address and run the client and server from the same machine

1712788
hide	show
then assign an id or class to your parent div in order for jquery to select it and the hover function to trigger a hide and show

1712841
int	boolean
when i return various other datatypes longs int boolean ...etc to the ie javascript it works fine with the propertyget method

1712842
hash	md5
and why are you doing an md5 hash on it

1712863
atomic	compare-and-swap
suppose i m writing assembly code for a cpu whose only atomic operation is an unconditional swap -- no ll sc no compare-and-swap just plain swap

1712927
disk	ram
just increase ram disk space split resources among servers load balance etc

1712934
hex	binary
however since the character data in there is actually just a hex representation of a 160 bit number i thought it might be better to store it as binary 20

1712946
hex	binary
hex is somewhat more readable than binary if i happen to be loading a data dump in a text editor etc

1712957
short	base
even with the alphanumeric and case-sensitive restrictions base 36 obviously provides a much more compact representation than decimal allowing for short and arguably clean-looking ids

1712974
width	height
and it can even be auto-adjusting by trying to keep the maximum height and width roughly the same

1713041
subtract	add
including a global used-everywhere list of scripts which you can add to or subtract from on the fly

1713052
superclass	subclassing
super and all subclassing superclass stuff only works with new-style classes

1713072
min	max
a table that has field name value type min max etc.

1713083
hex	binary
the biggest problem we ran into was constantly annoyingly having binary data show up in the console everytime you type select you hear a million beeps and you have to always do select hex or insert unhex which is a pain

1713083
hex	binary
lastly if you mix and match by mistake binary and hex unhex and join on this value you could match records you never intended to

1713101
min	max
edit the current scipy version started to normalize all images so that min data become black and max data become white

1713119
content-length	content-type
a traffic sniff from addons.mozilla.org upon clicking on add to firefox shows that all you need is the content-type set to application x-xpinstall and the right content-length

1713143
pull	push
try git pull to fetch and merge the changes then you should be able to push

1713152
gridview	objectdatasource
the example uses gridview and objectdatasource

1713158
pull	push
you can perform git pull resolve potential conflicts and git push the result

1713158
pull	push
alternatively you can rebase your change between x and b on top of a with git pull --rebase and push the result back

1713169
google-chrome	firefox
the above code works fine in firefox but in ie and google-chrome the masterdiv dynpagecontent disappears

1713185
getter	setter
an object in its getter and setter calls an update method that transfers all of the class s information over the socket connection to other connected clients

1713226
getter	setter
getter setter are of course good practice but they are tedious to write and even worse to read

1713226
getter	setter
how many times have we read a class with half a dozen member variables and accompanying getter setter each with the full hog param return html encoded famously useless comment like get the value of x set the value of x get the value of y set the value of y get the value of z set the value of zzzzzzzzzzzzz

1713235
free	malloc
no new not even a malloc -- because those can lead to memory leaks if a developer forgets the corresponding delete free operation

1713241
onkeyup	onkeydown
i ve tried setting onkeyup onkeydown handlers on the dnd items but they don t seem to fire

1713251
post	get
the shake animation that you get when you enter your os x password incorrectly i duplicated using core animation in this blog post on cocoa is my girlfriend

1713283
public	protected
the standard wcf datacontractserializer will serialize everything marked with - regardless of the .net visibility public protected private internal

1713284
children	parent
if i understand how works in relation to before_destroy the dependent children are deleted before the parent s before_destroy method is called

1713328
unix	bsd
i try to config apache php for my project to create web-based for file config management to open vpn in bsd unix but i can t run as superuser to start or stop service

1713349
width	height
but when i resize window form elements still have initial width and height

1713384
.htaccess	httpd.conf
whenever you do have to change your rules you will have to restart your apache server if you put it in your httpd.conf as opposed to them being instantly detected in .htaccess files because it reads them all on every request

1713444
nonetype	iterable
but i believe it s typeerror nonetype object is not iterable since self.accept can return none

1713445
folder	directory
if i put correct admin username and password then i must be able to put the folder in that directory

1713484
multiplying	add
i need to take all rows with mvt 60200 and multiplying every gc and lc record in that row by 1.1 and add a new row containing the changes back into the same table with fy set to 2011

1713521
implements	extends
make a sort of adapter page that extends page and implements wizardpage that provides empty implementations of the wizardpage methods

1713542
hide	show
like ragez said..it uses css and javascript to show and hide img

1713572
for-loop	loops
clearly if you have for-loop which counts from 2 to n that is n cycles meaning that if you have an input elements your loops will count from 2 to an meaning that it is on the same level az the input so it s o n

1713582
superclass	subclassing
now every time i reference the node in the subclassing and make a change i have to make the same change in the superclass or they will be out of sync

1713635
uiview	subviews
since addsubview is on the stack my guess is that something is trying to remove one of the uiview s subviews during construction

1713637
children	parent
if a parent divs children are appended to a different div and then back again i get the exception in ie only

1713681
freemarker	velocity
velocity tries to interpret our freemarker code and fails so we need to use escapes in many places

1713691
bazaar	git
you could try out a dvcs like bazaar or mercurial or git

1713762
profiling	debugging
the clr debugging apis have a very important advantage over the profiling ones they allow you to attach to a running process

1713791
min	max
create triggers before insert and update to enforce the mod 360 equivalency and if max-min 360 set the min and max values to 0 and 360 respectively

1713810
mp3	wav
if you want to get really creative you can actually write code to handle the result of the recording verb and email the link to the mp3 or wav file that twilio hosts for you

1713825
g++	gcc
g++ is the gnu c++ compiler where c++ is the system c++ compiler in the case of ubuntu c++ is a link to g++ however in another system it could very well be a link to a non gcc compiler

1713848
getter	setter
basically just a class that has an array with magical getter setter

1713866
fileinputstream	gzipinputstream
just wrap your fileinputstream in a gzipinputstream

1713875
jpql	hql
jpa has its own query language called jpql hibernate supports an extended version of it called hql

1713878
mouse	keyboard
also on unix consider your tty device - it connects a keyboard and a mouse to a screen - three quite different bits of hardware

1713929
client-side	server-side
building images server-side is pretty easy - the trick is linking them to client-side requests

1713945
freebsd	linux
there are versions for mac os x windows linux and freebsd

1713945
freebsd	linux	gtk	motif
on linux and freebsd in currently lispworks 5 uses x11 motif for the gui - this will change in a future version lispworks 6 to gtk

1713999
rsa	aes	rsa	dsa
a standard way would be to use pkcs#7 as the signed envelope format rsa or dsa as the asymmetric algorithm sha-1 as the hash algorithm and aes as the symmetric algorithm

1714025
ssms	sqlcmd
ssms has correct settings by default so does sqlcmd osql etc

1714029
put	get	post	put	post	get
request type get put post delete

1714049
folder	directory
it always gets you the path of the executing dll or exe will be in bin folder for web apps then you can deduce the app directory from it

1714068
getter	setter
as an alternative you could create your own registry so that you can make it s content more explicit by defining your own getter and setter

1714110
unix	sunos
perl cpan provides unix uptime - however it is not currently compatible with sunos but may be in the future

1714185
firefox	safari
so either your clients trust you and install you firefox ie safari etc. extensions or .

1714241
udp	tcp
it s almost like p2p audio video chatting so i think that i must to stream them using a specified udp tcp port

1714247
nullpointerexception	runtimeexception
runtimeexception exist so that you don t have to declare every single method to throw nullpointerexception etc

1714273
actionscript	mxml
cdata tags are useful in mxml because they to define an actionscript script block within an mxml file allowing me to combine an ecma type scripting language with and and the like and valid xml in a single file

1714273
actionscript	mxml
i suppose another option to combine mxml and actionscript would be to combine them in the way you combine html and javascript and that is to wrap the script in an xml comment tag inside the script block and the choice to use cdata instead was made by the developers of the mxml compiler

1714273
actionscript	mxml
i suppose the reasoning probably has more to do with editing as the mxml editor validates your code against a schema to check syntax and provide context help as well parsing your actionscript code for syntax and context help

1714317
put	get
i put up with this in the stl because well it makes sense to see algorithms apart from basic components and because of the you get used to it factor

1714349
mouse	keyboard
i m writing an application that monitors the personâ s mouse and keyboard

1714349
mouse	keyboard
if they have not used the keyboard or mouse for 1 minute it will pop up a message that says â œyou have not used the mouse or keyboard for 1 minuteâ along with an ok button

1714375
ienumerable	ienumerator
you can implement ienumerator interface and ienumerable and return false from movenext function of ienumerable interfase

1714388
mouse	keyboard
but to monitor all mouse and keyboard activity in the os you will have to hook to the api which is platform dependent and will require using the jni

1714402
ncover	testdriven.net
if you use the testdriven.net addin you will get a very good unit test runner and ncover thrown in as well

width	height
and that s it that s all you have to change to make the slider have a bigger width and height

1714743
post	put
but when i put this on a custom page i m working on it seems to just be pulling out the page name i m currently on and the link to this page even though i m thinking the above function should be retrieving a post

1714932
many-to-many	many-to-one
i would connect the ads with categories with a many-to-many relation the ads with the sellers with a many-to-one and either relate the area with the ads with a many-to-many or do the same with sellers and areas depending on what sort of design you re after

1715018
children	parent
the parent movieclip will take the size of its children or what is drawn in it

1715079
pull	push
if you want hg to push pull from a git repo then consider the hg-git mercurial plugin

1715087
return-value-optimization	nrvo
your compiler might also be smart enough to apply nrvo named return-value-optimization

1715095
versioning	upgrade
now however i have upgrade to the latest versioning of the zend framework 1.9.5 i needed to upgrade for another issue and now my subdomains no longer work

1715098
button	checkbox
button checkbox etc freeze while

1715116
jar	war
you might have a convention for loading the code - for example from a special directory or from a specially formatted zip file as war files and jar files

1715177
put	get
the best guess i have is that maybe the index fell behind although i had assumed that if i get a successful return from put then the indexes are updated

1715181
awt	swing
for an awt swing application you need to use non-standard appcontext class which could change at any time

1715181
securitymanager	classloader
the plug-in process will need a securitymanager set and a classloader to both isolate the plug-in code and apply an appropriate protectiondomain to plug-in classes

1715192

transient fields are lost at serializable but you need them only after deserialization so you have to restore them to what you need in the readobject method.

1715220
titlebar	window
icon in the window s titlebar will be

1715259
hash	md5
i m not quite sure if this is what you re asking but md5 is 128 bits 32 hex digits while sha-1 is 160 bits 40 hex digits so it s fairly easy to tell the difference between them providing of course that you know that your hash will be either md5 or sha-1 and not something else

1715259
hash	md5
if you re asking whether you can determine if a given md5 hash is a hash of a hash or a hash of some other data then i believe the answer is no .

1715277
hash	md5
md5 gives a 128-bit hash value

1715311
width	height
ps to be fair i am guessing that w and h are width and height so they are probably always positive

1715344
post	get
there are lots of places you could have gone wrong...and if you post some code you re much more likely to get a solution but some possibilities

1715405
oncreate	onnewintent
that s probably why oncreate gets invoked every time instead of onnewintent which would only be called if the activity is already existing

1715405
oncreate	onnewintent
but if you go up higher on the activity stack into other activities and from there call your artistactivity.class again it will skip oncreate and go directly to onnewintent because the activity has already been created and since you defined it as singletop android won t create a new instance of it but take the one that is already lying around

1715405
onstart	ondestroy	onresume	onpause
same for onrestart onstart onresume onpause ondestroy

1715434

since i want the user s updates to the fields and not the current database fields to be what displays on this go back action i have to pass the values around via post get params

1715456
hash	md5	hex	binary
well an md5 hash is really just binary data - if you ve got a string then it s presumably encoded in some fashion base64 or hex

1715457
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
so you most likely have had issues with firefox opera google-chrome and safari you did not know about

1715461
hash	md5
a md5 hash is a 128 bit value

1715461
hash	md5
a md5 hash has no internal structure or any kind of signature that allows you detect if a 128 bit value is a md5 hash or not

1715485
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
im trying to programatically do a uitabbarcontroller using a uinavigationcontroller inside each uiviewcontroller called by the tabs.

1715489
hash	md5
first thing to do is examine the file to work out how the md5 hash are encoded then design a match based on that

1715496
google-chrome	firefox
even if it doesn t work in every browser though that would be ideal even just firefox google-chrome would be excellent

1715611
google-chrome	safari
it is a known issue that document.implementation.createdocument isn t implemented on safari google-chrome webkit so you ll likely have to resort to loading the content in an iframe and accessing the contentdocument object of the iframe

1715628
hash	salt
i think thinking of user logs in store their userid timestamp and a hash of timestamp + salt + hash of their pw in a cookie

1715628
hash	salt
then when they visit the site next check if a hash of the cookie timestamp + salt + hash of their pw is valid

1715646
profiling	debugging
i either have sql profiling listening on the database or if you re in debugging mode with vs you can move the cursor over the linq statement and it is in the tooltip

1715710
margin	height
the issue is that without the margin on the bottom the page height is shorter then the window bounds thus your footer div ends and the body of the page bleeds through

1715766
bresenham	dda
for example bresenham s line algorithm is a dda optimized to use integer arithmetic

1715769

then hash random + salt + password + ip

1715850
google-chrome	firefox
this had no ill effects on firefox and fixed it in google-chrome

1715851
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
your two uinavigationcontroller should be the viewcontrollers of the uitabbarcontroller

1715855

1715951
mate	puremvc
for this app i m experimenting with other approaches to mvc not other frameworks puremvc or mate but writing my own mvc base application

1716009
int	chars
for example if you define chars as a single letter from the users point of view it can be more than 2 bytes for example this chars aìš is two unicode code points u+0041 u+030a latin capital a + combining ring above so it will require two .net chars or 4 bytes int utf-16

1716026
width	height
we could simplify user s subscription to item details observations by tagging observation type for example height weight width would be tagged with all dimensions physical

1716029
strtol	getline
you should probably use getline to read a line no matter what and then parse it with strtol or similar instead

1716083
google-chrome	firefox
firefox 3.5 and google-chrome 4 dev on this same machine both work as expected

1716097
fgets	strtol	fgets	strtok	strtol	strtok	int	chars
it s a better idea to just read whole lines in with fgets and then working on them with functions like strtok and strtol which btw will correctly parse int and tell you exactly where the invalid chars begin

1716117
rss	feed
what i need is a tool that can track for me a big very large number of rss or atom feed and issue events when they are updated

1716153
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
yes if the superclass s code changes drastically by altering method signatures you ll have to revise the subclassing as well -- that s part of the price of inherited

1716156
invariantculture	cultureinfo
if you do not want to use the current cultureinfo you can use the static invariantculture

i debugged the flex app and find that the actual width and height values are getting assigned

1716180
serializable	deserialization
if you just need serializable deserialization you can use only banana protocol or jelly persistence directly

1716221
disk	ram
the only way i can think of is to use to create a temporary ram disk and mount it under say temp tmp_ram_disk so that the save-to-disk option won t be slow but sure how to do that or if it s even possible

1716250
inherited	properties
assign the css class to the inherited cssclass properties instead and let the base class handle the rendering

1716255
put	get
although if you get start properly with a good book pragmatic defacto rails book 3rd edition is a good choice you will never put that one down even after so long as the references are just too useful

1716297
firefox	safari
now that works fine in firefox and safari but not in ie

1716312
channelfactory	wshttpbinding
ps i think you should be fine now - you create the wshttpbinding and it uses all the defaults as in the config and you define your endpoint address to point to the server where your service is hosted and in the channelfactory you specify the contract being used - that s all there is

1716322
stdout	fflush
to immediately fflush call fflush stdout or fflush null null means fflush everything

getter	setter
the retain assign copy qualifiers on the property declaration are about how the memory for the property value is managed in the getter and setter that the compiler synthesizes for you

1716513
google-chrome	firefox
ie8 firefox and google-chrome do not do an options request and therefore never have a problem

lxml	libxml2
currently i have 2 varieties lxml and libxml2 that both seem to work

1716647

1716663
memcpy	malloc
i have to malloc some space and know 3rd parameter of memcpy - size

1716710
post	get
but you would need to replace all links by forms with buttons and you need to modify the server side code so that it listens on post requests instead of get requests to take actions accordingly

1716726
maven	pom.xml
everything works fine during compile time but at runtime maven overrides the jtidy in the pom.xml with its own implementation in maven-core-2.0.7-uber.jar

post	get
although probably the most prvalent vector is form post content and get url variables

1717072

1717175
width	height
two of these left and right have fixed width height and should display an image or shrink to 0 when no image is present

1717219
width	height
if you want to display something inline and with a specific height and width use the display inline-block rule that s the correct option instead of just display block

1717224
downcasting	upcasting
since you talk about upcasting and downcasting i assume you want dynamic polymorphism meaning that you ll have functions which pass around pointers or references to a and at runtime the referands will actually be of type aimpl

1717224
public	protected
that s also fine except that a s destructor should either be virtual and public or non-virtual and protected

google-chrome	firefox
pls check the script below it worked fine for me in ie firefox and google-chrome

currently my object hierarchy looks like this uitabbarcontroller - uiviewcontroller - uiview

1717387
uisegmentedcontrol	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
as a more concrete example the first view controller for my uitabbarcontroller is a uiviewcontroller and that has three subviews which are controlled by a uisegmentedcontrol

1717478
typeerror	attributeerror
ned s suggestion about putting it in a try block works here as well but if you re going to go that route one minor note in python 3 calling next on a non-iterator raises a typeerror whereas this version would raise an attributeerror instead

1717486
gridview	sqldatasource
i display all the files in gridview control with sqldatasource

1717766
min	max
to do my min max and avg calculations i want an intermediate table that looks like this

1717830
quicksort	heapsort
with that proviso the short answer is that in most current standard libraries std sort is implemented as a intro-sort introspective sort which is basically a quicksort that keeps track of its recursion depth and will switch to a heapsort usually slower but guaranteed o n log n complexity if the quicksort is using too deep of recursion

1717852

equals	tostring
so i thought it would be convenient to put hashcode equals and tostring into the interface to make sure that i remember to override the default method for these

1718127
equals	tostring
but in the case of equals hashcode and tostring as well as a few others that you didn t mention the implementation already exists

1718134
implements	extends
any class that implements your interface also extends object

1718134

filtering	grouping
i m using zenity to post a simple notification when my spam-filter daemon filtering a grouping of messages

1718154
width	height
however zenity does not honor the -geometry option which is supposed to be standard for all x applications and its documentation gives options for controlling window height and width but not placement

1718166
equals	tostring
as far as a solution for your particular problem you might consider creating your own methods maybe getstringrepresentation getcustomhashcode and equalsobject and have your objects extend a base class whose equals tostring and hashcode methods call these methods

1718166
equals	tostring
this is one of the reasons that some people have suggested that equals tostring and hashcode should never have been included on the object class in the first place

1718170
implements	extends
it is a bad idea to force classes that implements your existing interface to extends a specific abstract class

1718183
jobs	cron
the worker processes run in a loop or off cron and poll the queue table for new jobs

1718207
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
so the former might be case-insensitive while the latter is case-sensitive

for-loop	loops
you can start by peeling off the first digit and incrementing your initial loops index if is non-zero just before the for-loop in decodehexstring

1718236
put	get
you could put some code inside the two types in a run member and get something kinda similar but with very cumbersome syntax

1719275
accessor	properties
the whole purpose of writing an accessor method is to hide the implementation of certain properties of the class from external users

1719275
accessor	properties
so in your case by making the accessor static you automatically declare and expose the fact that the corresponding properties is specific to the entire class not to a particular object of the class

1719275

by making the accessor non-static you automatically declare and expose the fact that the properties might be specific to a particular object of the class

i started out with nmock when that was the only option back in 2003 then migrated to rhino mocks because of its type safety and now use moq because of the simpler api

1720747
subtract	add
one way to make this approach easier is to add your top fields to a separate panel that is autoheight true then after showing or hiding fields simply measure the height of that panel and subtract it from the window height plus margins padding to get your html editor height that s what i ve done in the past when i couldn t rely on a layout to manage it

1720752
gridview	rowdatabound
i have a custom gridview on rowdatabound i am adding new gridviewrows

the reason i am doing what i am doing above is to extends secondclass for every class that needs it - doing so statically while the second class cannot extends more then one class thus i am using implements

1720941
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

1720943
folder	directory
i ve also seen other solutions on the same server of having the same web application run side-by-side and either change the root directory in iis or change the web.config to point to a different folder but the problem with this is that you have to do an entire build and deploy even if it were for a simple bug fix

1720984

the error does sound strange but as konamiman pointed out a little refactoring won t hurt although i don t like to use toupper or tolower

1721458

any keydown or keyup event is raised at panel level

1721472

1721474
put	get

1721544
outputstream	inputstream
buffered readers writers inputstream outputstream read and write to the os in large chunks for optimization

i also heared about scheme and lisp compilers but i don t like this language

1721834
put	get
as long as i can t get it working since if i put in my class

1721850
udp	tcp
at the risk of just pointing you back the comments to that post explain that udp doesn t block on the tcp ack but you could still block on a kernel buffer overflow

1721868
16-bit	64bit
i believe azul s version of hotspot uses 64bit references with 48-bits for address and 16-bit type information

1721886
free	malloc
never mix malloc free with new delete

1721886
boost	stl
there are const references to avoid copy construction of objects passed to functions and stl containers and strings for the other storage requirements and use smart boost shared_ptr pointers if you really need pointers and don t want to track them by hand

1721887
nsstream	nshost
during my efforts to bring this code to the iphone i discovered that nshost isn t available in the iphone sdk and should instead be replaced with nsstream and the related networking classes

1721908
free	malloc
call the correct deallocation routine is for arrays allocated via only delete for pointers to single objects only and free ... only for memory allocated via the c api such as malloc ..

1721908
short	base
these are required for correctness in short the base class must have explicitly marked the destructor as virtual

i want to draw rectangle to position what i get from startpoint but now it places my rectangle to middle of picturecanvas when i want to put it in startpoint position

1722099
implements	extends
however you can implements an interface in you model by extends the doctrine-generated model and implements the interface in the subclass

1722134
typedef	struct
struct typedef unions members of unions and struct and enum values typically are in lower case in my experience rather than the c++ java c# etc convention of making the first letter a capital but i guess it s possible in c too

1722155
innodb	myisam
myisam uses table-level locking for updates and innodb uses row-level locking

1722155
innodb	myisam
so as i understand for tables with frequent concurrent updates several updates per second it is better to make them innodb and for other tables if we don t need transactions and foreign keys of course it is ok to be with myisam engine

1722180
innodb	myisam
you should use innodb in such scenarios and most mysql gurus recommend using innodb by default anyway because it s considered more generally reliable than myisam despite being slower under some use cases

1722181
rsa	dsa
i d like to know at least the certificate type x509 rsa dsa and whether it s a public or private key

1722186
innodb	myisam
i am a newcomer to mysql myself but when i installed it it explained that innodb is optimised for transactional operational systems and myisam is great for reporting dw systems

1722221
put	get
but honestly the right way to handle this would be to get rid of that singleton and to put the data in 2nd level cache and to invalidate the cache if you update the table manually

1722229
filesystems	fat	filesystems	ntfs
this could be any type of filesystems - ntfs fat etc but all it means is that you re about to be working with the files on the system

1722682
inherited	properties
since user controls inherited from system.web.ui.webcontrol they have a page and parent properties

1722707
integer	unsigned	hex	binary
generally it makes sense to use hex when the number being represented is more of a technical computer or hardware limitation parameter as these types of values are often based on base-2 constructs because the internal limitation is tied to the number of potential values that can be represented by some binary number a value that muist be stored in an 8 bit byte or in a 16 bit unsigned integer for example

1722720
cvs	svn
i ve been working with cvs and svn in teams of different sizes and ime there are very few cases when merging becomes a real problem

updatepanel	scriptmanager
a simple not the most efficient way to do this will be to add a scriptmanager control to your page to enable ajax controls in it then add an updatepanel control and move your gridview inside this updatepanel

1722887
for-loop	arrays
another answer for the first question is to use one for-loop and perform linear indexing into the arrays using the function numel to get the total number of elements

1722897
client-side	server-side
even if you could work out these client-side problems as far as i know any generic web server is going to wait until it s received the entire post ed file upload before passing it on to the server-side web app so there s no opportunity for a server-side component to update status as it receives each chunk

1722898
ant	maven
maven does allow you to use ant tasks using the antrun plugin

1723114
sorting	filtering
is a good option but note that it doesn t support sorting or filtering out of the box

1723114
sorting	filtering
datatable is probably your best option if you need sorting and or filtering capability

1723146
mouse	keyboard
my solution to this was using cordinates and simulate keys klicks im using global mouse and keyboard library for this found at this location

1723152

i think you ll find the available allocator implementations are under include stlport stl in your installation

1723429
packets	multicast
i know how to set the ttl on the sending multicast socket but i want to know the remaining ttl of the arriving packets

1723458
config	ini
however it looks like you are parsing an ini style config file

1723472
aggregate-functions	sum
also as bill karwin mentions nulls behave specially in aggregate-functions count sum avg etc. calculating avg temperature on the above data would give you -14.5 as the null row is ignored

1723548
rss	feed
this is probably a more complicated approach than you re interested in but since the start page can show rss feed you could write a web app that would query vss via the com interface list your checkouts and publish that as a feed

1723548
rss	feed
if you re not looking to roll your own i did a quick search and came across vssrsssvc an application that generates rss feed from a vss database

1723551
post	get
i don t currently have access to an open wifi network with which to test further but i ll update this post if i get a chance

1723565
instances	transient
so all this does is confirm that transient scope is being used and that the controller factory is returning a different instances of the same controller when requested

1723566
inherited	properties
a blank newly instantiated smxfr object has the extended properties in place but all of its inherited properties and objects return error error #2037 functions called in incorrect sequence or earlier call was unsuccessful

1723566
inherited	properties
i get living handle properties from that and all other that is inherited properties throw error #2037

1723609
versioning	upgrade
the file versioning is also important for windows installer when you upgrade an existing versioning over a previous one

1723660
awt	swing
i think swing awt cannot do this without a guest program specific jni

1723673
post	get
post the code where you use the smxfr class and get the said error

1723785
cassini	iis
since you are running iis 5.1 you may need to use the visual studio development server aka cassini to host your visual studio project

1723830
children	parent
you can make your objects all expose the same method call it attemptsave and calling this method on the parent object will result in it calling in cascade those methods of all children

1723831
inherited	properties
the main difference is that the value of a normal .net properties is read directly from a private member in your class whereas the value of a dependencyproperty is resolved dynamically when calling the getvalue method that is inherited from dependencyobject

1723838
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
google-chrome 2 safari 4 firefox 3 opera 10 ie6 ie7 mdash

1723843
width	height
select the plot area of the chart and then manually set the height and width of the plot area

1723843
min	max
just setting the axis min and max values will still allow the chart to be squished

1723859
inherited	properties
dependency properties provide properties value inherited

1723860
superclass	subclassing
if it doesn t make sense for this to return a value in the superclass then you can make the superclass abstract which means you cannot construct an instance of it directly you can only construct one of its subclassing and declare the method abstract in karakter too

1723872
portrait	landscape
it does not matter if the picture is landscape or portrait the function knows exactly what to do

1723872
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome works same as safari

1723888
aptana	rubymine
if you need an ide i personally recommend rubymine although aptana is a worthy offering as well and free

1723901
imperative	declarative
i would recommend you though to always use linq instead of writing for or foreach loops because in the future it will become so intelligent that it will actually be capable of distributing the work over processors and take into account hardware specific things see plinq and it will eventually be faster than if you wrote the loops yourself declarative vs imperative programing

1723918
getter	setter
the more code means constructor copy constructor assignment operator and destructor which is a fair amount and of course the getter and setter

1723947
rss	feed
the string to be scrolled is created using an array of characters and their sizes using dx measure string created from the source string rss feed and stored in an array

1723947
rss	feed
the rss feed in this case was about 500 characters long

1723947
rss	feed
the memory seems to crawls up as each character is added subtracted and once the entire rss feed string has been scrolled the memory usage stays static - at 200m - from then on in

1723954
cvs	svn
if two more people edit a form at the same time conflicts can arise in svn cvs that are nearly impossible to reconcile

1723975
move	drag
so for example if i clicked on the drag handle div and then move my mouse upwards out of the div as the div only move left and right it then doesn t catch the onup or onmove events

1723987
versioning	upgrade
as for vss- tfs - microsoft supports an upgrade path which should keep your versioning history but if you don t need it the history i would just get the latest versioning from vss check it into tfs and archive the vss repository

1723989
qlistwidget	qtreewidget
i ve created a child class of qtreewidget that i want to be able to drag items from another tree widget too i want to handle the insertion myself though as well as from a qlistwidget

1724025
int	double
some are string s some are int s and some are double s

1724027
width	height
if you set the width and height using the star notation it will occupy as much space that is left in the container

1724027
width	height
setting the height and width to auto will make the control use as much space as is needed to display the contents of what is in the control

1724057
public	protected
do not use across assemblies public or protected if value might change in future because the value will be hardcoded at compile-time in those other assemblies

1724079
inherited	properties
one option for doing this is making all of your pages inherited from a base class that contains a relativeurl properties that can be overridden for individual pages

1724146
inherited	subclassing
i am using fluent nhibernate with table per subclassing inherited mapping

1724205
int	chars
in the case of int longs chars this makes sense

1724242
int	chars	int	double
the general precedence order from highest to lowest is chars int of any sign or number of bits single double and logical

1724249
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i have tested it on my computer with firefox 3.5.5 safari 4.0.3 google-chrome and opera 10.1

1724253
mockups	balsamiq
i also checked out how to design a user interface for the app via using balsamiq s mockups and submitted some ideas to my potential user base my peers on my team to have them give feedback

1724254
int	boolean
language specs define bitwise operators only when both operands are of primitive int types or both are of boolean type

1724262
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i have a uitabbarcontroller whose tabs are uinavigationcontroller

1724262
navigationcontroller	pushviewcontroller
this seems to work great when i only pushviewcontroller one level but fails when i drill down multiple levels in my navigationcontroller

1724329
mvp	presenter
see also model view controller mvc for web development and model view presenter mvp or model view viewmodel mvvm for desktop development

1724351
debian	linux
edit 1 this is on a debian lenny linux system in case it makes any difference

1724364
hide	show
all that said it looks like you are wanting to show hide divs

1724368
children	parent
normally when you load things with nhibernate the parent get loaded first and the list of known entities in the session will have the parent before the children

1724368
children	parent
if you don t have the parent in the list before the children the auto-dirty-check code doesn t work because it goes sequentially through the list of known entities mark child entities as dirty as it goes

1724368
children	parent
the moral of the story is this if you disable the auto-dirty-check behavior and you do custom loading of entities make sure that you load the parent up before the children

1724380
versioning	upgrade
the downside is that when they went along and discontinued the free versioning i was in the position to either pay for an upgrade or stick with what i have

1724412
cvs	rcs
the usual way to get revision history on a file is not to examine the repository-wide history file but rather it is to run the cvs log command which will extract the rcs revision information for a given file or subtree

1724433
vb.net	vb6	fortran	ada
language aware and handles many languages c c++ c# java objectivec php vb.net vb6 ada fortran cobol ...

1724460
post	get
i have accomplished this for the select boxes of the from using session variables however i can not figure out how to get the actual path of the file upload input to post

1724477
srp	principles
separation of concern vs single responsibility principles soc vs srp

1724477
srp	principles
single responsibility principles srp â every object should have a single responsibility and that all its services should be narrowly aligned with that responsibility

1724485
ord	chr	int	chars
chr and ord convert chars from and to int respectively

1724489
srp	principles
single responsibility principles srp -

1724492
subtract	add
it doesn t add or subtract to what clients can pass to your function

1724515
int	double
the types will all be simply values of strings int double and dates

1724574
getter	setter
my suggestion is to use one of the already existing orm implementations which already supplies facilities for getter and setter methods of related models

1724574
getter	setter
in the other case you have to write specialized getter and setter by yourself for every model

1724581
post	get
the only way to get rid of the post part of the url is with named routes but those require some duplication to make restful

1724604
onclick	onfocus
i have definitely tried onclick and onfocus to no avail

1724630
compare-and-swap	lockless
however i notice that there are papers at the end that can do the true lockless queue ing using a double compare-and-swap dcas operation

1724666
memcached	apc
most people seem to be using apc for the bytecode cache and putting their sessions in memcached

1724724
folder	directory
and even then you still need to parse the html page which represents the directory index and parse all elements representing the files and folder yourself

1724748
post	get
i want to get a lookup table that will give me all the post related to a given tag so i use the following code

1724756
spaces	delimiter
string begins with item1 and spaces following it until 10 spaces are taken up followed by a delimiter | and string 2

1724793
width	height
i would recommend adding two hbox s both 100 height and 50 width each and align them separate

1724807
equals	tostring
traversableforwarder -- forwards most methods to underlying except tostring hashcode equals stringprefix newbuilder view and all calls creating a new iterable object of the same kind

1724838
udp	tcp
this exposes less functionality because you can only control three things through ipsec for the adapters tcp ports udp ports ip protocols

1724863
portrait	landscape
im using a uiwebview to access a website when i rotate the phone landscape the uiwebview is properly resized and the scrollbar are on the right place on the right edge... but when i acess any of input fields to fill the information required and exit it the uiwebview scrollbar jumps to the middle of screen looks like it get back to 320 the width of the screen on portrait

1724870
queue	fifo
in contrast to a queue fifo a stack means you can handle the most recent data first while leaving old data last

1724981
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
use getelementbyid getelementsbytagname to locate your hidden input and assign it the value

1724985
multiplying	multiplication
but remember if you use matrix class becomes matrix multiplication and you need to use multiplying for elementwise

1725019
folder	directory	vmware	virtualbox
the source directory is a shared folder between windows and linux a virtualbox feature but i m sure vmware has the same thing

1725094
nsoperation	nsmanagedobject
since nsmanagedobject is not thread-safe i m sending in the nsmanagedobjectid from threada main thread to threadb via an nsoperation derived class

1725149
vb.net	vb6
vbmigration.com chose egl25 as a high-quality open-source vb6 project to demonstrate their vb6 to vb.net upgrade tool

1725155
rss	feed
i am trying to read an rss feed using c# and linq to xml

1725155
rss	feed
here is my code which reads out and parses the rss feed data

1725162
jquery	simplemodal
.modal.close function of simplemodal jquery plugin gets called when closing modal window

1725189
inherited	properties
you could create a custom class like scorecardformviewmodel and include the items you need as properties and have your view inherited scorecardformviewmodel

1725214
width	height
if set true then it might increase the width or height if the given width and height are bigger than original width and height

1725280
button	checkbox
it might be better ui to use a toggle button to check all uncheck all instead of a checkbox for all

1725280
button	checkbox
so 1 button + 4 checkbox instead of 5 checkbox

1725293
stdout	stderr
the code in question is normally very simple on windows unixy systems - typically does a bit of library initialisation opens stdin stdout stderr sets timezone etc sets up the environment processes the command line for passing to main

1725331
wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe
you generate a client proxy from the wsdl using either svcutil.exe or add service reference in vs or wsdl.exe and invoke the method

1725348
inherited	properties
onsubmit is a method id is a properties form is a node with a node type of 1 which means it s an htmlelement and inherited generic html properties

1725354
kde	gnome
read platform settings supports windows kde gnome

1725422
hide	show
it s expected that navigating to a new tab will hide the controls from the previous tab and show the ones from the new tab -- but then again tabs are a navigational paradigm

1725457
ubuntu	linux
we observed this rapid cpu spikes only on ubuntu linux where as windows it runs without on itch

1725464
subtract	add
i have the following dynamic sql statement where i want to add startrowindex + maximumrows and subtract 1 from it

1725484
children	parent
if a next h3 comes or page end you create a div and add it after the starting h3 all collected elements should be removed from their parent the html and added as children of the div

1725488
inherited	properties
one thing about objects is that they can inherited properties from a parent class of object

1725488
inherited	properties
so since element defines the name properties and textfield and checkbox and all their friends inherited from element they all automatically have this name properties available too

1725498
boost	stl
stl boost cover all the low level stuff

1725579
children	parent
but that seems to require that the parent pom.xml info is declared in the children

1725601
qtabwidget	qtabbar
the only methods pertaining to the qtabbar that i see in qtabwidget are protected and i don t see a need to inherit from the class other than for this express purpose

1725601
qtabwidget	qtabbar
other than this the only thing i can think of is to subclass qtabwidget and then i can control the size of the qtabbar by extending or overriding features of this class

1725616
filtering	grouping	sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping
as it is if your report contains any sorting grouping or filtering at all it is forced to parse the entire file before it can show the first page which i suspect is the main cause of the huge delay

1725629
opera	google-chrome
working correctly in ff3 opera google-chrome and even ie8

1725646
memcached	apc
a few options if memcached apc is too much or not possible

1725708
squash	merge
i wanted to have a simple solution to squash two merge commits together during an interactive rebase

1725708
squash	merge	squash	branch
i don t just want to rebase the my-feature branch since it is a published branch of its own i just want to squash together the last two merge commits into one haven t published those commits yet

1725722
printf	fgets
now try the same with wide characters and replace printf with wprintf fgets with fgetws etc .

1725735
decimal	ieee
there is also a new decimal type in some implementations based on a new definition from ieee 754r mdash

1725760
rss	feed
contact the author of the rss feed and tell him to fix it either by removing the cdata tags so the entities get interpreted or by putting the intended characters directly into the html file

1725766
adplus	cdb
in the past i ve set up a zip file that contained some of the contents of the debugging tools for windows like cdb and adplus which can be installed just by unzipping it on a users machine

1725776
width	height
you can assign the box a fixed width and height and then give it s margin-top and margin-left properties the negative half of the height and width

1725782
width	height
so if you set margin-top and margin-left to negative of one-half the height and width respectively you ll get a centered box

1725785
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i have my mainwindow with a uinavigationcontroller and a uitabbarcontroller

1725804
put	get
another way that i have seen is to get the max from the table and increment it and put it into the new row

1725832
post	get
the problem is applying the style pre render is pointless the javascript is building the table post render is all i could get to work

1725892
sharepoint	spsite
i m trying to get an spsite for a remote sharepoint url

1725895
vb6	vba
the following is the existing vba method accessing the vb6 app

1725897
google-chrome	firefox
here s an example that works in firefox and google-chrome

1725897
setinterval	clearinterval
setinterval and clearinterval are standard js functions

1725935
int	chars
from portability viewpoint chars cannot be smaller than 8 bits and nothing can be smaller than chars so if a given c implementation has an unsigned 8-bit int type it s going to be chars

1725970
jdom	dom4j
while i agree with and want to second the other two at the moment answers that proposed using a standard tool such as dom4j or jdom i d like to posit an off-the-wall suggestion

1725999
versioning	upgrade
strongly recommend upgrade your versioning of memcached

1726021
accessor	properties
the val accessor works like the value properties except that it s extended to work nicely even with input fields like selects and checkboxes

1726023
webkit	gecko
viewing it in either gecko webkit or presto an unintentional vertical space occurs after the object before the second div see

1726031
pull	push
the amount of overhead needed to use dynamic data structures extra memory use extra instructions needed to pull and push the data from sram keep track of which dynamic variable resides where moving memory blocks around when variables in between get deleted.... just doesn t justify the merits

1726042
binutils	mpc
according the the gcc build instructions you can build binutils concurrently with building gcc as well as gmp mpc etc

1726042
binutils	bfd
alongside the compiler bfd binutils

1726042
mpfr	mpc
likewise the gmp mpfr and mpc

1726042
mpfr	mpc
mpfr and or mpc source distributions

1726042
mpfr	mpc
to gmp mpfr and mpc respectively or

1726042
binutils	mpc	mpfr	mpc
this works fine for gmp mpc mpfr but i can t seem to get it to build all of binutils

1726046
ubuntu	linux
linux ubuntu at least seems to have much better support here using utf-8 and providing a font with broad grapheme support

1726057
width	height
as you are responsible for painting the entire form it is probably simplest to define your own content rectangle that is positioned say 10 pixels in from the top left of the form and has a width height 20 pixels less then the form width height

1726090
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i found this one the other day which doesn t seem bad but it doesn t work in google-chrome works in firefox and opera but i didn t get chance to check out ie

1726122
bmp	png	bmp	tga	png	tga
i used this image because i ve found it in various file formats tga tif jpg png bmp

1726218
tlistview	tdbgrid
tlistview is not a data-aware component and there isn t afaik a vcl tdblistview - if you need a grid of data you can either bind to a tdbgrid or use a 3rd part tdblistview which you can find with a quick google

1726307
punctuation	words
note that this array will hold bytes of data not necessarily characters letter numbers and punctuation marks as we typically understand the words character

1726312
mapquest	directions
part of what i want to offer subscribers to my application is a map showing the location of their customer with the option to get directions the idea is that they can just easily get the directions from one place instead of copying pasting and going to google maps or mapquest or whichever

1726320
width	height
if you omit the height and width on an image then it can be a little unpredictable

1726331
hide	show
i ve found great workaround for this - hide table before populating and then show it when done

1726346
uilabel	uibutton	pop-up	dialog
i d like to pop-up a dialog on top of the view controller at some point and i d like to design that view in interface builder because it s fairly straightforward background uiimageview some uilabel and a uibutton

1726360
fadein	fadeout
if your request is to have a text fadein effect you just have to apply the fadeout to the black layer over it and vice-versa

1726377
eigen	blitz++	boost	eigen	boost	blitz++
but it d be a tragedy if the c++ world revolved around that one library and boost and poco and wxwidgets and clutter and blitz++ and eigen and and 101 other wonderful things yes gtkmm and ace even were stifled at birth because the gatekeepers of the standard library didn t see fit to admit them

1726393
free	malloc
i wouldn t be so worried about the quantity but the frequency of memory which you leak but if you leak even just a few bytes very very often your malloc s data structures will grow and might make it dramatically slower to traverse them to allocate new memory and free

1726393
freebsd	linux
does not apply to even remotely dlmalloc-based systems freebsd linux etc there it s just don t care all you loose there is memory perhaps a few times more than the amount you think and not performance

1726421
subtract	add
i want to manage a google reader folder of feeds that i can add and subtract feeds to programatically

1726422
client-side	server-side
it s not client-side code but you mentioned php so maybe server-side code is an option

1726428
pop-up	dialog
however the great little tool reflector is able to go further and actually display the contained types and handles gracefully the missing reference issue by giving me a pop-up dialog to browse for it

1726531
children	parent
the parent pom and its version does have to be declared in the children

1726531
maven	pom.xml
set up a public maven repository deploy the parent pom.xml to it and put the repository information in the child poms

1726531
maven	pom.xml
you can tell maven to look for the parent pom.xml on a relative path before it checks repositories this is to help you when you have local changes to the parent pom.xml not yet deployed

1726546
avr	microcontroller
in particular avr microcontroller like the atmega series

1726561
spaces	delimiter
the exec method that accepts a string uses the spaces character as a delimiter to break up the string into commands

1726571
pull	push
sorry for the vague answer but here goes you need to push chat text out to every connection for a given user id not just responde to a pull from a given connection session

1726585
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome are known to be slow on localhost when ip6 is enabled

1726592
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
abstract superclass - subclassing inherited the behavior of the parent but the parent cannot be used to reference a subclassing you want to store in the database

1726592
superclass	subclassing
superclass with tableperheirarchy false - subclassing store the parent s fields in the parent s table polymorphism works as expected

1726592
superclass	subclassing
empty superclass with tableperheirarchy false - subclassing store all of their own data in their table polymorphism works as expected

1726641
hide	show
jquery i have two divs that i m toggling back and forth show and hide between on my page using a link to each

1726715
hide	show
as a bonus it won t show both content while loading and hide one when the loading is done

1726720
pop-up	dialog
this is currently implemented via four separate links that upon clicking display a pop-up dialog for the user to enter in their information for the corresponding server they selected

1726728
rsa	dsa
the x509 standard defines certificates and rsa and dsa are two of the public key algorithms that can be used in those certificates

1726728
rsa	dsa
all you don t know is whether those certificate private key are rsa or dsa

1726728
rsa	dsa
the text output of the openssl x509 command should include a subject public key section which will include fields that let you see if it s an rsa or dsa key along with the key size

1726742
width	height
and unlike inline elements a included among these block elements can be assigned a width and height

1726749
webclient	httpwebrequest
webclient does not allow you to set the timeout and the default for httpwebrequest what webclient uses is 100 seconds

1726749
webclient	webrequest
update i ve created a webhelper class that takes the place of webclient but provides more access to the necessary features of the underlying webrequest

1726777
integer	unsigned
you can remove the ambiguity by explicitly casting the integer indices to be unsigned so that no conversion is needed

1726783
width	height
one solution is to use the css style display inline-block - the link will then work much like an image - flow inline with text but also allow you to set a width height

1726787
put	get
if you were planning to put some bounds-checking in then i d say replace the conversion operators with getpointer functions since in general you don t want to implicitly convert a safe thing to an unsafe thing or do what std vector does which is that users get a pointer with

1726791
integer	unsigned
convert the operator to use int rather than unsigned int then you will get exact matches when integer literals or you can have two sets of operator

1726812
firefox	safari
again i have other pages using the same techniques that seem to be working fine unde msie and of course i see no problems in either firefox or safari whereever i ve tried it

1726815
post	get
i added c windows system32 inetsrv fcgiext.dll ext .php get head post

1726827
floating-point	integer
despite the fact that my go port used floating-point math versus integer math the results are impressive

1726860
google-chrome	firefox
also other browsers firefox google-chrome never quit asking for the password and show the errordocument

1726878
firefox	safari
i suspect that your firefox and safari users are not entering the domain before the username mydomain username

1726936
octal	hex	octal	binary	hex	binary
if you take a look at the pack manual pack is used to convert a string in hex octal binary to his number representation

1727027
free	strdup
please note you have to free all strdup strings after or you are going to create a memory leak

1727089
vb6	vba
learn vb6 or vba if you have a special need like programming microsoft access or creating vb scripts

1727091
maven	pom.xml
i m looking for a tool that given a maven pom.xml file tells me all the licenses that are used by the dependencies and recursively their dependencies

1727102
post	get
this post was a mouthful but i had to get it off my chest

1727128
post	get
just compare value sent by post or get with an array

switching	screens
i have a solution for 50 of the problem namely i have written the following applescript code to switching the location of the dock based upon my screens resolution but i have to manually invoke it

zlib	libpng
zlib libpng license

1727198
quicksort	mergesort
and yet most people use quicksort instead of mergesort

1727202
uiview	uiwindow	uiview	subviews
uiview objects are arranged within an uiwindow object in a nested hierarchy of subviews

1727202
children	parent
parent objects in the view hierarchy are called superviews and children are called subviews

1727244
disk	ram
as to whether it s faster or not the answer will depend upon a number of factors including the size of the file the disk drive speed and the amount of ram available

1727265
ant	maven
if you prefer you can edit property files in unicode and run native2ascii automatically as part of your build process in ant maven etc

1727299
mouse	keyboard
i find that i don t generally want to use the mouse in vim though as it takes my hands off the keyboard

1727368
int	chars
if you replace chars by int it saves one chars and still works but it s of questionable legality

1727383
width	height
if you don t want to subclass stuff you can use qt stylesheets to quickly set the height and width of your tabs like so

1727383
qtabwidget	qtabbar
note that the stylesheet refers to qtabbar even though we re calling setstylesheet on qtabwidget

1727441
uiview	subviews
you could try adding the uiwebview as a subviews of the main uiview in the controller

1727452
firefox	safari
disclaimer my experience with manifests and cache is all safari and firefox may handle some things differently

1727492
prng	random
let s see how you get your results random.getlong is called twice and then you remove some of the bits random bits the prng created

1727499
prng	random
from what i can tell the random class offers a prng with a cycle length of

1727542
jlist	jtree
that means giving jpanele its own jlist and jtree and so on

1727586
int	chars
in jpa 1.x it can be either a string this is the default a chars and an int

1727586
int	chars
if you d set the discriminator type to int or chars then you could write for the values 1 2 3 or a b c etc

1727592
gridview	repeater
now i need to get the imagepath from that the datatable serverpath and bind it in a repeater or gridview control and show the thumbnail images there

1727596
mktime	strftime
you can tie together mktime and strftime to do that

1727612
width	height
i know my width will be 180px but how can i get the height

1727670
hash	md5
i know of the md5 hash header that can be added

1727690
hash	md5
i m almost certain the answer is no but if you want to be extra paranoid you can precalculate the md5 hash before uploading compare that to the md5 hash you get after upload then when downloading calculate the md5 hash of the downloaded data and compare it to your stored hash

1727725
implements	extends
basically i don t see any benefit in using public class newfunctionality t extends oldfunctionality extends t in comparison with public class newfunctionality extends oldfunctionality public class filterbytype t extends list extends t vs public class filterbytype t implements list t

1727733
firefox	safari
currently there is an underline in firefox but not safari haven t looked at ie and the area bellow the img receives the background color on hover

1727734
gif	png	tiff	png
how can i check to see if the image is a png gif tiff and jpg and if so create the thumbnail and save it to the thumb file

1727748
punctuation	words
make sure you skip sequences of punctuation whitespace instead of counting extra words between them

1727782
pop-up	dialog
i ended up setting the iframe.src property to about blank initially and only set the source when the dialog actually pop-up

1727794
setinterval	settimeout
you can do this using settimeout or setinterval

1727796
implements	extends
assuming you know beforehand what the variable portion of the query is going to be you could use the template method pattern extends the plsqltemplate class and implements a set of abstract variable provider methods to return the specifics of the query

1727821
freemarker	velocity
you can use template engine like freemarker or velocity

1727854
servicebus	was
i was reading up on activemq which seems like a great implementation of a servicebus where producers can post messages and other processes can receive them

1727859
gdi	direct2d	gdi	directwrite	directwrite	direct2d
i recommend direct2d and directwrite as you get high-quality rendering that s also ridiculously fast compared to either gdi or anything done in the .net space

1727863
textmate	gedit
i d also give a gentle nudge into trying a text editor instead a full blown ide - i like textmate on os x and gedit on linux

1727868
hash	md5
md5 hash algorithm is designed so that a small change in the input results in a completely different hash so i would say that md5 hash bytes are distributed with equal probability i would not bet anything on it anyway

1727868
hash	md5
anyway you can apply a post-processing to your hash for example you can use keyed md5 to increase its randomness and to make it more secure by the way since plain md5 hash have been proved to be insecure

1727871
hash	md5
md5 hash are typically hexadecimals so there are 16 possible values for each byte

1727882
post	put
set the method to post and put your file contents into the body

1727918
dictionary	map
it s simpler than using a dictionary and conceptually cleaner as well as you don t really want to map keys to values

1727963
hash	md5
md5 isn t an ideal hash function as we know but the weaknesses are somewhat incidental here finding a collision on 4 bytes is well within the realm of a reasonable brute-force attack so there s no need to resort to cryptographic weaknesses

1727991
opera	safari
safari and opera don t like it

1728006
inherited	properties
the interest of the parent concept in maven 2 is to inherited properties dependencies configuration

1728011
put	get
to put it a different way implicit in the concept of callback is that you re going to seem to be called back in-the-same-thread how does this happen how does it get synchronized

1728065
put	get
i would get all the results put them in an array of ids and values

1728147
vsto	add-in
i am developing the add-in for the outlook 2007 using vsto

1728148
datalist	repeater
if you don t especially need a repeater to do this you can use a datalist instead and set the

1728171
inherited	properties
you need to inherited from form and override a couple of properties

1728229
.htaccess	httpd.conf
if file extension is .html then you should rename it to .php or add addhandler x-httpd-php html definition to httpd.conf or .htaccess

1728230
post	get
you will get one result in the post which will contain the selected value

1728231
vsto	add-in
we have a situation where we will have two vsto outlook add-in which both start off with some common shared code but the shared code will probably diverge over time

1728236
hibernate	gilead
if you want to go the hibernate way you should have a look at gilead or its predecessor hibernate4gwt

1728254
put	get
use regular expressions to get the name values from the json string and put them in the html

1728288
extjs	mootools
can anyone recommend me nice tooltip script which is javascript library independent meaning no help code from any of libraries such as jquery prototype scriptalicious mootools extjs etc.

1728297
mouse	keyboard
cover both onfocus and onmouseover - in cases of keyboard and mouse usage

1728330
ubuntu	linux
my target is linux ubuntu so platform specific answers are ok

1728338
hide	show
you may or may not wish to show hide the systray icon on minimise restore but i wouldn t recommend that because it would be weird behaviour unless you re also hiding from the taskbar

1728352
onmousedown	onmouseup
4 if the xy onmousedown xy onmouseup then assume a click event - so zoom

1728369
firefox	safari
when i drag a file from the desktop to the browser and i keep the browser in focus safari or firefox for now i know everything works right dragging having the app respond etc.

1728463
profiling	benchmarking
pear has a benchmarking library for php profiling

1728566
decoder	encoder
if there is a format there is usually an encoder decoder for it

1728658
cpu	processors
in theory if you are running on a multi-processor cpu then the threads could be run on different processors so the work is done in parallel but even then there is no point in having more threads than processors

1728697
cpython	ironpython
you can then use cpython jython or ironpython to run the library depending on which ide you are trying to integrate with

1728743
jstl	taglib
a commonly used taglib is jstl which provides the tag for exact this purpose

1728786
post	get
swap post for get if you re not

1728802
rsa	dsa
finally the pkcs #8 format is not too difficult to parse and the rsa dsa key pair objects are as per pkcs #11 and relatively easy to convert to a .net x509certificate once you figure out where all the bits go -- i actually did this in vb.net a while ago but unfortunately am not able to share that code

1728813
mp3	wav
one format like pcm encoded wav for recording and processing but compressed mp3 for storage

1728835
rpm	yum
if i use yum remove command or rpm -e command

1728835
folder	directory
but after installation my application automatically creates some extra folder in home directory

1728856
gridview	rowdatabound
you need to handle the rowdatabound event of your gridview

1728856
gridview	rowdatabound
this link demonstrates how to use the rowdatabound event to modify the value of a field in the data source before it is displayed in a gridview control

1728870
pop-up	dialog
for dialog always use in-page elements which are much more reliable and less annoying than window pop-up

1728892
hash	md5
at this hash size the weaknesses in md5 are pretty irrelevant since the best known attacks on md5 take roughly 2 32 computations while one can generate a collision in even an ideally secure 32-bit hash in around 2 16 computations since by merely choosing random inputs you have 1 in 2 16 chance of a collision so after roughly 2 16 random guesses you ll probably have found a colliding pair of inputs

1728916
versioning	upgrade
do we need to upgrade to a newer versioning

1728934
pull	push
i would like to access clone push pull a private via ssh git repository while behind a corporate firewall that only allows http proxy access

1728968
getter	setter
personally i would just re-expose the properties i am interested in perhaps putting them into a different - making sure to have both setter and getter

1728973
pop-up	dialog
my suggestion would actually be to add it to the help menu on your main form and possibly in some kind of very intrusive pop-up dialog

1728977
hash	md5
then form an md5 hash to compare with any new documents

1728978
passenger	thin
the provider allows for mongrel thin passenger fastcgi web servers which seems very flexible but i honestly don t know the differences between them

1728978
apache	nginx
i have looked at passenger on the surface - which does seem very appealing to me - but i was under the impression that passenger wasn t the actual webserver and instead was more like a layer on top of apache or nginx and managed spawned instances of the application like a mongrel cluster

1728992
interpolation	splines
i presume these are polynomial splines functions therefore you can actually interpolation your dataset near the edges with actual polynomes

1728992
interpolation	splines
solving this equations you ll get two polymones a1 x 2 + b1 x + c1 and a2 x 2 + b2 x + c2 which will be interpolation and smothly accessed to the splines funcion

1729008
background-color	transparency
this is accomplished by specifying the position and setting the background-color to transparency

1729019
getter	setter
for a property to be visible in the designer they have to be public properties with a getter and setter - from what you re saying the properties are only getter

1729039
apache	nginx
if you have a nix environment then passenger + nginx or apache is very popular as well which uses the standard ruby or ruby enterprise interpreter

1729055
apache	nginx
go with apache nginx + passenger

1729055
apache	nginx
additionally passenger is now available for both apache and nginx

1729055
apache	nginx
if you need better performance and scalability you can use nginx as a frontend proxy and forward all rails requests to multiple backend servers each one composed of apache + passenger

1729062
datarow	bindingsource
the datarow is part of a datatable which is bound to bindingsource that is bound to datagridview.datasource

1729070
getter	setter
however when i removed the getter and setter methods from an entity to have persistent fields the values for the corresponding instance variable was not retrieved from the database

1729073
post	get
if you spend the time to clearly define the parts of your upload-process-render architecture and you find that it can be applied to almost everything you are doing then all you need to do to make it a web service is define a clear 1-2-3 set of rules for using the system get post data etc.

1729074
apache	nginx
mongrel and thin are single ruby process servers that you would run multiple of as a cluster behind some type of proxy like apache or nginx

1729074
apache	nginx
passenger creates an interface between apache or nginx that creates an application spawning process and then forks out processes to server up incoming requests as they come in

1729100
onmousedown	onmouseup	onmousedown	onkeydown	onmousedown	onkeyup	onchange	onkeydown	onchange	onkeyup	onkeyup	onmouseup	onkeyup	onkeydown	onkeydown	onmouseup
i can record all things happening onkeyup onkeydown onmousedown onmouseup using textarea cursor position and keys information and make it cross-browser some time later but i can t handle things like pasting using mouse right button and selecting paste or pasting from the menu i can handle onchange but i will have no information is it pasted or already recorded as pressed keys and it fires only after focus change

1729130
getter	setter
anyway just create protected getter and setter methods as a workaround if your provider needs that

1729140
getter	setter
while on persistence property there is a getter and a setter method for each property

1729152
implements	extends
the class they extends provides a number of abstract methods which they must implements one of which is called updateaction and is automatically invoked at set intervals

1729193
docx	.doc
the resulting .doc file was 2725kb or 2697kb as docx

1729209
width	height
canvas width and height should be set as html attributes and not in the stylesheet

1729258
pop-up	dialog
on your server instance expand security- logins and right click on the correct login to pop-up the properties dialog

1729266
hide	show
the show password button can hide the password field and show the text field and copy the value of the password field into the text field

1729271
client-side	server-side
this procedure involves server-side as well as client-side programming but can be accomplished easily

1729275
explode	htmlspecialchars
have you tried adding htmlspecialchars to the explode

1729275
explode	htmlspecialchars
sex explode boom htmlspecialchars s

1729290
pascal	delphi
and free pascal is a delphi compatible pascal compiler for amongst others linux platforms

1729303
super	implements
to be serializable to implements the serializable interface either directly or through one of its super classes

1729303
getter	setter
to that you can add getter and setter for properties of the class that conform to a specific naming convention if you want the fields to be discoverable in certain circumstances making that class some object you can drag and drop from a visual editor in your ide for example

1729370
range	infinity
a null endpoint would mean that the range goes to infinity in that direction

1729479
put	get
simply put its good practise but i would say don t get too hung up on getting 100 right all the time brain power is better spend on other problems than arguing over weather a dl is better than a ul for a given problem etc

1729498
vb6	vba
learn vb6 if you have to deal with legacy application or one of the microsoft office applications that still use vba

1729498
vb.net	vb6
even then the syntax between vb.net and vb6 is close enough to make the transition easy

1729498
vb.net	vb6
the main issue of switching between vb6 and vb.net is the support libraries

1729502
phpunit	simpletest
i would recommend phpunit for your testing as it seems to be the most complete package for php imho many are fans of simpletest as well .

1729518
post	get
get edit page renders available products user selects them and then submitted post edit action picks selected from selectedproducts

1729737
opera	firefox
some browsers will display a warning message firefox the others will just do it quietly looking at opera

1729737
post	get
in order to avoid this you need to assure the page the user is getting is the result of a get request not post

1729749
interpolation	splines
splines interpolation

1729762
cpu	hyperthreading
now its as if my pentium cpu has two cores i bet its the hyperthreading

1729782
phong	shading
for simple shading you can stick with drawing triangles using gdi but if you want to do gouraud or phong shading the colour values vary across a triangle

1729791
ironruby	ironpython
the specific example i have in mind is writing an application in c# but using ironruby or ironpython to write the tests

1729791
ironruby	ironpython
as i see it using ironpython and ironruby have several advantages over c# code as a testing language

1729806
innodb	myisam
we know that myisam is faster than innodb when we don t have many concurrent updates inserts

1729826
ant	maven
currently i will have to call an ant task from maven as follows

1729860
hide	show
it should hide or show tooltip on each button click

1729860
hide	show
now the weird thing going on is when i click on the hide button it hide itself and when i click on show nothing happens

1729861
strsplit	substr
one suggestion there was to use readchar and then do string manipulation on the result with strsplit and substr

1729887
width	height
i have an image with the value x width and y height

1729897
hide	show
if you hide it with code placed in an external css file you will not be able to show it again with javascript

1729922
width	height
let then given any new height y in your case 60 px to find the new width x

1729926
width	height
i assume you want the width after the rescale to relate to the height in the same way it did before the rescale you want the aspect ratio to remain constant

1729948
jruby	mri
similarly with ruby you could ask about the difference between ruby and python or jruby and mri but the difference between ruby and jruby doesn t make sense

1730017
filtering	grouping	sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping
as a general rule you should let the database management system handle filtering grouping and sorting that you need

1730039
ironruby	ironpython
i would love to see the situation improve as both ironruby and ironpython mature but right now the testing c# story isn t so good

1730104
jtextpane	jeditorpane
a jtextpane or jeditorpane will do this for you automatically without the need for the above code

1730134
post	get
i on the other hand am looking for something that would just render a view without having to post get and generates me a simple string that i can send off through my email code

1730148
ant	maven
there is no official plugin for integrate ice with maven you can use ant and slice2java ant task

1730148
ant	maven
i not maven expert but seems that maven could run ant task maven antrun plugin - usage

1730149
min	max
i am using views to extract last months max val and last months min val

1730167
lisp	scheme
my first lisp learning experience was with scheme i ve never touched common lisp felt it was too complex and am now starting on clojure

1730167
lisp	scheme
i m no experienced schemer but i d say that if you immediately start with clojure you will still get the general lisp experience so you definitely won t be missing that by forgoing scheme

1730236
asp.net-mvc	openrasta
i ve recently found an interesting alternative to the asp.net asp.net-mvc that i currently do static htmls with advanced javascript doing service calls most examples use openrasta

1730251
int	chars
same for your other declarations chars c int len etc.

1730251
for-loop	loops
if you haven t talked about this loops in your class yet you don t have to use and you should know how the simple for-loop works as well but this is just a suggestion

1730255
int	chars
as you can see in the code above i assign an int to a chars

1730263
innodb	myisam
2 with only 2-3 tps you will not see any significant difference between innodb and myisam

1730298
children	parent
i thought it made sense to give the parent entity its own table and give each of the children their own tables - a table-per-subclass structure

1730317
innodb	myisam
say you have 16g of ram you would probably want to use about 12g for an innodb buffer pool provided you have no myisam tables

1730317
innodb	myisam
likewise if you have only myisam tables you probably want to turn innodb off completely and give a bit less than half say 6g to your myisam key cache

1730317
innodb	myisam
it is a massive over simplification in some cases and plain wrong in others to say we know that myisam is faster than innodb

1730317
innodb	myisam
if you ve tuned innodb properly for your server and are running proper server-grade hardware innodb should be able to compete with myisam on most queries excluding full table scans but you re not doing many of those right

1730317
innodb	myisam
if you find that innodb is much slower for inserts updates bear in mind that it offers a much better level of durability - if you tune it for approximately the same durability as myisam then you ll see good performance hopefully

1730352
folder	directory
i think you can just #include the files that you need from the main folder you will have to make it accessible from all the sites using soft links will cause the server to think they are in each site s directory

1730357
int	chars
in c assigning an int to a chars is legal

1730434
pwd	chdir
when i try a chdir with a filehandle as argument chdir returns 0 and a pwd returns still the same directory

1730453
firefox	safari
for firefox 3.5 and safari

1730453
opera	google-chrome
svg fonts for opera iphone google-chrome

1730495
width	height
the problem is that the a element has been made a block by the css so that it appears at the correct height and width

1730495
button	checkbox
so what i m looking for is the checkbox to appear immediately to the right of the element but without having to completely muck up the styling of the button

1730495
button	checkbox
absolute positioning of the checkbox using the known size of the button seems wrong and dirty

1730500
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
if you want to throw an exception but you can t change the method specification you need to use an unchecked-exception like runtimeexception

1730512
firefox	safari
for firefox 3.5 and safari

1730512
opera	google-chrome
svg fonts for opera iphone google-chrome

1730515
vbscript	vb6
vbscript has no concept of a collection object so to create a collection object to pass to our api we built a vb6 activex dll that provides a createcollection method

1730516
uitableview	uisearchbar
this view has a uisearchbar and uitableview

1730535
button	checkbox
the easiest possible way to get the checkbox beside the button while preserving the button s block styling would be to set the button s display property to inline-block

1730636
monodevelop	sharpdevelop
if you feel that visual studio is expensive you can try the express editions or go for monodevelop or sharpdevelop

1730638
width	margin
turns out that the width of my center content margin was dictated by margins instead of just a direct width ie

1730643
ostringstream	std
by including sstream you can use std ostringstream and build a message using the iostream library

1730648
monodevelop	sharpdevelop
you could use sharpdevelop or monodevelop though if you don t want to use visual studio

1730656
draggable	droppable
i have the td with a class called droppable that accepts draggable classes

1730659
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this code works fine in ie but it doesn t work in any other browser tried it in google-chrome firefox and safari

1730676
scrollable	panels
or you can create a custom panels and implement the scrollable interface

1730702
lisp	scheme
with this in mind the direct translation of scheme into common lisp gives

1730731
titlebar	window
when the app first starts the titlebar of the minimized window is visible just above the start menu

1730748
beyondcompare	winmerge
winmerge and beyondcompare are both mentioned in that thread but we re mainly interested in diffs

1730753
ftpwebresponse	ftpwebrequest
for what it s worth the system.net namespace has the ftpwebrequest and ftpwebresponse classes beginning in .net 2.0

1730783
children	parent
the parent supertype takes care of allocating a new id value and the children only reference that value

1730795
subnet	packets
every host on the subnet receives all mdns query packets and responds to the ones for their host name

1730796
post	get
if you post the same in load event the window does get minimized but still shows minimized on the desktop

1730806
vsto	add-in
my current project had done similar code sharing between vsto add-in for word

1730806
vsto	add-in
getting a vsto add-in into gac with an msi installer

1730820
beyondcompare	winmerge
i m a very visually inclined person and i prefer araxis merge s visual representation over winmerge and beyondcompare

1730859
width	height
that is i d expect to find functions with signatures of something like movewindow cgwindowid winid int x int y resizewindow cgwindowid winid int width int height activatewindow cgwindowid winid cgwindowid getcurrentlyactivatedwindow

1730863
postgresql	mysql
my general thoughts on foreign keys is that they re great but not usable in mysql and that postgresql handles them much better

1730871
nsdata	nsstringencoding
- nsdata datausingencoding nsstringencoding encoding

1730892
accessor	properties
as bryan said you expose a ui element as a properties via synthesize or a hand-coded accessor when you need to access it from outside a given instance of that class

1730915
innodb	myisam
as others pointed out note that both tables need to be innodb tables foreign key constraints are not supported by the myisam storage engine that will ignore them

1730944
qlistwidget	qwidget
i ve created a new qt designer form class in which i have one qlistwidget and one qwidget

1730992
many-to-many	many-to-one
it is also possible for users to misinterpret an e-r data model and produce multiplied numbers in cases where there are many-to-one or many-to-many relationships

1731024
apl	algol
remember that sql was originally designed as a user interface language that s why it looks vaguely like english and not at all like other languages of that era algol c apl prolog

1731027
firefox	safari
on firefox and safari the text is unfortunately darkened

firefox	safari
the hack above where i put the text into a different div tricked ie into displaying white text over the different-colored backgrounds but the same trick didn t work on firefox and safari

1731037
width	height
you need to specify width height on the bordercontainer itself in pixels

1731075
accessor	ivar
if there is no accessor then the ivar will be set directly using the obj-c runtime functions to find it by name

1731075
accessor	ivar
the accessor will be faster since you ll avoid all the slogging through the runtime to find the ivar in question

1731075
accessor	ivar	accessor	properties
the main reason why you would want an accessor for an outlet is the same as for any other ivar or properties you want to publish

1731182
hash	md5
you can take a look at sha hash for an alternative to md5

1731206
salt	md5
you may want to consider using a salt in conjunction with md5

1731209
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
in cocoa touch we have uiviewcontroller and its subclass uinavigationcontroller

1731230
hash	salt
if it s for passwords hashing consider using salt hash instead of just brute hashing the password

1731236
hash	md5
nobody is going to brute force your md5 hash the problem will be dictionary attacks agains known hash values rainbow tables

1731236
hash	hmac	hash	salt
and the protection is to use an hmac hash or something similar like a salt hash

1731255
post	get
i have seen some post using scope_identity and identity functions to get the current id

1731261
vim	emacs	vim	kate	emacs	kate
under goroot misc there are syntax highlighting files for emacs vim xcode and kate

1731263
accessor	properties
so following that logic if your mass properties retains and properly releases its value and it will if you use synthesize or follow proper accessor setter examples it s handling its own business just fine

1731271
post	get
this will allow you to build an http request from scratch which will allow you to include the data to post to the url you specify and get a response back

1731281
vim	emacs
i ll see your vim and raise you one emacs

1731301
cdr	cons
this function will build a cons cell with the first argument as its car and the second argument as its cdr

1731301
width	height
this way you can quote the symbols you want to appear literally like width and height and evaluate the symbols whose values you need like my-frame-width and my-frame-height

1731302
single-quotes	double-quotes
mysql s default mode allows you to use single-quotes and double-quotes interchangeably and back-quotes for delimited identifiers

1731302
prepare	execute
so here s code to prepare an associative array and pass it to execute

1731306
hash	md5
to answer question 2 the following two blocks have the same md5 hash

1731325
stdout	stderr
you need to capture stdout stderr from the process concurrently or you run the risk of the process blocking

1731331
rss	feed
translates your feed on-the-fly into a format rss or atom compatible with your visitors feed reader application

1731337
pop-up	dialog
however i want to share some common code between them say for example code that handles an action after a pop-up dialog etc

1731351
urllib	httplib
you could send an http head request using httplib instead of doing the http get that your urllib code does

1731377
uiview	subviews
i ve added a uibutton rounded rect to a uiview subclass dialogview which is a subviews of my view controller s view

1731441
post	get
i understand this kind of data need to be submitted using post instead of get but that s how scriptmanager works so would like to get solution by extending this limit

1731480
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
while c# is case sensitive these constructs in asp.net are case-insensitive because much in html is case insensitive at least in html4 -- xhtml is case-sensitive or course

1731498
put	get
third take your whole set of conditionals and put it into a function to get your current state and replace in your function calls

1731527
draggable	droppable
this works because the event is fired first droppable rather than draggable

1731592
put	get
i m not sure how this will translate to sharepoint but for normal asp.net pages i typically put a script like this in the head to get client ids

1731637
onfocus	onblur
i am thinking i might have to use combination of events like onfocus and onblur

1731665
children	parent
closest doesn t work because it searches in the the element itself and it s parent and you need to search inside it s children

1731682
folder	directory
both project folder are in directory c so i think that should be the correct relative path based on the documentation

1731685
post	get
use php s filter_input to get at the post variables

1731702
post	get
for a simpler way to download web resources directly you could go with urllib2 but urllib2 only supports get or post methods no head so you end up downloading the whole resource

1731869
post	get
thank you to lyle and his post reply that helped me get started on this article

1731869
integer	fractions
changing ubercart to accept fractions quantities means the datatype of some table columns must be changed from integer to float m d

1731912
rss	feed
one thing i was considering is periodically downloading the rss feed of bbc news and parsing the content using the yahoo term extractor

1731944
rss	feed
i used this ages ago to query some data from visual sourcesafe and build an rss feed from the changelog and it worked quite well

1731960
post	get
does that post back get dropped at the server side or client side

1732026
superclass	subclassing
subclassing know everything the superclass knows

1732121
client-side	server-side
i ve checked the java library a bit further and i think that its providing everything required for client-side and server-side code

1732153
translation	localization
personally i would keep anything national outside the java source and use the localization features to look up translation strings for simple keys and they are placed in your java code

1732193
cpu	hyperthreading
for hyperthreading 50 cpu usage is roughly equal to 100 usage

1732281
width	height
this can be done by keeping width and height variables and accessing the indices as such

1732320
ant	maven
you can t easily use maven as a drop-in replacement for ant and gradually adopt more advanced features

1732320
ant	maven
maven s big win is using it to manage your dependencies in a rational way and if you want to do that in maven and do everything else in ant you can

1732320
maven	pom.xml
you now have a classpath object named maven.classpath which contains all the maven dependencies defined in the pom.xml file

1732320
ant	maven
all you need is to put the maven ant tasks jar in your ant s lib directory

1732320
ant	maven
first maven is a much younger tool than ant or make so you have to expect that its going to take time to get to the maturity level of those applications

1732320
maven	pom.xml
for version ranges i recommend working on a plugin that will produce a temporary pom.xml with locked versions for all direct and transitive dependencies and make it part of the maven release lifecycle

1732375
mouse	keyboard
when i connect to my vnc server i am able to see the mouse keyboard movement at the vnc server from my vnc viewer

1732378
hide	show
for example when a user clicks a details button on some product i want to hide the main and show the containing the details for the product

1732385
button	checkbox
however as the other answers have stated you might want to consider using checkbox instead since radio button aren t really meant for this sort of thing

1732402
lvm	xfs
not sure if you re using lvm ext3 xfs or what but if you re on lvm you might want to checkout the dmsetup man page

1732465
post	get	children	parent
i have a parent child table simple tree table structure id parentid where i want to delete and get the id of all children for a given parent id - similar to this post sql server cascade delete and parent child table

1732475
lxml	libxslt	lxml	libxml2	libxml2	libxslt
lxml uses the full power of libxml2 and libxslt but wraps them in more pythonic bindings than the python bindings that are native to those libraries

1732500
width	height
this has the benefit of allowing you to specify both width and height while allowing the image to still scale proportionally

1732553
updatepanel	ascx
the ascx control is in an updatepanel

1732603
width	height
only the image s height is set on the image so that it can take all the vertical space available while its width is left undefined and i expect the width to scale accordingly with its height

1732603
width	height
for example if the image s original size is 800x600 and if the hbox is 300 in height then image height will scale down to 300 however its width doesn t scale down to 400 instead it stays at 800

1732618
getter	setter
the only thing i can see that i would change is to remove the private field in foopresenter and stick with just the property with a public getter and private setter

1732643
serializable	deserialization
ok the context is some serializable deserialization code that will parse a byte stream into an object representation that s easier to work with and vice-versa

1732663
width	height
maintaining the aspect ratio implies keeping the relation between width height

1732695
getter	setter
just including something like a getter setter definition in a block of javascript code will immediately give a syntax error in ie before you could sniff for their availability

1732717
qfile	qdir	qfileinfo	qdir
i looked at qdir qfile qfileinfo -- nothing

1732720
post	put
these are compatible with solving the problem using the dynamic programming solution i put up in a later post

1732727
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
gives same result as window.scrollmaxy with ie7 ie8 ff3.5 safari 4 opera 10 google-chrome 3 under doctype xhtml 1.0 transitional

1732738
set	bag
this would happen if you didn t have cascade save-update on your set bag

1732752
get	http-post
i am using an http-post rather than the default get

1732804
yacc	bison
projects that use flex lex for tokenizing typically use yacc bison for the actual parsing

1732818
put	get
you can use a guid to get 128 bits which will put the problem off for a while but ultimately you will need to add additional fields

1732834
jython	jacl
for example in websphere there is an admin console and the jndi resources can be added manually and saved or using jacl jython script out the addition of the necesary jndi resources

1732837
firefox	safari
the page functions beautifully in ie and in firefox but safari gives

1732845

1732858
copying	overwrite
i want to overwrite functionality of copying selected data using these 3 methods to copying desired data to clipboard

1732881
width	height
the size of a font determines its height not its width

1732881
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
adding that at the end of your svg and adding the appropriate element ids works in opera 10 firefox 3.5 and safari 4.0 at least

1732930
put	get
for starters you ll get a large degree of code reuse since you ll be able to put other front ends on top of the restful service

1732950
nswindowcontroller	nsviewcontroller
in the case you present the nswindowcontroller subclass would instantiate the nsviewcontroller subclass passing it the appropriate view nib and then attach the nsviewcontroller s view property to the window s view hierarchy

1732953
width	height
and then add all of your content to a div which has 100 width height have to do this with javascript

1732984
pull	push
i m looking for a server push technology rather than client pull

1732995
inherited	properties
datacontext propagates down the visual tree so the tabcontrol inherited the same datacontext as the containing mainwindow. so you can just reference that properties by name

1733001
createfile	deviceiocontrol
you can use things like createfile and deviceiocontrol to handle this but it s not going to be as easy as it sounds

1733020
width	height
you can try setting the padding instead of the height width

1733021
width	height
what i can think of is to stretch either width or height and let it resize in ratio-aspect

1733033
children	parent
normally when i execute a maven build like mvn install or whatever maven will run all the goals for the parent project before proceeding with the children

1733033
children	parent
i want to be able to define a goal that runs on the parent but not until all of the children have been processed

1733040
uisegmentedcontrol	uibutton
the solution to this is to 1 create the uisegmentedcontrol with all its buttons etc. and then 2 create a uibutton using the initializer and provide the segmented control as the variable to this

1733041
jar	war
if the tomcat app server is looking for the jdbc driver jar it won t find it in the war

1733045
postgresql	mysql
this was before the existance of mysql or postgresql when minisql a free-to-use but not free software database was still in common use or big money databases such as oracle

1733129
for-loop	arrays
i am having some trouble creating a for-loop within a constructor to iterate over a map and an arrays at the same time

1733208
regasm	tlbexp
attribute to prevent regasm tlbexp

button	checkbox
when the submit button is pressed a query is run on the dbase that pulls up a list of actors based upon the nations selected and creates a new checkbox list below the first one

1733345
spaces	delimiter
now the list should have every number delimiter by a comma and extra spaces removed

1733359
width	margin
try adding another css class for the second and setting a width on that as well as setting the width of the .info_row to accommodate the total margin and both asp labels span tags sizes

1733399
folder	directory
i assume the directory you are trying to delete is within the website folder

1733409
ubuntu	debian
from what i understand though i m not sure exactly why at all debian from which ubuntu is derived uses a dist-packages naming scheme instead of site-packages

1733409
ubuntu	debian
terminology python has packages and debian and so ubuntu has packages

1733416
pop-up	dialog
you can could a pop-up window that is styled to look like a dialog but pop-up windows are likely to have various user blocks etc

1733458
hex	binary
since these are actually binary files is there a way to see the binary instead of the hex

1733458
hex	binary
i instead would like to see the actual binary instead of a interpretation in hex

1733486
many-to-many	many-to-one
in an abstract kind of way you might consider the relationships between tables in a relational database schema a kind of design pattern 1-to-many many-to-one many-to-many one-to-one

1733528
sudo	passwd
i would guess that sudo is expecting an interactive terminal in order to ask for a passwd

1733555
octal	hex	octal	binary	hex	binary
hex and octal are close enough to binary

1733587
arp	tcp
your description suggests that the peer arp entries expire between tcp segments and cause some subsequent segments to fail due to the lack of a current mac destination

1733646
hide	show
i want to hide or show a column based on variable data from a users selection

1733651

i have put effort in and completed everything in the form that the instructor taught but i must have misunderstood when he went over the part of the lecture covering the set and get methods

1733651
post	put
i didn t put it all in the first post to be able to break things down into steps can t read in a file if you haven t created it

1733651
implements	extends
public class readpayrollfile extends jframe implements actionlistener windowlistener

1733675
accessor	properties
and if you want to access an specific element by key you can use also here the square bracket properties accessor

1733677
width	height
set the swf to 100 width height of the wrapper div then use js to resize the wrapper div not the object itself

1733713
client-side	server-side
answer is yes you can try calling a server-side function from a client-side script

1733713
client-side	server-side
extend asp.net ajax client-side function - the server-side way

1733713
client-side	server-side
asp.net 2.0 client-side features bring server-side power to the client

1733754
pull	push
another advantage of mercurial is that you can push and pull updates from your peer without disturbing the main repository

1733754
pull	push
a common scenario is when 2 developers are working together on a story and they can push pull from each other while the story is work in progress

1733783
folder	directory
i have this piece of code which copies a plist file to the applicationsupport directory in the users folder

1733784
hide	show
you can also use the show and hide functions rather than play with the css of the element or even toggle if you show hide the same element

1733787
maven	cargo
for jboss you could try the maven cargo plugin

1733789
portrait	landscape
i don t know if the statusbar would have a proper behavior and i let a lot of details for you to sort out but in any case i think it would be a nice idea to have two separate controllers one showed in landscape the other the tabbar in portrait

1733803
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
then to do a case-insensitive file open you split the pathname into components search the in-memory tree using case-insensitive search bulid the real case-sensitive pathname and use that to do the file open

1733805
maven	cargo
so far i have found ejb3unit jakarta cactus retired 2011 08 and the maven cargo plugin

mergesort	heapsort	quicksort	heapsort	quicksort	mergesort
wikipedia told me to use mergesort as it s the only one of the three common general-purpose sorting algorithms heapsort mergesort and quicksort which performs well when random-access is slow and even provided a link to simon tatham s implementation

1733882
implements	extends
you can extends the extension point org.eclipse.ui.startup and implements org.eclipse.ui.istartup to check the command line arguments and invoke your own command

1733964
post	get
currently i create an object and use its setters to set the get post data received from client

1733966
stdout	stderr
you must read out the stderr and stdout streams of the started process else it will hang when the os-specific bufffer for it is filled

1733968
svnadmin	visualsvn	collabnet	svn
i had both collabnet svn server and visualsvn installed and was getting errors until i made sure i was using the version of svnadmin that came with visualsvn which i had used to create the repositories

1734021
stdout	stderr
you need to read stdout and stderr to capture all process output and do this concurrently to prevent blocking of the spawned process

1734050
unsigned	short	int	chars	int	double
several convenience type definitions are declared qreal for double uchar for unsigned chars uint for unsigned int ulong for unsigned long and ushort for unsigned short

1734105
post	get
but to further increase security you might consider sending the username and password with post instead of concatenating them to the url with a get request

1734108
post	get
you need to send this using post instead of get currently you are using get

1734153
internationalization	localization
gettext is the gnu internationalization and localization i18n library

1734153
internationalization	localization
it has been developed as a tool for i18n and l10n internationalization and localization but - exactly because of this it has plenty of functions to deal with plural forms given that other languages might have much more complex ways of forming plurals than english does

1734171
haskell	scheme
there is a haskell tutorial where you write a scheme in what they claim is 48 hrs

1734186
udp	tcp
all of us who still do some kind of network programming tcp udp dns or client server in c repeatedly use some code snippets again and again

1734240
ant	cruisecontrol
overall this was a good learning experience even though i did it on a contract job that used ant and cruisecontrol to publish documents

1734276
mergesort	timsort
the business-end of timsort is a mergesort that operates on runs of pre-sorted elements

1734276
timsort	in-place

1734329
hide	show
you can set callback for jquery show and hide methods

1734364
octal	decimal	octal	binary
now you can type hexadecimal numbers hit f5 and switch between decimal f6 octal f7 and binary f8

1734373
cvs	svn
i read that the files should either be tracked by cvs and svn or there should be a mainfest.in

1734373
cvs	svn
i use neither cvs nor svn i use git

1734399
super	abstract
you can t have an abstract constructor in java so unless you can put all the calculation into the call to super you can t do what you d like to do with the current design as a final variable must be assigned by the time the declaring constructor has completed

1734399
public	protected
you could then make the constructors not public maybe protected and then the only way the objects can be created is via your factory methods

1734405
pull	push
since all of them have processes running using those settings i never want to push instead i d like for each of them to track the other two and pull only when i m logged in

1734412
icefaces	woodstock
netbeans used to do that but with the deprecation of woodstock rather merging with icefaces and with icefaces not supporting visual web project it is difficult to choose netbeans now 1

1734459
getter	setter
you could write an interface which exposes all properties of your class with getter and setter and a second interface which only exposes the getter for all your properties

1734550
gif	png
you can convert image types using the imagecreatefromjpeg png gif and imagejpeg png gif functions

1734576
post	get
take a look at the end of this blog post to get started

firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
this will work in ie and safari i think but not in opera or firefox as they haven t implemented the click event for file upload elements - edit yet

1734609
gtk	cairo
with gtk it s more common to use cairo already mentioned by jeff foster

1734692
rss	feed
disregarding the javascript question which would you use for your website and rss feed

1734709
rss	feed
second for my rss xml feed which

1734726
onresume	onpause
a trick i used in one scenario was to have each activity notify the service in onpause and onresume

1734726
onresume	onpause
the service would monitor these and if it got an onpause without a subsequent onresume in some period of time it was assumed the user was gone home incoming phone call incoming text message responding to some app via a notification etc.

1734772
mkdir	chdir
git init learned to mkdir chdir into a directory when given an extra argument git init this

1734777
int	chars	int	double
so to distil my problems how can i work on int or floating point data through chars pointers and specifically how could i rectify the above example to work with a double precision data

1734896
min	max	min	median	median	max
in other words i need r to run the summary statistics for variable1 capture the min median and max values and write those alone to an output text file

1734896
min	max	min	median	median	max
in this example the output file should contain only one line with the values 1.00 2.00 4.00 the min median and max values

1734930
hash	salt
salt and hash

1734930
hash	salt
we typically use a random guid as the salt and then sha512 to hash

fseek	ftell
unless there is specific reason to do it fopen fseek ftell is a better idea portable staying within the c standard library

1735000
profiling	instrumentation
i would also like to use instrumentation to profiling and find memory leaks

1735021
hide	show
when the link is clicked hide show the appropriate content

1735030

hide	show
alternatively you could just hide show them as appropriate rather than copying content

1735061
int	chars
the file is full of structs of evaluacion type including some chars and int variables

objectdatasource	detailsview
here s an example illustrating how to use an objectdatasource with a detailsview

1735122
division	multiplication
multiplication is less expensive than division so

1735129
matplotlib	scipy
use python along with numpy scipy and matplotlib packages

1735149
short	base
a short explanantion to click on this link - liskov substitution principle is that if you have a base class base and subclasses sub1 and sub2 the rest of your code should always refer to base and not sub1 and sub2

1735153
width	height
a classic example of breaking the rule as far as i remember is derivin square from rectangle since square can t have both width and height - because setting one would change another and thus it s no more conforms to rectangle rules

1735169
tablelayout	margins
it s definitely not a popular opinion but i m done with my tablelayout in 20 minutes while the css gurus spend hours tweaking line-height margins padding and floats just to do something as basic as vertically centering a paragraph

1735190
sqldatasource	detailsview
i list 10 user fields in the detailsview that uses the sqldatasource

1735349
debian	linux
i m running under a debian linux 2.6.26 kernel

1735350
abc	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
if a client is using a superclass abc with a method something int i then the client should be able to substitute any subclassing of abc without problems

1735350
abc	subclassing
if our something method in the abc base class above has a relaxed precondition that permits any integer then all subclassing of abc must also permit any integer

1735350
abc	subclassing
in reverse if the base abc class something method has a postcondition - such as guaranteeing it will never return a value of zero - then all subclassing must also obey that same postcondition or they violate the liskov substitution principle promising less

1735357
firefox	safari
in firefox and safari brief testing this prevents the page from moving down to the correct and just shows the very top of the page i want it to show the just posted comment

1735371
openbsd	linux
mmap_min_addr is currently a hot topic due to a related exploit and a public flame toward linus of linux fame obviously from theo de raadt of the openbsd effort

1735372
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it seems to do this in firefox safari google-chrome and ie at least ie8

1735378
free	malloc
if all your application does all day long is malloc one 8 byte chunk in thread a and free it in thread b and doesn t need to handle anything else at all you could probably write a memory allocator that beats the pants off any of those listed so far

1735378
free	malloc
most of the other allocators mentioned are designed as drop-in malloc free new delete replacements that can be ld_preload d

1735378
free	malloc
if you re constantly malloc free ing objects that are all the same size you might want to just write a simple slab allocator

1735397
unix	solaris
this should work fine on solaris unix also just remove win refs

1735413
xna	slimdx
if you just want to learn and become more comfortable with the graphics pipeline you should check out slimdx and xna

1735432
ssl	https
i used this ssl library for a small https server in busybox

1735526
rsa	dsa
it s written in c supports rsa and dsa along with a host of other algorithms and is public domain software

1735531
serializable	deserialization
the logic for serializable has to be shared too it is not unusual for an object to handle its own serializable deserialization

1735542
put	get
first get the current contents of the input and remove the last character then put the modified string back

1735554
firefox	safari
this seems to work in safari and probably firefox too but i haven t tested it in ie

1735581
inherited	properties
invoked as a constructor via the new keyword it is the newly instantiated object which inherited from the object stored in function s own prototype properties

1735585
opera	firefox
tip use the internet explorer developer tools firefox s firebug or opera s dragonfly to tweak the styling attributes in you page

1735602
qlist	qmap	qstring	qlist	qstring	qmap
if you are open to looking into qt you might want to try out their containers like qlist qmap and the very cool qstring

1735602
qstring	qlist
qlist qstring list

1735640
free	malloc
i am trying to get comfortable with malloc + free

1735644
postgresql	mysql
using mysql postgresql

1735666
clang	llvm
the major downside to using objective-c++ is increased compile times objective-c++ is even worse than c++ and the clang llvm compiler doesn t handle objective-c++ yet

1735677
ubuntu	debian
a list which includes file extensions which i find useful is the one included as etc mime.types in debian ubuntu

1735701
free	malloc
virtual memory is an abstraction on top of physical memory and malloc free provide an abstraction on top of that

1735701
free	malloc
free just releases parts of the heap allocated by malloc

1735707
min	max
a is obviously not the correct container for this task as it requires a search on every item to check if inserttime lies between the min and max values

1735725
min	max
if so is your friend - provide an which compares by inserttime and binarysearch for min and max

1735725
min	max
you ll need to create dummy timestampedtrackid objects with an inserttime values of min and max in order to search for them.

1735725
range	max	range	min	min	max
also remember that if multiple items can have the same inserttime you ll need to work backwards from the min index and forwards from the max index to make sure you get the full range

1735799
put	get
so i d recommend instead or in addition to project efficiency tracking to track developers efficiency satisfaction team efficiency satisfaction and try to solve how to re-balance efforts not only because of roi but to get most from people at least unless projects are profitable not to put roi estimations over all

1735817
rss	feed
i found this reference extracting peopleâ s names from rss feed using wordnet

1735827
mouse	keyboard
a grouped product should be a set of different products such as a computer monitor keyboard and mouse

1735874
hide	show
what i want to do now is to use jquery to do something simple like show hide a tag etc

1735887
firefox	safari
fyi - i just tested this in firefox and safari on a mac

1735933
rtp	rtsp
i m building a web app that should play back an rtsp rtp stream from a server

1735944
free	malloc
one example would be capturing malloc free

1735949
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works in firefox google-chrome safari and ie 8

1735986
rss	feed
you can download and parse an rss feed in under 10 lines of code

1735989
codeigniter	yii
the ones i used so far codeigniter and yii do work magic but have safeguards

1736040
ostream	ostringstream
trying to reconfigure your ostream to make the formatting come out as you want won t work because the default value just gets converted to a string in a standalone ostringstream inside lexical_cast

1736067
atoi	atof	printf	atoi	printf	atof
1 manual parsing using printf atof atoi for instance

1736069
strtol	atoi
depending on which crt implementation you re using you may have wide atoi strtol functions

1736121
np-hard	np-complete
virtually everywhere when you want to load your agent with optimal job schedule or when you want to build a route through all vertexes in the graph or when you feel that you need to look for a longest path you most likely run into an np-complete or an np-hard problem

1736157
hash	md5
which shows a class that creates md5 and sha256 hash from arbitrary data

1736216
width	height
as far as occupying the entire window you can see in firebug that the sample site has bound a function to window.resize refigure which sets the height and width of each frame to the size of the window

1736222
subnet	packets
if i have a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 then does the router make 254 packets for every packets sent ot the broadcast address

1736222
arp	dhcp
of course some essential protocols arp dhcp rely on broadcast multicast addresses to function and won t be blocked by default

1736230
hex	binary
pasting as a string is probably not the best way to view arbitrary binary data - you could use a hex editor component or some other visualiser to give you a better view of the data

1736273
post	put
i ve seen this done better with a decorator over the view but this was the dirty hack i put in middleware to copy the post into cookie before the session middleware runs to restore the session

1736292
std	ostream
the fact is cout is an instance of std ostream which has a lot of functionality built into it which is necessary for interoperability with other classes that overload the iostream operators

1736308
cout	cin
i remember many times when my solution didn t make it before the time limit just because of cin cout while printf scanf did work

1736328
cout	cin
before using std cout cin unless of course you mix stdio and iostream in your program which is a bad thing to do

1736344
put	get
sometimes i miss a file and i get a runtime error that it s looking for a certain file and i go find the file on the internet and put it in the right place and it works

1736463
textmate	bbedit
textmate and bbedit are also great editors

1736558
arduino	avr-gcc
i do know that if you wrote a c++ class compiled it using avr-gcc then loaded it on your arduino using avrdude it would work

1736594
int	chars
cvapi int cvsaveimage const chars filename const cvarr image const int params cv_default 0

1736614
hash	md5
i found a term hash in most description of md5

1736627
hash	md5
generally any of the sha algorithms are preferred over md5 due to hash collisions that can occur when using it

1736675
pinax	django-staticfiles
this is the approach taken by pinax and django-staticfiles which use static_url and static_root settings

1736688
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux
it is extreamly portable i work with it on windows linux openvms solaris freebsd

1736702
vim	emacs
there is no limit to the size of a system that can be developed in vim emacs unix in fact there are fewer limits than there are in ide s

1736728
persistent	transient
sometime developer might intent to persistent only top level object and forget to mark member variables as transient

1736742
folder	directory
i have all standard python modules in python31.zip which is basically an archive of the lib folder in the python install directory

1736747
put	get
i changed the term module name to ansiterm but i can t figure out how to get cucumber to load my modified gem which i ve put into rails_root vendor gems term-ansicolor

1736786
gxt	smartgwt
please exclude gxt or smartgwt like other heavy weight frameworks just want to use core gwt

1736821
sorting	grouping
using row_number you are numering and sorting the inherently unsorted grouping the table

1736831
vim	emacs	vim	bbedit
vim emacs bbedit wingide or my favorite - eclipse although i don t think this is very lightweight

1736833
g++	gcc
the following compiles in c but not c++ all compilations done with gcc g++ -ansi -pedantic -wall

1736835
punctuation	words
suppose two lines of text correspond to each other words by words except for the punctuation marks

1736847
vim	emacs
vim and emacs for non-ide editing work

1736848
gentoo	linux
imo i d say virtualbox + gentoo linux + kdevelop4 gentoo will give you the control you need over your environment

1736860
vim	emacs
having a good command on a powerful editor like vim or emacs is something i would consider as an essential skill for any programmer

1736886
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this all works in firefox safari and google-chrome

1736952
postgresql	mysql
however i would like to use another database technology such as mysql or postgresql for my authentication role management

1736956
vim	emacs
emacs vim can be used for any sized projects

1736973
background-repeat	background-image	width	height
i will use a simple div element with the width and height that the animated image will have the png sprite as background-image and background-repeat set to no-repeat

1736983
execvp	fork
however by manually performing the pipe fork execvp of the popen and then dup ing the pipe s read file descriptor closing the original does not block

1737006
hash	salt
the hash function hash input to a value requires a salt value and no proof salt is needed to store

1737023
ubuntu	linux
i have a subversion repository on my laptop in my room windows vista but i want to check it out to a computer upstairs ubuntu linux

1737042
oncreate	setcontentview
next create a listactivity as you would normally but add a setcontentview call in the oncreate method so we use our recently declared layout

1737080
post	get
it s possible in php because despite their names _get and _post don t really need a get or post

1737080
put	get
it doesn t matter what the actual request method is - it could be a put and those superglobals would still get populated

1737088
put	get
i loop on the linq query result and for each i open the file do some operation get value and put the result in myfileino.contentpart

1737240
interpreted-language	compiled-language
fact is that interpreted-language like php are always slower than a compiled-language

1737296
width	margin
what you should do is to set float right and width on your element and leave #content without any float or width just set margin

1737330
sqldependency	sqlcachedependency
in most cases you can probably use sqldependency or sqlcachedependency

1737381
uitableview	reloaddata
then just create a form and add the data to the list and use reloaddata on your uitableview

1737385
post	get
while the dragging dropping works i can t get the jquery post to fire

1737416
codeigniter	kohana
quick question about general mvc design principle in php using codeigniter or kohana i m actually using kohana

1737462
pull	push
alternatively thinking a bit more - and allowing that i use svn much more - the key would be that i could commit to my local wip repository all i want broken code or not and therefore would pull or push my current wip to the laptop and back safely

1737473
integer	unsigned
your problem is that php doesn t have a type byte it only has integer which usually is 32 bits not 8 so if you really need negative value there the bits are correct anyway because unsigned 255 is the same as signed -1 then you should probably add the missing 24 ones or use arithmetics to restore the negative value 255 is -1 254 is -2 and so on 256 - x -x

1737474
disk	ram
make sure your hardware is optimized enough ram fast enough disk etc

1737508
width	height
you could assign a mouse click event to the covering div then iterate through all elements that you know might be underneath inspecting their position width and height to see if that location of the mouse click was within their borders and if it was call their onclick event

1737537
pull	push
in other words a pull mechanism versus a push mechanism

1737576
mockups	balsamiq
use paper and pen or more sophisticated wireframing tools such as balsamiq mockups

1737590
django	web2py
here is a document showing the differences between django web2py and some others

1737618
hide	show
the best way to accomplish the desired affect is to move the larger thumbnail images outside of the div that is clipped and show hide it with javascript

1737643
int	double
with the scanner class you are able to request specific types double int ... string

1737710
typedef	struct
it seems that i have to declare p using struct point as the type or using a typedef

1737716
gif	png
you can if you want make the background image transparent by exporting the native image as a gif with transparency you can use png with alhpa transparency which has more colours but i am not so sure of full browser support for the png image in webpages yet

1737720
typedef	struct
as far as i know it shouldn t work without a typedef in c99 either as this is simply the way c works but it does work in c++ as a struct in c++ is just a class with all members public by default

1737721
typedef	struct
you have to either say struct point or use a typedef in c

1737725
typedef	struct
if you want to use a struct as a type you have to typedef it

1737779
typedef	struct
you can use typedef to alias it to another name - typedef struct point point

1737787
ubuntu	linux
i have a mixed windows and linux dev environment and the server is linux ubuntu

1737797
pull	push
option 2 commit on the sending side push to the receiving end or pull from it or put a hg bundle on a flash drive bypassing the work server update on the receiving side and then hg rollback on both sides to eliminate the changeset but leave the changes

1737797
pull	push
pros using push and pull to move over changes like mercurial intends

1737797
pull	push
push to a developer-repo that only you access and pull on the receiving end

1737806
cassini	iis
my solution was to switch to using iis instead of cassini -- just configure iis to point to the development folder and then change the startup url to be cassini has a bunch of other annoying features too like no support for compression so this works better for me

1737844
traceroute	packets
in that case and assuming that the icmp packets associated with traceroute are not filtered stopped on the way a simple traceroute would answer the question

1737847
button	checkbox
menus checkbox radio button spring to mind

1737847
mouse	keyboard
you ll see some of this in dedicated devices such as the iphone simply because that s a platform that neither has a mouse pointer nor a keyboard and only touch

1737864
pylons	turbogears
others prefer turbogears and or pylons maybe bfg maybe grok maybe zope maybe plone

1737871
vim	emacs
emacs is a great tool so is vim for programming and i use them to develop my code for physics research

1737891
width	height
width and height of this frame generated by width and height of image

1737895
mouseup	mousedown
this problem is caused because you filter the mousedown message but not the mouseup message

1737900
post	get
i just get all post vacancies etc with language pref.language and show them on the pages where needed

1737916
pull	push
then you can push pull docs around and the separate different parent repos will keep track of what point on docs they ve been updated to

1737973
mp3	wav
don t forget that an mp3 file is compressed whereas a wav isn t

1737973
mp3	wav
so the delay might be the time it takes to read the mp3 file into memory and decompress it which doesn t have to happen with the wav file

1737996
mp3	wav	mp3	ogg	wav	ogg
i want a library or some sort of a command that takes an mp3 file location as an input only mp3 i don t need wav ogg or any other type and plays the file to the end of it and make some sort of an equalizer output but only in frequencies as numbers like 31hz 62hz ... 16 khz all the 10 bands available but show them to me as ever changing 10 variables

1738009
folder	directory
i found that mucking around with the .project file can lead to the entire directory being considered a source folder which is not what you want

1738063
cldc	midp
it enables for cldc and midp 1.0 and 2.0

1738077
prepare	execute
as soon as you want to execute more complex queries you had best be prepare for some frustration

1738134
width	height
where #top-left #top-right #bottom-left #bottom-right are using corner images as backgrounds and have both width and height set

1738150
int	chars
you are assigning an int c to a chars result when returning from your function

1738180
int	double
i have a double pointer data- mono_channel where i would like to cast all the double to int and put them in an array

1738180
int	double
the purpose is that alsa takes an int array of samples and my samples are in double

1738180
int	double
so somehow i need my double to be casted to int

1738198
minimum	max	min	max
the samples probably need to be scaled from -1 1 to min max where min and max are minimum and maximum integer values for integer samples

1738203
mp3	wav
will decode the mp3 file to a wav file

1738206
int	double
if is an array of double s the casting is correct although your code is overly complicated -- you should just use index i as the control variable in the loop and use it to index the input array of double s as well as the resulting array of int s

1738214
public	protected
while inside a section of class a code it will always call the version from class a even if the class b version was protected or public

1738214
public	protected
as noted by others if you change the definition to protected or public it will be visible to class b and it will do what you want

1738234
treemap	treeset
you are almost there if you use a treeset instead of a treemap you can use your comparator on one of the fields of the animal class

1738246
pop-up	dialog
the dialog pop-up as expected but as you see in the screenshot below it is way too large and looks like the full facebook homepage

1738274
width	height
the code below works very well for resizing an image by aspect ratio by height and i can also create a separate function by width

1738274
width	height
but i m not always sure if an image will need to be shrunk by height or width

1738274
width	height
for example if the space that the image needs to be resized into is 100 width and 100 height and an image is 150 by 90 then its the width that would need to be shrunk

1738308
width	height
the following code will work out which side is needs to be scaled works with non-square boxes which simply checking width vs height won t work for and scale according to that

1738308
width	height
if you do not want it to enlarge where i switch the ratios check if width or height is 1 then and only then do the scale

1738313
int	double
i get cannot convert â double cls_lasvm int int void â to â double int int void â

1738393
typedef	struct
you can define struct like after defining one more typedef like

1738424
inherited	subclassing
they are not inherited by any subclassing and only classes no interfaces can have static members

1738461
versioning	upgrade
the windows 7 upgrade isn t as important as the upgrade to window s 7 s .net versioning 3.5 i think...

1738471
put	get
so i guess you ll still have to put some brainpower into making sure you get the appropriate indices in place to make your system perform well

1738489
fink	macports
you have -i sw include and -l sw lib which are standard locations for fink not macports

1738489
fink	macports
in general it s not a good idea to mix packages from fink and macports

1738518
codeigniter	cakephp
it was also said cakephp and zend have a steeper learning curve than codeigniter

1738602
post	get
here showview actually sends get wait for user s post and returns

1738613
hash	md5
for example if i run file1 through c# s md5 hash code and copy nd paste the same file to a new directory...the hash code come out different even tough it is he same file

1738634
int	double
as others have said you should probably declare n and num to be double not int

1738637
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

1738650
width	margin
without specifying a margin for your .outer div the user agent will determine the width using width auto which looks like it varies depending on the user agent

1738655
int	chars
people make assumptions all the time that chars is 8 bits short is 16 int is 32 long is either 32 or 64 and long long is 64

1738693
post	get
i m currently trying to implement that feature i ll post the code here if i get it to work

1738722
put	get
if we put it all together in the outer query using these two lists we get

1738773
int	chars
this generality is why the c specification says something to the effect of don t expect much about the sizes of int beyond sizeof chars sizeof short int sizeof int sizeof long int . that implies that chars could be the same size as longs

1738785
nullpointerexception	runtimeexception
here i am not talking about trivial runtimeexception such as nullpointerexception and so on

1738786
post	get
i must be doing something wrong because i get weird stuff in my file so weird i can t even paste it into my post

1738817
rss	feed
you just need to give it the rss feed for blog 2

1738884
mouse	keyboard
upgrade the processor 2.53ghz add ram to 4gb after purchase if you re comfortable throw a generic keyboard mouse and monitor on it and you ve got a heck of a machine

1738884
put	get
don t bother with a hd upgrade just get an external usb disk and put all your vm s and extra necessities on it

1738910
codeigniter	kohana
if you re going with codeigniter note maybe take a look at kohana too the php5 fork of codeigniter you can always use libs out of zend if theres something that fits your needs

1738920
haskell	ocaml
haskell s learning curve is somewhat higher than other functional languages like ocaml though it is my personal favorite

1738937
public	protected
iirc that is the error one got when trying to use visibility declarations private protected public in php 4

1738985
x86	64bit
but on 64bit server the environment variable processor_architecture is returning x86 instead of amd64

1738994
implements	sealed
even if you made the return type readonlycollection it still might delay the evaluation and throw for example readonlycollection is not sealed so a subclass could explicitly implements the ienumerable interface and do wacky things

1738997
x86	64bit
x86-64 more precisely which is the 64bit extension of x86

1739030
hide	show
on a button click my form1 hide itself creates a new form2 and show form2

1739055
x86	64bit
if your application is a 32-bit application running on a 64bit os the process version of this environment variable will return x86

1739098
getter	setter
and in the myclass action class you can declare a variable variable named arg with getter and setter

1739161
button	checkbox
to do this with older versions of windows installer you ll need to create a customaction that launches the website and then tie the execution of the customaction to a button another common use is to create a checkbox saying launch blah blah... and then tie a customaction to the finish button which executes based on the value of the checkbox

1739183
feedback	review
but if you have unit tests and review are done by the developer in front of peers then it can be very helpful as he gets feedback from others and everyone can learn from the experience

1739225
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
use the firebug extension for firefox or the built-in web inspector in any webkit browser google-chrome or safari

1739231
google-chrome	safari
webkit used in safari and google-chrome has a built-in web inspector that includes a js debugger along with a dom outline and manipulation tools and a js console

1739233
google-chrome	safari
webkit safari google-chrome web inspector

1739937
implements	extends
the main difference between extends and implements is that implements changes the class s prototype while extends creates a copy

1739937
implements	extends
this means that if you implements a change into a class all instances of that class will inherit that change instantly while if you use extends then all existing instances will remain the same

1739937
implements	extends
there simply is a difference in the order in which mutators like extends and implements are brought in

1739937
implements	extends
you can implements and extends but you need to declare extends first for it to work

1739937
implements	extends
you need class human to implements ninja instead and class badass to simply extends human

vb6	vba
as jtolle indicated this is simply not possible in vba vb6

1740020
vb6	vba
there is no perfect way to work around this but what i personally do is create a public friend sub call initialize with the parameters i want in vba vb6 you use optional parameters for overloading and then put a quick check in all exposed members of the class that throws an exception if you try to access them without running the initialize method

1740020
vb6	vba
it s not great but it s about as good as it s going to get with vba vb6

1740055
xslt	xquery
saxon an extremely popular java xquery xslt engine by michael kay uses ikvm

1740059
std	ostream
since m_newline is part of log we can t be working with generic std ostream s

1740059
std	ostream
so you need to create a new stream type derived from std ostream i ve left it out here but assumed it s named logstream

1740081
phong	shading
if i misunderstood your question and you already know opengl and want to study more about glsl in particular here s a good phong shading example that shows the basics

vim	emacs
using a ide i don t to care so many things like when you use editor like vim emacs

1740193
vim	emacs
alas...if you insist in using vim emacs as your editor you will encounter a deep learning curve you will waste so many time even to acchieve so trivial a function in your editor you will be desperate when you are busy catching up with your timetable if you just pick them up......you have to settle down and start leaning and also playing with editors and a couple of days you will find you ve already achieve more than you can ever expect

1740267
actualheight	actualwidth
when a window is shown it is measured then windowstartuplocation is processed using the actualwidth and actualheight of the window computed by the measure process

1740267
actualheight	actualwidth
the behavior you describe tells me actualwidth and actualheight are measured to be either zero or relatively small at the time of the show or showdialog call and only later set to nonzero values

1740277
hash	salt
the salt is supposedly determined by an array of values each corresponding to a point in the salt. password hash value to introduce yet another part of the salt

1740277
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
ie introduce my own customized salt that i can say do an md5 hash on that and then use that md5 generated by the salt to seed the password at given points in the md5sum

1740277
hash	md5
granted it prevents someone who were to get access to the md5 password list from using a md5 lookup of predetermined hash

1740293

1740754
width	height
the width and height of the node object el was 0px by 0px so not setting the overflow to hidden made the rendered item visible

1740756
hash	salt
regarding point 1 the hash_password function is used both to generate the password hash against the salt and including the salt that is stored in the database at signup-time as well as to recreate that hash when the password needs to be verified at login-time

1740756
hash	salt
the hash_password function will first hash the password against the salt and then insert each char of the salt into the password hash at the corresponding salt_pattern offset

1740756
hash	salt
find_salt will extract these salt chars so that the hash can be reproduced

1740756
hash	salt
although you can also see it has hash_password hiding the salt and find_salt finding it this method of encryption can t be called steganography i think because it is clear from the code that there is a salt stored with the password hash the existence of the salt is not secret

1740779
google-chrome	safari
databinding is ok and the required output shows great with mozilla and ie but not in netscape safari and google-chrome

1740809

min	max
that will match any max element that s a child of salary and that doesn t have a preceding sibling named min and will emit the default min element and then a copy of the max element

1740846

int	chars	int	boolean
don t use to compare instances of boolean chars int and so on

1741261
getter	setter
one thing you can do is to make getter and setter for the properties instead of public vars and have your class extend eventdispatcher if it does not already do so because it is extended from a movieclip like

1741270
buffering	sigpipe
maybe for your use you might want to do the write of the buffering in a separate thread to avoid blocking and make sure you handle sigpipe

1741285
subtraction	addition
i can t see when to set the overflow depending on the operation addition subtraction and the input values

1741309

opera	firefox
users might be using weird browsers - ie and firefox are common and we probably have an opera user somewhere

1741976
width	height
given we work in a 2 dimensional space then there will only ever be 2 attributes namely width and height

1741976
width	height
for instance you could easily make the mistake of getting height and width mixed up - in dimension 150px 200px

1742017
jquery	scriptaculous
as most have already posted it all depends on what you need to do i used jquery scriptaculous and mootools for some time and for lightweight effects mootools was the most appropriate as for support and medium sized projects jquery

the first abstraction would take inputstream outputstream as parameters whereas the other would take

1742825

one of the bits of info being loaded here is a jquery tabs setup so the onshow function of the simplemodal is used to initiate the tabs which are within the simplemodal

1742944
jquery	simplemodal
if i do multiple consecutive autocompletes on the same page it all works fine unless i have selected a different tab on the tabs in the simplemodal ....if i select a different tab close the simplemodal and then do another autocomplete i get a jquery error which seems to relate to a selector doing something with the old selected tab that was on the closed modal

uitableview	reloaddata
after rendering a uitableview with a given datasource i want to be able to switch to a different one prior to calling reloaddata

1742987
post	get
- the project and blog post should be enough to get anybody started

1742997
loops	while-loop
i am trying to debug right now in c and am curious if it is alright to call opendir repeatedly without having to first call closedir because i am trying to run a loops to open sub-directories when the while-loop that calls readdir encounters them

gridview	objectdatasource
this user control in turn contains several other controls mainly a gridview that is associated with an objectdatasource

1743003
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
the problem is that when you want to do that you need to have the sudo passwd and be in the sudoers file else it will fail

1743003
sudo	passwd
but you could try to use gksudo graphical version of sudo so when it gets called it asks for the passwd

1743046
folder	directory
right now each file and folder is stored in an object i created it contains the filepath filetype filesize a pointer to an offset in the file and if it is a directory and those objects are placed in a nsmutablearray

ubuntu	linux
i m using kimagemapeditor on linux ubuntu to create an image map

initializer	eigenclass
the simplest answer the eigenclass can t be initializer

1743186
width	margin
kill your left and right columns give your main div a width and then center that div using an auto left and right margin

1743189
uitableview	reloaddata
when you call reloaddata it forces your uitableview to re-query your data source regardless of the amount of data that is already loaded

1743189
switching	screens
in the light of your edits i m thinking that perhaps the moment you should switching data sources depends on the state of your live data - when you ve got enough data in it to be able to show enough of it on the screens

1743210
width	height
answers to that specific width height question would be very helpful but if anyone knows of some good documentation that goes over flex s layout stuff in general that would be great

1743228
antivirus	norton
i had to turn off norton antivirus outgoing email scan to get emails to go right away

1743307
width	height
the buttons width and height are set to 60 and 22

1743307
width	height
if i select everything in flash it confirms that the width and height of the entire movieclip is 130 and 120

1743307
width	height
and the the width of movieclip always acts as if the buttons width and height are both 100

1743400
gridview	formview
i have an asp.net page with a custom usercontrol which contains a selectable gridview and a formview which is on the page directly

1743400
gridview	formview
first issue i want the formview s pageindex to be the selected index of the gridview

1743400
gridview	rowdatabound
whenever i click the select link on the gridview all the formatting that i ve set up in the rowdatabound function gets undone

1743411
codeigniter	cakephp
besides you might end up spending more time learning another person s system than developing your own for which you could use rapid development frameworks such as cakephp codeigniter and the likes

typedef	struct
typedef struct word

1743468
typedef	struct
typedef struct svector

1743486
int	chars
in our example base64_encode treats 1234 as a string of 4 chars not an int because base64_encode does not operate on int

1743549
printf	strlen
it would be extremely rare in such a case to need another header file when adding a call to printf or strlen

1743582
try-catch	exception-handling
there are a bunch of application wide event handlers in that file like application_error that catches every exception-handling that isn t caught within your application so you don t have to use try-catch all the time

1743582
try-catch	exception-handling
but ultimately you don t want to wrap your entire application in a try-catch nor do you want to catch a general exception-handling

1743582
try-catch	exception-handling
try-catches generally slow down your application and a lot of times if you catch every general exception-handling than it could be possible that you wouldn t know a bug exists until months or years later because the try-catch caused you to overlook it

1743665
getter	setter
these can be used for a more or less comfortable getter setter generation

1743665
getter	setter
however i only create explicit getter and setter if i need to place some extra code there

1743665
getter	setter
there are some who say it breaks encapsulation if you don t use getter and setter

1743665
getter	setter
however with a language where you can add getter and setter later without changing the interface i don t think that this is true anymore

1743665
getter	setter
and also bear in mind that if you make a variable bindable without an explicit event name the compiler creates getter and setter for your variable wihtout you even noticing it except there are already getter and setter of course

1743665
getter	setter
this is btw a quick dirty way to implement interfaces that declare getter and setter functions

1743708
hash	md5
if not keep the files who have the same file size version and compute their md5 sha1 whatever-you-prefer hash

1743785
hide	show
the particular page is using an update panel and hide show drop down lists based off of a selection in a drop down list

1743785
hide	show
the page is working perfectly locally using cassini the local webserver used by visual studio 2008 but loses the items from the drop downs and does not show and hide the controls upon callbacks from within the update panel

1743797
implements	extends
i need to be able to instantiate an object of a class in dojo at runtime and mix it into another object kind of like specifying an extends or an implements in java but at runtime

is there any way to produce visual results of nunit tests from within teamcity s tests tab currently my nant script outputs an .xml file of the results using the following task

1743828

caveat i wasted the lower part of the screen so that nothing special was needed to address square screens and landscape portrait orientations

1743880
google-chrome	firefox
returns 0 in google-chrome but it returns the actual height in ie and firefox

1743919
post	get
depending on how complex the application s backend is and how perfect you can recreate the state ie all the way down to external soa services or the time clock it may not be possible to make those get and post requests reproduce the same behavior

1743931
folder	directory
equally of course ensure it has read access to your virtual directory though it looks like it is a permissions issue on the parent folder

1743980
rss	feed
feedsync allows you to publish directly to an rss feed

1744013
dictionary	map
this may apply more to people coming from a dynamic language background as the basic data types lists dictionary etc built in to javascript json directly map to the same or similar data types in python perl ruby etc

1744018
post	get
by the time you get to the code in your original post the content has already been corrupted

1744078
daemons	systemd
i believe the solution is to make a systemd call to launchctl since that s the daemons responsible for starting stopping systemd services

1744100
postgresql	mysql
don t assume that the default postgresql or mysql configuration is the right one

1744100
nginx	lighttpd	apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx
are you using apache or something like nginx or lighttpd

1744130
cpu	hyperthreading
in 2 physical cpu system with hyperthreading does an os assign number 0 2 to the first physical cpu and then 1 3 to second physical cpu

1744131
getter	setter
while trying to port and generally playing around with some non-browser code i came across getter and setter that looked like normal object properties

1744157
getter	setter
according to this article by john resig creator of jquery javascript getter and setter are supported in jscript.net 8

1744205
getter	setter
generating getter and setter would then be

1744255
for-loop	loops
if you are adding and starting your activity indicator in the same thread as where you are running your for-loop with the 16 computations the indicator won t update until those computations are complete since the current run loops can t finish before that point

i m currently trying to write the inputstream to an outputstream decompressing the data and then i ll need to write it back to an inputstream

1744309
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome work fine

1744312
xlib	gdk
it should be possible to do that using only gdk commands because they map more or less into the same calls of xlib

1744315
put	get
however if i put the same code back in the class file public class email which resides outside the project solution i get the transport error above

1744325
post	get
- either post or get for our http request to the third party server

1744341
postgresql	mysql
i think that you can look in open source db firebird postgresql or mysql and open source fulltext search engine lucene or sphinx

1744378
int	chars
the cin x will read the int but the enter key interpreted as a newline chars will be left in the input buffer

1744382
kde	gnome
gnome x11 kde and a web browser with thumbnail capabilities installed eg

1744404
post	get
the get request is marginally less secure than the post request

1744404
post	get
a confused deputy attack where the deputy is the browser is possible regardless of whether you use a get or a post request

1744404
post	get
on attacker-controlled websites get and post are equally easy to submit without user interaction

1744404
post	get
the only scenario in which post is slightly less susceptible is that many websites that arenâ t under the attackerâ s control say a third-party forum allow embedding arbitrary images allowing the attacker to inject an arbitrary get request but prevent all ways of injecting an arbitary post request whether automatic or manual

1744404
post	get
secondly the request parameters are of limited use to an attacker what they really need is the cookies so if the only thing they have are proxy logs they are unlikely to be able to attack either a get or a post url

1744404
post	get
caching proxies might retain get responses but not post responses

1744404
post	get
having said that get responses can be made non-cacheable with less effort than converting the url to a post handler

1744404
post	get
post requests are naturally immune to this however to exploit the get request a hacker would need to insert a link to their own website into the serverâ s response

1744412
hide	show
i tried the hide show thing but it keeps the old form running in the background

1744491
inherited	properties
odds are this type isn t really intended to be inherited and if it is these properties probably shouldn t be touched

1744503
post	get
get the interface definition for itaskbarlist from this forum post or from the windows sdk

1744533
free	malloc
i have a single malloc and a single corresponding free during each function call but after repeatedly running the code in java the malloc will eventually fail

1744553
starttls	smtps
extended smtps and the starttls command is an example of this

1744631
ceil	floor
the first is to implement the round function yourself using either ceil or floor from cmath and creating a function similar to the following

1744638
post	get
you might be better off adding 0.5 and using floor as mentioned in another post here to get basic rounding

1744653
html5lib	beautifulsoup
i m no expert on other languages but i would go with python and html5lib or beautifulsoup

1744695
hide	show	width	height
i don t believe the javascript runtime in any browser has an event you can hook into in between calculating the layout and displaying the element so you can add it in a way that it can t be seen and doesn t affect the height doesn t cause additional scrolling and then show hide it based on the width at this point

1744699
hide	show
maybe you can append it invisible then check it s width and then consider to show or hide

1744748
serializable	deserialization
the .net xml serializable was escaping the invalid character when serializing it but then it was un-escaping it before deserialization

1744888
post	put
if i copy the dll and its .pdb files with a post build event to the c# app s debug execution dir i still can t hit any break points i put into the dll code

1744935
ienumerable	ienumerator
if so and if indeed you have an ienumerable not ienumerator you can do this

1744945
hide	show
after doing this work i noticed that my nsscrollview would show and hide the vertical scroll bar as i typed

1744952
innodb	myisam
is better on myisam compare to innodb

1744994
ienumerable	icollection
if you implement the icollection ienumerable interface and have a method called add

1745022
internationalization	translation
getting the translation of content working is fairly easy using the internationalization module

1745027
post	get
first your server requests for something like this should be post not get

1745031
pull	push
the extension keeps each project in a separate repository but provides options to update push pull all the forest repositories together

1745032
children	parent
its not a big deal but if i expire the parent by updating it s metadata i d like to avoid having to copy all the children into the new copy of the parent

1745039
min	max
- sort the array from max to min value

1745046
cvs	svn
many svn cvs users expect to host

1745055
mouseover	mouseout
i m not sure this will stop the mouseover and mouseout events but give it a whirl

1745063
width	height
i think maybe in ie7 the position and height width of the elements original position before applying the relative positioning is not calculated correctly

1745100
actionscript	mxml
including the flex framework whether via mxml or pure actionscript will significantly increase the size of your final swf

1745100
actionscript	mxml
the mxml version was 175k while the no-flex actionscript version was 2k

1745114
hash	salt
this way even if the database is compromised the actual application would also have to be compromised or both the salt and hash would be completely useless

1745125
ssl	https
but here s the important part and why the only correct answer to this question is both from and to must be https that most people forget https and ssl tls in general isn t just encryption that is only a part of it

1745126
children	parent
i want to write a hql query to select the distinct parent of all children where no records s have a foreign key to them

1745155
children	parent
the parent will change it s hours to the total hours to the total amount of hours added up by the children

codeigniter	cakephp
codeigniter | cakephp | zend

1745184
children	parent
the view is bound to a viewmodel that exposes a list of parent which should be my rows and a children list which is supposed to be the combobox dropdown contents

1745184
children	parent
when i look in the output window i see the binding error saying bindingexpression path error children property not found on object parent

1745229
int	chars
because int can become arbitrarily large in clojure the resulting number becomes bigger with every chars thanks to the

1745239
coalesce	isnull
the following would be much preferred over a isnull or coalesce approach

1745292
imperative	declarative
they can help us implement complicated business rules that may be difficult to express in the declarative form of sql but it then brings us to use the procedural imperative form of sql which is a general feature of sql which is neither very friendly expressive programming-wise and often less efficient performance-wise

1745302
width	height
this algorithm is not efficient by any means o 2 width height ain t good.

cassini	iis
i get it working easily on iis but using same configuration it doesn t work with cassini

combine your background images into a single image and use the css background-image and background-position properties to display the desired image segment

1745364
vsto	add-in
i have written and successsfully deployed a vsto 3.0 add-in for excel 2007

put	get
you can put the socket in non-blocking mode then you ll get case ssl_error_want_read or ssl_error_want_write from ssl_accept

1745400
folder	directory
that should show you the root directory folder in and the contents of those folder

1745412
disk	ram
if you do not want to call external commands whether by exec popen or system etc but do not want to modify the source of these utilities and compile them into your code relatively easy just change main to main_cut etc then the only remaining option i see is to embed the utilities inside your code and either extract them at runtime or dynamically create a filing system by pointing at the data inside your code eg using a floppy or cd image and writing a fuse module that picks up the disk image data from a ram address

1745479
config	ini
but this is quite messy as the config file lives outside my python-path and i would rather use a standard config approach such as using ini files or yaml

istream	getline
istream getline istream is string str char delim

checkbox	dropdownlistfor
the advanced search page brings up a form with two required text fields 4 optional dropdownlistfor and two separate areas with multiple optional checkbox to filter the results even further

1745596
config	ini
although this does require a little knowledge of python syntax in order to configure the app it s not really that difficult and much more flexible than the ini markup config file approach

1745597
width	height
you have a tab that s 600 pixels in width with 5px of padding on each side you cannot have a div that is 550px or larger for the width this also applies to the height

1745597
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
in addition if you have multiple divs floating that come close to equaling the width height - padding margin when added together it will crash ie 6 but not ie 7

1745690
jruby	mri
things work perfectly when running under mri but i m getting strange results when running the same code using jruby

1745704
post	get
when i call the post i get the categoryid as a result

1745761
toolbar	tabs
if you want to switch content what you really want is a toolbar because that is meant to alter an-place view in various ways - tabbar is meant for switching between multiple unrelated views and as such you are fighting against it when you try to use the same view across multiple tabs

1745798
pull	push
you could either pull or have the app register for push notifications when active and be told when updates are available you can opt to receive notifications only when the app is open notification data packets are not large enough to hold the data updates themselves

1745806
gitorious	gitosis
i guess i m open to trying to set up gitorious or something if it allows this but gitosis works pretty well for me right now and it was dead easy to set up and i ve heard that gitorious is not so easy

1745806
gitolite	gitosis
i ve heard of other forks clones of gitosis that have per branch permissions like gitolite but i m not sure whether i want to use one of those unless they have other compelling features and are as well documented and easy to use as gitosis

1745832
many-to-many	one-to-many
on a side note person to car is technically a one-to-many person owner or many-to-many person driver relationship rather than one-to-one

put	get
if you want to put it in a string though things get more complicated

1745925
post	get
rationale sometimes instead of submitting form variables via post or get i want to pass them into a javascript variable then do something with the variable and then send it somewhere

1745938
inherited	properties
what i do is add a class that inherited from resourcedictionary and override the source properties to check if isindesignmode is true

1746084
getter	setter
the authors notion of relational is quite off and the code they show is not object-oriented by any means they just show a couple of structs glorified with getter and setter

1746095
int	double
note that your coordinates are all double not int these are not precise units

1746122
int	double
rule of thumb int can be cast to and back from double

1746122
int	double
with double you can use much larger int

1746122
int	double
assuming an ieee 754 underlying floating point system you will be able to accurately cast int of 23 bits to and from float and 52 bits to and from double

1746122
int	double
actually you get one more bit because of the hidden bit so you can fit an int up to and including 1fffffffffffff or 9007199254740991 in a double

1746122
int	double
so every single 32-bit int has an exact representation in double

1746143
getter	setter
the authors seem oblivious to this as evidenced by the fact that the operations in their class diagrams are exclusively getter and setter of state information which is why the state optimization data normalization techniques fit so nicely

1746209
bufferedreader	bufferedwriter
bufferedreader and bufferedwriter are the most efficient means of writing to and reading from the console as well as any file

1746223
system.in	system.out
in general system.out and scanner on top of system.in are usually enough

hash	salt
i d say it is absolutely essential to use a strong hash and salt on your end- neglecting to do so exposes not only your site but completely compromises every user who recycles username password combinations

1746443
width	height
for most controls you set it s height and width to auto in the xaml and it will size to fit its content

1746443
width	height
in code you set the width height to double.nan

1746476
hash	md5
a single nvidia 9800gtx can calculate 350 million md5 hash second

1746476

cheap modern gpus will easily boast one billion md5 hash second

if you want something really strong but still as naive as stored hash passwords are go for pbkdf2

freebsd is legendary for its stability has lots of documentation huge ports collection and it even allows running linux binaries

alternatively if your data does not contain double quotes commas carriage returns linefeed or leading trailing spaces you don t have to surround the data with quotes or worry about escaping

the onfocus and onblur events work on all form elements and anchors you can try just making your input a textarea and it will work but i would encourage you to do your event binding programmatically

fgets	getline
but since you mention c++ you might consider using instead getline caveat fgets also put the n in the buffer it fills getline doesn t

1746956
fgets	getline	istream	getline
both make easy to check for end of file fgets returns null on eof getline sets the eofbit on its istream argument which it also returns

1747087
inherited	properties
it works quite well except that some properties inherited is blocked textelement.fontsize for example

1747103
printwriter	bufferedwriter
to take the full advantage of printwriter or any other writer but also use buffered writing you can wrap the bufferedwriter with the needed one like this

1747117
onclick	onchange
also try setting the event to onselect or onchange rather than onclick

1747122

1747188
int	chars
chars literals like c and 0 are actualy int s not chars s - they re casted down to chars at assignment and can be just as easily cast back up

1747195
width	height
what supprise me is that the loadercontainer s width height is changing all the way according to the contents that it loaded

1747216
hash	md5
so then when we md5sum every file see digest md5 calculate their sizes we can use a hash table to do our matching for us storing the matches together in arrayrefs

1747219
rss	feed
you could build rss feed with views and put a simple feed parser into your static site

1747236
mouseup	mousedown
however the problem with that solution is that it is only generic it can t handle the standard winforms mouseup mousedown etc.

this is giving me a return type of iqueryable ienumerable tblanswers whereas all i really want is the iqueryable tblanswers so that i can work with them later easily

1747886
doc	rtf
i remembered the rtf capabilities of the clipboard and realised that a class could be created that would copy rtf data to the clipboard paste to a word doc and output the resulting plain text

1747886
doc	rtf
the benefit of this solution is that the word doc object would not have to be opened and closed for each rtf string

vb6	vba
here s a microsoft article on calling web services from vb6 - vba is almost identical to vb6 so i expect the advice still applies

1748574
post	get
how can i get value of radio button on form post

1748574
post	get
i am already doing the above code it is really correct way to get values of posted elements but for radio button it only post the last value of that radio button

1748598
rss	feed
edit of course this assumes you re hosting a list of updates online that the updater program can check an rss feed or even a simple text file

this is a long shot but isn t the code using qmainwindow and the xml ui-descripting defines a qwidget

1748903
java.util.date	simpledateformat
first step is to parse the first string into a java.util.date object using simpledateformat based on the pattern of the first string

1749007
int	boolean
traditionally in c a boolean is represented with an int type

1749007
int	boolean
for converting from boolean to int you may use something like interfaces.c.int boolean pos your_bool_value

1749019
hash	md5
this avoids the the very unlikely chance that two different files produce the same md5 hash

1749040
coalesce	nullif
how about combining coalesce and nullif

1749047
hash	md5
md5 is still a very good checksum just not so great as a cryptographic hash

1749052
firefox	safari
in firefox safari ie it is working fine

1749062
persistent	transient
however if the source date is from a transient source streaming in from a physical sensor of some sort it may be a good idea to persistent the interim date object output of simpledateformat#parse string somewhere

1749146
extjs	mootools
can t use any javascript such as jquery mootools extjs etc and actual elements i want to remove are divs with specified class so i can t use getelementbyid

to get around this ensure your target is x86 unless you absolutely need to target 64bit

1749356
cvs	svn
update if any suggestions are specific to a particular source control system i m particularly interested in cvs svn and mercurial

1749375
maven	pom.xml
to have maven include hsqldb in the dependencies for the test phase only use this in your pom.xml

1749385
firefox	safari
while testing it in different browsers - including firefox 3.5 safari 4 and icab which i am using because of its harsh security guidelines - i found out that even in the app s log the session hash looked different - the only thing the icab session contained was the session_id

1749423

1749453
postgresql	mysql
they have mentioned using mysql and an option - which i am sceptical of and i m considering recommending postgresql although my direct experience of that combination is limited

1749462
getter	setter
a related question would be if we should only set parameters in an object using getter and setter methods

1749485
cstring	bstr
in short if something expects a bstr call sysallocstring or ccombstr or cstring allocsysstring

1749507
inherited	properties
the basic idea is that you have a standard gwt module and a second debug module that inherited this standard module configures some properties and uses gwt s deferred binding to replace some classes with specific instances when debugging

1749507
ant	maven
then you only have to configure your maven ant build to compile the appropriate module depending on wether you are in development mode or in release mode

1749507
inherited	properties
created a debug module that inherited the standard module and configures some additional properties for development

1749507
profiling	debugging
in development you use mvn clean install -dgwtdebug to activate the gwtdebug profiling which in turn compiles the debugging module

1749509
getter	setter
getter and setter oop aren t and more often than not just double the size of the code for no good

1749513
implements	extends
that is you can only extends a single class but you may implements many interfaces

1749537
getter	setter
there are no true setter and getter in the commonly implemented javascript versions so if you want to emulate the effect you have to use some different syntax

1749542
postgresql	mysql
if you don t want to rewrite all of your application logic to you can link a mysql mssql postgresql table in access using odbc right click link table

1749555
getter	setter
as for getter and setter it somewhat depends on the language you use

1749555
getter	setter
personally i only provide getter and setter for public properties and or if changing a property involves logic beyond simply setting getting the property

1749571
nsmutablestring	nsstring
isn t a nsstring equivalent to const nsmutablestring

1749597
mouse	keyboard
do they hook the users mouse keyboard in order to move the cursor to the correct location

1749793
jobs	cron
hard to fathom what you want your english is very hard to parse but anyway besides task queues which are much more flexible and powerful and may be harder to use for simple jobs that cron functionality covers perfectly you can use cron to schedule app engine tasks in python by following the instructions here

1749808
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
these are autoresetevent objects -- looks like you want a manualresetevent -- the auto version triggers anything waiting but immediately resets

1749816

this was for a jdeveloper project and it turned out that the jdeveloper upgrade 11.1.1.2.0 that i d just installed incorporated a later versioning of svnkit than the one i use for command-line svn access jsvn

1749824
aptana	radrails
ruby on rails seems pretty good for kickstart development i love the railscasts unfortunately trying to develop a demo with aptana radrails failed epically to a 200 line stack trace

1749841
onchange	onkeydown
onkeydown although it wouldn t work for pasted data where onchange is probably better

1749842
implements	extends
however i think replacing these abstract classes is a pretty easy refactoring make them interfaces and replaces extends with implements where you get compilation errors and i really can t see what could get broken so i would go for it

1749863
sequence	permutation
covering the permutation in sort sequence is not the most efficient approach to password cracking although it will ultimately be effective

1749905

moreover their parent will have to contain the sums of their children accounts just like the example output bellow

1749994
caliburn	prism
caliburn addresses this missing piece of prism with its ipresenter component model and works well with prism

1750015
content-disposition	content-type
although this should not be happening because you ve set the content-type and content-disposition i believe that ie s built-in mime sniffing handling is what is causing the problem here

1750019
int	double
unless you know what to expect int double etc you need to use the long case statement

1750026
maven	m2e
edit as the op wrote in a comment these directories come from m2e that allows to check out maven projects from svn

1750041
min	max
the month label unit is generated based on a min max value that is supplied to the datetimeaxis it is not generated by the series data as far as i can tell

1750041
min	max
in other words the duplication does not exist within the data supplied to the chart but is part of automatic label generation process that datetimeaxis will execute when supplying a min max value for the axis

1750052
hide	show
from what i understand is you want to show or hide portions of the page depending on what the user selected in a dropdown

1750089
post	put
i have a web application and i m attempting to put an ajax timer control in it to give me a post back every 10-20 seconds

1750090
memcached	apc
you can also use apc much like you d use memcached for storing arbitrary user data

1750090
memcached	apc
better to serve a gig of data from one memcached box to four servers than to have 4 copies of that gig of data in apc on each individual server

1750090
memcached	apc
imo concurrency is tricky -- let memcached apc the database deal with it

1750149
int	chars
of course if you intended these to be the hex codes for chars then you would need to use the hex and chr functions to convert between int and strings of hex chars

1750154
hex	binary
instead convert your hex string by packing it into a binary string using

1750183
folder	directory
you can t change the installation directory from the installer but as the program doesn t depend on registry settings you can copy the installed assemblies to a folder in your vcs and run from there

1750196
put	get
in the specific example you give you need to first get the 4 decimal precision number and put it in a bigdecimal or decimal 19 4 as the case may be and then further round it to 2 decimal precision

1750250
nstextview	nsscrollview
b have 3 nstextview s within the nsscrollview

1750261

wmic	tasklist
if you re looking for a command-line program that gets those things for you there is tasklist and wmic

1750451
implements	extends
the key is that you can extends from only one abstract class while you can implements more interfaces

1750451
implements	extends
apparently the empty abstract class design desicion was made so that it prevents the implements class from extends from another classes

1750525
pull	push
you could use git locally to manage your own changes and then use git-svn to pull push those changes to svn

1750526
width	height
however being an inline element does not honor the height and width properties

1750582
width	height
height and width can only be applied to elements with haslayout property

1750582
fontfamily	font-size
you might need to play a little bit with dimensions because global font-size fontfamily and line-height can affect the real size of your box

1750615
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
you could use git bazaar or mercurial along side of svn though you would want to be sure that you exclude the .svn directories from your new scm and vice versa so that they dont track each others meta data

1750618
gif	png
first you will need a 24-bit png or a gif image with a transparent part - the example has transparent liquid

1750626
innodb	myisam
price node in offer parent node is also related to default price node and so while generating inserts statements we have to keep in mind that values are properly inserted into the databases but we are not allowed to use innodb table of mysql but the only engine we are allowed to use is myisam

i have the strong feeling that i m missing something trivially simple but i just don t find a method that works in ie firefox safari and opera

1750821
hash	md5
also the motivation for ditching md5 in favor of sha-1 or sha-256 would be that md5 is broken. there are shortcuts to find hash collisions so that brute-force isn t required

1750854
decoder	encoder
both the encoder and the decoder is documented in a 7 page format specification with lots of whitespace and large diagrams so i would suppose that you should be able to implement a decoder without much fuzz

1750870
vb.net	vb6
combine this with a custom windows message which your application listens for to bring itself into focus see vb.net vb6 and c# interprocess communication via window messaging

1750879
post	get
the limits on get post string length are both theoretical and vary between browsers and servers

1750895
disk	ram
someone hinted at a possible way to index this thing if you have abundant ram or possibly even disk swap available

1750958
free	malloc
the biggest performance gains flaws will be on the algorithm you implement and how much unneeded work you perform unneeded work could be everything from recalculating a previous value that could have been cached to using too many malloc free s vs using memory pools

1750965
boost	stl
in addition i want to note that using c++ can give you a lot to gain if you use the stl and boost libraries

1750969
post	get
if the value is part of a post form then you want to check request.forms or request.querystring if it s a get form

1750972
versioning	upgrade
although i am using drupal since the d4 series i only started developing professionally for it with d6 so - despite i did various site upgrade - i was never faced by the task of having to port my own code to a new versioning

1750995
stdout	stderr
i tried blocking the sigchld signal in my script i tried closing and or redirecting stdout stderr stdin which are duplicated on fork but you never know - no success

1751027
soaplib	suds
i read that i can use libraries like soaplib suds and zsi

1751032
move	drag
right now i have move to processing of drag drop

1751051
hide	show
inspired by adam a s comment you could hide the animation when the user is leaving the page through form submit is the normal route i would suspect so if when coming back to the page the animation isn t show

1751121
equals	tostring
so methods on value objects - such as equals hashcode tostring should always be tested using the real object

1751190
post	get
but if i ll use the same code in customer validator in asp.net it...pop ups the msg that please select maximum of three items..but after it the page get post back to server...that should not happen.

1751232
intersect	contains	union	distinct
this provider supports skip only over ordered queries returning entities or projections that contains all identity columns where the query is a single-table non-join query or is a distinct except intersect or union not concat operation

1751337
x86	mips
they are likely not corrupted but tools that expect x86 images as opposed to arm mips etc may give that misleading error when they encounter images compiled for a different processor

1751360
width	height
this way your background picture has always got the same size as the width of the screen and the height will allways have the right size

1751368
integer	unsigned
if the destination type is unsigned the resulting value is the least unsigned integer congruent to the source integer modulo 2 n where n is the number of bits used to represent the unsigned type

1751404
division	multiplication
there are different instructions for multiplication and division for signed integers

1751404
subtraction	addition
although addition and subtraction remains the same read the wikipedia link and you ll understand

1751415
restrict	shared
resource needs - given some of the drupal-7 threads it looks like they are likely to go up so this should be evaluated before porting smaller sites that sit on a shared restrict hosting account

1751415
versioning	upgrade
latest versioning first - this one is rather obvious and always stressed in the upgrade guides but nevertheless worth mentioning upgrade core and all modules to their latest current versioning first before doing a major upgrade as the upgrade code is highly likely to depend on the latest table data structures to work correctly

1751417
actualheight	actualwidth
for example suppose you want your vm to be aware of the actualwidth and actualheight properties of your view

1751448
accessor	properties
when i try to serialize this to xml i get an error the properties or indexer persistentobject.id cannot be used in this context because the set accessor is inaccessible

1751462
integer	unsigned
logical bit pattern bits of value-representation values of binary digits can only be preserved if the original signed value was non-negative because negative values cannot be represented by an unsigned integer variable

1751466
post	get
the only way browser and server can communicate is either via get request or post request over http protocol

1751553
int	boolean
i override the public boolean ontap int index in itemizedoverlay to detect taps on the markers but it seems inaccurate

1751563
put	get
of course you can put some settings in the database but you program will still need a config file to get the db connection string unless you hard-code it which is of course not recommended

1751578
post	get
mechanize is really great library as it s not just plain http get post request-and-fetch it s keeping track of cookies thus closely emulating real web browser behavior

1751623
jlist	jtree
basically i would like to create similar thing like here changing jlist row color at runtime but for jtree

1751653
division	modulo
if has a loop using a goto and processes the number using the modulo - set a - and integer division - set a - operators and some if statements to build up the hex string

1751680
int	chars
however when looking in the documentation it says that the method characteratindex returns a chars not an int

1751708
implements	extends
extends what lost-theory has said if you want to use comet for a passing messages between clients then you need to implements something like pubsub

1751710
mouseout	mouseup	mouseout	mousedown	mouseover	mouseup	mouseover	mousedown	mouseover	mousemove	mouseover	mouseout	mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mousemove	mouseout	mouseup	mousedown
but looking through the v3 api documentation it seems as if google has implemented click doubleclick mousemove mousedown and mouseup as event triggers but no hover or mouseover or mouseout

1751714
unsigned	short
characteratindex returns unichar which is an unsigned short

1751729
free	malloc
you need to use malloc and free to allocate your morse code string or used a fixed-size character array and copy directly into that

1751730
put	get
the best way to get around that and avoid ambiguity is to put a notes or labels on the diagram that explain the detail

1751784
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
the app is trying to treat your uiviewcontroller like a uinavigationcontroller which it s not

1751784
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
subclass the root view controller as uinavigationcontroller instead of uiviewcontroller

1751791
metaphone	soundex
you might consider using the levenshtein similar-text soundex or metaphone functions

1751802
google-chrome	firefox
note multi-process browsers include google-chrome ie8 and firefox 3.5 although ie8 does something funky to work around the multi-process problem when it s working

1751846
spaces	delimiter
the only reason to waste spaces on delimiter is when the data is variable length

1751849
minimum	max
so i use the formula you have in your second query to first calculate the bounds -- the four lat long values at the extremes of the allowed radius then take those bounds and do a simple query to find the matches within them less than the max lat long more than the minimum lat long

1751874
pull	push
doesn t have to be a named branch you can simply have multiple unnamed heads or named heads using bookmark though those still aren t perfect because currently they don t show up with push pull clone

1751920
post	get
will post answer when i get a response

1751932
firefox	safari
i m trying to create a unordered list with each li element having it s own background image no text just image but i m having trouble in firefox at least it works in safari getting the link to work

1751958
versioning	upgrade
the company i am working for is currently using td versioning 5.1 and considering upgrade to td 5.2 next year

1751958
mouse	keyboard
the code editing is possible even without mouse since there is a number of handy keyboard shortcuts

1751960
inherited	properties
no opacity is not a button properties it s inherited from whatever the form is set to

1751966
inotifypropertychanged	icommand
because there is nothing like inotifypropertychanged for icommand objects i am forced to call commandmanager.invalidaterequerysuggested to force wpf to reconsider all of my command objects canexecute states yes i actually do need to do this otherwise none of these controls become disabled

1751970
folder	directory
a file or folder in your application directory can create a conflict with the python-twitter library

1752140
division	multiplication
i did some speed testing to figure out what is the fastest when doing multiplication or division on numbers

1752140
division	multiplication
i got nonsensical results such as a massive loop operating in 2 microseconds or that multiplication was the same speed as division if only that were true

1752140
multiplying	division	int	double
multiplying to divide using double seems the fastest way to do a division followed by int division

1752164
width	height
note that even though i cannot see the video when i listen to the onmetadata of the stream i can get plenty of information about the video such as width height fps changes during playback as if a video is shown number of decoded frames

1752165
division	logarithm	division	multiplication
there are lots of ways to perform certain arithmetic so there might not be a single answer shifting fractional multiplication actual division some round-trip through a logarithm unit etc

1752171
slideup	slidedown
when slideup slidedown animations only work one way it is often a positioning bug

1752171
children	parent
either the element you are animating needs to be set to position relative or the children of the element have a float applied to them and are not giving the parent element true height

1752174
width	height
either make the popup element absolutely positioned and move it offscreen when invisible or maybe try to make it 0px width and 0px height when invisible

1752178
folder	directory
if you need the directory to be within your solution folder somehow maybe you should refer to the directory your executable resides in ... solutiondir bin debug which you can get using

1752209
floating-point	integer
also if you have integer sources and need an integer result make sure to include the cost of conversion between integer and floating-point in your benchmarking

1752223
children	parent
from what i have now the children display the same information as the parent

1752251
direct3d	directx
an interesting choice might be slimdx which is a slim wrapper around direct3d sort of like managed directx once was

1752263
stringbuilder	printwriter
it looks like the simplest thing is to call printstacktrace x where x subclasses a printstream or printwriter and gathers it to a stringbuilder and can return a string

1752319
disk	ram
specifically instead of writing the data to disk immediately or soon after i call write linux will store the written data in ram and then at some later time i suspect when the 2gb of ram starts to get full it will suddenly try to write out several hundred megabytes of cached data to the disk all at once

1752320
ubuntu	linux
the example i m thinking about is libnotify which enables for notification of messages with or without image and title this can for instance be found in ubuntu linux 9.04

1752322
width	height
if that doesn t work try extending buttonfield overriding layout and calling setextent width height with the width and height that you want

1752325
pull	push
note that you ll likely want to perform these operations in a local branch so that you don t inadvertently push them to your friend s master branch or your friend doesn t pull them into his master branch

1752353
set	bag
to handle more than one level deep for eager fetching you ll need to use a set instead of a bag or list

1752355
sorting	filtering
currently we are filtering and sorting data with a datatable

1752378
hash	md5
using a hash like md5 or sha on the id is not a good idea

1752416
post	get
i ve tried several iterations on what i ve seen done elsewhere including several post here but i have yet to get this to work properly

1752418
bids	ssis
recently i got a chance to transferred the jobs from sql server 2000 to sql server 2005 using ssis bids

1752434
post	get
request.isajaxrequest is returning true for the edit method that accepts http get but false for edit method accepting http post

1752436
stdout	stderr
ipc open2 ipc open3 to start a program while getting its stdout stderr via a file handle

1752459
put	get
the idea of a self documenting rest api is that one can be given a single entry point into a system and be able to discover all functionality available through the returned documents combined with understanding of standard usage of the rest verbs get put delete

1752459
post	put
by convention if you had permission you could update the employee bob using put against employee 132 or create a new employee with a post to employee

1752497
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in ie and firefox but not in safari and google-chrome

1752497
google-chrome	safari
in safari google-chrome it does not

1752497
google-chrome	safari
which for some bloody reason wouldn t work in google-chrome safari

1752508
rss	feed
and consider the rss feed where you get html embedded in the xml

1752543
sorting	filtering
datasources also provide a nice way to handle sorting filtering and pagination

1752543
linqdatasource	objectdatasource	sqldatasource	linqdatasource	sqldatasource	objectdatasource
and usually you end up tying your web ui to your persistence implementation sqldatasource linqdatasource etc or you end up using objectdatasource which sucks because it is so limited requires you to hard-code class names and method names into your aspx and uses reflection somewhat inefficiently

1752555
keydown	keyup
you can increment a counter for each keydown event and decrement it for each keyup event

1752603
versioning	upgrade
if the next versioning of either software changes its internals you could get different query results after you upgrade

1752603
min	max
the row where sequence is max or the row where sequence is min

1752604
super	abstract	super	implements
then implements your two behaviours in two different classes which share whatever they need of an abstract super type

1752618
sqldatasource	objectdatasource
2-way databinding was probably written with sqldatasource in mind and not objectdatasource

1752619
rss	feed
good web developers design their html with search engines in mind and often also provide things like rss feed and site maps to make it easier to crawl content

1752653
udp	tcp
assuming this is tcp not udp you can think of the socket as a stream of bytes

1752653
put	get
the sender can put them in in whatever way he wants and you can get them out in whatever way you want

1752681
fileoutputstream	filewriter
edit i m assuming here that you are writing files using fileoutputstream filewriter and the like

1752691
ant	maven
you should use a tool to compile like ant ou maven

1752697
hide	show
when you select one of the layouts you have saved vswindowmanager will automatically hide show and rearrange windows so they are in the exact same layout as before

1752722
post	get
you would allow post get post is more secure to the php file and would then run an http post get request from c#

1752727
bindingsource	dataview
use a filtered dataview and then set your datagridview s bindingsource to the filtered dataview

1752734
int	chars
int getgroovyname int grooovyid chars pgroovyname int bufsize

1752734
int	chars
basically you pass it an id int a chars buffer with memory pre-allocated and the size of the buffer passed in

1752738
vim	emacs
so i would like to learn how it can be done effectively using may be emacs or vim + other tools

1752767
post	get
i can get the .lic file to copy to the regular project s bin directory with either a post build or build action but the actual test itself doesnt seem to be running from there but from a constantly changing out directory

1752793
accessor	properties
even tho c++ doesnt support properties accessor by simulating them we dont only make readibility better or provide encapsulation but we provide control mechanism to set a value to a variable or we get calculated value for a variable

1752795
post	get
i have this old perl script that is supposed to act as a proxy of sorts between http-based clients and non-http java server the client post some data to this perl script and the script would in turn call the java server get the response and return it to the client

1752795
post	get
judging by the description spawn_proc_prog from apache2 subprocess could do the trick pass the post data as stdin to the child process and get back the child process output but it doesn t seem to work if i run anything but another perl script

1752804
fink	macports
if you ve installed another version of libxml2 make sure your path is set such that its xml2-config will be found first by the imagemagick configure script so ensuring most likely one of usr local bin opt local bin macports or sw bin fink comes before usr bin on path

1752816
many-to-many	one-to-many
i m bulding a user and contat management and i ve managed to get a working many-to-many relationship between contact and group pojo in my environment with either hsql or mysql 5.0.51 but not on a local test server .because of that i ld like t try the double one-to-many association so there are few things i would like to ask about that mapping with the introduction of an intermediary model

1752854
mstest	typemock
the way i have gotten the tests to run via partcover is to make partcover run the typemock runner which in turn runs mstest

1752854
folder	directory
working directory a folder that already exists

1752879
postgresql	mysql
i owe you a half option if you re not bound to mysql postgresql could offer a interesting alternative table inheritance

1752879
postgresql	mysql
one final word about mysql and postgresql

1752879
postgresql	mysql
postgresql is a database that imho in most aspects is today superior to mysql is just not that famous

1752879
postgresql	mysql
and no i m not just a postgresql fanboy i m a senior mysql user i started using mysql with a version 2.something i introduced it more than 10 years ago in the company i still work for and made it the default database and today i don t allow any new development i can decide to be based on mysql

1752885
perforce	svn
i have a project with 250000+ lines of codes 10 dylibs helpfile all in an svn perforce etc

1752919
width	height
additionally it shows you the width and height of the innermost box and the x and y offset of the element relative to its parent

1752967
mockups	balsamiq
i ve also used balsamiq mockups in recent project to whip together web app screens and the screen mockups have formed a vital part of the project specs -- very quick to produce and they convey a lot of information about how the screens should work that is quite hard to convey in a text document

1752995
folder	directory
the safest way if it is an option you are using windows auth is to make it a non-issue by using active directory rights on the folder so it doesn t matter if the user attempts to access a directory that is not valid

1753002
children	parent
your problem stems from the fact that both your parent and children are of the same type

1753002
children	parent
if you had a parent task that had a collection of children and the children were of a different type than the parent then you would be cool

1753002
children	parent
because you could provide a different template for the children than the parent

1753023
pop-up	dialog
for each part i want to add a small button pop-up as dialog which will convert that part to a dialog on-demand and then when closing the dialog to return back to the form with the new inputs

1753023
pop-up	dialog
the pop-up parts works fine - the sub-form converts into a dialog

1753028
hash	salt
few days back i saw an sample application where the hash and the salt was generated on the client system whenever a new user was created and then the salt password and the hash is transmitted to the server where they are stored in sql server

1753040
hash	salt
storing the salt unencrypted in the database next to the hash passwords is not a problem

1753040
hash	salt
when you have a salt and hash data the best you can do to reverse it is brute force provided that the hash function is cryptographically secure

1753041
width	height
letters tend to use a constant ratio between width and height

1753041
width	height
with two lines you can calculate the height of the complete letter and thus get a good estimation of the matching width

1753082
range	max	range	min	min	max
with the first example showing that i is between the min and max elements and the second example being that i falls outside the range between the elements

1753093
min	max
if i is less than min and more than max

1753093
min	max
if min is less than is and is is less than max

1753139
width	height
you are right span does not honour width and height however it does sort of honour padding

1753177
cas	shibboleth
with saml you can communicate between the major single sign on ss0 technologies like cas openid shibboleth ad ldap.

1753206
jlist	jtextfield	jlist	jlabel	jtextfield	jlabel
a time-tracking program can start out extremely simple a simple jtextfield a jlist some jlabel and a button or two but you can literally add hundreds of features to familiarize yourself with different parts of the api

1753266
post	get
i don t believe the original intention of the http spec was to confine all data editing submissions to post and all retrievals to get

1753271
boost	allocator
and trace the allocator you ll find that one object a boost signals detail signal_base_impl iterator allocated at line 75 of boost lib signals src signal_base.cpp is not freed up

1753299
svm	kernlab
i am trying to use the kernlab r package to do support vector machines svm

1753334
put	get
the udp server will then get this file a video put it into a datagram and send it

1753339
pop-up	dialog
once a user clicks on the link an inline pop-up dialog with an image for the id from the database is displayed next to the id link which was clicked

1753364
opera	firefox
ie 6 7 firefox opera and safari.

1753482
sqldependency	sqlcachedependency
then use sqldependency or sqlcachedependency to cache the data in a way that it can be updated on multiple servers if the db changes

1753503
post	get
this means that if a post response includes cache-control or expires or given a strict reading of section 13 even a validator like last-modified or etag the response can be used to satisfy future get requests

1753522
scrollable	panels
how can i add asp panels inside calendar1_dayrender e.cells so that when there are many items in the lists it would make that cells scrollable instead of stretching the calendar

1753554
post	get
here s a post to get your started on the dependency injection pattern

1753554
post	get
here s a so post on mocking frameworks to get you started

1753582
post	get
edit sorry realized you were using get not post

1753604
profiling	instrumentation
if for some reason you can t such as there is no profiling available in the apache modpython that is running your django your best bet might be simply to instrumentation your program with logging

1753612
post	get
if you already have the post object to get the number of comments you just need to call comments.count

1753644
post	get
just if you implement a way to validate the swf itself at the site like using get or post variables

1753644
post	get
the get or post validation will grant access to the file to the right request so if someone understands the scheme it ll be able to request the file from any browser

1753648
postgresql	mysql
for compatibility with postgresql mysql also supports the limit row_count offset offset syntax

1753650
post	get
in your scenario you could also just choose to make your form s method get instead of post

1753723
opera	safari
it looks aligned equally in moz opera ie8 safari but not in ie7

1753739
jobs	cron
also when there s schedule changes just create too many cron jobs that cover the regular times and the different times then have the job check to see if this is a valid time to start

1753744
width	height
use grid as the content to window and put everything inside that and don t put height and width with your controls

1753744
width	height
for your grid also give columdefinition s width and rowdefinition s height in proportion not in exact term

1753776
portrait	landscape
eg- i am saving photo from the photo library into the application but how can i know that photo in landscape mode or portrait mode

1753801
width	height
when working with a landscape photo the photo width is greater than the photo height

1753801
width	height
when working with a portrait photo the height is greater than the width

1753808
cvs	svn
note i am asking from your general perspective meaning you should not try to associate this with your preferred svn cvs tools or programming languages but rather think of it as something that should can be applied to any tools and programming languages

1753818
haskell	scheme
as to your specific question i generally prefer embedded domain specific languages that is dsl-like constructs embedded in a host language such as ruby with its object oriented metaprogramming scheme with its macros or haskell combinator libraries since it give you the full power of the host language for free

1753850
integer	unsigned
the negative value for pointer value might appear because of incorrect interpretation of unsigned integer as a signed integer

1753851
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git	bazaar	cvs	cvs	svn
i ve used cvs svn bazaar and git in that order of introduction and i d have to say for students that svn is the way to go

1753884
base	fractions
run from the command line supplying the base number first then the series of fractions presented as numbers with space separation like the following

1753897
white-box	assertions
i haven t found exactly what i m looking for so it seems to me that i should either rely on mox as i ve done often in the past which basically means mocking each subsystem used in a given test and setting up all expectations c strong but lots of work each time and very sensitive to the tested-code s internals very white-box y or rolling my own simulation of each subsystem and doing assertions on the simulated subsystems states as part of the unit tests

1753920
ienumerable	icollection
this works fine if the ienumerable list is the same type as the icollection i m trying to add it to

1753964
folder	directory
could not be found the web-site only builds if i set the directory as pictures which is where the pictures are and pictures is in the same folder as default.aspx which the above code is at

1754007
free	malloc
be careful not to call malloc free new delete inside your tracker or be able to detect the recursion etc -

1754007
put	get
and i forgot if you put your tracker in a dll you will probably need to loadlibrary or dlopen etc yourself to up your reference count so that you don t get removed from memory prematurely

1754080
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
i m not sure how accurate the msdn documentation is on sortedlist and sorteddictionary

1754080
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
each test operates on a sortedlist sorteddictionary containing 10 000 int32 keys

1754080
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
however you would expect the memory usage of a sortedlist to be equal or greater than or at least equal to a sorteddictionary

1754113
spaces	linefeed
i need to parse a file of this format such that i can get fetch the values present in place of those tags by avoiding linefeed or n carriage return 0r r spaces

1754192
uilabel	uitextview
if it is not exactly what you want you can customize your cell by adding uitextview or maybe several uilabel to it as a subview s

1754219
post	get
you would normally do a post or get from the flash movie using the url of a php or whatever page you have on your server

1754219
post	get
the server page would then process the parameters in the post or get

1754237
post	get
anyway i m trying to get an infinite loop going with divs scrolling through a window the other post has an image and the code below works

md5 hash because setcookie does urlencode automaticly and thereby possibly changing the hash

1759043
post	get
a possible solution instead of having the nested form add an onclick event to the form2 button which will call a js method that could get your specific items val2 input in this case from form1 and using ajax or simply xmlhttprequests to perform the desired post methods

1759056
width	margin
the width 100 on #top-panel refers to the width of the div s content area excluding borders padding and margin

1759072
strlen	substr	multibyte	substr
you are using multibyte strings and strlen is not mb aware use the idioms substr session 0 -32 to get the payload part of the string

1759072
multibyte	substr
maybe substr doesn t cope with multibyte strings too use explicitally mb_substr or whatever it is called

1759096
tinyint	boolean
mysql tinyint 1 converts directly to .net boolean and back when using the mysql connector .net

1759111
calloc	malloc
you may want to consider calloc rather than malloc

1759117
hash	salt
in my limited experience you would take the user s inputted password hash it with a salt the same salt used to hash the stored password and compare with the stored hash value

1759130
calloc	malloc
you weren t checking the return value of malloc now calloc but same rules apply

1759130
calloc	malloc
if you don t want to use calloc for this reason here s a version that does the same thing with malloc

1759166
post	get
if you are asking how do you post and reuse the same view as a get and run javascript only on the post than the short answer is you don t

1759172
post	get
i ll try to post a working example of my problem if i can get it to fail using a small set of simple code

1759236
overwrite	preserve
all the databases are on the same server and i don t need to preserve the old data just overwrite it

1759249
pop-up	dialog
my guess here is that your custom action isn t calling out correctly to the msiexec.exe and thus causing the help options dialog to pop-up

1759292
ubuntu	debian
the debian guide can be quite useful when it comes to ubuntu

1759305
daemons	launchd
i have a daemons running on dbus that offers service for launchd applications

1759325
gridview	objectdatasource
i have a gridview that has a datasourceid pointing to an objectdatasource

1759337
int	double
the string 1 for example would be parsable to byte sbyte int uint long ulong float double and decimal

1759408
for-loop	loops
then you nest an identical for-loop inside the first loops which is currently also completely wrong iterating over the filename once again

1759481
inherited	subclassing
then you can annotate the base type with that annotation then all subclassing would inherited the annotation as well

1759663
sorting	filtering
easy to skin and customise with some great features out of the box like filtering sorting and ajax support

1759711
versioning	upgrade	uninstall	upgrade
if you don t configure your upgrade to uninstall previous versioning of your product then the component will not be removed although its files may be overwritten

1759719
button	checkbox
in advanced data datagrid with columns checkbox textfield textarea button radiobutton

1759739
hide	show
i know i can find the behavior and call show and hide

1759776
vim	textmate	textmate	radrails
unless radrails three is light-years ahead of the latest release though you ll be missing out on a lot of very handy advantages of using a more community-supported solution such as vim or textmate

1759788
uploadify	swfupload
i tried uploadify and swfupload and it was quite easy getting them to work

1759820
client-side	server-side
oop consistency seamless data exchange and native object representation between server-side and client-side modules that is given a function on the client-side clientfoo and a function on the server-side serverfoo one should be able to pass an object obj of any type t without requiring any marshalling

1759820
client-side	server-side
basically it should be entirely irrelevant whether a given class or a given instance resides on the client-side or the server-side

1759838
accessor	properties
the get accessor problem was only with the early version of the interop library and i think a common misunderstanding of the usage of the range object and the range properties in c#

1759842
post	get
this blog post from scott guthrie has links to several resources to help you get started

1759880
ready	each
i understand what s going on in the program but i m ready to start extending it and i expect to be sending a reasonable variety of packet types each represented as a struct

1759898
put	get
edit re your last example if you have only 1 consumer you will never get rid of the object on the queue - unless it s updated in the mean time - in which case you d better be very very careful about thread safety and probably shouldn t have put the item in the queue anyway

1759945
unsigned	short
you could try converting it to an unsigned short and then print just the last four hex digits

1759985
inherited	properties
but by this way it inherited all the public methods and properties of usercontrol

1760030
fadein	fadeout
ok after reading a little more about the animate fadein fadeout and fadeto i understood that i don t need to use filter alpha for ie as jquery already supports it

1760030
fadein	fadeout
knowing that i made a test using fadein and fadeout now online and it works but there is a problem if you hover in and out several times it continues repeating the animation

1760035
getter	setter
not directly you need a pair getter setter with an addlistener removelistener interface of some sort.

1760040
getter	setter
first use setter and getter like so

1760076
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade to the most recent beta of firebug and have the most recent non-beta versioning of firefox and still no dice

1760132
getter	setter
still on luke s track i propose now a simple way to add encapsulated fields and the respective getter setter to objects by the means of a simple function call

1760150
put	get
the catch is that i get it all as one long string and it s not always immediately obvious where to put the linebreaks

1760178
fgets	fgetc
like fgetc fgets recieve a enter as

1760199
google-chrome	firefox
but oddly in firefox google-chrome it isn t quite the same as demonstrated by his example with stateful expressions that are used multiple times

1760254
maven	pom.xml
i just updated the maven plugin to work with 2.2.0 -- the updated pom.xml are attached to the code review bug

1760276
pop-up	dialog
if you want to avoid the risk of a pop-up blocker consider instead using the iframe within an inline dialog within your application

1760283
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the following snippet has been tested on firefox safari and google-chrome open the console and move between tabs back and forth

1760301
getter	setter
like any good class it has both data and behavior and i don t mean getter and setter

1760373
pop-up	dialog
4 then right click on the selection and go to source- clean up... or any other source submenu item like organize imports and the dialog that pop-up will tell you how many source files it is about to change

1760426
ilist	icollection	ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	icollection
you could accept an ienumerable t parameter and internally check if it is in fact an icollection t or ilist t and optimize accordingly

1760438
ilist	icollection	ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	icollection
if you have a look at how linq extension methods are implemented using reflector you can see that a few extension methods on ienumerable t such as count attempt to cast the sequence to an icollection t or an ilist t to optimize the operation for example using the icollection t .count property instead of iterating through an ienumerable t and counting the elements

1760438
ilist	icollection	ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	icollection
so your best bet is most likely to accept an ienumerable t and then do this kind of optimizations if icollection t or ilist t are available

1760470
ienumerable	ilist
with three versions as you propose you lose the efficiency benefit if someone passes you a runtime ilist t that the compiler statically considers an ienumerable t

1760474
ilist	icollection	ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	icollection
since ilist t inherits from icollection t and ienumerable t and icollection t inherits from ienumerable t your only concern would be performance in ienumerable t types

1760474
ienumerable	ilist
i just see no reason to overload the function in that way providing different signatures to achieve exactly the same result and accepting exactly the same types as parameter no matter if you have an ienumerable t or ilist t you would be able to pass it to any of the three overloads

1760506
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
safari and ie treat literals as per es4 but firefox and google-chrome appear to treat them as per es3

1760590
for-loop	loops
you re also looking for-loop joins in your batches so if you still get hash joins then either force loops joins or reduce the batch size

1760591
int	chars
i don t know if you re still doing chars int but i ran into the same error and my problem was that i tried to make a length 11 vector but fusion_max_vector_size was 10

1760603
public	protected
the decision of making these variables and methods of the base class private protected or even public is a case by case issue

1760603
public	protected
for example the base class could have a public method a protected method and or data and a few private methods

1760623
vcproj	csproj
i make sln files for each sub-module a few vcproj csproj which are related so that i don t have to open a big large sln file to view the project

1760623
vcproj	csproj
i avoid the problem by just splitting the vcproj csproj into different sln s and use a build server to build

1760627
postgresql	mysql
i suspect it s because of differences in how postgresql handles group by clauses compared to mysql

1760643
width	height
but am unsure of the syntax for changing more than one visibility width height and font-color

1760644
stdout	stderr
in case the exception bubbles back all the to the main function and if said exception isn t caught there either a default handler deals with it typically by printing out the exception to stderr stdout and halting

1760644
try-catch	exception-handling
the way this exception-handling could be caught would be with a try-catch construct as in

1760646
uitableview	uisearchbar
i create a uitableview in the initialisation and want to add it to the sub view when - void searchbartextdidbeginediting uisearchbar searchbar

1760658
mergesort	heapsort	quicksort	heapsort	quicksort	mergesort
it 1 uses mergesort rather than quicksort or heapsort for two reasons

1760658
quicksort	mergesort
mergesort is a stable sort and typically the efficient quicksort implementations are not

1760702
getter	setter
codedom which is basically generated and then compiled code nhibernate generates wrapper getter setter code for your entities and then compiles it

1760706
ubuntu	linux
i have few years of exp on linux mainly ubuntu dual-boot

1760753
stdout	stderr
alternatively and if you want to only handle stdout stderr which is common run your program through the standard unix tee program or the equivalent on your platform either by doing it yourself when invoking the program or within the program by forking setting up the streams as appropriate etc

1760783
children	parent
in the example you give you have a parent of object type information with a collection of children object type detail and the collection of detail children on the parent is called child

1760783
children	parent
so we do a template for the children and then one for the parent

1760783
children	parent
because the parent and child are of a different object type the tree view will grab the parent template which has an items source and when it comes to draw the children it will use th child data template

1760815
children	parent
what we d like to do is have a parent web app which is shared by all children web apps

1760827
firefox	safari
if it creates the same or similar markup in all browsers i tested this in safari and firefox then this should do what you want

1760839
hex	binary
in your message handler callback you don t want probably don t want to continue to manipulate the data as raw binary hex data but instead interpret the information in a meaningful fashion according to the message type

1760861
public	protected
personally i like to have public at top protected and then private

1760867
public	protected
personally i prefer putting public methods first followed by protected methods following by private methods

1760869
public	protected
public before protected before private

1760880
public	protected
the code should flow and using a rather artificial ordering based on accessibility public private protected etc

1760888
put	get
assuming i have this class what do i put in the dopost method to get either the file path or the actual file contents

1760923
disk	ram
this way even if the write to disk stalls the program can continue to read incoming data and buffer it in ram

1760924
atomic	interlocked
the atomic ie memory manipulated with the interlocked functions doing stuff like lock cmpxchg is only atomic with respect to itself not other memory

1760925
public	protected
i generally agree with the public protected private order as well as the static data member data member functions order

1760925
getter	setter
though i sometimes group like members getter setter i generally prefer listing members within a group alphabetically so that they can be located more easily

1760954
getter	setter
you don t need to use synthesize keyword in the implementation file if you provide appropriate getter setter

1760954
getter	setter
or you can use either synthesize foo to inform the compiler to generate getter setter for you or dynamic to inform the compiler that these methods will be available at runtime - both in the implementation file

1761003
ascx	scriptmanager
i was creating a custom ascx control and wanted to be able to not worry about whether or not the calling page had the scriptmanager declared

1761024
dreamweaver	aptana
another free tool remember dreamweaver will cost you at least a few hundred unless you steal it is aptana ide

1761039
put	get
go back to when i learned html 4 from a book and practice incidentally the common place thing was html tables css was new and had widely disparate implementations and i spent more time trying to figure out how to get around browser bugs than i did most other things put together and that was less than a decade ago

1761069
ready	each
so you re going to have to create a buffer string to append each number to until you re ready to print the line

1761080
pull	push
we re using gitosis where devs push to and pull from

1761105
installation	upgrade
i ve recently upgrade my ubuntu installation from jaunty to karmic

profiler	yourkit
yourkit is probably the best java profiler in the market right now

1761132
implements	extends
more than getting something to just work - your friend s point a well designed oo design is easier to understand to follow to expand to extends and to implements

1761143
converter	multibinding
this is extremely simple to do except for the c# parser just implement providevalue by constructing a multibinding that uses a converter and builds the appropriate validation structure

1761153
put	get
if you get this to work however you solve it put it on your resume

1761192
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade my xcode to the latest versioning today my iphonesdk os was 2.2.1 previously

1761192
installation	upgrade
i was alerted during installation i can upgrade xcode but iphonesdk cannot be upgrade

1761201
hmac	pbkdf2
pbkdf2 with hmac sha1

1761214
put	get
you definitely need to find a way to get a primary key onto your tables - if you don t have anything that you can use per se add a column id of type int identity 1 1 to it and put the primary key on that column

1761228
pbkdf2	hash
pbkdf2 requires a pseudo-random function and in this case a message authentication code based on the sha-1 hash is used mdash

1761237
websphere	ibm
i have the server side of ibm s websphere mq version 6 on a virtual machine running windows server 2003 sitting on a vista desktop

1761259
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
but my software doesnot works good or ubuntu and debian linux because they want .deb file

1761273
min	max
then use rand with a min and max corresponding to your array keys to select an item from the array

1761278
width	height
use the height and width properties of your forms

1761278
width	height
where formwidthpixels and formheightpixels are the width and height in pixels you want your forms

1761312
principalcontext	directoryentry
i would like the code to be using directoryentry and not principalcontext if possible as i m not sure if my app will be using .net 3.5 on all the servers

1761380
xna	spritebatch
yes you can load a shader file hlsl up to and including shader model 3 in xna and call spritebatch with using it

1761404
ubuntu	debian
you can also use debootstrap package to create debian ubuntu chroot and build .deb package inside it

1761405
post	get
it also includes being comfortable with http get and post restfulness and how to persist information between page loads cookies sessions url params

1761406

i ve read almost all of the vsto doco on msdn particularly the application add-in architecture and vsto runtime overview as well as various other articles and discussions on the topic

1761421
versioning	upgrade
let s assume that i m doing some sort of nontrivial change to my database which requires custom work to upgrade from versioning a to b

1761421
versioning	upgrade
the first logical obstacle would of course be that the deployment utility would not know whether any such logic needs to be updated - i d assume i could provide the logic for this as well check a versioning table and if the latest versioning is 5.0 execute this upgrade later adding a new versioning row

1761448
post	get
edit this post assumes you already do obvious things like take advantage of tail recursion to get rid of the unnecessary call overhead

1761448
quicksort	shellsort
for additional performance you should always switch your quicksort to shellsort for small list segments - i ve seen lengths from 15-100 chosen as the cutoff

1761456
chunked	transfer-encoding
the problem i m having is that depending on client the response may be recived as seen through fiddler as chunked transfer-encoding

1761485
filtering	grouping
this way you grouping it twice but filtering it only once

1761510
chunked	transfer-encoding
transfer-encoding chunked is defined for http 1.1

1761520
gif	png
these bytes will be invisible in your text editor but server will send these few extra bytes to the browser before the jpeg gif png data

1761619
hash	md5
now that i know there is a network hop between the files i would say just use an md5 hash and be done with it

1761637
firefox	safari
this is happening in firefox and ie but not safari

1761650
submit	submission
instead of submission data by row you submit them by whole column

1761678
disk	ram
i guess you could switch off ram areas which aren t in use but current oss use free ram as a hard disk cache so you won t find much free ram that can be switched off

1761696
getter	setter
i don t have to remember to initialize in the base class on every new property getter setter

1761709
disk	ram
unless you re using a really complicated and or slow hash loading the data from the disk is going to take much longer than computing the hash unless you use ram disk or top-end ssds

1761776
stdout	stderr
stdin stdout and stderr respectively

1761780
stdout	stderr
0 1 and 2 are stdin stdout and stderr respectively

1761797
qmail	exim
the easier route is to run a local mailserver such as postfix exim or qmail and set it up to send mail through a remote server

1761800
lisp	prolog	erlang	lisp
i d suggest lisp for functional programming for historical reasons or erlang for a more commercial language and prolog for declarative a.k.a logical programming

1761800
imperative	declarative
there are a lot of programmers that keep getting surprised by the possibilities of functional programming ability to prove a function right easy parallel integration no side effects etc as well as the possibilities of declarative programming for certain task that are just now well suited for imperative programming patter recognition for example or rule based systems

1761807
haskell	scheme	erlang	scheme

post	get
how to get this piece of info ex post especially years later is most likely not possible

1761869
post	get
when i check the stream it is all fine and is completely loaded in post request but then i get following error

1761893
folder	directory
you can give the directory writer access or change the destination path to one user folder like the my documents or an app directory

1761900
getter	setter
in this case don t you have to map every other classes and check the setter getter especially for boolean

1761927
width	height
make a div height 100 of the page width 100 of the page

1761930
websphere	ibm
we are currently building an application that needs to communicate to some ibm websphere queues

1761935
width	height
from what i understand what you want is to change the width height of the component at run-time

1761935
width	height
in this case you need to give an id to the hbox add a script block and call the width height setter on your block

1761942
wordpress	joomla
me too don t get any advantages for joomla it s big system and it just as good as wordpress for regular projects just wordpress is much simplier

1761987
post	put
i posted a similar post to this before but since then i have done some research and thought i d put this one out again to see if anyone maybe has any thoughts on my problem

1762029
bmp	png	tiff	png	tiff	bmp
formats like png bmp jpeg tiff and

hide	show
here s a simplified version that show the first two lines and hide the rest

1762070
opensuse	linux
can anyone give me the right direction for this as i am not able to find the declaration of eperm in either pthread.h or errno.h on opensuse linux

1762081
equals	gethashcode
i believe you need to override gethashcode and equals in your entities

1762086
inherited	properties
only the controls that inherited from webcontrol will have a enabled properties

1762175
public	protected
we can redeclare the public and protected method but not private

1762182
wstring	wifstream	wstring	wofstream	wifstream	wofstream
use wstring instead of string wifstream instead of ifstream wofstream wcout etc

1762196
width	height
first you can use the static properties fullprimaryscreenheight fullprimaryscreenwidth of the system.windows.systemparameters class to get the height and width of the screen

1762196
width	height
then you can set the top and left properties of your popup control using the width and height before showing it

1762260
cpu	irq
so if your cpu gets interrupted to service hardware irq or if another cpu is reading the same memory it doesn t affect the result and these other operations will observe it as either completed or not started

1762313
put	get
put the timer out of the update-panel and get a trigger in the panel - win

1762321
post	get
this won t actually do the text replacement as noted in your post but it will get you further

1762325
moq	typemock
without using a mocking framework such as moq typemock rhinomocks that can verify your expectations i would look at parsing the stack trace

1762352
agile	sprint
with agile including scrum you have fixed schedule iterations or sprint and fixed quality level definition of done

1762399
innodb	myisam
when i restored the database i found that the table engine has changed to myisam whereas they were set to innodb

1762445
innodb	myisam
since innodb wasn t working it fell back to the myisam storage engine which doesn t support integrity constraints like foreign keys

1762445
innodb	myisam
basically the problem is that if the innodb engine fails to start for whatever reason usually configuration problems -- then mysql silently falls back to the myisam engine

1762445
innodb	myisam
then if innodb isn t active mysql will happily create a myisam table without even warning you

1762453
post	get
a blog post that helped get me this far

1762498
int	double
then have them see has passing int or double or whatever still allows it to work

1762498
int	double
from there you can have them pass in arrays of whatever type int double etc and have it sort the array from highest to lowest again encouraging experimentation

1762588
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
so i m thinking of using an md5 hash of the relevant data and a security salt hard coded into the app

but before you do that read what awt and swing are what is lightweight heavyweight paint update repaint and how layouts work

1762762
ant	maven
if you can access the tomcat manager application remotely then you can use the tomcat ant tasks or tomcat maven plugin to handle this

1762762
ant	maven
using either ant or maven also gives you the advantage of being able to deploy from outside of eclipse

1762762
ant	maven
my personal choice is maven but ant is equally capable in this area

1762763
post	get
i have tried both suggestions in the post but i just can t seem to get it to run the build error seems to skip the initializeworkspace

1762874
rss	feed
i need to download a web page and to see if the page contains any rss feed

1762891
ant	maven
if you don t like the plugin then you could use build tools like ant or maven they have good support for remote deployment trough the manager application as pointed out by chris

1762891
maven	cargo
i d just add cargo to the list tomcat remote deployment is only available with the maven 2 plugin though

1762950
margin	height
if that s not the case one image s height is 154 px the function adds a 6 px margin to the img so that the balance with the baseline grid is restored

1762987
rss	feed
i am pulling data from an rss feed

1762987

but whenever i replace the jar in the webinf lib folder of the war and restart the server it does not pick up the latest jar

1763104

1763144
ssl	https
but the invalid certificate message wonâ t go away since the ssl connection is accomplished before http is taking part since https is http over ssl tsl

1763166
boost	stl
i do not want to use any libraries other than stl so no boost either

1763167
folder	directory
currently the directory size of the repository is clearly much smaller than the source code folder

1763241
implements	extends
edit in this example objects implements sortedmap which extends map are accepted too so in your case you could create a baseinterface and extends that in the interfaces like acceptedinterface extends baseinterface you want to be accepted by your .register baseinterface arg method

1763284
sorting	grouping
however if you want to have features like sorting grouping drag-drop re-ordering of columns hiding and adding columns at run-time ajax support etc

1763292
in-house-distribution	enterprise
you can also use in-house-distribution with the enterprise program see here

1763304
3des	aes
older versions of the specification mentioned aes and 3des by name but i believe newer versions just specify strong encryption

1763326
put	get
to get this to work with xval you would need to put the dataannotations on the view model properties

1763328
hash	salt
instead hash it according to standard best practices with salt etc

1763388
int	chars
i would like to replace the chars at certain indices with if the int corresponding to that index meets some criteria

1763447
put	get
and also want to override put and get method

1763490
jquery	jqmodal	jqmodal	blockui
you could try blockui or jqmodal for jquery both very cool and easy to use

1763582
spaces	linefeed
s - matches whitespace spaces tab carriage return linefeed

1763603
firefox	safari
he mentioned that drag-and-drop support is going to be difficult because of the way safari firefox can t remember which one is used to run out-of-browser on the mac

1763655
hide	show
so i create two differents modelchoicefield one for politic and one for economic and i use hide show effects of jquery in my template like you say kugel

1763658
folder	directory
basically i want to store the just folder path and not the file so that when i display the path using hyperlink the user can open the directory

1763679
mouse	keyboard
i want to be able to keep keyboard focus set on the textbox irrespective of whether or not the auto-completion popup is open so that a user can continue typing whilst simultaneously using up down controls or the mouse to select elements in the popup to autocomplete the text

1763701
implements	extends
if you need it you could write an interface and extends observablecollection to implements it

1763791
stringbuilder	bufferedreader
you can use a bufferedreader to read the stream into a stringbuilder in a loop and then get the full contents from the stringbuilder

1763858
width	height
3 and 2 column full screen width height layouts css

1763968
sqldependency	sqlcachedependency
use sqldependency sqlcachedependency when you can but don t over-use

1764042
spaces	linefeed
if you want just white-space spaces tab carriage-return linefeed you can replace the pattern with

1764089
svm	k-means
as you have a working k-means implementation you could try one of the many variants to see if they yeild better results k-means++ perhaps seeing as you mentioned svm

1764115
jlabel	jlayeredpane
i am trying to add a jlayeredpane to a jpanel and then add an image jlabel icon and a button to the jlayeredpane but neither show up

1764185
stdout	stderr
it has the drawback that lines may not be displayed in order because stderr goes directly to the console while stdout first goes through an additional process

1764209
google-chrome	firefox
basically that means that none of javasript based rich text editors would work in a jquery dialog in firefox and btw google-chrome as well - thats a big bad issue i have tried two so far and that s how i started looking into this issue

1764237
visitor	crtp
you can reduce the amount of boilerplate copy-paste by implementing visitor with crtp

1764239
getter	setter
each member variable has a public getter and a setter function

1764239
getter	setter
functions which are passed an instance of bar will want to access m_foo so that they can call its getter and setter functions

1764270
getter	setter
it already is conceptually public anyway if you give bar getter and setter like you describe

1764270
getter	setter
this applies similarly to any getter setter pair where the getter returns a reference

1764363
post	get
also if you post your table structure you should get half a dozen examples within five minutes

1764364
post	get
in case this doesn t get answered properly i found an alternative to using findname documented in the post here

1764391
int	boolean
a boolean as resulting from comparisons such as is also an int with a value of 0 for false 1 for true so arithmetic such as summation works just fine

1764421
getter	setter
if you now anyway have such large classes with getter and setter i don t think its a problem to return the reference to that object after all there is still a layer in between - you essentially still have control over what is set get in foo

1764424
children	parent
this is not a real answer but since so many people seem to believe that win32 forbids creating children in other threads than the parent i feel obliged to post a demonstration to the contrary

1764428
getter	setter
each member variable has a public getter and a setter function

1764431
getter	setter
you can create forwarding getter and setter for every single getter or setter in foo

1764431
getter	setter
you can make the foo instances public or you can create a getter and setter for foo

1764431
getter	setter
this leads to variables that are actually private member variables of their classes and eliminates the need for setter and getter

1764492
switching	screens
have tried switching off the screens lock in settings but it ll still kick in after a springboard restart

1764540
firefox	safari
it works in all commonly found browsers ie6+ firefox safari etc..... and it seems the least dirty of all the possible techniques

1764544
getter	setter
getter and setter must match between flex and java value objects

1764555
button	checkbox
so as long as you re talking about normal button selects and checkbox i think this is normal

1764595
implements	extends
your other option other than using the html tags would be to extends the checkboxlist control and create your own custom control which implements a checkboxlist with embedded images

1764597
post	get
get post verbs among others

1764647
button	checkbox
check some checkbox and for it up date either a text for or a list box with the result on button click.

1764648
prepare	execute
prepare and execute the main string

1764671
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works great in safari firefox google-chrome etc

1764709
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
and indeed it does when i test it with the stand-alone flash player or all of these browsers firefox opera safari google-chrome flock.

1764714
vmware	esx
particularly if you are using one of the direct-on-the-metal vms like vmware esx

1764735
post	get
then there are post vs get requests which are similar but enough different to warrant a special dicussion

1764737
udp	tcp
a packet is a combination of the application layer data the transport layer header tcp or udp and the ip layer header the network layer takes the packet and turns it into a frame

1764737
udp	tcp
here are a few 25 for smtp 53 for dns udp for domain resolution and tcp for zone transfers and 80 for http

1764797
base-class	subclassing
pushing all the methods from the subclassing to the base-class seems odd to say the least

1764797
inherited	subclassing
you would probably need to use virtual inherited for your subclassing to have only a single ibase base

1764823
hash	md5
the only way that md5 in mysql would return a different hash then the md5 function in php is if the character set in mysql is different

1764846
inherited	subclassing
if you don t want the final class sprite to implement all the methods you can implement that methods empty in the subclassing and then use virtual inherited

1764920
std	ostream
the only thing i can think of is that it s invalid to directly use a newly constructed std ostream like that ie without putting it into a variable

1764938
firefox	safari
it behaves as it should in firefox but ie and safari start the slide left animation way over in the middle of the page and then shift the menu back where it belongs

1764938
margin	height
currently i m hacking at the .animate function in jquery to first increase the height then apply a negative margin like so

1764957
bash	zsh
zsh has some funky filename expansion options compared to bash

1764958
int	double
replace all int double name declarations with var name number

1764958
int	double
replace all int double name declarations in function signatures with name number

1764958
int	boolean	int	double
replace all int double point boolean name declarations in function signatures with name type

1764976
std	ostream
i suspect that your std lib implementation implements for as a free function and has thus to fall back to some that s a member of std ostream

1764983
width	height
to start i would give all img elements a fixed width and height and display them inline and then look further

1765072
vsto	add-in
i m currently developping a bootstrapper to deploy one of my vsto add-in

1765111
put	get
so put it together and you get

1765119
internationalization	localization
my company uses an internally developed package to support internationalization localization

1765119
internationalization	localization
i ve looked at the wikipedia entry on internationalization and localization which includes links to other sites and related topics

1765120
hide	show
you could either monitor for an ajax event such as ajaxstart or ajaxcomplete and bind an action to that event such as show and hide

1765120
hide	show
the first method is probably better because you can monitor for global ajax events and hide show the loader image for any ajax event

1765132
for-loop	loops
that way you could use the usual looping for-loop do loops foreach

1765149
mouse	keyboard
if this is just for your local mac use you might look at the mac keyboard mouse config and see if you can change the mapping there

1765154
sfx	setup.exe
i built one a quick sfx that unpacked all setup files to a temp directory ran setup.exe and deleted all files

1765158
hide	show
then use this javascript to show this right before the ajax call fire s then hide it again after it is finished

1765175
free	malloc
you could then change all calls to malloc in the java vm to use your own special memory allocator which allocates from that free space

1765277
put	get
however if i put the using statement outside of the local namespace declaration i get the type or namespace name logpriority does not exist in the namespace project.logging .

1765280
decimal	ieee
float conforms to ieee 754 and approximates decimal representation

1765373
hide	show
the other onblur functions show hide child fields based on the value of the parent

1765440
ironruby	ironpython
vb.net supports both and i believe ironpython and ironruby do as well in a dynamic way

1765457
children	parent
the above function is supposed to take a starting parent id and recursively go through an array of children nodes really just an object with a unique id and a parent id sorting them so that each node comes directly after it s parent see below for sample data

1765490
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
in firefox google-chrome opera it wipes out all content of the iframe - if you inspect it s dom with firebug you can see that iframe.body lost it s class some-class as well as all text and it s not in design mode

1765508
super	implements
what we had to to on a project that used nhibernate some years ago was implements our own getunderlyingtype name stolen from the enum class for our entity layer super type

1765537
portrait	landscape
for a set of images sitting in the parent directory some portrait some landscape to create images in the current directory scaled to 600x400 cropping portrait images from the centre and simply scaling the landscape images

1765539
entities	entitymanager
i m trying to sort entities via my entitymanager class using std sort and a

1765564
octal	decimal
0 is octal not decimal

1765599
uialertview	uiwindow
edit i haven t yet found a solution to the status bar issue but i ve noticed that a standard uialertview shows up in its own uiwindow and when i investigated that i found the windowlevel property

1765616
aho-corasick	rabin-karp
read up on the aho-corasick algorithm and the rabin-karp algorithm

1765712
spaces	delimiter
i prefer spaces delimiter since it works nice with unix text tools and with excel

1765714
uiview	subviews
point the subviews nib s owner a custom subclass of uiview

1765745
inherited	properties
and they all had to inherited from a base interface that provided some additional meta data on properties types and there were rules on what events could be triggered from properties setters

1765787
many-to-many	one-to-many	parent-child	one-to-many
i normally model one-to-many with a standard parent-child table setup and i normally model many-to-many with an association table between the 2 tables

1765787
many-to-many	one-to-many
model the database as many-to-many and have the application code limit the data to be one-to-many

1765859
subtraction	addition
in the applications you mentioned addition and subtraction and other needed math are commonly used standardized operations so overloading is not required

1765859
subtraction	addition
to provide a trivially absurd example it is perfectly feasible but not at all acceptable to define addition as subtraction

1765869
mouseup	mousedown
however once this panel is created on the windows form i want to handle mouse events such as mousedown and mouseup

1765874
width	height
notice that i had to set the width and height inte the constructor

1765892
subtract	add
so any time i need a slider to start at a value other than 0 or return a floating point number i have to set a max value that doesn t describe the true max value of the control and then divide and or add subtract the progress value when i read it

1765938
many-to-many	one-to-many
we had the same situation as you and went with a many-to-many design to store one-to-many data against a future date when we d need to store many to many

1765939
cpu	processors
eventually the reading completes and the dma system issues an interrupt to the processors more cpu cycles coming up at which point the os sees what data is ready returns to your program and puts your thread on ready queue -- end of the cpu time

1765990
subtraction	addition
if you operate with data structures where it is a common knowledge of what subtraction addition or logical operation should do then use an operator overload

1766014
int	double
int get_values double param int sz

1766093
subtract	add
it also has numerous operator overloads so that i can add subtract a timespan to a calendar month and get a calendarmonth or subtract two calendarmonth structs to get a timespan.

1766150
int	chars
i have an int and a string that i need to store it as a chars the int must be in hex

1766158
cloudant	couchdb
at the moment cloudant and couch.io couchone iris couch are the only two companies offering couchdb hosting

1766161
for-loop	arrays
your old arrays items has only size elements so you need to change the upper limit in your for-loop to size from when you re copying the old elements to the new arrays

1766242
int	double
you could get a histogram of the program counter but it is practically useless unless you are doing something dumb like spending time in a bubble sort of a big array of int or double

1766283
versioning	upgrade
to fix it you have to get a 1.5 versioning of the library or upgrade your compiler to 1.6 i suggest the later

1766299
hide	show
hey i am trying to create a search field that will filter or show hide which ever is best the list elements based on what the user typed in and clicked the search button

1766327
button	checkbox	hide	show
i am trying to hide a checkbox and assign a default value of 1 such that the submit button only show

1766329
quicksort	heapsort
-sort array x you can use whatever method you want to sort array x -- quicksort heapsort anything stable.

1766341
client-side	server-side
client-side code javascript has no concept of server-side component boundaries like an asp.net app so there s no nice and easy native way for javascript to do that that i know of

1766354
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
for example create a dragbehavior that uses rx to combine the mousedown mousemove mouseup events with a command called to handle the new event

1766361
free	malloc
you need to allocate variable sized arrays on the heap using malloc and then free them when you are done with free

1766376
onfocus	onblur
i call the fieldhint via onfocus and call disablefieldhint via either onblur or onkeydown.

1766376
hide	show
so i think it s getting confused because onkeydown works initially to hide the hint but if peeps type then backspace everything then start typing again that onkeydown + value will be true and since fieldhint is a toggle it will show the fieldhint again while people are typing and everything is divided by zero - unless peeps then backspace again and start typing again then everything leaves upside down world - unless they backspace again and start typing again then it s all fubar and like opposite day for a few seconds

1766376
hide	show
i understand that i could just use style.display to show or hide the hint but the fades make me look much more like i know what i m doing which is obviously not true

1766403
sorting	grouping
in some cases where table data was uniquely identifying i used intermediate tables and frequency distribution sorting to eliminate things like uncommon names eliminated instances where a count with grouping by was less than or equal to 2

1766413
rpm	yum
yum uses rpm so the following command will list the contents of the installed package

1766416
rpm	yum
i don t know about yum but rpm -ql will list the files in a particular .rpm file

1766426
children	parent
because the grandparent class has a collection of parent and the parent a collection of children in your viewmodel you ll only need a collection of grandparrents in your viewmodel

1766471
children	parent
they also want to use exactly the same concept to represent 1 to many parent children relationships

1766473
onkeydown	onblur
i would set a flag when onkeydown is fired and clear it for onblur something like

1766478
try-catch	exception-handling
when this class is sorted using a custom sorter where the sorter accesses this null property and throws an exception-handling the exception-handling is considered unhandled even though there is a try-catch block around the sort method

1766542
for-loop	arrays
now i am trying to create a csv file with these arrays thought of using a for-loop

1766582
vb6	vba
i don t know of a complete ide but mz-tools makes a great ide addin for vba vb6 and it s free

1766649
width	margin
also a min width is needed of 930px including right and left margin of 15px each side

1766649

dbpedia	lubm
rdf datasets are graphs try rdfdata.org dbpedia which is wikipedia in rdf the lubm graph benchmark or a really big one currently down at 2009-11-19 21 18 gmt

1766699
width	height
the easiest answer really is that the flash movie should be the full width and height of the tab

1766808
gentoo	ubuntu
be warned gentoo is not a drop dead simple distro to use ubuntu -- you have to understand a bit about how the os works -- but it does provide an excellent developerment environment

1766823
rss	feed
right now i m using pyrss2gen to generate an rss document resyndicating a modification of an rss feed that was parsed with feedparser but i can t figure out how to add uncommon tags to the item

1766828
getter	setter
using methods for getter and setter and having a public new setter for the mutable class

1766852
getter	setter
then you don t need to care if your concrete implementation has a setter or not - your callers will only use the getter

1766861
width	height
i m trying to find the exact height and width of a browser s viewport but i suspect that either mozilla or ie is giving me the wrong number

1766861
google-chrome	safari
ideally i d like the solution to work with safari google-chrome other browsers as well

1766864
hide	show
i ve taken a look at the js that show hide the fieldset content but it doesn t look like there s anything in there to do what i d like it to so i m assuming i ll have to roll my own

1766900
mkannotationview	mapkit
i m trying to create a subclass of mkannotationview for an iphone mapkit app but for some reason i am suddenly encountering this error

1766955
equals	gethashcode
when overloading you should make sure that both equals and gethashcode are also consistent

1767042
firefox	safari
after failing at this in safari i switched over to firefox and found it working perfectly

1767042
firefox	safari
again this works perfectly both locally and remotely in firefox and also works in safari remotely

1767044
ilist	icollection	inherited	properties
what is slightly inconsistent is that the generic ilist t interface has an isreadonly properties inherited from icollection t whose semantics are therefore different from the non-generic ilist.isreadonly

1767131
coldfusion	cfchart
i have a coldfusion page that uses jquery s ajax .load function to load in a new flash file that is generated by coldfusion s cfchart tag

1767131
post	get
changed the ajax method from get to post

1767186
memcached	apc
you could use apc memcached or similar

1767230
width	height
when a naturally inline element has layout google for haslayout for more info on that it will act like an inline-block element and respect width height set on it

1767277
min	max
setting the min and max memory ensures the heap is continuos and the jvm doesn t have to attempt to grow the heap

1767289
folder	directory
of course within the trunk folder you should set up whatever normal directory hierarchy you would if you didn t use source-code control

1767344
toupper	uppercase
one thing to note you may want to use toupper to convert your string to uppercase so that you don t have to or it with lowercase guesses might make it a little faster

1767359
versioning	upgrade
at my last job i had nant scripts that would restore test databases run all of the upgrade scripts that were needed based upon the versioning of the database and then dump the end result to ddl and dml

1767406
boost	stl
libpng boost and stl and i don t

1767476
versioning	upgrade
if you have an older versioning of .net wmq classes and can t upgrade for some reason you can always keep a separate thread open and periodically poll the queue

1767527
shoes	fxruby	wxruby	fxruby	wxruby	shoes
i looked into fxruby tkruby shoes and wxruby

1767534
post	get
your php script is expecting variables to be passed as an http post request but your xmlhttprequest is doing a get request

1767552
firefox	safari
safari and ie interpret multiple references to the same image and make a single request while firefox appears to make a unique request for each image linked to via css

1767562
post	put
we always need need to think smart if it comes to using repeated backgrounds if i was you i d create 2 seperate background images check the image at the bottom of this post i can t put it here as it breaks my code...

1767567
post	get
if you re using http get instead of post

1767685
appkit	nsimage
i would like to do the same on regular appkit cocoa desktop app using coregraphics or some nsimage related api but couldn t find an equivalent method

i ve tried width auto height auto width stretch height stretch

1767694
textmate	notepad++
i know you asked about notepad++ but textmate for os x can do it via the json bundle its called the reformat document command

1767705
hide	show
the above will hide the navigation bar when this view controller is pushed on top of the navigation stack and show the navigation bar when the view controller is popped off

1767717
opera	firefox
the only way to find out the location of a non-worker script is the non-standard error.filename which is only supported by firefox and opera

1767725
ubuntu	linux
they suggest using ubuntu 8.10 linux distro

1767731
opera	firefox
you can write plugins one for ie one for firefox one for opera

1767790
gridview	objectdatasource
i have a gridview that is bound to an objectdatasource that is calling a business service object which returns a list of poco s

1767882
children	parent
pages can be children of another page specified by the parent property

1767883
children	parent
that s either going to find a lot of nodes if the context node is the parent of your products element or none at all if the context node is a product element unless your product element have products children

1767891
decoder	encoder
used this url encoder decoder

1767920
ienumerable	ilist
here s an extension to ilist can t be ienumerable because i use list specific features for insertion sort

1767979
boost	stl
maybe this would have all been better with boost but i m still learning stl and didn t go that way

1768046
put	get
i m using xval for validation and everything on that end works just can t get it to redisplay the prior page with the information the user put in displayed in the box

1768086
inherited	properties
by defining properties in the prototype properties of a constructor function and creating objects with the new keyword the newly created objects inherited the prototype of the constructor and thus have access to those methods

1768086
inherited	properties
so to reiterate inherited in ecmascript is achieved primarily by defining properties methods in the prototype of a function constructor example would be all the core constructors such as date number string which have methods defined in their respective prototype properties which allows you to use those methods when you create an instance with the new keyword

1768086
inherited	properties
and btw we didn t really have to create a new instance of the john object as pointed in the other answer you can define properties in the prototype after you create the initial constructor and all objects would inherited those prototypal properties even after they ve been created

1768222
pull	push
i was thinking of either using push or pull

1768222
pull	push
i have found that pull is more scalable than push

1768227
children	parent
i think once a parent has a filter applied all of it s children essentially become directx surfaces internally

1768235
width	height
this is an instance method from a rectangle class where we modify the x and y coordinates of the rectangle and its width and height

1768238
post	get
so as mentioned before really a get request is for requesting data no side effects while a post request is generally used for transmitting data back to the server to be stored with side effects

1768268
anjuta	kdevelop
my school computers have eclipse netbeans anjuta kdevelop and several other obscure ides and they work fine

1768270
put	get
the jsps are under webcontent i have put the config.txt file under the webcontent folder and tried to get to it with

1768283

sounds like a job for the prg post redirect get pattern because you don t want the users to refresh the page and have it submit again

1768300
centos	linux
i m using centos linux on a dedicated server with webmin as the cp yes i know

1768301
icmp	udp
as a bonus for connecting the udp socket you will not have to specify the destination address port on each send you will be able to discover unavailable destination port the icmp reply from the target will manifest as error on the next send instead of being dropped and your os will not have to implicitly connect and disconnect the udp socket on each send saving some cycles

1768350
bash	zsh	fish	zsh	fish	bash
i have spent sometime trying to pick one on net comparisons are for zsh vs bash and fish vs bash

1768350
fish	zsh
but i could not find any comparison for zsh vs fish

1768360
stdout	stderr
the shell app have both stdout and stderr connected to the same pty so when the terminal emulator reads from the pty for the shell app output it can no longer tell which was written to stdout and which to stderr

inherited	properties
i must assume you meant properties inherited because otherwise the question makes no sense you don t use class inherited from your visual logical parent - you simply have a reference to that parent

1768377
inherited	properties
inherited properties are inherited in the following priority order

1768405
fish	zsh
if you can t find any comparison between zsh vs fish then try them out yourself

1768411
hide	show
is there any way to hide remove its entry from window- show view menu

1768483
serializable	deserialization
full automatic serializable deserialization behavior- the imagebytes property is just an implementation detail

1768498
cvs	svn
i d go with svn or cvs

1768520
perforce	svn
perforce offers more advanced branching and merging capabilities than svn

1768574
button	checkbox
i have a button in the main aspx page on click of which it will check if checked or not for all the checkbox and fetch the corresponding row from the gridview

1768623
icomparable	compareto
essentially what you are doing is creating an anonymous delegate which compares two items in your case you are sorting on value you can even sort on key using the compareto method of icomparable string and int implement this interface

1768679
put	get
i assume if we put the right grammar - the words we expect in the recording - we should get the textual output of that

1768688
folder	directory
if you have downloaded the binary distribution then in the folder where ajaxcontroltoolkit.dll is found release or debug not sure which you should also see a whole bunch of directory named according to culture code such as fr zh-cht ja and so on each one containing ajaxcontroltoolkit.resources.dll

1768688
folder	directory
you need to copy the language folder you want to your website s bin directory so that the resources will be loaded and used by the .net runtime for the matching culture

1768715
width	height
i want to set max-width 980 px for site but minimum width can be everything and height should depend on content

1768718
accessor	properties
indexers resemble properties except that their accessor take parameters

1768755
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
fileinputstream reads all bytes of a file and fileoutputstream writes allbytes to a file

1768758
bufferedreader	printwriter
i think what you are looking for is a bufferedreader and a printwriter

1768790
accessor	properties
it just shows where to find the methods when looking for accessor for the properties of that name

1768790
getter	setter
by cls convention plain properties are represented on clr level by a property associated with methods with corresponding signatures one for getter and one for setter

1768790
accessor	properties
indexed properties that aren t default are only accessible from c# by calling their accessor methods get_foo and set_foo directly - though this will change in c# 4 for com-imported interfaces

1768794
lisp	prolog	lisp	scheme	scheme	prolog
vb common lisp ruby scheme ml prolog go .

1768800
pull	push
cloning yourremoterepo that way you can easily pull push from that repo

1768823
post	get
plus from the start the language was really web oriented easy access to get post variables

1768869
vsto	add-in
for anyone that is looking for an answer to a similar problem then the registry keys you need to make a 2003 vsto add-in load for all users should look something like this

1768871
bufferedreader	printwriter
fredrik is right about bufferedreader but i d disagree about printwriter - my problem with printwriter is that it swallows exceptions

1768871
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
it s worth understanding why fileinputstream and fileoutputstream don t have any methods relating to lines though the classes are about streams of binary data

1768871
bufferedreader	fileinputstream
so you probably want a bufferedreader wrapping an inputstreamreader wrapping a fileinputstream for reading - then call readline

1768871
fileoutputstream	bufferedwriter
for writing use a bufferedwriter wrapping an outputstreamwriter wrapping a fileoutputstream - then call write string and newline

1768871
fileinputstream	filewriter
there s also the filereader class which sort of combines fileinputstream and inputstreamreader and filewriter does the equivalent but these always use the platform default encoding which is almost never what you want

1768935
super	implements
uiviewcontroller and uiview implements it by default so all you need to do is override the encodewithcoder and decodewithcoder methods call super and save the state variables you need

1768954
sorting	filtering
note you have to note since the filtering and sorting would be done on client side it might perform really poorly if you have too much rows

1768992
avr-gcc	winavr
the big benefit is the free and very good avr-gcc compiler winavr for windows

1769144
google-chrome	safari
i believe safari and google-chrome do too

1769306
equals	gethashcode
value types are supposed to implement equals and gethashcode correctly

1769319
multibyte	substr
additionally java char s are just 16 bits wide so a single char cannot reliably represent a single unicode character on its own - and subsequently the substr method isn t wholly multibyte friendly

1769351
sorting	filtering
i have no idea how to make the three functionalities pagination sorting and filtering work together...want i want to achieve

1769351
post	get
get submits are a bit different than post submits since you pass all of your variables in one shot with the submit input

1769361
postgresql	mysql
i ve been migrating some of my mysql queries to postgresql to use heroku

1769374
onclick	onchange
i have an asp.net dropdown list control with onclick and onchange javascript events

1769374
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
both work in ie mozilla opera and google-chrome but not in safari

1769374
onclick	onchange
when i remove the onclick event onchange suddenly works

1769375
post	get
a loader must be shown ...while in the background the post happens and then aspx page must get loaded and then the modal must redirect to the aspx page

1769383
aggregate-functions	sum	postgresql	mysql
mysql s group by can be used without an aggregate-functions which is contrary to the sql standard and returns the first row in the group i don t know based on what criteria while postgresql must have an aggregate-functions max sum etc on the column on which the group by clause is issued

1769400
button	checkbox
so i guess i want to define an implicit style which applies to the textblock the checkbox and the button

1769414
postgresql	mysql
postgresql is more sql compliant than mysql

1769433
memcached	ncache
apart from memcached and velocity you can look at some commercial solutions like ncache or oracle coherence

1769453
put	get
as the others have said - i would definitely not use a long string like an url as the primary clustering key on a sql server table - but of course you should feel free to put a unique constraint on that column to make sure you don t get any duplicates

1769466
getter	setter
i have tried to mimic getter and setter in javascript as specified in the following link

1769469
x86	mips
it currently works for arm7 nxp lpc2xxx cortex-m3 stm32 and nxp lpc17xx x86 and our in-house mips isa compatible fpga soft-core

1769477
stdout	stderr
a more radical approach is built in to my experimental shell gush which shows stderr from all commands run in red stdout in black

1769496
set	bag
i d also add that i suspect set semantics instead of bag would be more appropriate for the employee.team and team.employee properties

1769573
post	get
post reqmethod get

1769583
post	get
you make a post request as drupal will cache get s and the semantic of this is that you are posting data - the node - to the server

1769603
cvs	svn
a google search revealed the existence of some custom scripts for example pvcs -- cvs and then cvs -- svn should be quite straightforward

1769628
button	checkbox
if the user is only allowed to select one item from a list you should use radio button instead of checkbox

1769662
filtering	grouping
the data can be grouping into several categories so that filtering can be made upon it

1769668
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome is normally the way to run firefox with relaxed security

1769672
fseek	fread
s in glibc contain a jump table with pointers to appropriate functions to handle such calls as fseek fread and of relevance fclose

1769746
inherited	properties
the object i am storing has complex type properties with some of them being objects of classes that inherited from other classes so serializing the object before storing it in the session might be a little expensive

1769762
opera	safari
opera supports it above 90 adobe was supporting it above 80 but may be supported it better now than last year and safari is supporting it above 40 but not supporting in a comparable manner compared to the prior two mentioned groups

1769813
width	height
i ve runned the debugger i ve noticed that the scene and the model is rendered and the picture width and height is zero

1769850
min	max
otherwise you couldn t have results for things like select min col1 max col1 .

1769862
mkmapview	mkannotationview
note you need to handle the touch events for the mkannotationview and not mkmapview

1769865
firefox	safari
you can also try running the same code in another browser with a solid js debugger like firefox + firebug or safari with the develop tools enabled

1769881
sudo	passwd
or more generically assuming sudo passwd has been catered for some-how

1769902
serializable	deserialization
just serializable your class name method name and parameter class names as strings and then recreate your method object using a reflection mechanism during deserialization

1770034
maven	m2e
a bigger one is that m2e forks and uses an external maven for running maven goals while iam q4e only uses the embedder

1770040
hide	show
when the drag stop event is fired you should just be able to unhide them again by calling show instead of hide and replacing .ui-draggable-dragging by another class they have in common

1770075
getter	setter
i provide getter and setter hibernate dependencies on my classpath also.but i still do not get the how to validate simple form there is actually not so much documentation for spring hibernate combination

1770198
hide	show
i want to hide win_dock when all the windows of the application loses focus and show it again if a window gain focus

1770198
hide	show
when this counter drops to zero i want to hide win_dock and if this counter is positive again i want to show win_dock

1770241
webclient	httpwebrequest
but when coding your own webclient httpwebrequest the proxy is not automatically used-- you need to enable use of a proxy yourself either in code or configuration

1770241
webclient	httpwebrequest
note that the same code can be used against webclient as httpwebrequest

1770265
opera	firefox
as this call is within a click handler it even works perfectly with firefox and ie for opera it lets you open the popup manually

1770292
antlr	parser-generator
if you have no control then a parser-generator such as antlr may be valuable

1770343
zoo	xts
for the former look at the zoo and xts packages which offer much better time-pased subsetting

1770364
shadowbox	lightbox
i m using a jquery shadowbox library wich allows you to show html content in a lightbox shadowbox

1770399
folder	directory
what i want to do is use vs2008 on my windows xp development box and create a new project linked to this source folder so that i can explore and edit the source with the benefits of intellisense then simply putty into the mounted directory and run make

1770432
versioning	upgrade
if you upgrade to vs 2008 they changed their stance and included unit testing in the non team suite level versioning of the ide

1770456
mbunit	nunit
if you can t use nunit and presumably mbunit etc. then you have two options upgrade to vs2005 team system or vs2008 professional

1770475
min	max
another option would be to use jamon a tool that gathers statistics execution time number of hit average execution time min max etc for any code that comes between start and stop methods

1770497
sortedmap	sortedset
a sortedmap is a mapping from a sortedset of keys to values

1770545
post	get
note because i m unregistered i can only add in one url per post so the next url s are a bit mangled to get around that restriction

1770549
apache	nginx
apache 2 and nginx .

1770647
int	double
and similarly using convert.toint32 convert.tosingle convert.todouble for the argument to produce int float double substituting in the correct type arguments to convertall

1770648
sorting	grouping
for example even though the datagrid control may not have everything you re looking for consider that it has features such as sorting paging grouping and aggregation already built in

1770648
telerik	componentart
you may consider looking at and testing third-party controls from vendors such as telerik componentart or devexpress

1770661
integer	fractions
datediff but note it returns an integer so if you need fractions of hours use something like this -

1770670
screens	tablet
i m adapting an application for touch screens interface and we want to use the tablet text input panel included in windows vista 7 specifically its keyboard

1770670
hide	show
i want to show and hide it as appropriate for my app

1770677
put	get
if you re trying to get atomic put if not already in there use chm

1770719
multiplying	subtract
just subtract the two datetime values and multiplying by 24

1770791
tooltip	scrollbar
in order to display an office 2007-style tooltip revealing which page the position of the scrollbar corresponds with

1770890
folder	directory
and i have following dll in the dbg tools folder mscordacwks_amd64_x64_2.0.50727.3603.dll taken from framework64 directory

1770891
firefox	safari
i found that this works in ie apple safari and firefox

1770895
puts	gets
in any case you may want to additionally log the hashcode of the keys used for the gets puts in threads 1 and 2

1770896
inherited	properties
for properties you could have a template to wrap them in the stl container so that they share a common ancestor and you can store pointers like where properties makes created type inherited from common type

1770958
for-loop	arrays
you could use an arrays to store the recipients and then use a for-loop

1770980
post	put
i recoment you to use the parameter formcollection in your controller and put a breakpoint you can see all the values send within the post

1771092
int	double
imagine for a moment this inheritance double extends int extends number

1771092
int	double
this is not correct in java but imagine that double is just an int plus a fractions part

1771092
int	double
in this scenario a comparable which works for number also works for int and double since both derive from number

1771092
int	double
so would satisfy the super part for t being number int or double

1771092
int	double
this means you can pass in number for t and the resulting code will also work when there are int and double instances in the lists

1771092
int	double	super	extends
if you int for t you can still use double but number is not possible because it doesn t satisfy t extends comparable anymore the super part would still work though

1771103
post	get
i have successfully been able to get the post rendererd out through the posts.each do |post| call

1771127
spaces	delimiter
this would be pretty trivial stuff for a parser but different text files have different delimiter so i d like to let the user specify whether the text is separated by tabs spaces commas pipes unicode snowmen et cetera

1771171
boost	stl
to solve your misery give up on stl and have a look at the successors try boost and maybe qt

1771258
folder	directory
the other is that you are trying to edit a folder location after costfinalize has set directory locations

1771295
put	get
if your cygwin sshd is running under a privileged account it can get a handle to the current desktop and put windows on it

1771341
client-side	server-side
the restlet framework also has an api which works both server-side and client-side

1771362
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i would look into how ie7 firefox google-chrome and safari store these cookies but probably not in a really secure way

1771370
folder	directory
you should get a new folder in your project s bin debug directory with the satellite assembly named projectname.resources.dll

1771415
hide	show
you need to somehowe tie the show hide buttons to their respective divs that they will act on

1771482
versioning	upgrade
the old classic pagination has been moved out into it s own plugin too but it s only recommended if you were already using it when you upgrade rails to a versioning where they took it out

1771487
serializable	deserialization
but as i know saving large object set in sessions clearly slows down application performance because of frequent serializable and deserialization process serializable is time consuming i guess from web services - soap and binary formatting

1771589
width	height
for example for an image reference element i d make the width height and format attributes

1771717
put	get
you want to put the id so you can access the value in javascript as well as a name if you want to access the value on the server in the tag you wish to get the value from

1771755
bash	zsh
you can start with command line powershell bash zsh .

1771775
public	protected
note that if you replace public with protected the marked method will be only visible to base classes and subclasses

1771830
post	get
assuming you named your counter cache votes_count you can do this to get the 10 most popular post from your controller

1771897
inherited	subclassing
this provides subclassing with a default implementation of the interface or part of it and also lets you inherited from something else and still implement the interface or if you want to implement the interface but not inherited the base class implementation

1771914
qsort	bsearch
i m not coming up with c functions that work on arrays and not container classes except for things like qsort and bsearch and the stl has better ways to do such things

1771914
strtol	atoi
for example the boost lexical_cast is an improvement over such functions as atoi and strtol much as the standard c++ string is an improvement over the c way of doing things

1771946
jobs	cron
we can also manage data loads with dbms_job dbms_scheduler routines which further cuts down the need for shell scripts and cron jobs

1771967
inherited	properties
but if you want a class to have the properties and method of another class the best you are going to get is to use a public properties of the the type of class you want to inherited

1771975
hide	show
anyway so it checks if it is the initial keydown if it is it hide hint if not doesn t hide it because it s already hidden and to call the hide again would show it thx toggle

1771983
agile	sprint
when asking for more detail one is informed that you are asking for too much detail and since this is agile the requirement will become clearer later during the sprint 2 week sprint and you should not worry about the detail just then but rather to just give the story a weight in doll hairs and stop being difficult

1772008
pop-up	dialog
when a user clicks a link from any table row jquery s ui modal dialog pop-up up and i add a class to the clicked links parent tr called highlight

1772011
post	put
if you do this collection update_many put rails will submit a post to the index action commentscontroller#index i want it to go to the update_many action

1772016
put	get
prior to submitting my form i do the getloginstatus call and put the sessionkey and secret into form fields so they get posted to the controller

1772031
lxml	html5lib
however parsing huge files is becoming a performance bottleneck and lxml parsing is about 80 times faster than html5lib i benchmarked it

1772066
postgresql	mysql
same is true for all major systems oracle mysql postgresql not only for sql server

1772067
agile	sprint
when asking for more detail one is informed that you are asking for too much detail and since this is agile the requirement will become clearer later during the sprint 2 week sprint and you should not worry about the detail just then but rather to just give the story a weight in doll hairs and stop being difficult

1772090
dictionary	map
along the lines of what l99057j said if all you re doing is mapping inputs to constant values this is a place for an appropriate lookup structure such as an array list for sequential inputs or a dictionary map for a sparse one not a switch statement

1772095
gmail	hotmail
essentially type_key has the name either hotmail or gmail and type has the dictionary that is the value associated with that key

1772102
notepad	textpad
what i want to do is allow the source app to be able to drop into notepad textpad as well

1772117
coalesce	isnull
you can also use the isnull transact-sql specific or coalesce sql-92 standard function as in

1772174
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
uinavigationcontroller is organized in a stack-like fashion and it holds uiviewcontroller instances not views

1772260
jobs	cron
any server that allows you to install your own cron jobs can do this

1772270
width	height
i ve set its width to be 640 and height to 450

1772320
min	max
and of course various min max abs etc

1772333
min	max
the macro you posted from gcc min and max is an example of this they use the global variables _a and _b to avoid the risk of double evaluation like in max x++ y++ well they use gcc extensions but the concept is the same

1772337
goto	break
if the loop is a true infinite loop there is no break condition -- only an external event can terminate the thread s process execution then i actually prefer the label and goto

1772389
fgets	strlen	fgets	atoi	atoi	strlen	printf	fgets	printf	strlen	printf	atoi
no strlen no fgets no atoi no strtoul no fopen no printf with the s conversion specifier .

1772460
put	get
then you d only have to use logical and s and or s to get put stuff into it

1772465
client-side	server-side
unlike client-side validators the server-side validation does not prevent the page from posting back and processing events as normal

1772469
apache	nginx
i highly highly recommend running the environment with apache nginx and phusion s passenger

1772495
mouseup	mousedown
that listen for mouseup or mousedown

1772495
mouseup	mousedown
how to handle mouseup and mousedown events for a textbox

1772565
printf	strncpy
but regardless of which method you choose you should definitely use printf or strncpy for buffer overrun protection

1772581
submit	submission
what i can not find is how to either invoke or trigger the webbrowser to act as though either the submit button was pressed or alternately the enter key was pressed causing the default submission

1772607
postgresql	mysql
there are native providers for mysql postgresql ms sql server oracle etc

1772660
cos	sine
back in the bad-old-days we d define entire cos sine tables and other such bleh in integer form to reduce floating fuzz and increase computation speed

1772728
post	get
the post redirect get pattern will prevent the re-post warning

1772728
post	get
at any rate i think web applications that follow the post redirect get pattern are slightly more user-friendly but your mileage may vary

1772728
post	get
sometimes get is a better option in those read-only scenarios because it makes your url scheme richer and avoids these sort of post warnings

1772747
disk	ram
working with computer equiped with lot of ram in order to maximize disk cache

1772749
autofac	castle-windsor
i know that unity and ninject work with silverlight but i haven t found any information that suggests that other well known containers like structuremap castle-windsor or autofac support silverlight

1772767
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested ie firefox and google-chrome over an 8 hour period and there didn t appear to be any negative impact although my boxes are relatively fast

1772793
put	get
i get dynamic content with ajax and i put it in a div but the problem is that i have diffrent ids for some child divs from the dynamic content

1772822
put	get
so i was thinking of having another sort of tag like this and put it under the authorizeattribute this way if they are not authorized they get caught by that one

1772849
uiview	subviews
i got rid of the uiview completely and ended up putting the uilabel as a subviews of the uiimageview and returned the uiimageview

1772850
base	fractions
this is similar to how in base 10 1 3 is an infinite fractions 0.3333...

1772850
rational-numbers	fractions
if you use fractions with bignums arbitrarily large numbers for your numerators and denominators you can represent any rational-numbers that will fit in the memory of your computer

1772861
google-chrome	firefox
on google-chrome and firefox it works properly

1772861
google-chrome	firefox
so bottom line the div is centered on google-chrome and firefox but all the way to the right on ie7.

1772876
sorting	filtering
the table should behave nicely when sorting and filtering using excel

1772910
postgresql	mysql
after getting burned on the matter of postgresql and java stored procedures i won t dare to speculate on whether mysql does java stored procedures

1772938
inherited	properties
there is however no way to set a base object s properties and have them used in the inherited class

1772948
joptionpane	jdialog
usually when people want more flexibility than joptionpane offers it s basically a bunch of static factories for a few dialogs they write their own dialogs using jdialog

1773118
websphere	ibm
ibm websphere mq probably overkill in your case

1773129
int	chars
chars 80 population int 15

1773130
width	height
if you remove the display block you won t be able to set your width height or use text-indent to hide the copy within the a

1773151
websphere	ibm
once you get the client installed the sample code can be found in c program files ibm websphere mq tools jms samples simple

1773159
post	put
i m not sure i should put every of my codes dealing with an issue here and from what i ve learned from other forum is to post just the necessary and being concise

1773178
opera	firefox
this works in ie but i cannot get it to work in opera or firefox

1773211
division	multiplication
if you have to calculate with your probabilities especially if you do division and multiplication you need to round the results correctly

1773234
children	parent
as you know when you double click a tree view parent then the tree view expands and shows the children

1773249
int	chars
int execve const chars filename chars const argv

1773251
addclass	removeclass
for more information see the jquery docs on hasclass addclass removeclass and toggleclass

1773304
hide	show
to hide and show a form use the form.visible property

1773305
ironruby	ironpython
this talk from pdc09 really piqued my interest the guy demonstrates how you can use ironpython or ironruby to make a c# app scriptable in his demo drop a python script in a text box and it works with extends your c# code

1773435
ubuntu	debian
if you are using debian or ubuntu you need to install the python-tk package to get tkinter support

1773549
uiview	subviews
to prevent the crash create a generic uiviewcontroller + uiview x and add view x to the window as a subviews

1773598
int	chars
it seems that when you pass parameters to a function that when the parameter happens to be a chars it s padded out to the size of a regular int

1773618
bufferedreader	stringtokenizer
read in every line via bufferedreader and parse with stringtokenizer

1773642
put	get	post	put	post	get
the reason that there s no post to a particular member is because that member record already exists in the database so the only thing you can do to it is get look at put update or delete destroy

1773642
post	get
if you were trying to duplicate an existing member you would want to get the original member in a duplicate member action and post to the resource root with its contents

1773673
background-color	transparency
background-color transparency

even ie8 only supports getter setter on dom objects and not jscript objects so i think it s something the jscript team need to include if they ever do

1776148
nsurlconnection	nsoperationqueue	nsurlconnection	nsoperation
in general when doing something like that it s easier to put everything in an nsoperation which then goes in an nsoperationqueue although if you are implementing nsurlconnection callbacks you have to provide a few extra methods in the nsoperation class

1776446
width	height
my attempts at determining the correct height and width of the content however haven t been completely straightforward

1776446
width	height
indeed uiwebview seems to inset the actual html content by 8 pixels on some edges top bottom and left in this case it seems such that the fitted size given by sizethatfits doesn t match up with the javascript body height width result

1776455
haskell	ocaml
haskell has higher level bindings to llvm than ocaml the haskell ones provide some interesting type safety guarantees and haskell has by far more libraries to use 1700 packages on making it easier to glue together components

the problem with this solution is that the echo-server needs to have lots of bandwidth to accomodate all connected peer since it relays all the traffic rather than establish p2p connections

1776623
min	max
indeed we can compute both max a and min a in linear time and just assign

1776642

1776673
stdout	stderr
you need to redirect stdout and stderr somewhere

1776673

the do shell script command knows that the pipes it setup for the program s stdout and stderr are still open so it waits for them to be closed

1776674
sorting	filtering
databases can do a far better job of filtering and sorting data before it gets to you

1776677

on the other hand if you plan to use tcp udp for ipc it will be much easier for you because firefox provides socket services that you can use easily from javascript component

1776927
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
you could - if that works in your scenario - absolutely position an invisible element with 100 width and height and have the element centered in there using margin auto and possibly vertical-align

1776948

1777201
stdout	stderr
as peter hosey points out it s likely that the child processes writing to stderr rather than stdout

1777201
stdout	stderr
since stdout and stderr are both inherited by child processes if you set the stderr of the task you launch to a pipe you re aware of its child processes should write to that pipe

1777201
stdout	stderr
alternatively you can change the perl script to redirect the child processes stderr to stdout

currently it s passed by get or post with every request but i was wondering if i could avoid this by offering it as a cookie since it is dependent on the user s ip

1777493
post	get
all good points however in answer to the question get requests are more useful in certain scenarios over post requests

1777496
width	height
the position of the lower horizontal path relative to the base of the button wasn t clear if you need to alter the position and width of it alter the grid column height and width values appropriately and keep them as ratio s and not absolute numbers

1777498
getter	setter
you can add special property in your view model that will set value of your mutable property in its setter and return needed value using all three your properties in its getter

1777526
unsigned	short
data type unsigned short int

1777527
irix	linux
for systems where famd can run irix linux bsds most unices there is sgi fam and sys gamin both of which do not build straight out of cpan or tarball but do work well once you get them working

1777528
decoder	encoder
i d like to do this in parallel by piping the output of the decoder directly to the input of the encoder

1777543
lseek	fseek
if the program checks the return value of fseek or lseek as it should the program will likely return an error

1777570
int	chars
i have a pointer ascii which a pointer to a chars and i want it is value as an int in order to make it an if statement like

1777582
int	chars
the code will take a sequence of 0 and 1 string chars an int representing the chars that the machine starts with and an int representing the state of the program in no particular order and output the final result of the operations on the string as well as the final position

1777622
int	chars
unsigned chars y and e occupy the same space again depending on the fact that int is 32 bits so .y and .e are effectively aliases for each other

1777668
showwindow	postmessage
at startup previous instance s mainwindowhandle property is 0 so i can t send showwindow or postmessage

compile your object with g++ compiler instead it will link to standard c++ library gcc does not

1777855
width	height
for example if i were to have a bounding rectangle of width and height of 4 and the points p1 0 0 and p2 2 2 it could output the following

1777862
int	chars
it is obvious that int system const chars command will be necessary to complete the program

1777862
int	chars
starting it with int main int argc chars argv will allow getting the command-line arguments but there is still a problem that is difficult to understand

you can find used mac mini s for cheap and use an existing monitor and usb keyboard mouse

1777989
daemons	systemd
so we queue those tasks into a messaging systemd and have back-end daemons handle them

1778000
free	malloc
since the error occurs when draining the pool i might be suspicious that you ve already deallocated the object by that point and the object is over-released although generally you ll get a malloc double free error for this or perhaps the memory has already been overwritten by something else

1778088
pull	push
specifically the new master branch points to skeleton master branch and i can push and pull to move around changes to the basic project setup

1778097
folder	directory
one way to get around your problem is to add your local folder the unzipped version in the current directory to the beginning of pythonpath so that python will find it first

1778131
folder	directory
if the directory structure conforms to what is defined all projects should be under a defined svn folder and each project should have a tags branch and trunk folder

1778132
getter	setter
use getter and setter and make the properties private

1778214
stdout	stderr
you have to use a normal compiler and redirect the stdout and stderr to your website

1778377
put	get
to try to get what s wrong i put the aspx file aside and open only the html page

1778377
cassini	iis
all 3 files above are the same page being run through 2 different servers cassini iis and the normal html render from firefox

1778466
pop-up	dialog
you can also use packagemanager to detect if wamf is installed seeing if there are any activities that would match the intent you want to use in startactivity -- that way you can disable the menu choice or have it pop-up a dialog telling people to install wamf or something

1778478
unsigned	short
if i have an array of short unsigned ints

1778492

note that a process may allocate far more memory virtual memory size but as long as it don t writes to the memory it is not represented by physical memory be it in ram or on the disk

1778568
post	get
i do not know how to do it but i guess you can at least get some inspiration from this post

1778784
apache	nginx
nginx presents itself as lighter option to apache but the latter has much more modules and support

1778788
apache	nginx
memory wise nginx comes with a lower memory footprint out of the box than apache

hash	md5
no md5 - is one-way hash function

1778908
hash	md5
md5 isn t an encryption method it s a one way hash

1778909
hash	md5
md5 is an hash which makes it allmost inpossible to get the original value back

1778910
hash	md5
if you intend to decrypt them later md5 won t be an option since it only hash strings you lose the original data

1778913
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
however you should always encrypt hash passwords with at least md5 and a salt as pointed out in ivan s reply

1778916
hash	md5
just be aware that basic md5 hashing is no longer a secure hash

1778916
hash	md5
i think one major problem with it is that there are rainbow tables of md5 hash all over these days so bare md5 is very susceptible to brute forcing

1778916
salt	md5
there may be special hoops that you can jump through like both using a salt and performing nested md5 hashings to make it more secure though i m no cryptographer

1778946
versioning	upgrade
i ended up using a more complex way to do upgrade by reading the raw xml from the user settings file then run a series of upgrade routines that refactor the data to the way it s supposed to be in the new next versioning

a trie is an uncompressed prefix tree a tree in which the paths from root to leaf nodes correspond to all the prefixes of a given string

1778967
inherited	properties
if you get an event handler where the e parameter is an inherited eventargs you can use the properties on the inherited eventargs object to find out more about the event

1778969
inherited	properties
a good example of this is the gridviewediteventargs that are passed by a gridview inherited from eventargs but extend it to provide neweditindex and cancel properties

versioning	upgrade
when that downward trend is well established discontinue upgrade to the 2.4 versioning but keep it available for download

1779064
spaces	delimiter
first off your linked udf s default delimiter is the character not spaces

1779141

post	get
for example if you re sending a post request to a url that s only designed to handle a get request you ll get this error

1779462
put	get	post	put	post	get
so servlet a can perform an http get on a particular path to check a status either sending back an object or checking an http response code - this latter method seems a misuse of status codes however and put post an object if required

1779555
apache	nginx
i ve used apache passenger and nginx passenger on a vps and memory usage was better with nginx

1779555

1779618
int	double
the upsizing of int to float to double works but the problem is that you aren t passing variables to add so inside add it can t change them

1779626
floating-point	integer
your function takes its parameters by reference not by value and you can t pass constant integer floating-point values by non-const reference

1779626

for people who use ant in daily work switching to maven is hard especially for non helloworld projects

1779897
addition	multiplication
you can get a somewhat unique one by converting the hex version to several integers worth of data then combining them addition or multiplication

1779908
hash	md5
you ll need to define your own hash function that converts an md5 string into an integer of the desired width

1779908
hash	md5
if you want to interpret the md5 hash as a plain string you can try the fnv algorithm

1779923
yacc	bison
liby is part of yacc and some versions of bison but is rarely actually needed it just defines default implementations of yyerror and a couple other things

post	get
i ve been working on a post editor i want to generate thumbnails from all images inserted on the html code so before to do that i want to get all basic image attributes

1780120
stdout	stderr
createchildprocess isn t as convenient though because it doesn t buffer stdout and stderr so you will need event handlers to read the output in chunks

1780157
vmware	virtualbox
you might benefit from running either vs2010 or vs2005 or both in a virtualbox virtualpc vmware

1780169
width	height
typically if you use window.open and specify a height and width for the window it will cause most browsers with most configurations to open it as a new window and not a new tab

1780172
disk	ram
this is true even if you have a 1 tb ram machine you ll need 1.5 tb pagefile on disk sounds crazy but is true

webclient	httpwebrequest
1 if you are building a client app console or winforms and want to access using webclient or httpwebrequest without any intervening proxies then should accomplish this

1780416
webclient	httpwebrequest
btw if you find that things are configured correctly and you still get the error the first thing i d recommend is to code up a quick test which manually sets the proxy before your webclient httpwebrequest call instead of relying on configuration to do it

1780463
int	chars
if you are working in c you have your string in a chars array that is of a size multiple of a int you can just take the pointer to the chars array cast it to a pointer to a int array and do whatever you want with your int array

1780531
children	parent
if you really only care about a parent and it s forked children you can use an anonymous mapping and not bother with the file and you can store the location of the mapping in a global which can be read in the children

1780540
accessor	properties	getter	setter
but when your language lets you switch from public variables to properties and vice-versa without any incompatible change in the api such as c# ruby python ... it s silly to carry around total boilerplate when the public accessor getter and setter do nothing except copying to and from a private variable -- even if you re certain your compiler can optimize them away such boilerplate accessor just bloat the source uselessly and waste an important design feature that s part of what makes such languages nice ones

1780547
children	parent
pass the map_anonymous and map_shared flags to mmap - this will mean that child processes that inherit the mapping will have a mapping that is shared with the parent and the other children

my strategy was to use the wba_logo_bg as id and select the parent then from there select all the children td which doesn t have the class wba_topnavbg and hide them all but i don t know how to write the selection part

1780696
min	max
given only that and without restricting the style of how enums are used declared we know the size of the enumerations but not their signedness which makes defining type-safe constructors taking min and max arguments impossible

post	get
i follow there instructions for creating an app on there site create and commit git push the code and it shows up at though the bulk of what i have done is in the post path when i go to enter a new post because this is kind of a blog platform i get the 500.html error and essentially everything shuts down

1780789
post	get
can t even get back to the page that i entered the post

1780870
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
if this is going to be a long-running client i d also recommend using the lower-level datainputstream and dataoutputstream instead of objectinputstream objectoutputstream to prevent holding onto a possibly large identityhashmap of the objects

i looked at the network traffic and there seems to be a lot of ancillary packets related to using multicast

1781159
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
here i bind the mousemove event on mousedown and unbind it on mouseup

1781162
mousemove	mousedown
you bind the mousedown event and call mousemove inside of that function and use the jquery unbind event to get rid of the mousemove

1781212
union	distinct
the information comes from two distinct unrelated tables maybe use union to obtain results in a single query while effectively running two queries you would then use an extra column with some text like univ public to differentiate the two lines

cgfloat	uiedgeinsets
uiedgeinsets encapsulates four different cgfloat values for the inset values of the top left bottom and right respectively individually

1781294
width	height
jpeg has a header within each segment of data which has its own height width and resolution

1781294
width	height
you might need to read the entire image to find the width and height of each segment within the jpeg to get the entire width and height

1781294
width	height
you could do it if you can develop a server side program that would seek forward and read the header of each segment to compute the width and height of the segment

1781333
kde	kubuntu	kde	gnome	kubuntu	gnome
i use kubuntu ie ubuntu with kde instead of gnome -- mater of personal choice and it s ok for lamp development you can use eclipse pdt or aptana of course you have mysql available .

django	turbogears
you could also look at other alternative frameworks such as turbogears or paste if you wanted but django is a great way to get something up and running quickly

1781477
mouse	keyboard
events on the other hand are system language-level messages which can be used to signify various hardware or software situations i d use the word event such as mouse clicks keyboard entries but also application-level situations such as new record inserted in database or highly digested requests and messages used in modular programs for communication requests between various parts of the program

1781482
nunit	mspec
any testing framework nunit mspec the vsts-built in framework etc. will do just fine

int	chars
the ctypes library has all the c data types int chars short and so on and can pass parameters either by value or reference

1781582

navigation scripted archive by month listing contents scripted footer once sidebar inherited throughout site - override by cloning into subdirs and editing or specifying object properties for local instance closest to the url path then seeking up to root

1781648
width	height
you ve got some invalid html on that line the width and height parts

1781674
spaces	delimiter
i m going to assume that we re not talking about the trivial case here not just splitting a string around spaces since that d just be a basic tokenizer problem - but instead we re talking about something were there isn t a clear word delimiter character and thus we re having to guess what the best match for string- words would be - for instance the case of a set of concatenated words w o spaces such as transforming this

1781783
next	except
almost monadic i believe except that in your case they appear to be actions so there are no values to string through from one function to the next

1781826
hide	show
td colspan does not work while using jquery show hide

1781851
firefox	safari
the form is styled and looks fine in safari and firefox but then in internet explorer 6 7 and 8.

1781922
equals	gethashcode
the same happens in c# equals and gethashcode are methods implemented in the system.object class

1781928
post	get
i need some way of reading the post values converting them to something readable storing them and then being able to get them back out and loop through the info again

1781936
fat	hfs+	hfs+	ntfs	filesystems	fat	filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	hfs+
the language should be able to describe the most commonly-used file attributes of common pc platform filesystems ntfs fat hfs+ ext2 3 etc

1781973
pop-up	dialog
the problem is that i want to just close the fbmlpopupdialog the same behavior as if the user just hit the x button on the pop-up dialog

1782023
width	height
the image tag supports width and height but doesn t need pixels just the value

1782024
superclass	subclassing
the template method in the superclass implements the common algorithm and each subclassing fills in the blanks in its own specific way

1782030
ubuntu	linux
later the following packages would be installed automatically when we run the deployed .net application in ubuntu linux

1782093
parent-child	one-to-many
the existing ui uses a multiview control to navigate between the editing of associated business objects one-one associations or one-to-many parent-child

1782093
objectdatasource	formview
within the itemtemplate of each formview various server controls databind to fields or methods on an objectdatasource

1782093
factories	presenter
more specifically - use an objectcontainerdatasource from the web client software factories to make it easier to bridge between the current ui and a set of new presenter classes

1782112
int	chars
the value of eof is a negative int to distinguish it from chars values that are in the range 0 to 255

1782139
post	get
you d probably need to use xmlhttprequest to make an http request to your server-side script and pass variables either through get or post

1782140
button	checkbox
when i hitted save button after the selection of mutiple checkbox it will stored to that of particular column seperated by a semi column

1782149
width	height
if you have term readkey module installed from cpan you can use it to fetch the width and height in characters and in pixels

1782196
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
this way the answer of shouldautorotate is forwarded to the controlled tabs and in particular for the uinavigationcontroller it is again delegated to the visible uiviewcontroller

1782196
portrait	landscape
the problem is that i would like that even if the device is still in landscape mode and user pops the special viewcontroller the interface should behave consistently and return to portrait mode

1782218
multiplying	add
so i need to multiplying the price by quantity and then take that subtotal per item and add it in total after the loop

1782270
pivot-table	crosstab
i ve tried to avoid using find_by_sql and db specific queries but for a pivot-table or crosstab query i have no idea how to do it in a way which is not specific to say mysql

1782270
postgresql	mysql
ie my mysql find_by_sql breaks on a postgresql db

1782310
post	get
i have a quick question i hope you guys can answer i ve got a search system that uses post to do searches now i want to track queries using google analytics but it requires using get url parameters to pull parameters out the url what i don t want to do is rewrite the entire search system to use get instead of post

1782310
post	get
i was thinking maybe i can make a get call to a new page from the page that recieves the search post but i don t want it to redirect i merely want it to hit the url without actually redirecting

1782333
accessor	properties
i m trying to write a generic cached properties accessor like the following but am getting a compiler error when trying to check whether the storage variable already contains a value

1782335
post	get
with the array _request you can access all request parameters get and post

1782352
folder	directory
this will mvn install correctly but when i open the output war file i was expecting the file xmlgateway-context.xml to be in the web-inf directory but it ends up in the folder web-inf classes web-inf

1782368
lxml	beautifulsoup
i suspect that it is choking on poorly formed html and i d like to try pre-parsing it with a parser better designed to handle bad html say lxml or beautifulsoup and then feeding the prettified cleaned-up output to the form parser

1782401
put	get
because all of the machines are in your domain you can put together a vbscript that will get the macaddress es from the local machine and store it as an attribute of the computer object in active directory

1782465
ubuntu	linux
i just started using ubuntu linux for the first time

1782488
hash	md5
since you don t have additional arguments the hexdigest is d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e the md5 hash of the empty string

1782652
pop-up	dialog
one way to do this is to write a web page for the pop-up and link to it normally then add your your js function of the onclick event load the page in using ajax to a dialog box and return false from the js function

1782652
pop-up	dialog
that way the pop-up appears as a dialog box when js is turned on as the false return from the function disables the link action but the link behaves normally when js is off

1782658
range	max	range	min	min	max
parse string containing range of values to min and max variables

1782689
stdout	stderr
you should direct stderr to stdout

1782693
cgpoint	cgrect
i m not sure what you mean by geospatial boundaries but if you mean you have a rectangle defining a location you can convert it to a cgrect offset the latitude and longitude of all of your points by 90 and 180 respectively to make sure you don t have negative numbers convert your cllocation objects to cgpoint s then use cgrectcontainspoint to figure out if your location is within that rectangle

1782739
put	get
to get the whole hash you d put a in front of the braces

1782769
rar	zip
to give you an idea a 2.31mb file - lots of text several full page diagrams - compressed to 1.92mb in zip and 1.90mb in rar

1782770
pop-up	dialog
although i know that this can be accomplished by showing the default2 into a modal pop-up show the default2 into a modal dialog and after that call the button event using javascript

1782787
comparator	comparable
see comparable or comparator for a precise definition of consistent with equals. this is so because the map interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a map performs all key comparisons using its comparator or compare method so two keys that are deemed equals by this method are from the standpoint of the sorted map equals

1782801
filesystems	ntfs
you can mount the ntfs volume containing the repository under linux and then checkout from the repository location to somewhere in your linux filesystems

1782818
hide	show
finally i wanted to be able to show and hide the input panel

1782872
min	max
required min and max size etc.

1782894
put	get
if you need the data in the db for the test for get put it there in the setup step

1782902
getlasterror	waitformultipleobjects
experiencing intermittent issues related to named events when processes are running in different user contexts waitforsingleobject and waitformultipleobjects too for such event handle fails with wait_failed getlasterror returns 6 - invalid handle value

1782972
for-loop	loops
the foreach loops or enhanced for-loop does not have facilities to keep track of which element is being iterated on at the moment

1782973
bash	zsh
assuming bash zsh or something similar for the dupe of stderr on to stdout.

1782983
boost	stl
these are template-based libraries that only make use of header files with some #included inline code like most of the stl and boost libraries

1783178
ubuntu	linux
i am creating a dhcp client in linux ubuntu

1783204
gcov	lcov
everything was working just fine until i tried to do some code coverage using gcov lcov which don t operate on dynamic libs so i modified all my .pro file to have a static lib compilation using

1783231
inherited	subclassing
the testcalculator class is the testfixture but inherited all of the tests from the base class which leaves the subclassing responsible solely for providing the object to test for that interface

1783297
vim	emacs
because someone already mentioned emacs of course there s vim with r plugin don t know how many of those there are but i found at least one with a quick google

1783297
vim	emacs
vim might have an even steeper learning curve than emacs though

1783297
vim	emacs
i think emacs and vim will both handle pretty much any language out there so let the flame war begin

1783381
imperative	declarative
a paradigm is a way of doing things and there are two main programming paradigms imperative and declarative

1783407
vim	emacs
emacs and vim have a bigger learning curve but they re also very powerful especially if you re already using them for something else

1783523
mouse	keyboard
i also found a tool called xdotool which allows you to programatically simulate keyboard and mouse activity amongst other things

1783552
hash	md5
i would use a hash function like sha or md5 this will generate the same output for a given input every time

1783582
hash	md5
you could use a simple lcg or you could use a hash function like md5

1783631
folder	dir
i have a folder named lib and i am using the file find module to search that folder in whole dir say d

1783640
inherited	properties
in other words as your inherited properties have a different meaning than the properties you get from interfaces you have to access them differently

1783690
filtering	grouping
its difficult to tell without looking at an execution plan but i think that whats happening is that sql server is not clever enough to realise that the where clause specified is filtering out the grouping and does not have any effect on the records included for each grouping

1783725
post	get
regarding the use of the -readcount parameter i did a blog post on this a while ago that folks might find useful - optimizing performance of get content for large files

1783733
post	get
i can easily get a count of post grouped by date but this doesn t return the dates when there are no post eg it misses out 17-11-2009

1783752
apache	lighttpd
if you want to off load the polling requests to a second server lighttpd in your case then it would be better to setup lightttpd in front of apache on a second physical machine and use a shared caching server memcache so that the lighttpd server can read the cached timestamps and apache can update the cached timestamps

1783752
apache	lighttpd
the rationale for putting lighttpd in front of apache is if most requests are polling requests to avoid the heavier-weight apache process usage

1783763
int	chars
if you have a string representation of an int number you could write the isincre function like this ord converts a chars to an int and string is just a list of chars

1783802
profiling	instrumentation
the only good way to tell if there is any discernible difference in performance is to use profiling tools like instrumentation for measuring things like display framerate for the two techniques or shark to determine hotspots in your code

1783812
integer	unsigned
it s a little confusing but a uint_ptr as well as the more standardized uintptr_t is defined to be an unsigned integer that is guaranteed to be large enough to hold a pointer value

1783821
coalesce	isnull
both coalesce and isnull answers give in other answers are equally valid too for this particular case and simpler frankly

1783833
ubuntu	linux
on my ubuntu linux system it s about 1000 lines of output including this

1783839
button	checkbox
and sometimes after clicking on some button and checkbox in the grid more empty rows are added

1783921
coalesce	isnull
or in this situation you can use coalesce or isnull

1783969
translation	localization
we ve recently finished internationalizing a website and are ready to begin the im sure arduous task of localization translation

1783973
changeset	cherry-pick
as that is probably lacking the rest of trunk s files i d then branch off trunk tmp-trunk and replay cherry-pick all the changeset from tmp-subdir onto tmp-trunk

1784044
weblogic	oc4j
weblogic websphere and oc4j consider

1784054
for-loop	loops
if your for-loop is performance-critical and not doing heavy computation such that the index arithmetic actually matters you should almost certainly be restructuring your code to do more work in each pass of loops

1784064
gridbaglayout	springlayout
the flowlayout gridbaglayout and springlayout managers use the component s preferred size the latter two depending on the constraints you set but borderlayout and gridlayout usually don t.if you specify new size hints for a component that s already visible you need to invoke the revalidate method on it to make sure that its containment hierarchy is laid out again

1784075
rss	feed
i am creating some process that will retrieve the content from the rss feed every 3 hours

1784135
put	get
the -e will put the project in myproject src but link it to myproject lib pythonx.x site-packages so any changes you make will get picked up immediately in modules that import it from your local site-packages

1784162
ubuntu	linux
i am attempting a fresh install of drupal 6.14 on a ubuntu 9.10 machine using xampp for linux

1784183
maven	pom.xml
first explicitly specify that you want to use a version of the maven assembly plugin greater or equal to 2.2-beta-3 in your pom.xml the includes excludes of the unpackoptions element that you ll need later don t behave as expected in versions prior to 2.2-beta-3

1784196
width	text-align
but that would mean wrapping everything in a container element and setting the width of that element along with the text-align property

1784203
for-loop	arrays
then just do a for-loop on that arrays

1784211
children	parent
if you delete their parent windows forms automatically calls dispose on the children as well

1784276
hide	show
that can be achieved using the default jquery slide function what happens is that the new item on the list comes with a slide show and the last one with a slide hide in it

1784328
width	height
jquery will return the correct width height of the div which is the width height of the image

1784328
width	height
using javascript alone won t work because js won t return a width height unless it s set to a fixed value in the style

1784346
punctuation	words
all in all since l is identically equivalent to list g it s hard to get very excited about the ability to express it via punctuation square brackets instead of round parentheses instead of a single short pronounceable and obvious words like list

1784362
filesystems	ntfs
the disk is formatted with ntfs and we would like to search the filesystems using wildcards

1784415
fadein	fadeout
this starts the fadein before the fadeout is done

1784427
multiplying	addition
if you know beforehand that you will have overflow then you can scale their amplitudes prior to addition - simply multiplying by a floating point value between 0 and 1 again keeping in mind the issue of precision perhaps converting to a larger data type first

1784477
vsto	add-in
i am struggling to find a straight forward guide to creating office add-in using vsto and vb.net

1784570
udp	tcp
i used to have the same exact application but instead of udp it was tcp based

1784572
pull	push
they re having you pull commits over http and push them via ssh

1784625
filtering	grouping
if you combine a filtering and a grouping however sql server can no longer use this trick and is forced to evaluate the value of count or max based on the filtering result set leading to expensive lookups

1784650
gif	png
just to add i do not want the php script to be evoked when requests are made for css js png gif jpg and other media etc

1784652
getter	setter
setter and getter functions or to access members directly via

1784661
width	height
they have the same height and different width

1784664
imperative	declarative
i have been searching the web looking for a definition for declarative and imperative programming that would shed some light for me

1784671
getter	setter
with c you would typically not define setter and getter for each struct member

1784671
getter	setter
the advantages of setter and getter is present in c++ because you can do data hiding via private and protected

1784685
udp	tcp
i have trouble deciding whether it should use udp or tcp what basic commands should it support

1784687
imperative	declarative
declarative programming is when you say what you want and imperative language is when you say how to get what you want

1784710
imperative	declarative
you have declarative .aspx files and then the imperative aspx.cs code files

1784716
imperative	declarative
c# is a much more imperative programming language but certain c# features are more declarative like linq

1784727
width	height
i m listening on the stage to event.resize updating my width height to match the stagewidth stageheight and drawing a rectangle to show me how big it is

1784727
width	height
the width and height are correct in both cases but in the small case everything is in a small box

1784732
udp	tcp
looking further i see that the difference is that the tcp version of your code receives data via the inputstream that s provided by socket whereas the udp version of your code receives data directly from the datagramsocket s own receive method

1784733
listview	gridview
i am facing a similar wpf listview gridview sorting issue and i have some contraints which makes it difficult to implement the csharp solutions provided

1784740
keydown	keyup
you have to let the keyup in order to fire a new keydown event

1784743
.htaccess	httpd.conf
so basically in httpd.conf i m adding an include to conf extra httpd-zf.conf which contains the same thing that was in my .htaccess and working perfectly

1784773
width	height
i m vaguely aware i can create the tab bar without these values and probe the window and tabbar for height and width to calculate the desired values but i m struggling to achieve this

1784773
width	height
what i want to achieve is a tab bar of the standard width and height correctly positioned at the bottom of the enclosing view

1784787
udp	tcp
you shouldn t have trouble deciding whether to use tcp or udp you should rely on the actual dhcp spec to determine what protocol is used

1784812
getter	setter
in c if you are creating a new struct it already has setter getter built in

1784812
getter	setter
no need to create separate setter getter interfaces and functions in c

1784843
django	turbogears
with things like django or turbogears or all the other web-frameworks you essentially set up a small stand-alone web-server which comes bundled with the framework so you don t have to do anything tell the server which function should handle what url and then write those functions

1784872
x86	64bit
all the registers in cpu of x86 are 32-bit where as for 64bit its 64bit

1784873
windows	wow64
for example on windows you have things like filesystem redirection and registry redirection wow64 when running 32-bit apps on a 64-bit windows os

1784899
x86	64bit
in x86 there are 8 32 bit registers in x64 the registers are 64bit each and there are 8 more of them

1784906
getter	setter
following up brian bondy s answer in c you cannot have getter and setter

1784926
hide	show
on the other hand you may want to hide the struct entirely and only show its declaration to the clients as a kind of an opaque handle

1784933
width	height
so if you update the width and height on that as well it works

1784937
width	margin
just float right the inner main div set the outer sidebar div to be width 100 and specify that the inner main div has a left margin to allow for the sidebar margin-left 20

1784948
min	max
you either stop outputting the fields that are different or choose to aggregate them and specify which of the multiple values you want min max etc for when there are duplicates

1784958
min	max
max min sum avg

1784976
min	max
then all the other columns in the select need to be output using some aggregate function line min max avg etc.

1785018
many-to-one	one-to-many
in that case the table that changes the relationship direction from many-to-one to one-to-many is the one in the join clause

1785047
division	multiplication
and indeed as noted by mark scalar division and multiplication is also possible

1785062
imperative	declarative
i think it doesn t matter which of the terms declarative imperative functional or procedural is a subset of which

1785082
width	height
after reading a few posts i established that the issue was indeed that there was no content in the div except for a table i was trying to make the background image adjust to the size of the broswer without collapsing or expanding and therefore used a much larger image in the background of the div in order to form a cropping of sorts. the solution for me it seems was to simply cheat by placing an img tag that displayed a blank .png file that i then re-adjusted to the the correct height of the image with width set to 100

1785109
imperative	declarative
i ll add another example that rarely pops up in declarative imperative programming discussion the user interface

1785109
button	checkbox
on the imperative end you could use directx or opengl to very imperatively draw your button checkbox etc.

1785109
imperative	declarative
just because one language is declarative or imperative does not mean that it doesn t have certain features of the other

1785109
imperative	declarative
also one benefit of declarative programming is that purpose is usually more easily understood from reading the code whereas imperative gives you finer control over execution

1785167
hide	show
in the user control you add a textbox and a combobox and add a method property to show one and hide another

1785191
children	parent
there may be smarter ways of accomplishing this task but the stupid quick method i would use is to modify the parent object to contain a children collection

1785191
children	parent
if you didn t want to add a children collection to your parent object you may be able to use the following xaml binding

1785194
maven	pom.xml
it is executing maven mvn commands fine but it couldnt recognizing the maven project pom.xml to run the build.so i tried to execute the same pom.xml through the command window and that is working fine could any one can help me how to solve the issue

1785199
firefox	safari
i was building an active directory single sign-on authentication system for java web applications using spnego kerberos and everything works fine with either firefox or reportedly safari but internet explorer causes an exception

1785212
multiplying	division
you might also want to create a simple hash function for hashmap entry objects to return smaller numbers to increase multiplying division performance

1785235
merb	ruby-on-rails
it allows you to do the kinds of things you re talking about and shrugs off the weight of frameworks like ruby-on-rails or merb

1785244
getter	setter
how can you get intellij to generate getter setter on one line like this

1785308
bmp	png
this happens with all filetypes png bmp etc...

1785321
bionic	libc
google s android in it s bionic libc implementation has a completely reimplemented elf loader

1785337
width	height
the problem is that default implementation for setters of width and height is just a mere alias to scalex and scaley .

1785337
width	height
at the same time the default getters simply return the effective width and height on screen so if you draw to the sprite it s width and height are updated accordingly .

1785364
width	height
this gets harder the more content you have but if you just have something like an image or a button or what have you it s really easy to just calculate the height and width then divide by 2 and subtract

1785370
width	height
i know where 0 0 is width 2 height 2

1785393
width	height
when creating the array add an offset to each x value equal to half of the width and an offset to y equal to half of the height

1785430
public	protected
generally public protected private is what i would expect - but maybe that is more from my c# time

1785441
consistency	acid
there are a lot of anti-rdbmss or base systems basically available soft state eventually consistent as opposed to acid atomicity consistency isolation durability to choose from here and here

1785471
actionscript	mxml
actually here i include the actionscript file into mxml

1785573
switching	screens
vs2008 sp1 in visual studio 2008 sp1 having windows in non-default locations for example after docking and undocking windows when switching between debugging and designing or switching to from full screens can result in a crash of the visual studio ide

1785597
coldfusion	railo
also for development adobe s coldfusion is free and well as railo s open source offering which bundles with blaze ds the same open source java amf server that coldfusion 9 comes with

1785602
spweb	spsite
just a side note you should generally wrap your spsite and spweb objects in a using clause as these are unmanaged objects as outlined here

1785648
width	height
create a new image in memory setting width height depending on how you want to join them place the 3 images onto that image and save it

1785679
photoshop	fireworks
don t know if you can keep most of the eye-candy in photoshop and then assemble reamble versions with ease using fireworks

1785708
public	protected
regarding structure class access specifications you will typically see public members listed first followed by protected then private in order of increasing access control

1785719
ubuntu	linux
im using mxmlc to compile as3 on ubuntu linux

1785726
post	get
this is the point i m stuck at requiring a pre-shared key through a get post parameter would be easisest and probably the worst solution

1785726
post	get
edit i clealrly remember writing requiring a pre-shared key through a get post parameter would be easisest and probably the worst solution

1785729
google-chrome	firefox
also as an addition i use dreamweaver to write code and the background colors show up in the preview mode but do not show up in firefox google-chrome or ie

1785740
int	chars
you probably only want to do this for a few chars - once you ve read a few chars the sum becomes quite big and php can t handle it properly unless you resort to using functions suitable for large int math you can certainly use gmp and such but it may not be ideal for your case

1785746
width	height
or map your coordinates by adding half the width and half the height of the desired viewing area to each coordinate

integer	fractions
integer division drops the fractions portion of the result

1785899
rss	feed
i ve installed the wordpress.org script however the rss feed just sends me errors

1785915
int	double
thus since two int s are divided by each other they will evaluate to an int solution in this case rounding towards zero before being implicitly converted to a double

1785915
int	double
as other have noted you ll need to cast the int variables as double s so the solution comes out as a double and not as an int

hash	md5
if you are not concerned with security someone deliberately trying to break your hashing then simply using the md5 hash will give you an excellent hash with minimal effort

1786428
hash	md5
it is likely that you could do an sha hash of 100kb in well less than 10 second though and though sha-1 is still theoretically flawed it is of higher strength than md5

similarly you could just push the changed rows to this small table - and have your cache-maintenance program pull from this table

1786648
jruby	mri
on the other hand ror apps deployment is easier both ruby mri or jruby but the application s size is naturally larger given you have to install other gems and ruby on rails plugins

1786705
width	height
these two controls are very simple in that they are both grids that take up 100 width and height of what they are given

1786705
width	height
the animations i chose to start were the doubleanimation s for setting the width and height of my controls

1786705
width	height
this all means that when a user clicks on the window my two controls will at the same time over the course of 1 2 second shrink and grow in height or width

1786705
width	height
the awesome control will shrink in width and the awesomer control will shrink in height

1786929
vim	emacs
both vim and emacs have pretty steep learning curves but the power you get is totally worth it

1786933
int	boolean
i ve been using int32 string and boolean instead of int string bool in c# for a while now but i don t know why

1786951
int	boolean

1786974
getter	setter
what i was thinking though could i build these into the getter and setter methods for my date property on the linq-to-sql created object model or should i just go round the app everywhere re assigning how the value is saved adding an extra line to the controller like

1786991
put	get
and use that to get the last id inserted and put that in your new record

1786996
vim	emacs
on today s machines that s a non-issue but if you ever find yourself dealing with older gear it s my experience that vim is far more likely to work on a wonky terminal than emacs is

it simplifies the form layout and allows you to show and hide whole tabs depending on choices made in other tabs

1789566

1789582
ant	maven
use pmd from the command line from an ant script or use maven to build your projects

1789647
webclient	httpwebrequest
you need to use httpwebrequest rather than webclient as you can t set the timeout on webclient without extending it even though it uses the httpwebrequest

1789666
accessor	properties
additionally if you leave the set accessor public then the consuming code will be able to set the properties to null which can break other consuming code

1789666
accessor	properties
so a good technique to keep the consuming code from being able to set the properties value to null is to set the set accessor to be private

1789679
put	get
i m expecting to see a string such as abc or def as that is what i put in there initially but if i do a system.out.println i get something like java.lang.string#f0454

an application that acquires the mouse or keyboard device in exclusive mode should always unacquire the devices when it receives wm_entersizemove and wm_entermenuloop messages

1790085
getter	setter
this includes getter and setter in properties

1790085
getter	setter
it s a great feature but what resharper doesn t know is that when you re designing a view which will be displayed in the designer form user ctrl that the property getter and setter are called at design time and don t show up in compilation

1790085
getter	setter
so resharper will suggest that those property s getter or setter can be made private or just removed

1790091
post	get
here a rest server will respond to http requests get post delete and suchlike to perform crud operations for persistence and most likely business core rules and security

1790096
versioning	upgrade
some people are not in control of their browser versioning and cannot upgrade it

1790108
put	get
to get rid of it just put

1790195
addclass	removeclass
you should use toggleclass instead of addclass + removeclass

1790255
google-chrome	firefox
the style attribute isn t a string so that type of selector won t work in fact the console in google-chrome and firefox both say indexof is not a function when trying this one

1790262
maven	pom.xml
this is the python equivalent to maven pom.xml it looks something like this

1790272
accessor	properties
canread only indicates that the properties has a get accessor

1790277
mouseleave	mouseenter
i suggest using hover this instead of binding to mouseenter and mouseleave looks cleaner to me

1790353
versioning	upgrade
so if your team upgrade boost to a new versioning you could simply change the include path in the .sln or .vsprops files to make the compiler search for the new versioning -- if a coworker hasn t installed the right versioning he just won t be able to build which might be preferable to silently building with an old versioning

1790428
selecteditem	selectedindex
it seems that the listbox is populated after the initialization and the selectedindex will become 0 after all.same story for setting the selecteditem to null

1790454
int	chars	int	boolean
for sure object keys cannot contain spaces or any non unicode chars unquoted variables can be only boolean int float object and array value strings should always be quoted

1790470
jdom	xom	jdom	dom4j	dom4j	xom
there are at least 3 different ways to implement the xml-wrapping part sax xslt and xml libraries like jdom dom4j and xom--i prefer xom but any of them will work

1790470
outputstream	inputstream
if i had to implement that then i would create an xmlfilter that takes in xml and writes xml out stacking that on top of another piece that writes xml to an outputstream and writing a wrapper method around the unmarshalling stuff to feed the incoming stream to the xmlreader copy the outputstream to another inputstream an easy way is to use commons-io and feed the new inputstream to the castor unmarshaller

1790470
jdom	xom	jdom	dom4j	dom4j	xom
using xom or jdom or dom4j to wrap the xml is also possible and the learning curve is a lot lower than for sax or xslt

1790475
calloc	malloc
variables stored on the heap are the variables which you initiated using explicit memory allocation routines such as malloc calloc new etc

1790500
jtextpane	jeditorpane
so i have a gap between in-memory result of xsl transformation and javax.swing.text.styleddocument which can be rendered by jeditorpane or jtextpane

1790506
selecteditem	selectedindex
that should de-select everything since index -1 doesn t exist but as far as i m aware unless you explicitly set the default selecteditem the listview is generated with nothing selected so it s possible that selectedindex has been inadvertently set at some point

1790537
postgresql	mysql
i m an oracle guy myself yet sometimes i find it hard to argue its use over postgresql or even mysql

1790566
profiling	debugging
if so then i would debugging profiling it for any performance matters leaks

1790610
lxml	beautifulsoup
beautifulsoup - if lxml fails on your input try this

1790624
width	height	factors	mean
if you mean the aspect ratio of a height and width it s just height width reduced to its greatest common factors

1790624
width	height
replace 1600 and 1200 with the width and height you want respectively

1790645
post	put
i ll leave the question open big thanks to everyone who put their hat in the ring it was all useful and if anyone comes up with anything further i d love to hear some more options...and if anyone finds this post as a result of seeing this behaviour in their own environments then hopefully there s some pointers here that you can try yourself and hope fully see further than we did

1790676
super	extends
it was my understanding that the no-arg constructor of any super class was implicitly called from any class that extends it am i wrong

rss	feed
i have a rss feed for each wishlist

1790780
rss	feed
it would be very easy to generate your users code and you might even be able to make use of your rss feed for this

1790818
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
all other browsers opera firefox google-chrome don t see the style for #right and thus don t apply it

an https ssl page

1790865
pop-up	dialog
i am using jquery ui dialog for modal pop-up

1790920
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
if you absolutely need the sorting feature you could consider using a sorteddictionary instead of a sortedlist

1790921
apache	nginx
serve all user uploaded content with nginx instead of apache and serve it all as static content it will not run any of the php or cgi even if the users upload it

1790956
post	get
you could think of other solutions like copying all post data and doing a get request to your second form or storing all data in a temporary table transmitting an id to your second form and load the corresponding data there but i guess this implies modifying your second form and is not really acceptable

1791030
wav	aiff
if i m not mistaken sun s vm has built-in support for aiff au and wav files

1791050
entities	entitymanager
my problem arises the moment any entities are loaded in my entitymanager session before i launch my query

1791068
width	text-align
it seems like it s only the text-align center that s not correctly respecting the full width

1791071
width	height
this might need position height and width attributes as well to work

1791161
lxml	libxml2
btw another answer recommended lxml which is a python library but is actually built on libxml2

1791161
lxml	libxml2
if lxml worked well for him chances are libxml2 is going to work well for you

1791200
google-chrome	firefox
i tested in both firefox and google-chrome with flash v

1791221
post	get
i just want a ruby script to sit on the server get passed a few variables in a post request and return a json string in response

1791286
firefox	safari
web browsers like firefox internet explorer or safari are an exception because they don t lock open files and flex builder is able to re-compile even though your application is running in the browser of course you will need to hit refresh in your browser to see any further changes

1791298
post	get
the issue i have with that is that i must post data and jsonp only allows for get

1791315
put	get
for example if you have a variable of type array and you use it as a key to put something into a hash and then you add something to the array and try to use that variable as the key to get the something back out of the hash it won t work as the array s hash value has changed

1791316
entity-relationship	entities
the entity-relationship model allows you to manage entities vacancies career levels education independently and then assign manage relationships between those entities

1791356
width	height
if you choose the x y and height width for your new custom text to be the same as for the static installtext the installtext will be obscured

1791356
button	checkbox
you could add multiple text controls or...you can add lines button checkbox whatever

1791403
for-loop	loops
so while in a for-loop most of the time i m adding a boolean varible to simple exit loops

1791414
getter	setter
writing is allowed then i would use separate getter and setter methods rather than properties

1791444
versioning	upgrade
ability to try out different versioning or upgrade quickly

1791451
post	get
this common pattern is known as the post redirect get pattern

1791451
post	get
bonus info about keeping state when doing post redirect get

1791451
post	get
if you generate some kind of status object - maybe a log of sent mail messages - while handling the post request you will need some way to save this object for the following get request

1791451
post	get
saving the object to the session on the post reading and deleting it on the following get would be one way to solve this

1791500
haskell	scheme
a well-known downside of lazy functional programming applies to haskell or clean but not to ml or scheme or clojure is that it is very difficult to predict the time and space costs of evaluating a lazy functional program mdash

1791617
textchanged	selectedindexchanged
when i click sort or change page index and the results have not returned and do it again click sort or page index while it is busy the selectedindexchanged and textchanged events fires on some of the controls

1791671
keyup	mouseup
in ie only the select event applies to body text as well as form inputs so would do what you want but to detect when the user has made a selection in a cross-browser way you will need to handle both keyup and mouseup events

1791681
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
using a case-insensitive file search on the case-sensitive server should only be a last resort

1791809
printf	strlen
no that just shifts the problem of detecting the end of the string from printf to strlen and it s still exactly the same

1791832
post	get
if you post some example code that explains your problem and a deeper explanation of what you are trying to achieve with it you ll get some better responses

1791838
printf	strlen
on the other hand since strlen str determines string length by counting the number of characters before a null is encountered it doesn t offer you any benefit over just using printf without a field width specified

1791838
printf	strlen
the upshot the only case where specifying a field width for a string is helpful is when the string isn t guaranteed to be null-terminated or the classic case of using printf to write to a buffer that may not be big enough to hold the contents of str but in that case you d have to determine string length using something other than strlen

1791840
wordpress	joomla
the most common used cmses are of course wordpress joomla and drupal

1791861
int	chars	int	double
you should be able to convert those chars to int values using the double function

1791861
int	double
you could also leave off the call to int16 to just leave the result as type double the value it stores would still be an int

1791949
stdout	stderr
btw i do have separate threads for reading stderr and stdout and that s the way to go

1791950
ilist	iqueryable
implement my own iorderedenumerable which is risky too because i perform ordering on iqueryable or ilist then i perform other linq operations so i fear side effects

1791951
getter	setter
i m accesing profile properties with getter and setter so i don t need the profilecommon class

1791977

1792243
uiview	subviews
subviews is an array of uiview not uiviewcontrollers

1792253

1792279
pascal	delphi	ada	pascal
you can take parts of the style guide of other pascal derivatives ada is based on modula which is based on pascal like delphi which feel a bit closer to home for pl sql i use a mixture of .net delphi

1792307
filtering	grouping
if you re filtering on the totals by this row grouping you cannot have a field indicating if row is excluded or not in a dataset

1792307
filtering	grouping	hide	show
i need to filtering out negative totals per patients patient row grouping but i have column grouping as well - per month so my dataset cannot be per-patient granularity and therefore the only place ssrs can decide whether to hide or show the row is on the row grouping level.

1792370
postgresql	mysql
i think you ll find that postgresql works a lot better for nearly any workload olap especially than mysql

1792370
postgresql	greenplum
greenplum and other similar solutions should work a bit better than postgresql depending on your data sets and use cases

1792414
post	get
curl performs actions pertaining to http requests and other networking protocols but i d bet http is the most-used. you can set http cookies along with get post variables

1792614
apache	nginx
it is a module for apache and nginx to host rails and rack applications

1792619
getter	setter
that way if you need to make changes you want to extend it from just mapping integer data to complex numbers then you would create new setter and getter so that you insulate the data from the application and you are free to change the implementation all you want with little care as long as you keep to the contracts you already agreed to

1792619
int	double
so if you state that int arrays can be used in the constructor or as a setter then allow that but also allow other types ie double complexdatatype for example

1792633
post	get
if you serialize the data it should be sent to php as query parameters if you are using a get method ajax request or post vars if you are using a post ajax request

1792677
post	put
the way to do it yourself would be to read up on how the body of a post request is put together it looks a lot like a url query string build the string out of the various parts and then use the request s -sethttpbody method

1792683
put	get
if i put it into irb alone i get syntax error unexpected tamper

1792703

width	height
i believe that actual default value for either of width and height properties is the double.nan value

1793256

1793349
hash	hmac
as the stream cipher is xored with the plain text it means that a 1 bit change in the ciphertext directly results in that bit changing in the decrypted data therefore some sort of message integrity is paramount most likely a hmac so that an attacker cannot realistically generate the hash and correct that as well

1793399
int	chars
for example a is a literal of the type chars and 2001 is a literal of the type int

stdout	stderr
the console based sub-processes communicate via stdin stdout and stderr and if you run them in a genuine console they terminate cleanly when you press ctrl+c

superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
also parameterised constructor of superclass is not inherited by subclassing

in fact logically a subclassing never inherited the constructors or destructors of the superclass

1799092
rational-numbers	integer	division	multiplication
the sort of constructions you re talking about will require multiplication and division which means that to preserve exactness you ll have to use rational-numbers which are generally easy to implement on top of a suitable sort of big integer of unbounded magnitude

pop-up	dialog
there are a number of things you might have meant by when i upload it it doesn t do anything other than i create an applet jar and upload it to my server then reference it in an applet tag of an html page and when i open the page the security warning dialog pop-up but i click it and nothing further occurs

1799202
floating-point	fractions
data can be lost when floating-point representations are converted to integral representations as the fractions components of the floating-point values will be truncated rounded down

1799202
floating-point	integer
conversely converting from an integral representation to a floating-point one can also lose precision since the floating-point type may be unable to represent the integer exactly for example float might be an ieee 754 single precision type which cannot represent the integer 16777217 exactly while a 32-bit integer type can

everything is nice and shining and i managed to write a small application that meets my needs but i noticed that many times for instance when i click a button or a listview the event is handled listview selection is changed but the area under the mouse is not updated so a small rectangle at the place where the mouse pointer was is not updated â the background color of the entire gridview selected item line is turned to dark blue but there is a white rectangle area where the mouse was

1799484
getter	setter
in their developer articles for android google states that you should usually declare public variables rather than private ones with getter and setter to enhance performance on embedded devices i suppose function calls are more expensive than just writing to an address

1799511
onresize	onload
you can use the code and function calls inside onload and onresize body events

1799521
getter	setter
as for getter and setter

1799521
getter	setter
the advantage of using getter and setter is that you can log changes to parameters and do some input validation

1799521
getter	setter
but i can t really believe that getter and setter can t be optimized away by using for example final classes

1799532
hide	show
you ll need to trap all selection related operations on the list control and show hide or move and update the contents of the combo box

1799549
pull	push
and if your inside a function you typically want to push pull your return address to the stack before and after the function call respectively otherwise you will end up in an infinite loop

in a nutshell i have a for-loop updating a dynamic text element but it seems to iterate so fast that only the last item in loops is updating the text

1799606
777	tmp
maybe you can try testing for a file on tmp with 777 as it permission bits

1799607
getter	setter
in particular if you re choosing between trivial pass-through getter setter methods and public variables you re already most of the way down the breaking encapsulation road so you might as well not pay the extra performance hit for no gain in flexibility

1799611
getter	setter
now google indeed tell use to avoid getter and setter but only for an internal use api should still expose only getter and setter

1799626
notepad++	textpad
i mostly use notepad++ and textpad on windows 7 and they both work fine

1799962
waitpid	posix	int	boolean
by the way the function can be expanded easily to be blocking you may simply add a flag int blocking or whatever is now used in c99 for the boolean that will trigger a waitforsingleobject for the win32 section and a waitpid for the posix section

1799984
folder	dir
by total disk space and available disk space in a folder i refer to the total and available disk space that this folder would report if you performed a dir command on it that is the total and available disk space of the logical drive containing that folder considering the user account under which the request is being made

backtracking	greedy
if you let the greedy dot gobble up everything up to the end of the file quick and then backtracking until you find a line that starts with words or spaces tabs but no newlines and then class or interface and 1 then that doesn t require as much stack space

1800312

1800528
post	put
i meant to put that into the original post since i knew someone would mention it

1800531
filtering	grouping
in order to accomplish this what i ve done is created a sql query where i join the events for each location and then grouping by the location name and only use location grouping having more than 10 entries that filtering out the somewhat non-reliable entries but i still end up with some very different spellings and entries resulting in duplicate properties locations

1800536
int	double
finally image wants either int between 0 and 255 or double between 0 and 1.0 so you need to cast or rescale your numbers

monodevelop	sharpdevelop
in addition the monodevelop ide is also built in c# and gtk# originally based on sharpdevelop

1800570

1800612
getter	setter
google does not say to avoid getter setter and make your variables public for android

1800612
getter	setter
they do advise to not use getter setter from within a class to access its own fields

1800612
getter	setter
avoid internal getter setter

1800612
getter	setter
it s reasonable to follow common object-oriented programming practices and have getter and setter in the public interface but within a class you should always access fields directly.

1800617
hide	show
i frequently have objects in my pages that i want to activate deactivate hide show etc. but - having missed the rigorous introduction to javascript - i ve no idea how these things get named

google-chrome and firefox do not do this i m assuming opera and safari do not as well

1800671
nfa	dfa
this however neglected the fact that the number of states in the dfa after conversion from an nfa can end up being 2 m where m is the number of states in the nfa

1800671
nfa	dfa
so for now i m just going to go ahead with the regex nfa dfa approach

1800712
implements	extends
the only way to change types is to assign a different instance of a compatible type to the variable if the variable will accept types implements foo and types foo1 and foo2 both implements extends foo then an instance of either can be assigned to the variable

1800727
int	double
one field can be double one field string one field int

1800793
filtering	grouping
this works but how do i filtering by a certain grouping

1800864

i am aware of the biginteger.probableprime int bitlength random but i am not sure how or even if the bitlength translates into a max min value of the outputted prime

1801056
post	get
i am also suspecting that flex may be on-connection-drop automatically retrying the post or get request resulting in our server receiving the request twice

1801057
put	get
because parsechildren was true the child controls would be put into a property rather than into the containing control s child controls collection and would never get their onprerender function called

if your problem domain involves concurrent programming clojure s array of integrated tools for managing concurrency may be a better fit than the implementation-specific or lowest-common-denominator libraries available in other lisp and scheme

1801181
min	max
jprete s answer is fine if your ratio max min is not close to 1

1801185

1801220
int	chars
i m trying to put the coefficients of polynomials from a chars array into an int array

1801222
memset	calloc	memset	malloc	calloc	malloc
you can use calloc instead of malloc to have the memory be initialized set to zero or you can use memset after you allocate the memory and set the memory to zero yourself

1801234
atoi	strncpy
the strncpy function leaves the string un-terminated which may cause atoi to crash or give the wrong value randomly

1801248

it is certainly not what i would expect a click event in my terminology implies that the distance between mousedown and mouseup is below a certain threshold

1801412
move	drag
the message will be displayed only if the mouse didn t move too much between the down and up events a normal click should trigger it a drag shouldn t

xna	spritebatch
my only prior game programming experience is in microsoft s xna and c# which has a built in spritebatch framework that makes it incredibly easy to draw scale and rotate pre-rendered sprites on screen

currently i m implementing a trackball approach that move the camera around when the user clicks and drag and i would like to be able to pan to a specific spot on the sphere but i dont know how to calculate the required 3d rotation transformation based on the cameras current position

1801943
innodb	myisam
basically the problem is that if the innodb engine fails to start for whatever reason usually configuration problems -- then mysql silently falls back to the myisam engine

1801943
innodb	myisam
then if innodb isn t active mysql will happily create a myisam table without even warning you

1801943
innodb	myisam
even if you later discover and fix the innodb problem all tables created during the problem remain myisam

1801955
public	protected
nonlegacy may make it protected or public as appropriate but defaulting to the same accessibility as its base class is a good idea.

1801977
boost	allocator
i would not expect anybody working for me to be an expert in all facets of boost but i do expect even fairly inexperienced c++ programmers to know where they can find it and that they will be better off using code from boost rather than trying to say write their own pooled memory allocator

1802477
width	height
assumption 2 you have several types of roof-related jobs and you want to issue a cost depending on the width height pitch and type

1802477
width	height
your roof table would need at least colums for width height pitch and type type of roof

1802477
width	height
but if you don t want to store width height and pitch on your database you would have to create a module in your lib directory and implements validations yourself

well on a single machine apc k-v cache is way faster than memcached

1803139
memcached	apc

1803306
updatepanel	onclientclick
if you have an updatepanel that displays a number in its load method and a button as a trigger and you make the button have an onclientclick method that increments the number the updatepanel will not update when you click it

1803306
updatepanel	onclientclick
this is because the updatepanel load method runs before the onclientclick method so it draws the number on the screen before it increments it

1803306
updatepanel	scriptmanager
at the moment i get around this by using the scriptmanager to tell me which button or whatever caused the updatepanel to trigger and then i use that to run the increment method before it renders which works

1804400
put	get
basically this is used so that attackers can t get the url and include it on their page and have javascript now put the variables on the page because as soon as the request has been serviced the browser will go into an infinite loop not allowing other javascrip access to said variables which would potentially allow attackers to use your browser to get information that is meant to stay private

i m working on a number of delphi applications that will need to upgrade their own database structures in the field when new versioning are released and when users choose to install additional modules

1804464
versioning	upgrade
i can see two ways of implementing this storing a versioning number with the database and using ddl scripts to get from older versioning to newer versioning or storing a reference versioning of the database structure inside the application comparing the reference to the database on start-up and having the application generate ddl commands to upgrade the database

exactly like in the typical implementation of java or c# python gets first compiled into some form of bytecode depending on the implementation cpython uses a specialized form of its own jython uses jvm just like a typical java ironpython uses clr just like a typical c# and so forth -- that bytecode then gets further processed for execution by a virtual machine aka interpreter which may also generate machine code just in time -- known as jit -- if and when warranted clr and jvm implementations often do cpython s own virtual machine typically doesn t but can be made to do so with psyco or unladen swallow

1807430
put	get
if i put test and execute it i get back test

1807444
folder	directory
if you meant recursively go down a directory hierarchy to delete all folder starting with a certain string then the following might suffice

1807444
folder	directory
this will recurse into the directory tree finding all folder starting with abc iterate over that list and removing each folder

1807451
floyd-warshall	dijkstra
i woluld first use dijkstra algorithm it has to be run for each verticle for computng shortest distances between all pairs of verticles - there are also some more efficient algorithms for that like floyd-warshall

1807468
winpcap	wireshark
i ve tried using winpcap but even wireshark

1807468
winpcap	wireshark
when i start wireshark sniffing which is based on winpcap driver i see only traffic from step #4 when it goes to the internet

1807472
ogre	irrlicht
also take note that while xna is a more complete game development framework there are many other available libraries such as ogre opengl and irrlicht that cover everything from audio to physics

1807486
int	double
if it was arbitrarily restricted to double s and int s then you couldn t use the template with a or run a test with a type which supports interval arithmetic even though those types provide those operators and the matrix library would be valid using them

1807516
post	get
i understand this is illegal according to the c++ standard as seen in this blog post but i don t know how to get my reference to d without using the conditional operator

if it needs to upgrade several versioning it must run each script in order

1807705
codeigniter	cakephp
i would suggest you to go for cakephp or codeigniter which are damn good for making large and maintainable sites

1807727
implements	extends
yes b both extends a and implements runnable

1807841
hash	md5
you are calculating the md5 hash of the ascii text

1807841
hex	binary
you will need to convert the ascii hex representation to actual binary bytes then run md5 on the blocks

1807859
qvalidator	qspinbox
just beware of dependencies - you might have to iterate a few times to get qt to build for instance qspinbox depends on qvalidator being present

1807933
fpdf	fpdi
like fpdf or fpdi opensource projects

1807969
width	height
either a single frame frameset or an iframe with width height set to 100

1808055
ienumerable	idictionary
edit i was researching an entirely different problem today binding datasets to silverlight datagrids and came across this article by vladimir bodurov which shows how to transform an ienumerable of idictionary to an ienumerable of dynamically created objects using il

1808055
ienumerable	idictionary
it occured to me that you could easily modify the extension method to accept a datareader rather than the ienumerable of idictionary to solve your issue of dynamic collections

1808082
min	max
why not use max min and union results

1808085
implements	extends
public class filedraggesturelistener extends dragsourceadapter implements draggesturelistener

1808187
bazaar	git
supports arch bazaar darcs git mercurial

1808228
int	boolean
this is very useful if the parameter or property is a simple type an int a boolean

1808230
post	get
preferably change your search form s method to get or use the post redirect get pattern

1808236
post	get
if you don t want that you can use get instead of post for your form method

1808245
sorting	filtering
i want to retain the functionality of the listviewwebpart rendering sorting filtering view definition action menus etc. but add this functionality

1808258
mouseup	mousedown
the problem is that if you mousedown on the img the div click fires on mouseup

1808282
keydown	keyup
i would imagine that either the form keypreview or just the keyup keydown events would help you get that

1808336
pop-up	dialog
it works fine but when the dialog pop-up it requires me to click on a button twice to use it

1808387
cvs	svn
rubymine has an excellent scm support and ships with svn cvs and even git compatibility

1808485
int	double
the normal divisions are stored in long double the int are stored in long long unsigned int

1808494
google-chrome	firefox
works with ie7 8 google-chrome 19 firefox 3.0.3

1808501
int	double
you shouldn t be using long double for your normal divisions but int there as well

1808577
put	get
however your legitimate authenticated users will get a different token put on their machine

1808604
hash	md5
don t send the md5 hash string from the db back

1808663
hash	md5
md5 is a hashing algorithm you will never be able to reverse the hash and that s the point

1808663
hash	md5
don t use md5 as it has been cracked use an sha2+ hash algorithm sha256 for example

1808677
filewriter	bufferedwriter	filewriter	printwriter	printwriter	bufferedwriter	ioexception	bufferedwriter	ioexception	filewriter	ioexception	printwriter
bufferedwriter file filewriter ioexception printwriter

1808704
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
to my mind it s a good candidate because current browsers ie firefox opera safari will look at it and switch the content into standards mode - even though they don t implement html5

1808729
content-length	content-type	content-disposition	content-length	content-disposition	content-type
before writing out this the content-length content-type and content-disposition must be set in order to send a valid header and filecontent to the client

1808731
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
what s nice about this new doctype especially is that all current browsers ie firefox opera safari will look at it and switch the content into standards mode - even though they don t implement html5

1808748
hash	md5
you re using md5 hash but if you look at the linked articles you will see that md5 alone is not enough and one can easily pick most of your passwords back if they have your database

1808748
hash	md5
for a quick test just throw an md5 hash into google and you will see that unless your password is really wicked you will get it back

1808763
do-while	break
break ends execution of the current for foreach while do-while or switch structure

1808803
min	max
group by clause in sql server allows columns which are in group by clause and in case we want some other columns then we need to access them via aggregate functions like max min etc

1808814
postgresql	mysql
so lets make the point i have a generic database postgresql or mysql doesn t matter that contains many generic objects

1808814
memcached	apc
memcached around 4-5 times slower than apc but run as a single process that can be touched everywhere in my environment

1808824
filtering	grouping
whilst you are filtering buildid to only be one value sql server requires that it be specified in the grouping by list

1808835
aggregate-functions	sum
group by means - group the results by listed fields and execute some aggregate-functions sum avg... on the rest of the fields

1808849
mouse	keyboard
this will check for both user inputs mouse and keyboard and fire an alert or whatever you wish when it changes

1808880
google-chrome	firefox
neither google-chrome nor firefox supports mht files so it s probably a microsoft only feature

1808990
aptana	radrails
the rails framework is a great setup for doing web development and i would highly recommend radrails as your ide or it s base aptana

1809011
parallels	bootcamp	vmware	bootcamp
install parallels vmware bootcamp and set up everything as you would for windows

1809024
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
ignoring svn externals might also ease the pain when you switch to distributed version control like git bazaar hg in the future

1809036
shadowbox	lightbox
hence javascript library third-party widgets such as thickbox lightbox shadowbox

1809053
swt	swing
this is usually problem of swing not swt swt is directly linked to os framework provided widgets - a quote from a gentle introduction to swt and jface 2

1809055
viewmodel	caliburn
you should also make sure that your namespace and class naming for views and viewmodel follows the caliburn default convention if you want your views to be correctly inferred by the framework

1809063
octal	decimal
it s a complete guess but i would suggest that the chmod function is taking a decimal mode rather than an octal one

1809086
post	get
some actions may always be using get no matter if the main view was posted back thus using post

1809205
folder	directory
but if i change default output folder from testweb build classes to testweb web web-inf classes eclipse stops to deploy external jars to web-inf lib directory

1809283
config	ini
you can load the config from a simple array from an ini style file or from an xml document

1809283
config	ini
also using ini files with zend_config allow you to define sections of config that inherit from each other

1809288
int	chars
create table #test buildid int verdict chars 7

1809296
udp	tcp
most logs won t be important so udp is fine for them but some are money-losing important alerts and must be reliably delivered implying tcp

1809323
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
our company have recently upgrade our fogbugz installation to versioning 7 downloaded the latest post-commit files and followed the latest instructions on integrating svn with fogbugz to get lists of modified files for each case.

upgrade to the newest versioning of php php 5.3.1

1809386
sunos	bsd
if the problem still persists and your server is running windows upgrade it to anything else particularily a form of nix a gnu linux distribution a form of bsd sunos etc.

1809455
post	get
you need to add to your get or post request being sent by your api client

1809465
strlen	strcpy
maybe the code is a bit faster than with strcpy as the 0 char doesn t need to be searched again it already was with strlen

1809468
integer	unsigned
i m representing an infinitely precise integer as an array of unsigned ints for processing on a gpu

1809503
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
alternatively the web inspector in safari google-chrome will do the trick as will the developer tools in both ie8 and opera

1809528
qbytearray	qimage	qtcpsocket	qdatastream	qtcpsocket	qbytearray	qimage	qdatastream	qdatastream	qbytearray
for images at least assuming you are using qimage you can use a qdatastream to convert your qimage to a qbytearray which can then be written to the qtcpsocket object using write

1809528
qbytearray	qiodevice	qfile	qbytearray	qiodevice	qfile
for general files the qiodevice base for qfile among others provides read functions such as readall which will read the whole file into a qbytearray ready for you to send

1809566
google-chrome	firefox
the code below works perfectly in firefox and google-chrome but not in iexplorer

1809589

1809598
trojan	virus
kidding if the client is not cooperating install some trojan virus kidding

1809604
subtract	add
in the worst case you can add them all and then subtract away the unnecessary ones

1809629
innodb	myisam
i recently migrated my whole db from myisam to innodb

1809668
inherited	properties
to exclude the inherited properties use the hasownproperty method

1809744
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
salt all passwords with a unique salt and then hash them md5 is not an ideal function for this as it has weaknesses

1809762
filesystems	hfs
they are odd because they are so hidden but many major filesystems hfs nss have it and the concept dates back to the early 80s

1809762
filesystems	ntfs
in fact originally the streams were added to ntfs for interoperability with other filesystems

1809777
installation	upgrade
for handling installation and upgrade of our application we use the debian packaging system

1809777
versioning	upgrade
fresh install and upgrade for a versioning to another are made through puppet a system for automating system administration tasks he install our .deb

1809777
versioning	upgrade
you can pick any of our .deb and make a fresh install or upgrade from the actual versioning to the versioning number he hold

1809803
hash	md5
password hashing or any other form of encryption or hashing should be done within your script and not through other client server requests ie create password hash before sending them to mysql dont do insert into users values 1 jblow md5 password as this query is viewable in logs and by administrators of the sql server

1809833
memcpy	memset
there are one or two people who have re-written many of the core c primatives memcpy memset etc

1809835
octal	decimal
the reason phpseclib expects permissions to be represented as an octal value 0755 is cast to a decimal value - not an octal one is because that s how ftp_chmod does it and that s what net_sftp chmod is modeled after

1809873
opera	firefox
opera only has limited javascript 1.7 support which includes very basic support of destructuring assignment so this won t work in opera but it will work in firefox

1809886
rubymine	radrails
i ve tried netbean radrails and rubymine

1809896
versioning	upgrade
you can guide a user to install an upgrade versioning instead of the existing one by pointing to the upgrade midlet s jad in a platformrequest but they have to remove it on their own

1809931
setinterval	settimeout
the idea being that upon success of the ajax request a variable will be set which will be the signal for a while loop that has called either setinterval or settimeout and a callback function as appropriate to exit

1809931
setinterval	settimeout
of setinterval and or settimeout

1809934
put	get
to get anywhere beyond keys you need to perform your checks at application level before you put an entity or a change to a unique set of properties you make a suitable query key-only for speed and check that it comes up empty but that gets pretty costly and hard to make transaction-safe

1809979
config	ini
as the value is not only used by the rails app i would probably store such config information in a language agnostic format yaml json ini xml which can be easily parsed by different tools without fear of possible side effects

1809980
memcached	apc
look into caching - opcode caching for the php pages and memory caching apc memcached for reference data and other static or close to static data

1810020
width	height
in this case the original image width height are 270 and 438 and the image was developed on 192dpi screen

1810037
width	height
ok ive found out the reason it doesnt show is because the video sometimes has a width and height of 0 pixels

1810074
width	height
resize both width and height by a percent

1810074
width	height
if you need a given width newwidth for example then calculate the percent of newwidth width 100 and calculate the height based on the resulting percent as above

1810094
put	get
you define a dataconstract for your data entities and an operation get put dataset

1810105
post	get
i have a few forms which are in get instead of post

1810124
redmine	trac
i ve happily used trac and redmine for various personal projects

1810124
redmine	trac
trac is written in python while redmine is written in ruby leveraging the rails framework

1810124
redmine	trac
redmine has built-in multiple project feature while trac planned supporting it in 0.12 already available in a branch

1810124
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git	bazaar	cvs	cvs	svn
redmine supports svn cvs git mercurial bazaar and darcs

1810130
put	get
you can get past the lock by specifying the with nolock hint in your select statement put it just after the table name but be very careful as it will read data that has not been committed something that might be rolled back

1810167
octal	hex
your programming language will doubtless use other regexes eg think about tokens for hex literals octal literals float doubles and comments in c c++ java

1810182
put	get
when i put the link in i get the following error

1810199
hash	md5
you can use a one way hash like md5 or sha-2 to sign a message to make it harder to forge or alter but there s no practical way to convert the hash back into a message

1810203
verilog	vhdl
i ve checked this and it works but i m more comfortable in verilog so this code may no be the nicest vhdl ever.

1810217
ubuntu	linux
i am actually successfully running a production website with asp.net mvc under mono in a ubuntu lts linux

1810235
decoder	encoder
serialization short-lived structure one encoder decoder

1810235
serializable	deserialization
personally i tried as much as i can to separate the code of serializable deserialization from the actual code that runs the class

1810235
serializable	deserialization
i usually try to keep serializable and deserialization of one version close together

1810246
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
you should not only md5 your passwords but add salt value and hash resulting password multiple times then save salt and hash string in database

1810294
put	get
it ll get the same end result as method two but in a nice repeatable way which can put into source control

1810299
fgets	strlen
when you read data with fgets it may be placed into buffer but when you transmit it everything after 0 gets lost your strlen call ensures this

1810306
128bit	64bit
you may want to have a second look at the infinity requirement and check if say 64bit or 128bit counter still can satisfy your algorithms for some limited period of time like 1000 years

1810312
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i m looking for some kind addon for browser firefox opera ie google-chrome etc... which can easily highlight element s which i define by jquery selector

1810317
gridview	linqdatasource
so now i have a gridview that uses a linqdatasource that is connected to the aspnet_membership table

1810325
sorting	grouping
it does this by creating a view which is a separate copy of your items source with your grouping and sorting applied to it

1810390
mouse	keyboard
but i need to disable mouse and keyboard so it wouldn t interrupt playback

1810390
mouse	keyboard
is there a easy way to block mouse and keyboard input while still using sendinput

1810416
set	bag
the other facet â whether the set permits duplicate elements â is meaningless in mathematics and is more accurately described as a bag

1810422
hide	show
in this case just hide the div or span that the updatepanel creates rather than trying to hide show a a new outer container

1810452
postgresql	mysql
some mail servers can store login information in databases like mysql or postgresql

1810456
google-chrome	firefox
it happened as expected in google-chrome firefox ie8

1810485
int	chars
i m calling this code within a loop and whats strange is that it correctly converts the first 47 chars then on the 48th chars it adds a 0 after the int on the 49th chars it adds a 1 on the 50th seen here it adds a two all the way up to the 57th chars where it adds a 9 then it continues to convert correctly all the way down to the 239th chars

1810501
strtol	atoi
also atoi doesn t provide any way to detect errors so prefer strtol and similar functions

1810514
put	get	post	put	post	get
the format of the xml for post and put or the url for get and delete and the deserialization of the response is done in helper methods

1810530
decoder	encoder
you need a json encoder decoder to do that

1810538
voip	sip
this reasonably high-level tutorial has lots of information including common voip questions and a discussion of sip functions and book recommendations

1810542
getter	setter
generate getter and setter is also a feature i find to save time when writing java beans

1810594
for-loop	loops
in your for-loop i ve created two variables l and si that store fsel.si.length and fsel.si respectively so that javascript doesn t have to look up the si and length properties every time around loops

1810597
folder	directory
for extra security you may rename the system folder to something else people can t guess or move the system folder two levels up to your home directory

1810606
haskell	agda
you can have a look at languages like haskell or even agda

1810640
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome rendered this ok firefox pushed the form button too far up

1810644
ocaml	sml
you can take a look if you want ocaml and sml are very close languages

1810649
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in firefox it works as expected but in ie8 safari and google-chrome it waits until all the code is processed and then shows the whole text

1810684
gridview	linqdatasource
i have a gridview using a linqdatasource with a datamodelcontext that i ve created

1810728
srp	ocp	srp	principles	ocp	principles
i would argue that you are violating two principles the single responsibility principles srp and the open closed principles ocp

1810728
srp	ocp
now my bootstrapping code adheres to both srp and ocp

1810753
cout	ofstream
so i overloaded the operator of the binarytree class to use cout tree and ofstream f tree but i receive the next error message undefined reference to operator std basic_ostream binarytree

1810787
firefox	safari
in safari and firefox the tw cen mt is displayed great but in ie times new roman is displayed

1810800
gif	png
the best way is to put headings and small paragraphs into graphics preferably as gif or png

1810838
std	ostream
friend std ostream operator std ostream os binarytree tree

1810863
opera	safari
web inspector is an integrated part of the safari browser thereby it is not going to be available for other browsers like opera mini android browser or what ever

1810864
ienumerable	ilist
nonetheless you should implement the ienumerable interface the ilist interface etc.

1810872
crossover	mutation
mutation crossover selection population gene - all this are separate classes

1810891
filtering	grouping
now my question is how can i take the myuser field and filtering it so only users of grouping foo show up

1810908
width	height
i guess you problem is that the textview is centered since you use fill_parent on both height and width on the parent linearlayout

1810918
min	max
i ve tried to change the min size max size and preferred size settings for the mainpanel with no success

1810926
equals	gethashcode	equals	tostring	tostring	gethashcode
remember to override equals gethashcode and tostring when doing so

1810941
getter	setter
the telerik controls are based on asp.net ajax and use pretty much the same coding conventions - public properties have getter and setter methods

1810941
getter	setter
the getter and setter methods are public and you are free to use them

1810943
hide	show
the next message should be show when the firs hide

1810963
int	double
it logically represents a single value similar to primitive types int double and so on

1811033
gw-basic	qbasic
then it is likely that he would be able to load it in any of gw-basic 3.32 qbasic quickbasic and perhaps even visual basic and then be able to use this command

1811059
calloc	malloc
when using malloc it would be better to calloc instead as it initializes memory to zero instead

1811071
post	get
take a look at my blog post in which i show the speed up you get when you run a simple linq query in parallel using the asparallel extension method

1811117
width	height
they only changed they full words width height etc and they added the p attribute.

1811119
hide	show
actually this is over-kill unless some items are show and some are hidden - if you know for a fact that all items are initially visible you can use the greater-than selector to simply hide items with index 8 and above - as corey demonstrates

1811134
getter	setter
and that the form uses getter and setter methods of the class to work with those attributes

1811134
getter	setter
disadvantage is that the populated hash instance will probably use more memory than your fixed set of attributes accessed via getter and setter methods

1811134
getter	setter
getter setter should be quicker too - no hashing of the key object is needed - a method is associated with only one stored value

1811140
put	get
when data has been put in the text box and enter is pressed all i get is a ding

1811157
post	get
so i m using this plugin jquery-in-place-editor i m trying to make a post request according to the docs but i m not sure what url to do the post to i can t seem to get it right

1811167
fast-forward	merge
the second isn t a merge updating in hg is equivalent to fast-forward there s nothing to merge

1811186
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
works in firefox safari and google-chrome

1811195
sorting	filtering
i prefer to use a subform to a list as it features lots of column sorting and filtering functions

1811219
ubuntu	debian
i use debian and ubuntu so the main log file for me is var log syslog

1811233
onresume	onpause
using onpause and onresume to start and stop the timeout gives me the following semantics

1811262
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
so far i m looking at a uitabbarcontroller with uinavigationcontroller in each pane with a little custom code to pop the navigation controller on the target tab back to the root on a tab switch

1811316
put	get
all the tables get created correctly but nothing ever gets put in the userfriends table and every user that comes back has an empty friends list

1811318
superclass	subclassing
the problem is that the overriding method from the subclassing might be called on the object before the superclass initialization has completed

1811330
xlib	xcb
while another language and set of libraries are technically possible i think the best language choice would be c and the xlib or xcb libraries

1811330
xlib	xcb
xcb - a 21st century replacement for xlib

1811356
xlib	xcb
you can use the xlib bindings for your language of choice or you can use the higher-level xcb bindings

1811356
kde	gnome	xfce	gnome	xfce	kde
conforming to these means your window manager will behave nicely in gnome kde xfce and any other desktop environment that comes along although simply ignoring them is certainly easier on your first try

1811361
cpu	affinity
i don t think its cpu affinity that you have to worry about so much its how i o bound each process is bound pardon the pun to become

1811376
pop-up	dialog
when i run this by itself i get a dialog box that pop-up and i can get the results in tabular format

1811378
std	ostream
std cout is an std ostream object so you have to overload for ostream which takes as an argument assuming you use from the standard header complex

1811378
ostream	istream	std	ostream
takes a std istream object which does the opposite of what std ostream does

1811378
cout	cin
i assumed you wanted to use cin and cout here

1811391
width	height
you can change the width and height as well though it only works for certain combinations 336x280 120x300 160x300 125x125 120x90 234x60

1811391
width	height
the default width and height is 250px by 250px

1811423
vbscript	jscript
users can write some vbscript jscript code and feed the server

1811450
config	ini
the ini file starts with a to ensure that if the config file is loaded it won t execute any code

1811452
config	ini
it simply declares the config from an ini file within an array

1811526
retaincount	dealloc
rather than clientx calling bossofeverthing removemefromyourclientlist from its dealloc method it calls it from its release method only when retaincount 1

1811526
super	self
if bossofeverthing removemefromyourclientlist returns no to clientx release then clientx release calls self performselector selector release withobject nil afterdelay 0.1 otherwise it just calls super release

1811527
redmine	trac
with assembla you also get a copy of trac which will give you a project management system as well though i ve used trac for the past 3 years now i ve since moved onto redmine

1811536
beautytips	hoverintent
beautytips works with hoverintent to give time to the user to click on the tooltip link

1811607
profiling	instrumentation
i recommend using instrumentation performance profiling tool that is bundled with xcode and the developer tools

1811708
post	get
it s all covered pretty well in the documentation but feel free to post to t he google group if you get stuck or something doesn t make sense

1811720
free	strdup
if you do use strdup be sure to free the result later

1811721
switching	screens
i ve already started with this code as a base i just need to plot the locations of hospitals without switching to another screens

1811728
free	strdup
i dislike strdup because it returns a heap allocated string and in the case of your functions it should be clearly documented that the user of the functions has to free it

1811737
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
to test that paste following in address bar firefox and opera fails while ie8 and google-chrome is working

1811747
stdout	stderr
stdout subprocess.pipe stderr subprocess.stdout

1811749
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
then in the viewwillappear or viewdidappear methods i can use the navigationcontroller to display the toolbar

1811753
button	checkbox
select the characters radio button and pick a character type and then click the numbers checkbox

1811766
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
surely when the new view controller s view is added and becomes visible it will call the viewdidappear rather than the viewwillappear

1811769
dylan	smalltalk
to a degree this technique can be simulated using what smalltalk calls double dispatch but there s a programming cost and a performance cost. i believe the languages cecil diesel and dylan all use some form of multimethod dispatch but i m teetering on the edge of my expertise

1811788
boost	stl
to keep the long story short i am unable to use the container from the stl and boost library and have to create my own

1811788
int	chars
all struct be it nested or not will contain only primitive types like chars int bool etc

1811806
put	get
so it ll have slower get put contains operations than a hashmap but to offset this it supports the sortedmap and navigablemap interfaces

1811837
mouse	keyboard
i have always used autoit s dll for sending keystrokes as well as blocking keyboard and mouse

1811939
jruby	mri
if you have to run in jruby it seems like it s probably because your sysadmin doesn t want to have a build of ruby mri installed so requiring that to run is odd

1811939
jruby	mri
i would talk to your sysadmin and make sure that it s cool to be running mri as well as jruby

1811965
wxpython	pygtk	wxpython	pyqt
there is so many great freameworks like wxpython tutorial pyqt tutorial pygtk tutorial already

1811980
textarea	textbox
like input textarea in html and textbox in xul

1812047
sorting	filtering
and if you want more functionality that it offers such as column names databinding support sorting filtering then you can derive encapsulate and add that functionality

1812052
comparator	icomparer
how to use the comparator and icomparer interfaces in visual c#

1812118
fadein	fadeout
however then i came across another problem one that i would like the hover image to fadein and fadeout

1812122
google-chrome	firefox
firefox 3 and google-chrome

1812122
google-chrome	firefox
firefox 3 and google-chrome

1812145
sorting	filtering
or here linq part 1 - filtering sorting object lists

1812152
free	realloc
i know that memory blocks and reallocation are implementation so specific but when there are contiguous free blocks of memory realloc works better than a new buffer allocation and memory copy

1812180
int	double
you must unbox value-types such as int double correctly

1812200
memcpy	realloc
in particular if you try to use it don t store any non-pod objects in the buffer as realloc will just memcpy them to a newly allocated buffer if necessary which will break non-pod objects.

1812219
int	chars
in every link there is a chars -array and some int variables which tells how good a leaf is

1812223
srp	principles
your problem fits squarely into the single responsibility principles srp one of the solid principles

1812242
iboutlet	ibaction
then link your button with the ibaction and the iboutlet and initialize toggleison to no

1812259
boost	stl
i am unable to use the stl and boost library and i have to write my own container in c++

1812275
hash	md5
if the hash is different then presumably the query failed to update due to the md5 check

1812288
jruby	mri
with small modification to the script opening the http request only once and then rewinding the same data both mri and jruby behave about the same jruby even 2 secs out of 20 total faster

1812302
ubuntu	linux
in linux ubuntu eclipse cdt

1812309
width	height
in addition you could use this servlet for quality rescaling of your images by providing width and height parameters as arguments and using image.getscaledinstance w h image.scale_smooth considering performance of course

1812320
getter	setter
so the usual way to put stuff on the value stack is to add getter setter for the values to your action class

1812356
wildfly	glassfish
glassfish payara configuration example can be found here and wildfly configuration example can be found here

1812356
outputstream	inputstream
if you want to have control over reading writing files yourself then you need to create a servlet for this which basically just gets an inputstream of the file in flavor of for example fileinputstream and writes it to the outputstream of the httpservletresponse

1812362
int	chars
hope someone explains why they are reversed - my guess is that chars are not reversed but the int is little endian

1812362
int	chars
in this case you have an int and a chars array of length 2

1812362
int	chars
assuming int is 16 bit and chars is 8 bit both require same space and hence the union is allocated two bytes

1812421
filesystems	hfs+
it may sound horrible to you but filesystems value metadata over data take journaling in hfs+ or ext3 4 for example

1812440
free	realloc
same for realloc and free

1812565
int	double
based on the types i parse them correspondingly cost column in double visit column in int keyword column in string etc..

1812665
unix	bsd	unix	solaris	solaris	bsd
would you prefer more c c++ experience if some of it were bsd or solaris or other unix

1812665
gentoo	debian
would you prefer 5 years experience with red hat or 7 years experience spanning red hat debian suse gentoo and others

1812682
firefox	safari
the following code works on ie8 safari 4.0.2 - but generates an empty page on firefox 3.5.5

1812693
hash	salt
it gives you a pre-defined schema with best practices like storing the passwords hash and with a salt not in cleartext

1812769
required	placeholder
but in return it required that you be able to allocate an object with type igroup to act as a placeholder in case a child is retrieved before its parent

1812876
cos	sin
firstly the derivative of sin x is cos x or to put it more formally

1812876
cos	sin
i guess you could solve sin x using the taylor series for cos x

1812876
put	get
of course you ll need to put some limiter in to exit the recursion otherwise you ll get a stack overflow error eventually which is left as an exercise for the reader

1812909
put	get
replace all content in the current site with tags and then put the different language in file or db tables sniff the users desired language do you have registered users who can make a preference or do you want to get the browser language tag or is it going to be url dot-com dot-fr dot-de that make the choice and then replace the tags with the target language

1812924
children	parent
also has two relationships parent to-one relationship to abstractitem and children to-many relationship to abstractitem and the inverse of parent

1812926
vim	emacs
interesting enough to make me wish to try out vim or emacs as well and see if they would turn out to be a better solution for me

1812926
vim	emacs
i have the general feeling that vim and emacs are not the kind of editor you learn by playing with it though

1812926
vim	emacs
in the linked thread responders have essentially answered by commenting on vim often mentioning i m sure emacs has the same

1812932
int	chars
the potential danger exists even if your chars array has sufficient length to cover the entire int

1812953
sorting	grouping
certain kinds of sorting or grouping may be unable to use indexes - try to avoid them or modify the query so that it can use indexes

1813059
vim	emacs
i have the general feeling that vim and emacs are not the kind of editor you learn by playing with it though

1813059
vim	emacs
having someone who s experienced with emacs and i d assume vim is a great help

1813094
hide	show
those will let you show and hide a loading gif on ajax json requests

1813115
put	get
put it on a local web server and you can have your favorite server-side tech give it to you in response to get data containing the urls

1813145
inherited	properties
that can t be done but you could delete the properties from the class prototype so that it is not inherited

1813145
inherited	properties
that way it won t be inherited but you need to do that for every private properties in your base class

1813163
kerberos	ntlm
is just a cover error for any underlying kerberos ntlm error

1813202
google-chrome	firefox
so while this works for firefox now that i want to port my add-on to google-chrome i couldn t find a way to get the coordinates

1813220
for-loop	arrays
the for-loop over the counts arrays ends the printed output every 10th count and uses

1813227
int	chars
int forces conversion from chars to int

1813259
int	chars
how do i generate random chars and int within a method so that the method can be called in main and so that the method generates random chars and int together

1813259
int	chars
i do not want a method that genrates chars and another methods that generates int

1813320
for-loop	arrays
i guess the problem is with the nested for-loop through the tracktitles arrays but i can t see what i can change to make it work

1813340
entity-relationship	diagram
in entity-relationship diagram it would be a relation

1813345
daemon	cron
set up a cron daemon that run this script every x

1813345
daemon	cron
the number or scripts the cron daemon runs

1813373
portrait	landscape
once the keyboard is invoked the vertical scroll bar will remain at the portrait coordinates when the phone or simulator is in landscape mode

1813381
vim	emacs
i find myself gravitating toward vim for scripting languages like ruby perl python php and for emacs for languages that are more interactive lisp essentially

1813391
children	parent
in this case relation parent children change nothing since you refer to widgets by names not relations

1813430
inherited	properties
you can as a bonus provide a default implementation using reflection that goes through every properties of the inherited class to dump it

1813446
rtp	rtsp
darwin streaming server dss is the first open sourced rtp rtsp streaming server

1813446
rtp	rtsp
it was released march 16 1999 and is a fully featured rtsp rtp media streaming server capable of streaming a variety of media types including h.264 mpeg-4 avc mpeg-4 part 2 and 3gp

1813461
ubuntu	linux
for whatever reason the json parse in my firefox browser ff v3.0.15 linux ubuntu 9.0.4 is throwing the unterminated string literal exception

1813462
fastcgi	scgi
there is mod_wsgi for apache and a scgi fastcgi ajp module + flup for the others

1813470
django	turbogears
for developing sophisticated web applications in python you would probably use a more comprehensive web development framework like django zope turbogears etc

1813477
pascal	delphi
i want to know how i can develop gui applications 32 bits without using delphi language object pascsl only by using fpc with lazarus installed pascal

1813483
cos	sin
the average of 0 0 and 90 will be atan sin 0 +sin 0 +sin 90 cos 0 +cos 0 +cos 90 atan 1 2 26.56 deg

1813493
udp	tcp
a more complicated mechanism but one that could provide a high performance logging path write a logging service that receives log lines via tcp or udp

1813500
subtract	add
i believe the answer could be the normal arithmetic average reduced modulo 360 we sum all the values divide by the number of angles and then subtract add a multiple of 360 so that the result lies in the interval 0..360

1813545
fadein	fadeout
i pulled out your fadein and fadeout animations and put them into a separate hover for the

1813559
rss	feed
i have a few questions about parsing so rss feed

1813559
rss	feed
here is the code of that so rss feed

1813595
ddms	adb
if that does not help as aforlorney suggested check logcat via adb logcat ddms or the ddms perspective in eclipse to get the java stack trace of your exception

1813654
filtering	grouping
you could use a collectionview this would allow for grouping filtering etc

1813665
postgresql	mysql
i would still recommend checking out postgresql and postgis in comparison to mysql if you intend to do more complex queries in the foreseeable future

1813754
inline	inlining
if i understood one of the fpc compiler devels which has the same issue correctly inlining can only happen when the routine to be inline was already compiled

1813757
cvs	svn	perforce	svn	perforce	cvs
i don t know but you may want to check with perforce on this as this might be something specific to their plugin rather than something in the team su8pport i never have this problem with svn or cvs though maybe my builds are not big enough

1813818
bindparam	bindvalue
even trying to create a function to replace tokens on the php side would not guarantee the replacement process is the same as the sql one tricky stuff like token-type bindvalue vs bindparam ...

1813821
firefox	safari
i ve been struggling to get some absolutely positioned overlays to show above an flv movie using flowplayer in the firefox browser works in safari

1813847
bmp	tga
if this is in an application that you re making where you can supply code to it you can set up a render target and output the result to a bmp or tga file

1813848
post	get
i am trying to debug the reason why my ajax get post is not working in ie 7 8

1813848
firefox	safari
now this works fine in firefox safari win mac but not in ie 7 8

1813857
sablecc	cup
sablecc antlr jlex cup and so

1813936
vim	emacs
many editors like vim and emacs have a feature that reindents code according to its built-in indentation standard

1813939
many-to-many	many-to-one
graphs can be much better at keeping track of the other types of cardinality many-to-one many-to-many etc.

1813939
children	parent
so for example in the parent child relationship can child operations be done on the parent with the parent passing a reference to itself to the children during that operation

1813951
bazaar	git
it stores etc in a repos git default mercurial or bazaar

1813966
int	chars
third you are casting the chars value stored in buf i to an int and then printing it as a chars

1813987
unsigned	short	int	chars
chars s short s and their unsigned counterparts are promoted to int s

1814003
wadl	wsdl
there s a rest equivalent to wsdl called wadl

1814003
wadl	wsdl
you could explore an approach where a rest service provider sends you a description of their api in wadl you translate the wadl to wsdl and from the wsdl generate the soap apis your broker offers

1814003
wadl	wsdl
your wadl to wsdl translation simulataneously generates the mapping logic used by your broker to translate each soap request to an underlying rest request on the service provider

1814032
public	protected
2 use public private protected function instead of just function restrict as much as possible and open up later if needed

1814049
put	get	post	put	post	get
i retain the data from get to post for the first time then i put it in tempdata and pass it to another action anotheraction

1814049
post	get
once i get my data on get i cannot retain it on post

1814086
vmware	virtualbox
in addition to the virtual machine solution virtualbox virtualpc vmware you might be able to run your program under dosbox

1814105
comparator	comparable
if you don t have the comparable implemented for contact you will need to pass in a comparator implementation

1814118
comparator	comparable
you need make your contact classes implement comparable and then implement the comparator contact method

1814118
equals	compareto
per the page i linked to compareto returns a negative integer zero or a positive integer as this object is less than equals to or greater than the specified object.

1814154
portrait	landscape
one view support orientation in portrait and landscape

1814154
portrait	landscape
problem is when i change view back from landscape to portrait uitoolbar at the top disappears

1814194
int	chars
qstring qstring fromascii const chars str int size -1

1814194
int	chars
qstring qstring fromlocal8bit const chars str int size -1

1814194
int	chars
qstring qstring fromutf8 const chars str int size -1

1814224
getter	setter
don t use underscores for private varibles unless your using a getter or setter

1814224
getter	setter
this example getter setter is a little useless as you could just make a public property that does the same thing

1814224
getter	setter
only use a getter or setter when you need to do something special when you get or set the property

1814270
g++	gcc
i am wondering why gcc g++ doesn t have an option to place the generated object files into a specified directory

1814337
firefox	safari
the errors are rangeerror maximum call stack size exceeded. safari and internalerror too much recursion firefox mac

1814355
children	parent
when you click on the input box the event is bubbled to the outer div as opposed to event capturing - which traverses from parent to its children

1814364
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in firefox and safari google-chrome

1814370
algol	smalltalk
the terms you are using are most commonly used together these days in ruby although the constructs previously appeared in algol smalltalk and scheme

1814457
centos	linux
i have a large catalog of audio on a linux centos 5 server that i would like to expose to an existing .net web site

1814530
post	get
when you get the desired speed post an nsnotification

1814531
mp3	wav
i ve always been curious about audio conversion software but i have never seen a proper explanation from a beginners point of view as to how to write a simple program that converts for example a mp3 file to a wav

1814536
subtraction	addition
you just do simple arithmetic pointer operations like addition and subtraction as well

1814544
post	get
what happens is that you can search but as soon as you click on one of the column headers and it reloads the page with the new get variable it will get rid of the current post variable thereby showing all results again

1814554
x86	64bit
64bit x86 assembly is almost the same as 32bit x86 assembly since 64bit x86 is mostly backwards compatible with 32bit

1814555
pull	push
every few hours i git push my changes to a server from which i then pull to my client machines

1814579
min	max
for each unique x-coordinate get the list of y-coordinates for points with that x-coordinate and make a line from the min to the max y-coordinate

1814602
getter	setter
hiding state behind getter setter

1814661
apache	lighttpd
if you don t care about adaptive streaming this is really easy - just share the audio out over http then add a mediaelement or something like if you want it to be fancy see my caveat at and point it towards your linux server running lighttpd or apache

1814673
superclass	subclassing
well here s one good one that i came up with - utilizing oop overriding subclassing and superclass

1814673
superclass	subclassing
i create subclassing herbivore carnivore and omnivore from the superclass animal and override the eat method with the type of food that it can actually eat

1814693
octal	hex
002 means 02 interpreted as an octal base 8 number similar to how x02 would be the same for a hex base 16 number

1814697
maven-assembly-plugin	maven-jar-plugin
so my suggestion would be to remove the configuration element from the maven-jar-plugin and to configure the maven-assembly-plugin like this

1814697
post	get
if you get an error please update your question with it and post the content of the meta-inf manifest.mf file and the relevant part of your pom.xml the plugins configuration parts

1814740
min	max
if it comes from mysql you may have this dbms returns directly the min and max values for the considered list

1814740
min	max
edit as indicated by darkerstar the way the way the data is structured and also the existing sql query which returns the complete list as indicated in the question generally dictate the way the query which produces the min and max value should be structured

1814740
min	max
if somehow you cannot use sql a single pass through the list will allow you to obtain the min and max value in the list in o n time that is

1814740
min	max
set min and max value to first item in unsorted list

1814740
min	max
iterate through each following item in the list comparing it with the min value and replacing it if found smaller and doing like-wise for the max value.

1814740
min	max
with min and max values in hand a simple difference gives the max number of days.

1814755
vim	emacs
wow vi vim vs emacs what a temptation.

1814763
lxml	beautifulsoup
one option is to use lxml i m not familiar with beautifulsoup so i can t say how to do with it it defaultly supports xpath

1814780
calloc	malloc
calloc and malloc return a void object that can be assigned to everything

1814787
post	get
edit added example of reseting the tempdata in anotheraction to get access to it in the post

1814833
width	height
this works to some extent because if i addchild the loader i am able to see the jpeg as it is streamed but i am unable to access the loader s content and most importantly i can not change the width and height of the loader

1814833
width	height
after a lot of testing i seem to have figured out the cause of the problem is that until the loader has completely loaded the jpg meaning until he actually sees the end byte of the jpg he does not know the width and height and he does not create a content displayobject to be associated with the loader s content

1814837
firefox	safari
this is how various sites distinguish between ie firefox mozilla safari webkit and the like

1814852
ssl	https
if the connection is https encrypting it a second time won t do any good except if someone breaks ssl tls

1814854
hide	show
you can also add all items you want to the menu up front on the treeview or containing controls construction then hide or show them through the visible property

1814894
persistent	transient
this would make the object identity dependent on the persistent state persistent or transient

1814899
implements	extends
another thing to keep in mind is client classes can only extends one abstract class whereas they can implements multiple interfaces

1814943
textmate	sublimetext
however i have liked sublimetext for it s nice gui similar to textmate on mac if that s where you re coming from

1815045
google-chrome	firefox
you can use the view-source uri schema supported by firefox google-chrome and older versions of ie

1815047
udp	tcp
depending on the udp application i d expect that the response would come on the same port for simplicity -- this is not the case for protocols like tcp which have an intentionally random and high source port

1815114
webclient	httpwebrequest
fetching the full html via webclient httpwebrequest should not be a problem

1815134
post	get
ive been through this once in a project and what i recall was that ie has a limit of 2083 characters for both post and get requests

1815135
sorting	grouping
reporting features like sorting grouping joining charts crosstabs form print etc

1815185
backtracking	greedy
with a greedy quantifier on the other hand it will match as much as possible in one go and only then backtracking as much as necessary to match any following tokens

1815215
webclient	webrequest
http authorization and .net webrequest webclient classes

1815286
vpn	lan
my take is that you d need to connect to a remote lan via vpn passing through a firewall to be on the same subnet and similar ip address as where the webservice is running on

1815288
phong	shading
it sounds like you re trying to display your 3d mesh and apply a smooth shading appearance by interpolating surface normals such as in phong shading and you need to calculate the normals first

1815315
pop-up	dialog
now with vista and win 7 the manifest is used to specify elevated permissions to get around the uac thereby minimizing the chance of vista win 7 having to pop-up an uac dialog box

1815337
webkit	gecko
a rendering engine is the engine that a browser uses to render the html gecko vs webkit

firefox	safari
but even if you switch the user agent of lets say firefox to safari it will still use the gecko rendering engine to render it s page

1815343
integer	unsigned
alternatively you can send a series of packets containing parts of the image again with a type - this time of type image packet instead of image plus the length of the packet which might only be a 16-bit unsigned integer for a maximum size of 65535 bytes plus an end image packet for the last segment

1815349
jar	war
or don t use the jboss log4j configuration and define your own log4j.xml in your war either in a jar in lib or in classes

1815372
vim	emacs
i would advise that checking out both is worth the time because of various reasons already covered by other answers or emacs vs vim vs xy threads

1815372
vim	emacs
vim and emacs are certainly editors that you learn by doing

1815394
public	protected
as long as the member is available in your page at the public or protected level you can push it into your javascript it in this way

1815516
int	boolean
it should be a basic language with features like basic types int boolean arrays and etc and i should write the framework

1815576
subtract	add
im guessing my buttons are right but when clicked they add integers on the compiler and subtract integers using the next and previous buttons

1815658
super	extends
if you want this to work use wildcard expressions extends or super

1815771
stdout	stderr
if you want it quick and dirty and you want to get rid of all output then redirect stdout and stderr to dev null

1815856
set	bag
i recall that in one of the brown bag webinars it was mentioned in passing that the tokens could be resubmitted and you d get the corresponding result set back

1815892
post	get
i don t understand why you would be using a get method here since it sounds like you re going to be uploading this image data to your web service - you should be using post

1815928
gif	png
this works for gif jpeg and png only of course and you may run into some issues like alpha channel and colour profile problems

1815929
fflush	gets
if 1 gets fflush and 2 doesn t then we re fine as the db transact wasn t then committed

1815929
fflush	gets
if neither gets fflush or both get fflush then we re also ok

1815929
fflush	gets
so if 2 gets fflush but 1 doesn t then we have a problem

1815945
subtract	add
in your implementation of the action method for this switch value change you ll need to implement logic to determine whether rows should be added or subtract and then actually add or subtract the rows

1816039
ant	maven
automate the building maintenance of these via your build ant maven etc. to keep control of the common elements required

1816049
jfreechart	piccolo
i just got into information-visualization and scientific-visualization and have been using piccolo and a little with jfreechart

1816051
strstr	substr
i have no experience using regular expressions in php so i usually write some convoluted function using a series of str_replace substr strpos strstr etc you get the idea

1816052
multiplication	modulo	division	modulo	division	multiplication
i tried to make them myself but implementing multiplication division and modulo an efficient way seems to be quite a pain

1816062
pow	math.h
to clarify if you don t include math.h the compiler assumes that pow returns an integer

1816091
outputstream	inputstream
in an iphone app i have a socket connection through wifi and i need to read from inputstream and write to outputstream

1816137
pow	math.h
when using math functions like this you should always include math.h and make sure you are calling the right pow function

1816165
visualvm	hprof
however you may be able to skip the hprof dump to get just basic information from the running vm by using jmap jstack and visualvm included in the jdk package

1816173
post	get
it will reveal and log all the headers and get post traffic

1816173
post	get
if you get stuck just post a query on this website

1816173
post	get
you ll also have to get comfortable programming http post requests

1816201
pop-up	dialog
however you can use in-page pop-up window like jquery ui dialog that all pop-up blocker cannot block it because it just is html tag like span or div

1816247
xslt	xquery
that project taught him what he needed to know so he was able to spend more time learning about xquery with sql server instead of the ins and outs of dtd and xslt

1816284
unification	inference
however scala lacks any meaningful kind system and therefore has no kind inference and no kind unification

1816323
ready	each
finally the fully entered vehicle would be displayed to them and they would be able to go back and edit each part of it as they so choose and when they were ready submit it

1816349
versioning	upgrade
these settings will also use isolated storage allow you to upgrade to different versioning of settings to maintain user settings between versioning and many other features

1816354
integer	unsigned
this is because it is an unsigned integer so it is looping round back to the maximum value

1816389
inherited	properties
for general use it s recommended that you test to be sure that the properties hasn t been grafted onto the object somewhere else in the inherited chain

1816390
jar	war
declare a formal manifest for the war module allowing it to declare the its dependencies on the individual jar modules which should allow the war to see the resources in the jar module

1816406
ant	maven
but instead of ant i d choose maven because it will require less work imho and it has a built-in feature called profiles that is perfect to manage environment specific stuff like here

1816449
accessor	properties
if you check the row s height after you resize it it is unchanged the actualheight is the properties that contains the row s actual height when you resize it and actualheight cannot be set because it does not have an accessible set accessor

1816475
postgresql	mysql
compare that to the pentaho stack which will typically end interacting with postgresql or mysql

1816475
postgresql	mysql
i can t vouch for how postgresql performs in the olap realm but i do know from experience that mysql - for all its undoubted strengths - has issues with the types of sql that typically crops up all over the place in an olap solution you can t get far in a cube without using group by or count distinct

1816485
versioning	upgrade
i didn t have the same problem before the upgrade of my ubuntu versioning

1816490
rss	feed
magpie returns different rss content from same feed one of the blogs returns the contents with angle brackets removed

1816509
stdout	stderr
the server logs stdout stderr webapp

1816518
ant	maven
i would add the necessary infrastructure to allow a mechanical build with ant or maven

1816524
mouse	keyboard
this will just repaint the form control but not allow mouse keyboard interaction

1816543
ggplot2	lattice
have a look at the packages lattice or ggplot2 the plot functions in these packages create objects which can be assigned to variables and can be printed or plotted at a later stage

1816552
range	minimum
and no mention of the minimum range provided by the type

1816576
for-loop	arrays
i have solved the problem of reading and assigning values to the arrays by changing the values to read in the first for-loop from d to floats f which gave me the right values

1816637
fadein	fadeout
what i m not sure of is whether .is animated will return true when run against an element that is being animated via fadein and fadeout

1816637
fadein	fadeout
in the end i have found that yes animated matches those elements animated using fadein and fadeout because the jquery source uses .animate to achieve these effects

1816667
draggable	droppable
the main issue is i want my draggable to create my droppable depending on having an odd or even class

1816695
listview	gridview
the listview with a gridview built into the framework isn t great so i would recommend the wpftoolkit s datagrid for a free option

1816706
folder	directory
to create a test website on the same web server you can just copy the entire website into a new folder and set the virtual directory in iis

1816715
int	double
just like int numberic limits the limits for float double and long double are imported from the c standard

1816741
folder	directory
the xcode groups the yellow folder like your resources are completely independent of the file system - they don t directly represent directory

1816743
inherited	properties
the properties that can be manipulated at the compiler level are inherited derived from the properties of the system below it the electronics in the cpu

1816768
bitwise-and	modulo
this really helps for hash tables because you compute the index modulo the size and if that size is a power of two the modulo can be computed with a simple bitwise-and or rather than using a much slower divide-class instruction implementing the operator

1816778
put	get
its funny though once you get around to setting aspectj up its remarkable the number of uses that you will put to

1816810
keystore	jks
keystore privatekeystore keystore.getinstance jks

1816810
keystore	jks
keystore reloadedkeystore keystore.getinstance jks

1816837
children	parent
this finds the category from the classname there can be additional classes and then it finds other children of the same parent using .siblings and then includes itself so you can add the hover class to the elements at one time

1816863
filtering	grouping
i d recommend you use a combination of controls to filtering your items into smaller grouping

1816870
hlsl	glsl
i am not familiar with hlsl but i am with glsl

1816870
hlsl	glsl
your only option is to pass a variable to the shader program in glsl it is called a uniform but i am not sure about hlsl

1816871
filtering	grouping
if you added a dropdown to choose the category geographic region product grouping or some other filtering then the user could choose a category

1816913
mp3	wav	mp3	aiff	wav	aiff
i sort of cobbled them together to successfully make a small utility that converts a aiff wav etc file to an mp3 file

1816913
mp3	wav
now you can peruse lame s api or just fork exec a process to lame to convert your wav file to an mp3 file

1816954
keydown	keyup
i would suggest using keydown keyup events and capturing the keys pressed

1816956
width	height
use the animate function and simply vary the width and height

1816983
subtract	add
alignment is a real pain though that s why i only used sse for arithmetic operations add subtract dot product those kinds of things

1817018
post	get
in asp.net mvc when an action takes an object for a parameter asp.net mvc looks at all the post get data and looks for values which coincide with property names on the parameter object

1817033
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
the reason i believe that there are none is because the merge algorithm for each scm whether it is git hg bazaar svn etc works on the lowest common denominator which is simply plain text

1817063
for-loop	loops
i would say it is o n 2 because you have a double-nested for-loop but the size of each loops is not the same so we have to modify it a bit

1817072
haskell	scheme
haskell and scheme have the strongest support but aren t web languages and so far as i know don t have gui libraries for the most part

1817118
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add
a close look at the num class i num in ghci reveals one problem with the type of avg num doesn t have enough methods â basically enough to add multiplying and subtract

1817130
equals	gethashcode
you can t you need to override gethashcode and equals and create your own iequalitycomparer

1817206
post	get
however when i try to perform the same operation using a post in code which the api claims to support i consistently get an error stating that my api key is in an invalid format which their documentation claims is likely an encoding issue

1817215
listview	gridview
aspx in that case it would be relatively simple to have an aspx page that contains either a gridview or listview which you bind your data in to or you could just generate an html page with the data formatted in to a table

1817256
jsfunit	cactus	junit	cactus	junit	jsfunit
this is not what exactly what you are asking for but jsfunit which uses junit cactus htmlunit and httpunit seems to be a serious candidate for testing in the jsf land

1817268
processors	hyperthreading
i know how to get the processors type perhaps that s the only way but i m actually looking for a way to determine from an application whether it s running on a multi-core processors or on a hyperthreading single-core processors

1817298
processors	hyperthreading
system.environment.processorcount which will also include hyperthreading processors

1817327
getter	setter
i will suggest first turn this variable into a property with setter and getter

1817327
getter	setter
then refactor your code to make sure all the places that directly write and read this variable are not changed to use the setter and getter of the property

1817352
datalist	repeater
you can use a repeater or a datalist

1817380
inherited	properties
command is a dependency properties and i m pretty sure it is inherited by any control beneath it in the visual tree

1817408
client-side	server-side
if you need to do this asynchronously via javascript then you can always use an ajax request that will allow for asynchronous communication between the client-side environment the user s browser and the server-side environment

1817456
128bit	64bit
that is for example multiply two 64bit integers to get a 128bit result which is stored in two 64bit registers

1817484
pop-up	dialog
but i am now trying to get it to work on a page that get dynamically populated into a jquery ui dialog pop-up but it doesn t seem to be working

1817508
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication	division	addition	division	subtraction	division	multiplication
i have a vector class that has addition multiplication subtraction division etc operators

1817538
fflush	gets
your server is calling print and never fflush the stream so the time never gets sent

1817547
width	height
for example all the controls can be left or right aligned and resized to the same size width or height

1817591
ubuntu	debian
both should be available as package just make sure to make it the default java after install see for ubuntu or a debian based distro find out how to do this for another distro

1817619
docx	.doc
paste it into a .doc docx will have the same indents and colours

1817628
mouseup	mousedown
when i ran the code above something interesting will happen when the left mousedown is issue nothing seem to happen i move my mouse and the window doesn t move however when i added a mouseup event then the window jumped to the location where i supposedly dragged it

1817643
subtract	add
can you pass in an operation like divide by 2 or subtract 1 using just a partially applied operator where add 1 looks like this

1817643
addition	multiplication
for addition and multiplication this argument ordering doesn t matter

1817690
hide	show
when using the asp.net ajax library i could register a modal async indicator by registering a show method and a hide method with the pagerequestmanager

1817701
nsmutablestring	nsstring
you can set an nsmutablestring to an nsstring but not the other way around

1817701
nsmutablestring	nsstring
this is because an nsmutablestring is a subclass of nsstring so it is a nsstring

1817721
move	drag
to drag you must put the mouse button down first then move the mouse

1817743
coalesce	nvl
another benefit of using coalesce is that the data types do not need to match which is required when using nvl

1817763
bazaar	git
aside from the git vs bazaar issue i identified in my comment above i was able to confirm that you need to escape the parens as in

1817806
bazaar	git
if you are using a local server anyway why wouldn t you consider using one of the distributed revision control systems instead of subversion git mercurial bazaar

1817813
folder	directory
when i try to enumerate directory paths under private var mobile library it does not list callhistory folder but everything else

1817871
isnull	nvl	coalesce	isnull	coalesce	nvl
you might ve noticed i didn t have any left join examples - this would only be necessary if columns from the subquery use null testing coalesce on almost any db these days oracle s nvl or nvl2 mysqls ifnull sql server s isnull etc...

1817949
apache-fop	xhtml
given that xhtml is an extension from xml i d recommend using apache-fop

1818021
profiling	instrumentation
profiling it with instrumentation sampler instrumentation see where it spends its time

1818038
integer	unsigned
however there are two 3rd party notes from perlmonks and the apache poi project which say much the same thing this looks like a windows vt_filetime data type which is a 64 bit unsigned integer representing the number of elapsed 100 nanoseconds since 1 january 1601

1818054
postgresql	mysql
since mysql doesn t offer a nowait method like postgresql or oracle does i ve run into locking issues where worker threads hang and wait for the locked row to become available

1818087
width	height
menubar toolbar location directories status scrollbars resizable dependent width 640 height 480 left 0 top 0

1818090
rss	feed
i ve heard that it s quicker to use file_get_contents for basic get requests grabbing an rss feed that doesn t require authentication but i haven t tried myself

1818182
expander	grid	treeview	expander
the outer listview and expander is to replace a treeview that was used to have a list of collapsible nodes but the treeview s internal use of grid means the textview items were squashed horizonatlly the same as if you remove ether horizontalcontentalignment stretch attributes

1818196
pop-up	dialog
you could also create a dialog as a page and then use a pop-up window to display it as a real native os modal dialog but this is perhaps more annoying.

1818200
move	drag
drag buttons and text boxes onto the form move them around add some labels

1818200
swt	swing
in eclipse you either have to use netbeans instead ie not eclipse... or use ibm s swt or code the swing forms by hand

1818221
uilabel	nsstring
you can calculate the fitted size of a uilabel based on the nsstring content using the uikitadditions category on nsstring

1818221
uilabel	uitextview
you could should probably use a uilabel rather than a uitextview since you don t need the scrolling behavior of the uitextview

1818260
versioning	upgrade
i complained with them 3 months ago and they upgrade passenger on my server the day after so i could install the current rails versioning

1818276
profiler	vtune
use an instruction-level profiler like vtune

1818280
vb.net	vb6
edit alternatively you can write code in vb6 .net c# vb.net python for automation

1818291
pascal	delphi
i have few legacy pascal source files that i wish to make it compile in delphi 2009 2010 as well as delphi 2007 and below

1818340
128bit	64bit
also the benefit of generating a 64bit hash from a 128bit 4 x 32-bit number is a bit questionable because as other people have suggested you could just use the original value as a key in a set

1818501
opera	firefox
firefox still fired the event but webkit opera and internet explorer didn t although frankly i ve no idea which is correct.

1818521
snmp	mib
many other concepts also involve dependency trees such as snmp mib resolution c c++ source code compiling

1818559
next	except
edit i guess what op needs is that the remaining record should be selected except those where current record s old state is not the same as next record s new state kind of an undo operation in records and current record s new state should not be same as previous record s old state

1818572
stdout	stderr
the simplest solution to this problem is to redirect all stdout into stderr

1818590
uilabel	uitextview
uilabel automatically splits but uitextview does not do it

1818598
ready	each
the server responds in around 2 - 300 ms at each request but it takes 1.5 - 2 seconds for the page to be ready in the browser

1818599
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this was originally done in ie for the mac but this behaviour is the same in all versions of ie since ie5 and firefox google-chrome safari and opera

1818624
yslow	pagespeed
there are a lot of things you can do to optimize performance you may use tools such as yslow and pagespeed to analyze the page further and determine what might be worth doing

1818689
width	height
menubar toolbar location directories status scrollbars resizable dependent width 640 height 480 left 0 top 0

1818742
for-loop	loops
anyway as tom hawtin said it is sometimes better to use the old syntax when you need to get the current index information by using a for-loop or the iterator as everything you win when using the java5 syntax will be lost in loops itself.

1818752
itunes	iphoto
examples of this are iphoto and itunes - there is no concept of documents in these applications but there is differnt data for differnt users

1818755
post	put	range	minimum
if i were the person assigned with the unenviable task of providing an estimate to completion for a project being managed as arbitrarily as in the original post i d try to figure out a range based upon the minimum number of folks assigned 48 to 66 weeks given 2 developers 50 to 80 confident and a range associated with the average number of folks assigned 25 to 45 weeks with 5 developers 50 to 80 confident and use the low figure from the average number along with the high figure from the minimum number 25 to 66 weeks given anywhere from 2 to 5 developers 50 to 80 confident and even then i d put a disclaimer on it plus 10 for the lost time due to context switching

1818816
hide	show
what you might want to do is contain the image you wish to hide in a and show this div after the page and all of its content your screenshot image included has loaded ie

1818816
addeventlistener	onload
in an onload handler -- or obviously you can use addeventlistener too

1818887
put	get
i see only one option to get around this i need to put the extension into the url

1818948
getter	setter
ok that way now a can setter y getter the options of my plugin once instance

1818955
super	self
and the self register super class

1818986
g++	gcc
in my opinion the best way is to symlink gcc g++ to ccache but if you would like to use within cmake try this

1819007
int	chars
ref parameters are mostly used to pass value types such as int long chars etc

1819023
truecrypt	umount
in the past i have read about people using truecrypt partitions that automatically umount but that would probably require decent intrusion detection

1819056
hide	show
i got all fixed besides disabling the toggle button that hide show the toolbar

1819084
stateless	stateful
the web application is by nature stateless so even if your users should log-in it does not make the application stateful

1819087
width	height
you need place width 100 and height 100 in the style of the object tag in the html holding it

1819087
width	height
also remove the width auto and height auto from the usercontrol

1819147
retaincount	dealloc
- to have it deallocated retaincount 0 invoke dealloc

1819164
wadl	wsdl
i ve spent a couple of hours looking for a solution suggested by other grails users but didn t find a neat solution besides a recommendation to use wadl or wsdl 2.0

1819231
post	get
you can log all http requests and check the requested pages for get post sql injection tryouts

1819236
range	minimum
the minimum range you can rely on are

1819236
unsigned	short
unsigned short int and unsigned int 0 to 65 535

1819236
range	minimum
the minimum range for this type if your compiler supports it is

1819246
hide	show
right-click the cell with the comment and choose show hide comment might do the trick

1819329
vim	emacs
maybe a good way is to learn vim emacs while using eclipse

1819371
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
for any reason this works perfectly on iexplorer 8 but doesn t on firefox safari nor google-chrome

1819465
post	get
when he clicks on that close button there is a post form from where the parent window should get the selected value

1819509
cout	cin
it will ignore my cout and cin usage everywhere in the code so i can t even debug it

1819517
getter	setter
with this syntax it s easy to figure out what is happening but it is not a standard setter and conflicts with margins getter

1819517
getter	setter
for me it is obvious the method is a setter but this time i cannot set multiple values with just one call and there s the problem with getter again

1819523
min	max
after performing estimation you obtain some min and max values

1819523
min	max
as i see min estimation can result in stress for developer max estimation can result in using all the time which is allocated to developer even if task can be complete faster so called student syndrome

1819551
implements	extends
you might have fancy knobs lockable knobs etc which can all be implements by extends your base door knob

1819558
vb.net	vb6
i have vb6 activexdll called a.dll i am referencing this dll into my vb.net application

1819559
min	max
you should use the best guess which is a function of the min and max estimates - not just the simple average -

1819559
min	max
best_guess min min_weighting + max max_weighting divisor

1819559
min	max
the weighting you give to the min and max values will depend on the complexity of the task the risks associated with the task the likelihood of the risks occuring the skill of the developer etc

1819559
min	max
while giving the max and delivering early is not the same as giving the min and delivering late it still shows that you don t have control over your development

1819559
min	max
these min and max estimates will be got by various means - asking the developers past experience etc

1819559
min	max
if polling developers then the actual min and max values should be treated as outliers and either discarded or modified in some way

1819561
int	chars
why do they turn chars into gchar int into gint etc.

1819578
joomla	phpbb
joomla phpbb

1819590
min	max
if the difference between min and max are big rather than using some black magic formula i think it the best thing to do would be to go back to the developers and ask them to do a finer breakdown and prototyping which will lead to better estimates where the gap between min and max is not that big

1819602
min	max
if you have little experience with a specific developer one of my fondly regarded previous managers would ask the developer himself to do the estimate and set the initial deadline a third of the distance between that developer s min and max challenging the developer to beat it

1819629
wordpress	joomla
i will go with wordpress joomla and drupal on the runner up list

1819677
entity-relationship	diagram
i usually end up drawing a crude entity-relationship diagram after this which further clarifies which classes i need

1819691
int	boolean
in theory you should make objects pretty much everything until you fall down to the smallest possible elements the primitive types boolean string int etc

1819733
folder	directory
i want to list all these directory and sort them in which they have created in the pc and copy the latest directory contents to batch_latest_lib_files folder that will be a new folder created by this batch file.i want this new folder to be created in the path where this batch file is present

1819782
put	get
get rid of the linq and put old stored procedures

1819836
post	get
but on return my app keeps trying to call my show action presumably because it thinks its a get request and not a post

1819853
firefox	safari
in safari and firefox it s ok

1819862
importerror	attributeerror
this will sometimes give you attributeerror instead of importerror

1819862
importerror	attributeerror
this way isn t better it will sometimes give you importerror when more appropriate would be attributeerror

use neither min nor max but something in between

1819945
min	max
when composing individual tasks estimates into an aggregate neither min or max is sensible

1819946
fast-forward	merge
as for the fast-forward merge git pull should take care of that automatically but since in git terms a pull involves both fetching the changes from upstream and merging your local branches with the new upstream the merge part of this will fail if you have a dirty working tree so the above commands will need to be done or other permutations of committing stashing operations before the merge can proceed

feedback	review
review the code and give good feedback

1820903

1822335
junit	jmock
i use combination of dbunit jmock and junit 4

instead of creating categories on nsnull for which you would also have to add a similar category to nsstring that s why it crashes because real strings do not respond to stringvalue - instead try creating a helper category on nsdictionary like stringforkey that uses the code johan posted and returns an nsstring probably also should enforce all other types get mapped to empty strings as well

merb	ruby-on-rails
if it s in a ruby-on-rails merb or rack application you can set

1824915
stdout	stderr
you can probably avoid the need for an additional thread if you use stderr stdout

1824927
children	parent
basically works by binding the event to a parent imutable element and then deciding the actions by the children that are clicked

1824963
children	parent
changing the class of the parent will change the style of all affected children

1825038
int	boolean
yes if your webservice only takes int and strings you can use the built in testpage that the webservice serves up but often you have boolean userobjects or strongly typed datasets that will be passed in the functions and then you have to create a program that create a dummyobject and fill some default properties for you to test it out

1825049
folder	directory
you can put this sln in one of your project directory usually in your gui csproject folder

1825127
post	get
it seems like it should be pretty simple but for some reason i can t get the type post to work correctly

1825127
post	get
using type get works no problem but post doesn t seem to actually post anything to my accepting php script

1825127
post	get
if i do a print_r _get when i use type get it prints out all the correct data but if i change the .ajax option to type post and try to print_r _post it shows a blank array with no content

1825145
folder	directory
create svn ignore attributes on generated folder such as the obj and bin directory so svn status will give you useful feedback when you ve forgotten to add an important file

1825195
post	get
and post the code so we can all get a look

1825218
ncover	ndepend
adding code quality tools into your build - style checks class and method sizes complexity code duplication test coverage etc complexian simian flog flay ndepend ncover etc. will discourage ide generated code

1825369
udp	tcp
you should probably just use tcp for this nothing in your requirements that indicate you need to use the more complicated and error-prone udp rtp-based solutions

1825370
rtp	rtsp
use ffmpeg library for encoding your stream and use rtp rtsp stack to stream them

1825371
udp	tcp
as for the tcp or udp that depends on how you want to use it

1825371
udp	tcp
udp makes sense if you want to make your stream multicast otherwise i would prefer tcp because it is more reliable

1825383
int	chars
each of a c and f will be located on the aforementioned boundary and so will take potentially more space than just the size of an int a chars and a float

1825395
struts	wicket
basically you need an mvc framework spring mvc struts wicket and an orm tool hibernate ibatis

1825436
firefox	safari
ie6 has css gradients and css shadows just like firefox and safari but you access them differently google ie css filters to learn more

1825484
memcached	apc
a quick googling says that apc is 5 times faster than memcached

1825484
memcached	apc
my experience say that apc is nearly 7-8 times faster than memcached

1825484
apache	lighttpd
but memchached can be accessed by different services for example if you run mainly on apache and delegates some traffic static contents like images or pure html to another web-service like lighttpd that can be really usefull if not indispensable

1825484
memcached	apc
apc have less feature than memcached and is easly to use and optimize but this depends on your needs

1825501
tapestry	struts	tapestry	wicket	struts	wicket
having used struts wicket rails tapestry i recommend you look into tapestry 5

1825587
qsort	bsearch
from this point of view the concept is already used in the standard library for the functions qsort and bsearch

1825599
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
having been caught out recently when a web site i launched displayed perfectly on ie firefox google-chrome and safari on windows but was corrupted when viewed using safari on the mac by a potential customer i need to start testing how my sites look when viewed on a mac

1825613
integer	unsigned
should be integer unsigned

1825636
children	parent
-when you select unselect a parent node all the children nodes get selected unselected

1825658
int	chars
will print 1 sachin assuming count is an int whose value is 1 and name is a chars array initililsed with sachin

1825715
serializable	deserialization
if i use struct to define a binary structure the struct has 2 symmetrical methods for serializable and deserialization pack and unpack but it seems ctypes doesn t have a straightforward way to do this

1825794
g++	gcc
gcc would not compile this file but after adding i could use g++ to compile this source file

1825824
opera	google-chrome
opera and google-chrome use utf-8

1825939
nsstring	nscoder	nscoder	nsuserdefaults
edit i would be remiss if i did not mention a few of the other important features implementation-abstracted collection classes nsarray nsdictionary nsset strings nsstring utility classes nsprocessinfo nsuserdefaults serialization tools nscoder .

1825955
width	height
if you set up a div with overflow auto with a fixed width and height with alot of content you will get scrollbars

1825966
children	parent
edit1 i must be dumb while the above is true you indicate to click the parent of the elements not the children - now that i have my glasses on

1825966
children	parent
.children would be the correct selector of that from the parent of the children of course as you indicated

1825966
children	parent
this will select the .parent_menu items children from my parent which says all .parent_menu items and all .child_menu within that

1826004
opera	firefox
browâ ser supâ port is currently limiâ ted to firefox opera and safaâ ri

i ve created a virtual directory in the isv folder of crm and uploated an asp.net application

1826119
mouseover	mouseout
lately i found a css focused solution absolutely positioning an image over another fading it to 0 with jquery on document ready and fade to full on mouseover fade again to 0 on mouseout

1826126
temporary	tablespace
if the temporary tablespace you want to shrink is your default temporary tablespace you may have to first create a new temporary tablespace set it as the default temporary tablespace then drop your old default temporary tablespace and recreate it

1826168
tapestry	grails	tapestry	struts	tapestry	wicket	struts	wicket
if you are looking to develop a webapp there are a bewildering array of java web frameworks to chose from wicket tapestry spring struts grails aribaweb the list just goes on and on

1826168
tapestry	grails
i d suggest learn some java oo first then play around with the java servlets jsp pages which should give you the basics and finally pick a framework like grails or tapestry to learn

1826170
put	get
always let them know that everyone started at the beginning and this industry is always about learning - try to find some positive that they can share with you very early on - you will find this will put the emphasis on sharing and communication and not be dictatorial and autocratic in style and you get to learn stuff also

1826182
post	get
the cropped filename that can then be send via post get in the form

1826191
post	get
this answer by runner and this blog post from rob s technology corner provides you with all you need to get a stack trace with jcl

1826194
subtraction	addition
for the sake of completeness i would like to mention another less powerful algorithm with addition subtraction

1826228
boost	stl
i perhaps wrongly assumed that something like this should exist in the stl or in boost but i was unable to find anything

1826272
postgresql	mysql
the following jpa column definition generates an integer data type by default on all databases h2 mysql postgresql

1826330
pull	push
also the pull model might be more decoupled as the variable of load is kept local to the worker whereas in the push model one would need a communication protocol and overhead to communicate this state

1826330
pull	push
think of the success of the pull model in the auto industry it went from the traditional push model where inventories would be difficult to track and required lots of feedback to the now successful and ubiquitous pull model

1826333
union	distinct
a union essentially performs a select distinct so that it can remove duplicate records

1826359
width	height
the standard way to swap them in c++ is simply std swap width height

1826370
hide	show
when i alter the script to do this the show hide for each tab breaks

1826405
put	get
i m trying to put two new images in to compare instead of the examples given but on this line i get an error with the new images

1826512
disk	ram
if you are creating deleting lots of temporary files move this to a ram disk

1826519
min	max
i am applying one aggregate function to the first component and an other to the second component min and max

1826542
gitolite	gitosis
gitosis or similar gitolite tool are about access control to git repositories via git and are managed from a command line not from web

1826621
min	max
edit given that you will be applying min and max to each vector separately i would suggest either using a matrix if a and b will be the same length and the same data type or data frame if a and b will be the same length but can be different data types or else use a list like in your last example if they can be of differing lengths and data types

1826667
post	get
you should do destructive actions with post reserve get for idempotent operations

1826670
post	get
i figured i would post the answer so if anyone else runs into this issue they can get it to at least work

1826679
width	height
if #close were nested in a block with a position you d need to look at the width height of that block instead of window

1826716
ienumerable	icollection
actually in the current ms implementation of count ienumerable there s a shortcut looking if the ienumerable is an icollection and calls count on it

1826716
ienumerable	icollection
if the ienumerable is a icollection then the copyto method is called instead which is a bit faster

1826763
post	get
this executes via a normal post but in an ajax post this function doesn t get fired

1826768
jboss	weblogic
i have some experience integrating quartz into a weblogic no jboss experience sorry application server

1826801
restructuredtext	asciidoc
if you have control over the output format consider a lightweight wysiwyg markup language such as restructuredtext asciidoc markdown etc

1826830
post	get
the problem is that our content is added to the post via javascript when the post is displayed so we always get fresh data

1826830
post	get
therefore wordpress does not send a pingback to the urls that the plugin will add to the post and the author do not get a link back from us via our pingback system

1826834
altera	xilinx	rtl	hdl
i have also seen rtl viewers in xilinx ise altera s quartus and mentor s hdl designer

i tried all of firefox ie8 in various settings and opera and it simply doesn t work

1826860
rss	feed
it demonstrates how to use nsxmlparser to parse xml data on an rss feed

1826866
rar	zip
please rename the rar to zip once downloaded had trouble uploading a zip file

1826923
integer	unsigned
check also that the type of the index unsigned integer member matches the type of your loop variable i currently integer

1826945
folder	directory
however abc.xyz.com 123 seems to be looking for a folder called 123 in the root directory of xyz.com and is showing up a 404 error when it cannot find any

1826958
udp	tcp
works with both tcp or udp connections and has decent log viewer and database integration

1826998
lisp	prolog
one example is implementing prolog in lisp and then defining a predicate that allows direct use of lisp functions via eval

1827006
hide	show
- using jquery i click an image link to show and play the video clicking it again stops and hide the video - vice versa

1827025
charindex	substr
while splitting the city is easy combination of charindex and substr extracting the country seems to be more challenging

1827036
sorting	filtering
you filtering out later with the sorting

1827086
hex	binary
you have the binary wrong - it should be 0100 0001 - your bin to hex is fine

1827095
pull	push
if the threads ui and facade wait for one another to finish their requests then this should prevent a pull update happening at the same time as a push update

1827097
client-side	server-side	updatepanel	scriptmanager
you can use a combination of the asyncpostbackerror event on the scriptmanager server-side and the endrequest event on the pagerequestmanager client-side to fully handle server-side errors when using the updatepanel

1827118
hash	md5
if you need your whole column to be the primary key calculate sha1 or md5 hash and use it as a primary key

1827186
nsurl	nsstring
i am attempting to load a variable with type nsstring into an nsurl with the following line

1827196
hide	show
you have not subscribed to the uikeyboardwillhidenotifcation only show - thus it will not do anything when the keyboard hide

1827221
ssl	https
bear in mind to do that on a separate meaning not for other browsing activities firefox profile in order to intercept https zap will install a new ssl certificate

1827238
next	except
next use sumif as docmax explained except with different columns

1827240
post	get
and i want to get all post for a given blog

1827319
youtube	vimeo
i am working on an embedment section on my site where users can embed different media from various services youtube myspace music vimeo etc

1827355
accessor	properties
for example the writeablebitmap array accessor has disappeared but i found it in the new pixels properties so instead of writing

1827361
rss	feed
i m querying a twitter rss feed and supplying the results into a repeater for display

1827364
rss	feed
i am using nsdata to get content from a url rss feed and then parse it

1827364
rss	feed
one such url - feed jpl.nasa.gov multimedia rss rovers.xml

1827375
mbunit	nunit
c# - nunit xunit mbunit msunit etc etc

1827379
rss	feed
and take a look at the syndication apis that make dealing with rss feed much easier

1827397
colorbox	simplemodal
simplemodal has a similar function but i much prefer colorbox s implementation and documentation otherwise i d use the latter

1827412
youtube	vimeo
youtube vimeo myspace have only columns specific to each one

1827427
hide	show
i m looking for a wordpress plugin that hide to start with the when i click say an arrow image an ajax feature pops out with say a contact form inside and also another show hide feature at the bottom of the page to show and hide multiple divs

1827439
post	get
there are various post around on how to scale crop a uiimage you get back from the camera like this one

1827500
microstrategy	cognos
and crystal reports brio cognos business objects microstrategy actuate jasperreports birt etc should all work fine

1827549
disk	ram
the distro is a stripped down red hat 7.3 running in a ram disk but i can add in whatever tools are needed to get this working as long as they play nice with 2.4 series

1827616
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine on google-chrome firefox and even works in 64-bit ie 8

1827628
width	height
arguments 3 and 4 represent the width and height of the rounded rectangle

1827628
width	height
the last two arguments represent the width and height of the arc drawn in the

1827704
webclient	httpwebrequest
httpwebrequest or webclient

1827715
ssl	https
obviously http vs https performance has lots of details but remember that a lot of the cost of ssl is in the session setup so the encryption for the transfer will be less costly relatively for a large transfer

1827723
webclient	httpwebrequest
i believe though that webclient is simply a helper that implements httpwebrequest under the hood

1827725
google-chrome	firefox
focusing primarily on google-chrome and firefox btw

1827782
daemons	launchd
and as it relies on standard linux features even people with a limited knowledge of your app can launchd a daemons or stop one if they know how it s called system-wise aka myworker in the above example

1827827
postgresql	mysql
thus if sqltypes were to return postgresql dialect would map it to int2 and h2 mysql to tinyint

1827863
getter	setter
if the checkboxes all have the same name you can have a getter setter for a string

1827888
avr	microcontroller
as i ve been told avr and pic are the most common microcontroller among hobbyists and apparently most people suggest avr for newcomers like me due to its c-friendly architecture whatever that means its c compilers and its large hobbyist community

1827915
arduino	avr-gcc
all you should have to do to get running with the arduino is do a pkg_add avr-gcc or build your own which is quite simple and pkg_add avrdude

1827921
tcpclient	networkstream
so far the client handles both content-length and chunked responses by iterating through the networkstream response after writing a get request to the tcpclient parsing the headers and retrieving the relevant message body bytes chunked bytes

1827926
automake	autotools
i have been using gnu autotools autoconf automake libtool for the past couple of months in several projects that i have been involved in and i think it works beautifully

1827926
configure	libtool
autoconf configure the project based upon the platform that you are about to compile on automake builds the makefiles for your project and libtool handles libraries

1828070
vbscript	jscript
note that it s much more difficult to use wmi in jscript than it is in vbscript and most examples you find on the internet are for vbscript which makes porting the code a pain

1828148
post	get
you can edit your cookies or post data or get session variables or write a simple script to do it

1828172
comparator	icomparer
comparator - an icomparer to compare keys

1828175
circuit	nor
never seen nor noticed that before and i used to sell rotating screens like that when i used to work for circuit city

1828182
children	parent
when testing nested objects if the parent is undefined or null then it has no children so no further testing is needed

1828182
children	parent
to safely test a heavily nested object you will need to test the topmost parent using typeof but you can test any children for actual values see the testing for empty answer

1828263
wcf	openrasta
if you re considering .net there s openrasta a really nice rest framework simple yet powerful where rest was not retrofitted as an afterthought like it was in wcf

1828275
comparator	icomparer
i dug in a little deeper and found that you can derive from collectionview which is a wrapper around a collection to be bound in wpf and override its comparator property to return a custom icomparer

1828567
inherited	subclassing
qt widget classes have a great many methods so inevitably i m going to end up adding a method to the subclassing with the same name as one inherited from the qt widget

1828573
min	max
another possibility is to handle the wm_getminmaxinfo message and set the minmaxinfo struct so that both min and max size of the window is the current size

1828611
spaces	delimiter
it seems to me from your example that you are cleaning up white spaces from the beginning and end of pipe | delimiter fields in a text file

1828613
keydown	keyup
the biggest issue seems to be that after some period of time the key begins to repeat firing off keydown and keyup events like a fiend

1828616
public	protected
one of the requirements of cls compliance is that public and protected member names should not differ only by case thus ensuring that your libraries can be used safely by visual basic code or any other .net language that doesn t differentiate based on case

1828637
onkeyup	onkeydown
look at this answer and use onkeyup and onkeydown

1828649
keydown	keyup
i think the answer is that the keydown event and its twin keyup are all the info you get

1828649
keydown	keyup
essentially you can evaluate keydown and keyup yourself but ignore a keyup event if it takes place too quickly after the last keydown .

1828649
keydown	keyup
or essentially you should delay your response to keyup long enough to be sure there s not another keydown event following with something like 0.25 seconds of the keyup

1828654
put	get
i m ready to put a bounty if i still can t get an answer

1828658
width	height
what you could do would be to actually have the text in an inner div that has the same fixed width as the container but no fixed height

1828679
keydown	keyup
then using the documents pages controls keyup and keydown events update the array with that key s state

1828681
hash	md5
btw to avoid checking the content of the whole file a solution might be to add a new column to your upload table to store some kind of hash of the file see md5 and or sha1 for instance

1828747
profiling	debugging
such as debugging profiling searching refactoring and many more

1828784
atomic	interlocked
the interlocked operation is atomic

1828785
cvs	svn
i also like having tight svn integration or cvs vss etc

1828802
keydown	keyup
the only possibility is monitoring each keyup and keydown and remembering

1828802
keydown	keyup
after some period of time the key begins to repeat firing off keydown and keyup events like a fiend

1828802
keydown	keyup
you ll definitely get keypress repeating and in many browsers you ll also get repeated keydown but if keyup repeats it s a bug

1828802
ubuntu	linux
unfortunately it is not a completely unheard-of bug on linux chromium and firefox when it is being run under gtk+ which it is in popular distros such as ubuntu both generate repeating keyup-keypress-keydown sequences for held keys which are impossible to distinguish from someone hammering the key really fast

1828813
mouse	keyboard
that command might be implemented by a right mouse button but it might come from the keyboard or some custom setup for some other hardware

1828839
atomic	interlocked
the interlocked class essentially combines the two steps above into a single step providing an atomic operation

1828869
hide	show
hide and show the modal popup in code behind

1828875
put	get
if you put all of this in place and you still get a blank code file consider reinstalling visual studio

1828878
nunit	moq
i am starting a new project with nhibernate asp.net mvc 2.0 and structuremap and using nunit and moq for testing

1828879
put	get
like most tools you get out of them what you put in

1828884
try-catch	exception-handling
inside the main method put a try-catch and use smtpclient to send notifications about unhandled exception-handling

1828885
integer	fractions
also you ll have to change texture matrix to represent fractions values with integer texture coords otherwise they ll only point to texture corners 0 1

1828951
listview	gridview
so i am not using the gridview of the listview anymore

1828951
listview	gridview
however i now have to rework out of a listview with a gridview that i had styled and use this method

1828998
folder	directory
there you can tell which folder from your project should be copied live to what directory on your machine the tomcat webapps yourapp

1829028
nsstring	nsdata
the possible return types from this method are nsdata nsstring nsarray nsdictionary nsdate and nsnumber

1829062
post	put
i ve put break points in page_prerender and page_preload and both are being hit the post back is definitely occuring

1829072
disk	ram
as disk i o is orders of magnitude slower than ram i o this can cause a very significant difference in query execution times

1829082
mp3	wav
you can use lame to encode wav to mp3

1829124
superclass	subclassing
if you use a specific superclass type you ll have to cast the pointer every time you call a subclassing s method in order to avoid compiler warnings

1829126
mouse	joystick
this is true of right-click ctrl-click left-click on a button-swapped mouse 18th-click on a highly configurable mouse a tablet or joystick configured to work as a mouse etc

1829155
postgresql	mysql
i would recommend checking out chapter 8 of that book which covers all of the different methods for db2 oracle postgresql mysql

1829245
comparator	comparable
you can either make sure your word objects are comparable or supply a custom comparator

1829266
typedef	struct
what i mean is header guard includes typedef enums struct function declarations class definitions classes templates etc etc

1829273
post	get
from my testing this is what i concluded and works for form get and post methods

1829274
x86	64bit
you shouldn t have too many problems - we build and develop on xp x86 iis 5.1 and deploy to a 64bit server 2008 iis 7 platform

1829284
button	checkbox
a user can select as many checkbox as they like then click a button that says create a new quote it ll take the items they checked and clone them into a new table so they can edit them as apart of the quote

1829314
typemock	nmock
mind you tools like nmock and typemock make the job easier but it s still hard -- you need to design your code to be tested not just write the code first and pray that you can test it later

1829352
gitolite	gitosis
beside gitosis mentioned in marcin gil answer which requires python and setuptools best known probably from seminal hosting git repositories the easy and secure way blog post and described in chapter 4.7 of pro git book there is also similar gitolite tool

1829376
put	get
i can get the result i want using a subquery but i can t put a subquery into a view

1829383
akismet	recaptcha
since most of the antispams recaptcha akismet etc uses the same principle in avoiding spams where they use some sort of random images with words and people can just guess the words based on what they think is the correct word out of it

1829391
post	get
in my head i see it as two separate functions one to get the form initiate session and another to post the data

1829412
stdout	stderr
try redirecting the error stream to stdout like so and then you should be able to capture both stdout and stderr in a single variable

1829445
boost	stl
given the number of different compilers and the very cryptic warnings that use of the stl and boost gives i usually use google but i strip as much unique strings from the query as i can removing line numbers etc

1829460
gridbaglayout	miglayout
now that i have custom buttons that take care of uniformly sizing themselves i could meet these requirements fairly easily with gridbaglayout and probably even more easily with miglayout

1829480
udp	tcp
how udp is different from tcp

1829480
udp	tcp
one last word of caution - you may find yourself re-inventing tcp over udp

1829545
integer	unsigned
expiration times are specified in unsigned integer seconds

1829600
getter	setter
if you need any custom logic in either getter or setter you cannot use auto-properties

1829610
int	chars
the most effecient way is not to convert each int to a string but rather create one string out of an array of chars

1829698
gentoo	linux
i would like to believe that the linux kernel i m using gentoo 2.6.30 happily takes care of these details and i can use fcntl and it all comes out in the wash

1829718
put	get
the only other way i can think of to get the number of rows that would be returned for a query without doing much work is to put a trigger function on the table that updates the count every time a row is inserted updated or deleted based on whether it matches the query

1829750
getter	setter
writing getter and setter for properties

1829773
versioning	upgrade
i used to be able to do this prior to an upgrade from the last versioning of the os but it s been so long i don t remember what i did the last time

feedburner provides statistics about rss feed of subscribers and reaches

1830062
rss	feed
it is easy to understand that feedburner can count visits reaches to a rss feed

1830062
rss	feed
but how does feedburner get to know subscribers to a rss feed

1830062
rss	feed
in my understanding each requests to rss feed uri is independent

getter	setter
in your first example c# automatically generates the private backing fields so technically the data member is not declared as public only the getter setter

1830265
getter	setter
syntax is just a convenient shorthand for this that you can use when the getter and setter don t do anything special

1830280
getter	setter
the great part about having the simplified getter setter is that when you want to fill in the implementation with a little bit more guts later you do not break abi compatibility

1830280
getter	setter
don t worry about getter setter slowing down your code through indirection

1830280
getter	setter
the jit has a thing called inlineing makes using the getter setter just as efficient as direct field access

it assumes the inputstream instr and outputstream osstr have already been created

1830812

width	height
for example the resized image must have a width 400 and a height 300 but should be as close to those dimensions as possible while maintaining the original aspect ratio

1830829
width	height	portrait	landscape
such that a landscape image would have an ideal height of 300 or slightly larger with a width 400 and a portrait image would have an ideal width of 400 or slightly larger with a height 300

insert the parent rows insert the children rows into a staging table then insert the children rows while joining to the parent on that column to get the id

1833907
children	parent
you can either include the file line # and then use the same steps above joining on those child.line_num parent.line_num and no other parent.line_num is between those two numbers or you can import the parent one at a time in a loop capture the id then insert all of the its children using that id

1833954

1836456
factories	presenter
since your presenter needs the view in its constructor your page should take a dependency on a presenter factories instead of the presenter itself

1836456

so first you need the presenter factories which is a delegate with the necessary parameters

1836456
factories	presenter
in your view add a property receiving the factories delegate and use the delegate to create the presenter

1836497
vb.net	vb6
i have been tasked to convert out vb6 program to vb.net

1836733
instances	transient	persistent	transient
it will however still cascade the save operation through the collection onto the contained entities which includes persistent transient instances

also see if you can use a webkit browser safari or google-chrome or maybe firefox to see if the javascript files are being transferred

1836948

you can set a const of what you think an inch is for yourself and use the width and height of the bounds to represent your measurement

1837156
post	put
if the badness is in the content of a post or put request you ll need to modify your application to save a copy the content as it reads it from the input stream

on cocoa desktop there s nscell which is a lightweight alternative to nsbutton but that s an older technology before calayer and core animation they don t conflicts with each other

1837217
put	get
not sure how to get started but one idea was just to put logic statements comparing the dates between these blocks then adding the total trues

1837221
post	get
if you need it server side have the javascript send the offset to your server with a get or post

1837267
pop-up	dialog
the issue is that when the user enters bad credentials air pop-up an authentication dialog box before my javascript even gets notified of the 401

1837315
width	height
i ve tried making sure all my img tags have height and width specified tried using php s flush function after right before the tag adding a flush right before the function that access the database

1837400
ant	maven
words cannot express how freeing it is to test changes by saving the file you re working on and clicking reload on a browser vs running an ant maven build process

1837441
profiling	instrumentation
alternative frameworks rely on things like profiling api or the java 5 se instrumentation feature the java.lang.instrument package to modify cil or bytecode at runtime which makes any dependency mockable

1837481
post	get
i want to send a php variable to php file using jquery ajax so the php file can get all post for and echo it back to main file

1837502
post	get
i could see if you initial get edit view threw this error and you had firstname set to nullable in your dbml and database but since it is a post this doesn t make sense to me right now

1837524
updatepanel	scriptmanager
you need to use the scriptmanager when registering a script within an updatepanel instead of clientscript.registerstartupscript

1837540
mouse	keyboard
most things that can be done with a mouse while you re programming can be done with a keyboard

1837555
autocomplete	autosuggest
i m implementing a ajax autocomplete autosuggest feature and not only do i want to do the usual show suggestions that are similar to what the user typed but i d like to let the user do partial completions to save typing

ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
i m trying to get it to run in backtrack 4 which is a pen-testing linux distro based on debian ubuntu

1837580
integer	unsigned
it does not need to be overly elaborate you could simply reserve the first 8 bytes to send the length as a 64-bit unsigned integer

1837581
dllmain	getprocaddress
the dumpbin showed only the dllmain functions being exposed and no other function being exposed hence the getprocaddress was failing

1837657
ant	maven
build ant maven

1837661
observer-pattern	mvp
i don t think you really need a special design pattern for this - just standard mvp mvvm kind of stuff in conjunction with a basic observer-pattern or events if in c# or signal slot etc... would probably be sufficient.

1837686
hex	binary
the basic idea i have is to make a function from the current hex decimal binary values used for each character to the 128 values i would have in the seven bit encoding then scan through the file and write each modified value to a new file

1837687
codeigniter	cakephp
with that knowledge you should be able to jump into a framework like cakephp or codeigniter with a strong appreciation for what they re doing for you

1837707
serializable	deserialization
it s a bit much for a small object like this and i rarely ever actually use xml serializable but would load it into an xml document and pull out what i need for deserialization assignments but when things scale are inherited and generally more complex it allows you to reuse quite a bit more

1837744
puts	gets
which gets all the values from a list on my page and puts them into the events array

1837834

1838010
post	get
post get response

1838010
post	get
to avoid this problem many web developers use the prg pattern â instead of returning a web page directly the post operation returns a redirection command using the http 303 response code sometimes 302 together with the http location response header instructing the browser to load a different page using an http get request

1838018
disk	ram
i came across several ramdisk drivers that can create a virtual disk from the os-hidden ram and am looking for suggestions how best to use the 740mb virtual disk to speed development in our environment

1838105
user-controls	tabcontrol
create a tabcontrol user-controls with all of the tabs that you want to display

1838105
hide	show
add the user control to place holder control upon button click event and show hide the tab pages that you want to display

1838114
notepad++	scite
by the way if you like minimalistic approach there is also scite editor which is my personal preference for doing small bits of code it s even more lightweight than notepad++

1838174
post	get
basically it doesn t work different from a normal xmlhttp request xhr post or get to a server

1838227
hide	show
alternatively you could use a decorator pattern where you use a regular asynccallback and decorate it with another one that show hide the popup

1838227
hide	show
alternatively if you use a command pattern you could just add these events to your command pattern implementation and you can register a handler that show hide a popup every time a request is send received

1838242
gridbaglayout	grouplayout
the do everything in a single panel layout managers like gridbaglayout and grouplayout and lots of 3rd party ones have their place mainly when you need components in different parts of the layout to align but with a large layout they generally result in a huge hard-to-handle mess

1838262
multiplying	add
obviously multiplying calls add internally

1838262
multiplying	add
if add fails multiplying fails too

1838303
put	get
hashtable predates the java collections framework from java 1.2 but it s put and get methods are synchronized

1838306
multiplying	add
the fact that multiplying internally uses add is an implementation detail of multiplying

1838306
multiplying	add
so don t take these things into account explicitly in your tests and just write tests to test the functionality of both add and multiplying

1838331
pascal	delphi
i use it for all my projects from delphi 6 to delphi 2009 and free pascal

1838337
dictionary	map
this dictionary is used to map object properties to asp.net controls

1838344
getter	setter
in case you are interested i take the view that it is ok to leave out the getter and setter method for a private inner class especially if the fields are declared as final

1838351
mouse	keyboard
there are literally hundreds of keyboard mouse automation apps out there

1838351
mouse	keyboard
update just re-read the question i dont think what you want is the ability to record keyboard mouse actions as its not guarenteed that the application will keep up with the mouse clicks windows could open in slightly different places or there could be a slight delay etc...

1838355
mouse	keyboard
you should hook keyboard and mouse events see processing global mouse and keyboard hooks in c# low-level mouse hook in c# or processing global windows mouse and keyboard hooks in c#

1838400
gridbaglayout	miglayout
i tried miglayout for something recently and was disappointed to find that the miglayout actually ended up being more complicated to use than the gridbaglayout in that particular case

1838400
gridbaglayout	miglayout
it s fine to split a gui into panels for different logical sections but i think if you re creating a whole bunch of unnecessary extra nested panels just for the purpose of positioning components you clearly need to learn how to use a gridbaglayout or other similarly advanced layout like miglayout

1838420
addclass	removeclass
i m thinking i am going to need a lot of if s with hasclass removeclass and addclass but i want to see what the so community thinks

i ve just had an awesome experience porting an interbase 6.0 app to embedded firebird 1.5

1838515
interbase	firebird
your final point about performance - well interbase was always pretty snappy anyway and my experience with embedded firebird thus far is that it screams - really really impressed

1838573
pull	push
support for the git pull and push commands does not look like it is yet implemented within the nbgit plugin - see this bug report for details.

i ve got all of the fields on the edit form bound to the appropriate core data entity via an nsarraycontroller and i ve got an awakefromnib method installed to handle calling the record but i m not sure what to put inside the method to get the record to display

1838800
pull	push
i believe clickonce is a pull model although by specifying minimum version we can kind of push

1838821
profiling	debugging
debugging and profiling tools gdb

chunked	transfer-encoding
header transfer-encoding chunked

1838944
post	get
for it all requests are equal get post or otherwise

1839003
hash	md5
to ensure that no one messes with the information during the transfer a md5 hash is calculated at both ends with a special key that is not sent to them

1839026
codeigniter	cakephp
commonly-used php frameworks out there at the moment include codeigniter and cakephp

1839029
try-catch	exception-handling
depending on the complexity of logical evaluation going on if the first clause evaluates to true and you possibly implement lots of other tests any number of which could result in errors all of which you want handled in the identical way i d consider it mandatory to either raise a specific exception-handling call a method to handle the error or put the whole thing in a try-catch block which can be quite ugly if there s a lot of code

1839054
powerpc	i386
at runtime the mach-o loader will choose the best architecture to run from your universal binary powerpc on powerpc or i386 on intel

1839131
cvs	svn
i know that eclipse can do this but maybe they are using some tricks inside because you can commit projects which use different repositories too for example one which is in cvs and the other in svn

1839145
folder	directory
subversion gets cranky about there being no .svn directory in the common root of the folder that you re trying to check in

1839231
inherited	properties
you can t remove the properties your control inherited from usercontrol

1839301
firefox	safari
this works fine in ie but the marker does not display in safari or firefox

1839326
inherited	properties
you can remove inherited properties from the properties window with the browsable attribute

1839387
public	protected
in java you have public protected package and private visibility

1839478
zeromq	qpid
therefore i would look at products implemented in c++ such as qpid or zeromq

1839478
zeromq	qpid
zeromq will probably perform a lot better because you can have peer to peer channels whereas qpid is using a broker architecture which had a step

1839504
gridview	sqldatasource
as i use asp.net i have some gridview connected to sqldatasource in each tab and only want this content to load when the user selects the specific tab

1839528
mouse	keyboard
however when i press the menu key on my keyboard the contextmenustrip does not open at the mouse cursor position it opens at the same location somewhere in the bottom-right quarter of the form

1839538
cvs	svn	perforce	svn	perforce	cvs
git cvs and svn have their checkout commands file- new- version control in qt creator perforce not

1839558
button	checkbox
as i have check box in gridview if i dont select any one checkbox and if i click asp button then i have to show message to user to select checkbox

1839633
jobs	cron
also consider that you have at most 40 cron jobs which are used to send messages to the users

1839640
boost	stl
i guess boost bjam compiled without those and that causes such problems because the stl structures like vector look different in binary form when compiled with or without this

1839648
des	dsa	des	aes
i am not sure about dsa java and .net differs on encryption in des and aes as far as i know

1839653
freebsd	linux	freebsd	debian	debian	linux
i know it might be overkill but it makes me confident in future on unix-platform freebsd or linux debian but i suppose that the last one

1839660
boost	stl
you must use exactly the same stl preprocessor definitions when you compiled boost in your project

1839670
addition	multiplication
so perhaps you could use multiplication to generate all the cases you know that are safe and then use addition from there

1839671
postgresql	mysql
the tool should be able to cope with db2 oracle postgresql and mysql as a minimum

1839680
int	chars
you need to convert the chars to an int and return that

1839680
int	chars
you should also learn about pointers and how int and chars differ in memory

1839680
int	chars
you can t just assign a pointer to a chars to a pointer to an int

1839730
post	get
in udi dahan s post i get the impression that he simply has an in-process broker really an observer that notifies all subscribers of events as they occur

1839738
postgresql	mysql
am wondering if there are guidelines somewhere to write sql code which is compatible in sql server mysql as well as postgresql

1839756
postgresql	mysql
postgresql and mysql are heavy supporters but i don t know if you could say the same about sql server

1839774
superclass	subclassing
there are plenty of instances object and string for example where the superclass has a no-arg constructor and a subclassing does not

1839841
mp4	h.264
if i don t make a mistake safari currently need mp4 h.264 aac video encoded for the html5 element

1839854
udp	tftp
tftp is used because it uses udp which is simpler and had a smaller footprint than a full tcp-based ftp server

1839915
gridview	onclientclick
i thought about using the onclientclick event for the edit button along with the gridview row for getting the appropriate button based on the row setting the edit button s enable property to false and the visibility of the cancel and update buttons to true

1839942
children	parent
if you create two children then they are separate objects and their parent parts are separate

1839952
installation	upgrade
in the sql server installation center there a edition upgrade options found under maintenance

1839970
post	put
but the post is outdated the zunelib.initialize takes a parameter and i have no idear what to put there

1840085
versioning	upgrade
how to write a wix installer which can upgrade if there is older same versioning of product installed on target machine

1840131
quicksort	heapsort
most implementations of std sort use quicksort or usually a hybrid algorithm like introsort which combines quicksort heapsort and insertion sort

1840208

a rough 99.99 it s just a piece of metadata gluing together two methods a getter and a setter

1840268
post	get
just make a post or get request using the jquery ajax methods

1840273
jar	war
find out which of your war or ear s jar files contains that and remove it along with the rest of the javax.faces classes

1840323
maven	pom.xml
the internal compiler used for editor hints will follow the source settings in the pom.xml to match the behavior of a full maven build

1840323
maven	pom.xml
maven currently defaults to 1.3 as a source level you can change the source level by editing the pom.xml or more easily using the netbeans project properties dialog

1840324
richfaces	icefaces
as far i know integrating icefaces an richfaces will be possible when theirs jsf 2.0 versions will be released in icefaces 2.0 and richfaces 4.0

1840346
post	get
you can definitely do this just by making another get or post to the controller action you wish to call

1840346
rss	feed
for example i have a twittercontroller that reads my twitter rss feed on the front page

1840351
doc	rtf
i need to export a report and save it to a location specified i have exported the report but i want to know how to save it in a file location it is a doc or rtf format

1840375
width	height
center screen positioning - using negative margins the same dimension as the height and width of the object you want to center you can center an object in the middle of the browser

1840404
width	height
it appears from your code that you have hard coded the pixel width and height

1840407
objectdatasource	formview
i am binding objectdatasource to formview for update uperation.set objectdatasource as follows

1840432
caliburn	prism
caliburn actually has a component that adds integration with prism

1840436
int	chars
now at the end i am convincing myself using normal chars array and type casting it into int

1840469
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
currently supports by firefox 3.0+ safari 3.0+ opera 9.5+ and internet explorer 6.0+

1840515
postgresql	mysql
you can easily find lots of comparisons of postgresql versus mysql

1840526
width	height
i recommend making your own version of simple_list_item_2 wherein you have both the height and the width set to fill_parent

1840541
punctuation	words
if you try doing it by hand i would suggest applying some kind of normalization to your strings lowercase them remove punctuation maybe replace common abbreviations with the full words dr

1840568
division	multiplication
if a remains the same and b is changing say if your code is in a loop and it s clear that a does not change between two iterations for instance because it s a const variable then the original version can execute faster because multiplication is cheaper than division assuming the compiler moves the computation of 1 .

1840615
folder	directory
i am looking for a vb script that would list the folder and subfolders from a directory and output it to excel so that i could open the folder via hyperlinks

1840615
folder	directory
i am trying to create a sort of directory index that collates about 100 parent folder from 2 directory located on 2 different servers

1840639
fortran	ada	perl	tcl
there are language-bindings for ada c# lisp fortran java lua php perl python ruby tcl etc.

1840661
subtraction	addition	division	addition	division	subtraction
i know i can split the number between two variables and i have done that for addition and subtraction but never division

1840670
width	height
in css2.1 the padding border and margins are all outside the height and width of an element

1840670
margin	height
this means your elements are 100 of the window height plus the padding plus the margin plus the border

1840680
int	chars
you can write a bigint class that takes chars and stores each element in a linked list data item of type int

1840694
ilist	iqueryable
so realistically in this instance returning ilist or iqueryable has no significant difference

1840705
subtract	add
option 2 if you have monitoring turned on then check the monitoring view user_tab_modifications and add subtract the relevant values to the table statistics

1840720
exponent	modulo
i m looking for a python library where i can import public or private ca signed certificates and automatically encrypt or decrypt message in string format i viewed the crypto library embedded in python source but i don t know how to use the hex modulo and exponent in this part of the certificate

1840723
postgresql	mysql
in 2002 i d say mysql definitely but in 2009 i d say postgresql instead most of the time

1840748
children	parent
now i d like to get a list of all parent and the amount of the parent children

1840748
children	parent
suppose i have one parent with two children and one parent with no children at all

1840756
openssl	m2crypto	rsa	aes	rsa	dsa
m2crypto is the most complete python wrapper for openssl featuring rsa dsa dh hmacs message digests symmetric ciphers including aes

1840756
urllib	httplib
https extensions to python s httplib urllib and xmlrpclib

1840762
verilog	vhdl
it s not vhdl specific verilog and vhdl examples are presented side by side or even hdl-heavy ndash

1840778
packets	pcap
the pcap data starts with the link-level header but i don t think there s much in it that you re concerned about other than ignoring non-ip packets

1840778
udp	tcp
this is done using the more fragments bit in the flags field and the fragment offset field combined with the identification field to distinguish fragments from different datagrams then you use the protocol field to identify tcp and udp packets and the header length field to find the start of the corresponding header

1840778
udp	tcp
the next step for both tcp and udp is demultiplexing separating out the various connections in the captured packet stream

1840792
versioning	upgrade
you only need to load the new module and the gen_server running the old versioning will upgrade since it calls the new module

1840795
subtract	add
now we have to add up the volumes of these solids for the upper faces and subtract them for the lower faces to get the volume of the poyhedron

1840804
width	height
you can use pure javascript to get the width and height like so

1840813
jsf	tapestry
take the presentation layer of your code written with jsf and then rewrite it using tapestry

1840855
octal	hex	octal	binary	hex	binary
this is part of why ada uses the form 16# to introduce hex constants 8# for octal 2# for binary etc

1840855
octal	hex
in fact studies have shown that octal and hex are pretty much the sweet spot for human-readable representations that are binary-compatible

1840855
octal	hex
hex is actually a bit too much already but octal has the problem that it doesn t evenly fit in a byte

1840924
octal	hex
it should also be noted that some languages use o### for octal and x## or h## for hex as well as many other variations

1840965
urllib	httplib
turns out a transparent proxy was making an onward http 1.0 request even though urllib httplib was indeed making a http 1.1 request originally

1840968
unsigned	short
i recently wrote some code that uses the same unsigned short to store two values a result and an id for example

1840999
postgresql	mysql
also starting with version 8.3 of postgresql it is pretty much on-par performance wise with mysql it isn t like the older 7.x versions which were s-l-o-w

1840999
postgresql	mysql
the biggest reason why i recommend postgresql to people who have more oracle mssql experience as opposed to mysql is that the sql syntaxes and general feel of the database engine match pretty closely

1841001
post	get
so i thought i would use the get_img_binary method of ofc2 to get the binary data of the image and use jquery to post the binary data to my perl script

1841013
width	height
each div has a pixel width height top and left saved as individual records in the table

1841017
jboss	weblogic
work with other application servers like jboss and weblogic and note their nuances with java

1841020
nsstring	nsdata
the way you get the nsstring into the nsdata is going to dictate the encoding using datausingencoding

1841047
google-chrome	firefox
now in firefox and google-chrome all those divs show up fine and dandy but in ie only the first div is displayed in the container div on the page

1841068
disk	ram
in addition to ctacke s answer remember this cf is a very small subset of the desktop windows that we all love hate such as xp vista windows 7 including server editions the api calls on a cf is smaller as the cf has limited resources such as memory storage space i will refuse to define this as disk space as the distinction on the cf is blurred - flash ram sd cards compact flash cards and so on but no hard disk of any kind

1841094
shadowing	named	superclass	subclassing
you are shadowing your named variable so that the subclassing s named variable and the superclass s named variable are two different variables

1841100
powerpc	i386
you need to look into universal binaries this is the name given to an app file which runs with no dynamic recompilation on both powerpc and i386 architectures

1841100
powerpc	i386
these can be partitioned in such a way that both the i386 and powerpc binaries are contained

1841101
hide	show
if your scrollview is going to be show full-screen in portrait orientation you should use the following sizes assuming you don t hide the status bar

1841112
move	drag
drag move pan

1841130
switching	screens
now i have the problem i want to create a new view which should switching by clicking the button on the blue screens press me

1841149
int	chars
i ve tried using getline with a delimiter of - but i keep getting the error cannot convert parameter 1 from int to chars

1841149
int	chars
i tried creating a temp chars variable to store the number in and then type casting it to int but that didn t work

1841174
int	chars
if i understand correctly try atoi or stringstream to convert from chars to int

1841192
cos	sin
just remember that cos and sin are your friends and there are 360 degrees in a cricle or 2pi radians depending on your math package

1841207
fadein	hide	fadein	fadeout	hide	fadeout	hide	show
replacing my fadein fadeout by show hide solves my problem but it would be more usable if i could add those animations on this.

1841227
width	height
put the div to fadeout inside another div with the height and width set in css

1841241
ant	maven
build tools like ant and maven

1841321
gridview	objectdatasource
so if anyone is reading this cannot get their gridview to page through an objectdatasource make sure you have a primary key

1841322
width	height
you can do so by either setting height or width of the element or by setting the zoom 1 css style property which effectively does nothing 1 is the default

1841323
vbscript	vb6
i did this in vb6 and added a reference to microsoft vbscript regular expressions 5.5

1841346
children	parent
my sitemap has 3 levels to it at it s deepest and depending on what section your are in i want to display all of the children below the parent in a navigation

1841349
width	height
this led me to look into resizing it on the server in the c# code but we use user images uploaded to the database and i can t seem to find the right time or place in the page life cycle to access and change the width and height

1841430
folder	directory
inside of our src directory we have two folder and our continuous integration build file

1841447
serializable	deserialization
if you only need serializable and not deserialization you could probably just do

1841471
int	chars
admittedly you could use chars - it s a 16-bit unsigned type - but that would be horrible in my view as chars is clearly meant to be for text when code uses chars i expect it to be using it for utf-16 code units representing text that s interesting to the program not arbitrary unsigned 16-bit int with no relationship to text

1841477
int	chars
don t use a chars - use an int -

1841503
skype	ichat
desktop sharing either through skype or ichat etc

1841508
min	max
max and min heap free directives may help with some of your heap ergonomics too

1841523
post	get
here s a blog post detailing what one person went through to get into this program and gain access to the documentation

1841568
public	protected
what i can think about is also check all links accessible cffunctions fuseactions etc. accessible by the search result are either secure to be public or being protected to necessary level like

1841617
hash	salt
rngcryptoserviceprovider to generate a random salt then sha512 the password with the salt and finally store both the password hash and the corresponding salt if you want to later verify that some text equals the stored password

1841626
jquery	scriptaculous
incidentally i started using jquery today for the first time i am only new to jquery but i ve dealt with enough javascript and other frameworks prototype scriptaculous etc.. to know whats going on

1841646
short	base
i see initializecomponent is not virtual so it seems there would be no way for the base class to call it short of using reflection

1841668
ant	maven
tools - ant or maven

1841707
unsigned	short
like some of the other answerers i wonder why you have this pressing need for unsigned short that no other data type will fill

1841737
hash	whirlpool
â and add a whirlpool hash into the non-hidden

1841772
postgresql	mysql
i ve found that postgresql is in my expirience is slower as mysql

1841819
hash	salt
hash and salt

1841819
hash	salt
if you only hash you could be attacked by a rainbow attack reverse has lookup and a salt makes this much more difficult random salt would be best. for your encoding you will probably want to either base64 or hex encode your resulting byte array

1841819
crypt	hash
you might check out a standard password hash such as crypt on unix systems

1841819
hash	salt
but again a simple hash + salt is good enough for most applications

1841842
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i ve been working on a website www.philipdukes.co.uk and although the nav seems to work fine in firefox safari google-chrome even ie6 miraculously on my system here it fails miserably in ie8 the navigation links don t work

1841866
put	get
best to put up a message saying that there is no internet connection and give them an option to retry in case they can get an internet connection or choose to quite it themselves

1841868
hash	salt
a single strong hash is likely good enough and adding salt is easy enough that there s no reason not to do so

1841874
french	polish
i have a method which turns any latin text english french german polish into its slug form

1841884
mef	prism
you can use prism with mef if you like instead

the alert fires every time i click the submit button in safari firefox ie 6 7 and 8

1841996
gif	png
a 8-bit png shim is smaller than the same dimension 1 pixel gif and everything will still work as planned

1842001
put	get
1 i noticed that if we donâ t bind gridview to object data source control then when user puts gridview into edit mode we have to handle gridview.rowediting event else we get an exception and in this event put gridviewâ s row into editing mode

1842043
width	height
if you wanted to assign the letter at 40 60 with a width and height of 20 and a texture width and height of 200 to this quad then the uv coordinates would be

1842080
children	parent
i finally got to write this simple solution for getting both parent and children form the current viewed category in wordpress

1842112
google-chrome	firefox
i append it to the document before calling initelement and it works for ie8 google-chrome and firefox

1842134
hash	md5
i wrote it using md5 -q as the hash function

1842138
hide	show
to be more specific what i m trying to do is set this up so that clicking the link will show or hide the div.b s

1842189

there was this post today that discusses two scenarios where mef and prism work together to provide solutions

1842253
scatter	graphing
i am interested in moving to projects that deal more with 3-dimensional graphing of scatter plots and 3-dimensional navigation

1842263
cassini	iis
change your project to use iis instead of cassini

1842263
cassini	iis
now when you run you project it will use iis instead of cassini

1842277
google-chrome	firefox
they may or may not have google-chrome and firefox already installed

1842293
hash	hmac
the hmac uses the block size of the underlying hash for its key size 1024 bits for sha512

1842312
mouse	keyboard
now the application behaves like the message box is displayed mainly the keyboard and mouse are not operational until i click the button on the box but the message is not shown on the screen

1842361
int	double
you should use f instead of d as you are using a double and not an int

1842364
pull	push
then i do my work on on comp push my finished work back the repo and when i switch computers i just pull from my repo

1842421
versioning	upgrade
most dynamic mock libraries are just .net libraries so the backwards compatibility of .net will normally ensure that they still work even if you upgrade to a newer versioning of the clr bcl

1842454
converter	multibinding
create a converter that implements imultivalueconverter then use a multibinding on the text so that you only have one textblock with each line like this

1842515
rss	feed
i have a wealth of atom rss feed files which have many different atom entries in them and a few overlapping entries between files

1842515
rss	feed
i need to find and return an entry based on a url from any one of the rss feed

versioning	upgrade
also make sure you use the module and any other extension points to implement your functionality rather than making changes to the actual dnn core code since any changes to the core will make it that much more difficult to upgrade to newer versioning of dnn

1847564
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox

1847675
width	height
you might want to consider switching do a div with fixed width and height and an overflow auto style

1847695
union	distinct
i suggest using a union all in a query like this because you re sure that the tables returned by the subselects will not contain the first rows so a plain union which effectively does a distinct on the combined data is not necessary and is likely to run slowly

1847725
folder	directory
i ve found this to be useful to visually see unversioned files in one place in a directory listing - but obviously only one folder at a time

1847771
freebsd	linux
this is probably the easiest way or alternately have a look at the source of tail in gnu s coreutils specifically it s -f function although thinking more you ll probably want to look at how the freebsd implementation works as i believe that the gnu version uses some linux specific callback

1847791
config	ini
check if there are any other sources of information the extension uses like a config file ini xml ...

1847792

1848695
sorting	grouping
unfortunately the custom column doesn t show up when sorting through the grouping by fields.

1848762
int	double
the biggest largest int that can be stored in a double without losing precision is the same as the largest possible value of a double

1848762
int	double
go on ask me what the largest int is such that it and all smaller int can be stored in ieee 64-bit double without losing precision

1848762
int	double
or another way of looking at it once the bias has been taken off the exponent and ignoring the sign bit as irrelevant to the question the value stored by a double is a power of 2 plus a 52-bit int multiplied by 2 exponent âˆ 52

1849428
width	height
the idea being that the inner box s offset height and width will never be greater than 200px even if it has a border as shown in the css

1849428
width	height
in quirks mode because the box model is royally screwed you can set height and width to 100 and be done however i am working in standards mode

1849428
width	height
if not can you advise on a javascript solution which does not involve measuring the offset values setting the height width and then subtracting the difference

1849455
cassini	iis
the problem we re running into is that we have to use iis in order to test the application because cassini will only send localhost as the requested domain despite using a different domain in the address bar

1849455
cassini	iis
while iis does give us better performance than cassini we would still like to be able to hit f5 to run our application from within visual studio

1849457
queue	fifo
and have some other process launched via a crontab every minute for instance check that fifo queue

1849457
queue	fifo
if one day you need such an amount of processing power that one server is not enough anymore this kind of system will be easier to scale just add a second server that ll pick from the same fifo queue

1849473
bash	zsh
i highly recommend moving away from csh towards something like bash or zsh

1849487
nfa	dfa
unfortunately nfa- dfa involves a potentially exponential size explosion because states in the dfa are subsets of states in the nfa

1849487
nfa	dfa
fortunately it s possible to avoid the subset-of-states explosion and intersect two nfa directly using the same construction as for dfa

1849508
error-handling	exception-handling
exception-handling separate error-handling code from the normal program flow and thus make the code more readable robust and extensible

which works except now div#stack has a width height of 0

1849578
quicksort	heapsort
if the answer is yes it switches from quicksort to heapsort

if your server code php knows about these images you could calculate the maximum width and the maximum height among them and set the height width of the parent appropriately

1849606
qstring	qtextedit
you could assign your string to a qstring and then add that to the qtextedit or you could parse the qstring using section see here

1849614
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
always test in a standards-compliant browser first like firefox or safari google-chrome

1849614
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
as far as when do i cross draw the line it s 99 internet explorer issues and if it s close enough to looking like firefox or google-chrome safari i m done

1849652
cpython	ironpython
i d ideally like the ability to run both the cpython and ironpython versions of ipython on the same machine

1849656

secondly if use prepare statements thoroughly and you come in the situation where you need to execute it multiple times you don t need to rewrite the code to prepare and execute but you just execute it

1849937
post	get
i seem to recall being able to configure asp.net ajax using attributes on the methods to use an http get rather than an http post

1849962
post	get
ajax calls using get are more performant than post according to yahoo

1849975
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
the default behavior of a uitabbarcontroller is to pop the contained uinavigationcontroller to the root view controller when a particular tab is tapped a second time

1850035
integer	unsigned
the common method in embedded systems programming is to read the data as an unsigned integer then use bit masking to retrieve the interesting bits

1850059
qstring	qtextedit
qtextedit will let you add your contents via a qstring

1850059
qstring	qtextdocument
the qtextdocument itself also can accept a qstring

1850073
public	protected
derived classes can only change members of the parent s superclass if the access is marked as protected or public and the members are not const

1850097
children	parent
the problem right now is that if i click a specific taxonomy in the view it shows me the children of all the parent

1850120
strcpy	strncpy
avoid using strcpy and use strncpy instead

1850127
pull	push
if you have admin level credentials that apply to all your pcs and can get a list of all you r pcs network names you could push the files out through the c share or if they log in to a domain you can have them pull them via a login-script

1850143
multiplying	subtract
it doesn t make sense to compare an array to zero multiplying it or subtract it.

1850157
getter	setter
you could reach the the functionality by using a setter and getter method for your variable but not for a constant

1850196
post	get
get is more performant as it is idempotent and does not contain a message body where as post does

1850196
post	get
the server can look at the request method get post and does not differentiate between a regular request and an ajax request

1850197

user-controls	tabcontrol
my problem is that the infotab user-controls does not have access to the mainusercontrol which contains the tabcontrol shown above

1850464
put	get
personally i prefer to put only brief one-line summary of in-line functions and members in header files as otherwise it makes it harder to get a brief overview of the class functionality when skimming through the header file

1850534
for-loop	loops
i come from a c background so my instinct is to loops 1 through 100 in a for-loop something i can do in matlab

1850534
for-loop	arrays
in a matrix vector arrays i would store sin x where x is the counter of the for-loop

1850556
put	get
but if i use a variable length array an array whose length is setted in run time i get the opposite behaviour a is put on the the stack before the array

1850569
firefox	safari
it works in firefox safari and ie6 but not in ie8

1850705
stdout	stderr
a solution is to have a stderr redirected to stdout and then have a thread empty the input stream of the process object

1850728
dbf	bde
depending on your version of delphi and what you want to do you can either use the bde or find some specialized components that read write directly to dbf native file format

1850840

another form of int math expressions in bash puts the double parentheses on the outside of the entire expression for assignment operations

1850842
int	boolean

udp	tcp
following the ip header is the header for the transport layer the transmission control protocol tcp header or the user datagram protocol udp header

1851047
telerik	componentart
i would check out telerik componentart infragistics and karmasoft

1851116
jsf	wicket
innovative technologies spring hibernate wicket jsf ws rest ... - yep

1851117
avro	thrift
use thrift or protobufs possibly avro to declare a communication protocol and use that over a tcp socket

1851149
haskell	sml
pattern-matching functional languages like sml or haskell may be best to express this pseudocode procedural ones like my big love python may actually mask the problem too deeply by including too-rich functionality such as itertools.combinations which does all the hard work for you and therefore hides it from you

1851260
firefox	safari
you will not be able to animate from transparent to a color except in safari and firefox 3.5 and other browsers that support rgba background colors

1851260
mouseleave	mouseenter
fade in and out the new dummy element on mouseenter and mouseleave

1851279

1851294
mvp	presenter
mvp places majority of meaningful functionality inside classes called presenter

1851296
igraph	networkx
i use python and i ve tried networkx and igraph to plot but all seem to assign fixed edge lengths

1851303
awt	swing
you need to read the article on painting in awt and swing

1851303
awt	swing
also you should not be overriding the paint and upated method of japplet this is old awt code and should not be used with swing

1851314
pull	push
i can t decide if i should use push or pull and i m not sure if the distributor should live on the server side or on all the clients

1851324
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox work fine and recognize the event

1851325
int	chars
objective-c is c so it supports struct and the familiar c-language data types like int and chars

1851335
int	chars
so probably the most efficient way would be an array of int or chars that you append to

1851403
for-loop	arrays
it will have a for-loop that iterates through the replacement chars replacing the char at that index with one from the arrays

1851416
post	put
how come the post form call update action with put method

1851517
kate	gedit
in the linux world gedit and kate fits most needs

cout	cin
it can be used much the same as any other stream such as cin and cout except instead of sending all output to the console you get an actual string out of the deal

1851541
int	double
a floating point number or a double precision floating point number is stored as an int numerator and a power of 2 as denominator

1851592
putty	winscp
i was usually able to install putty so i could check my email in austria germany and italy on a 3-week trip in 2005. winscp lets you run a text editor on remote files which would otherwise be painful over a high-latency connection

1851599
int	chars
use int instead of chars

1851599
int	chars
the value eof is a negative int usually -1 so clearly you can t store it in an unsigned chars or in a plain chars that is unsigned

1851621
portrait	landscape
in the interface builder i rotate the main window from portrait to landscape and than put few uicontrols on it

1851621

1851669
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
the default uiviewcontroller or uinavigationcontroller has details on this

1851769
client-side	server-side
the purpose of json xml in this context is to provide data to client-side javascript through a webservice which at the back end is probably a server-side language php ruby whatever that is pulling data from sql and then marshaling it into json xml for consumption by the requesting client

1851789
children	parent
if the dummy node is found launch a search to get the children and add them to the parent node finish it off by removing the dummy node

1851835
tlistview	tframe
essentially this code displays a tlistview in a tframe and is to show the various current times around the world for different time zones

1851835
tlistview	tframe
i should not add items to tlistview in the tframe constructor

1851862

1851884
ant	maven
so i am thinking of writing an ant script which uses svn commands to rearrange the files in the working copy according the standard maven directory layout

1851967
int	chars
note that the return value of std cin.peek is actually of type which is the same as which is an int and not a chars

1851967
int	chars
more important than that the value returned in that int is not necessarily a simple cast from chars to int but is the result of calling on the next chars in the stream or which is defined to be eof if there is no chars

1851967
int	chars
typically this is all implemented in exactly the same way as fgetc casts the chars to an unsigned chars and then to an int for its return value so that you can distinguish all valid chars values from eof

1852019
post	get
i suppose you could pass php code to a server-side script and interpret execute it but you d still need ajax or a full get post request and it would never be a good thing to do because of how easy it would be for malicious code injection

1852020
interpolation	splines
if you want to interpolation data in a quite general and fast way splines or polynomials are very useful

1852035
mbunit	nunit
the current release of gallio includes a unit test runner with mbunit and nunit support built-in

1852081
odt	opendocument
format rtf opendocument text odt

1852097

you can t do this using the replace function - you need something more like xslt analyze-string from xslt but this is not available in xquery 1.0

1852103
jar	manifest.mf
osgi bundle no different from a plain jar file except for a few mandatory entries in the jar manifest the meta-inf manifest.mf file as already pointed out by james

1853149
unsigned	short	integer	unsigned
in embedded systems the short and unsigned short data types are used for accessing items that require less bits than the native integer

1853149
unsigned	short	integer	unsigned
for example if my usb controller has 16 bit registers and my processor has a native 32 bit integer i would use an unsigned short to access the registers provided that the unsigned short data type is 16-bits

1853540
tlistview	tframe
adding items to tlistview in the tframe constructor should not cause access violations

1853586
turing	decidable
a set of natural numbers is said to be a computable set also called a decidable recursive or turing computable set if there is a turing machine that given a number n halts with output 1 if n is in the set and halts with output 0 if n is not in the set

hypothetically a foreach may be slower - a for-loop and a while loops with the same condition should be equivalent

1854716
cpu	affinity
it seems like cpu affinity and the concept of threading itself is separate from that

1854732
children	parent
however this returns a list of parent where the children are in id order

i have nsstring text contains slovo and i need that nsmutablestring currentrequest contain t e x t

1855222
int	chars
a little benchmarking on windows vs 6.0 debug build 32-bit with a handful of stacked loops gives int and long as providing similar performance which is about twice as fast as chars

1855222
int	chars
running the same test on linux with gcc similarly pegs int and long as similar and both faster than chars although the difference is less pronounced

1855232
wadl	wsdl
i would suggest to avoid wadl or wsdl for api documentation you can see this question where i explained my reasons why the slow wadl uptake

1855232
wadl	wsdl
wadl or wsdl are usually used for automatic client code generation they are not human readable documentation

1855232
wadl	wsdl
i don t think wadl or wsdl are very useful for a user to figure out how to consume the resources correctly

1855250
int	chars
using chars for int is really only useful when you have a lot of numbers a large array and you need to conserve space

1855252
ironruby	ironpython
keep in mind with ironruby and ironpython there are 2 separate type systems in play there is the underlying clr type system and the ironruby ironpython type system when they call out to c# code there is marshalling going on

1855252
ironruby	ironpython
so even though ironruby ironpython can properly monkey patch their own type system they can not use the same mechanism to patch the clrs type system

1855254
int	chars
valid reasons to use chars for storing int values are when the space really matters that much not as often as you might think and when describing some external data format protocol that you are marshalling data to from

1855271
int	chars
arithmetic on chars will almost certainly actually performed using the same registers as arithmetic on int

1855271
int	chars
there is therefore no adavantage for using chars over int when it comes to arithmetic performance

1855879
post	get
get all friends ids of user1 and then select all post

1855922
spaces	delimiter
in your specific example the string you want is seemingly always the second word delimiter by a spaces so it can be beneficial to include the spaces in the regular expression to look for it

1855998
hide	show
i have made a very quick jquery slideshow and i m using this to hide the div s which shouldn t be show until it s their turn obviously

1855999
affinity	processors
so by default the affinity bitmask 1...111 32 times. this means that the process may run on processors 1 2 3 ... 32. of course if you only have 2 cores then the extra 30 bits won t apply

1856018
hide	show
then if you can be sure the user has js enabled you can hide the divs using css and show them using js

1856019
html5lib	beautifulsoup
also can use beautifulsoup and html5lib for parsing

1856019
lxml	beautifulsoup	lxml	html5lib	html5lib	beautifulsoup
out of these i would recommend lxml html5lib and beautifulsoup

1856023

1856230
std	ostream
finally the client uses a binary write fwrite or std ostream write to transfer the buffer to the stream

1856278
getter	setter
however there are internal members in the abstract base properties with internal setter and public getter that the service uses so it needs to be in the same assembly as the service for that to be possible

1856313
postgresql	mysql
i guess i could require the install of a database server but a commercial mysql license doesn t make sense postgresql is different enough that i d have to rewrite a lot of my application

ant	cruisecontrol
we are using cruisecontrol to build our projects which are ant files

1856359
width	height
in silverlight the approach would be to give the row and column definitions which define the cell a specific height and width respectively

width	height
now you can modify the width and height properties of the definitions and the other cells and their contents will move accordingly

1856411
hide	show
in the subclass i override its -touchesended forevent method in order to hide and show the uitoolbar on a single tap touch through a caanimation as well as issue an nsnotification that causes the view controller to hide its navigation bar

1857064
put	get	post	put	post	get
methods you could add a hidden input to a regular get post form with the pseudo-method and have your application translate it so that your controllers see it as if it were a true put request as you mentioned

1857064

however get post put and delete are supported in ajax by the major browsers so there should be no need for a hidden input if you aren t relying on the html form

np-hard	np-complete
np-complete problems are those problems that are both np-hard and in the complexity class np

1857339
np-hard	np-complete
therefore to show that any given problem is np-complete you need to show that the problem is both in np and that it is np-hard

1857342
np-hard	np-complete
the precise definition here is that a problem x is np-hard if there is an np-complete problem y such that y is reducible to x in polynomial time

1857342
np-hard	np-complete
but since any np-complete problem can be reduced to any other np-complete problem in polynomial time all np-complete problems can be reduced to any np-hard problem in polynomial time

1857342
np-hard	np-complete
as another example any np-complete problem is np-hard

you can create an application folder on the webserver and call it something like new then install the mvc project into the new directory

1861706
hash	md5
but i would add a price tag to this basket for each item and often it makes sense to add also the users session id md5 hash to this basket

1861734
versioning	upgrade
first the core python packages as these don t change with backwards-incompatible issues unless you re upgrading a major versioning and you ll want whatever security fixes from a python upgrade to apply automatically to your virtualenvs

1861734
psycopg	mysql-python
second packages that are a pain to easy_install or pip install into each individual virtualenv but that don t change very often -- mysql-python psycopg and pil for example

1861768
getter	setter
another example is properties in python - where your code can directly reference class or instance variables rather than always go through setter getter

1861785
public	protected
edit2 based on your comment below have two sub-classes of foo one that simply provides public versions of the protected methods and one that has overrides all of the important methods

1861786
public	protected
what i ve done when i ve been in a situation like this and its not nice but it works is create a publicfoo in the same package as foo but in your source have it extend foo and override the protected method and make it public

1861790
inline	inlining
you should simply mark functions as inline when 1 it is convenient for you and 2 you want to ensure that the compiler has the option of applying the inlining optimization

1861800
superclass	subclassing
a subclassing should have access to a superclass s protected methods

1861973
hash-function	rabin-karp
i am familiar with the rabin-karp algorithm which uses a hash-function for its operation but this algorithm does not dictate a specific hash function to use and the one the authors suggested is o m where m is the length of the hashed string

1861980
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
both autoresetevent and manualresetevent derive from waithandle which is the prescribed use case here

1862035

in other words every time the #group selectbox is changed hide all options in #subgroup and show only the ones whose value attribute starts with groupval

1862264
int	boolean
only use null true for non-string fields such as int boolean and dates

1862293
windows	wow64
first you have to know that windows 64 bit can run both 64 bit and 32 bit in emulation mode wow64 so you ll have to decide if you want to allow that or you are interested only in pure 64 bit

1862303
pull	push
it would work for push and pull

1862335
accessor	properties
the impression i had from what the apple engineers have said was that the data would be faulted in for the non-fetched properties as soon as you used the accessor for that properties

1862335
accessor	properties
it may be that in generating the description of the nsmanagedobject these accessor are being used for each properties causing the data to be faulted in right before the string describing the objects is generated

1862347
unix	bsd
i know for certain that it is available on bsd and possibly other unix s

1862382
ubuntu	debian
after getting that installed and set up you can say fink install mysql-unified-dev to get essentially the same thing as asking for libmysqlclient15-dev on a debian or ubuntu type system

1862417
rss	feed
later when a rss feed reader comes by your site for the user you just load the user information for the user with that token

i am using ni labwindows cvi 8.1 to compile and build a executable program which i need to run on either windows xp and windows 2000 os

1862511
jmenubar	jmenuitem
adding a jmenuitem doesn t play well with the layout of a jmenubar and buttons look too button-like

1862557
jmenubar	jmenuitem
you need to put the jmenuitem in a jmenu then you add the jmenu to the jmenubar

1862578
postgresql	mysql
the above syntax works with mysql and postgresql for varous syntax used for this kins of request you can have a look there select-limit

1862598
int	boolean
the sig for this method is refreshnavigationimages boolean int

1862620
postgresql	mysql
mysql postgresql

1862647

the following code implements camickr s solution although i would have come up with the same thing after seeing the default way jmenuitem s are rendered in a jmenubar

1862867
bellman-ford	dijkstra
edit otoh dijkstra s with an unsorted array for the priority queue timed out. that bfs bellman-ford worked surprised me a little as i thought that the input size was quite large

1862875

1862875
solaris	aix
websphere xd supports many operating systems including aix hp-ux linux sun solaris windows and z os

1862876
hide	show
i think i can do this by having the three images next to each other far enough apart that the one to the other side will not show and use javascript to hide the scroll buttons and then use javascript to scroll to the html anchor that specifies the location of the image

1862883
bellman-ford	dijkstra
the boost graph library appears to have implementations for both dijkstra and bellman-ford

1862889
put	get
i don t need to actually run a tfs server myself but i do need the ability to connect to my clients and get put files and the integration with team explorer in vs is really nice hence i d rather not have to use an external 3rd party tool

rss	feed
title .net c# using rss.net with stack overflow feed how to handle special properties of rss items

1862896
rss	feed
for some examples of reading and writing extended values from rss feed go here.

1862929
floating-point	integer
as the other commentators rightly remarked ap is much slower than hardware supported floating-point datatypes because you must program it with the integer datatypes per hand

1862934
affinity	processors
option one means that you run four instances of the erlang vm each with a single scheduler affinity set to different processors cores

1862934
affinity	processors
option two means running a single erlang vm with four schedulers each scheduler s affinity set to different processors cores

1863002
folder	directory
here s the part that is really frustrating me the fxcop documentation here says that it will load up all referenced assemblies from either the same folder that the analyzed assembly is in or from a folder referenced by the directory command line option

1863002
folder	directory
the file does exist in the same folder as the one being analyzed and i have tried passing the folder in as a directory command line option

1863011
ropemacs	pymacs
the ropemacs variants appears to be for refactoring only and pymacs is allows python as an emacs-extension language -- neither of which is what you need for standard support

1863013
g++	gcc
this can make a difference especially if you are combining compilation with the link phase as it can lead to different libraries being linked g++ vs gcc and so you can control the outcome in your makefile

1863050
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
the test case below works fine in firefox opera and google-chrome i get the expected list of nodes and depths but fails in ie8 all the nodes are at the same depth and end tags are included in the node list

1863057
put	get
i always get does not contain rows as a result but looking at the visual studio debugger shows that the collection i m passing in contains the two values i put in there

1863090
min	max
if that s not successful maybe find the actual min and max amongst the samples and adjust your scale accordingly

1863102
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
looks like ie doesn t treat your xml nodes as dom nodes whereas firefox google-chrome and opera do

1863136
strlen	strtok
strtok can return null if it doesn t find the separator it s looking for and you can t call strlen with null

1863136
strcpy	malloc
malloc can return null if there isn t enough memory and you can t call strcpy with null either

1863151
vb6	powerbuilder
i haven t done anything with powerbuilder but this is the technique we followed pretty successfully with a project that could not immediately be migrated from vb6

1863151
vb6	powerbuilder
2 we referenced the com objects in our vb6 code as you would in the powerbuilder code using the built in object handling oleobject in your case

1863165
subtraction	addition	subtraction	add	subtract	addition	subtract	add
the two s-complement system has the advantage of not requiring that the addition and subtraction circuitry examine the signs of the operands to determine whether to add or subtract

1863195
strcpy	malloc	strcpy	strdup	strdup	malloc
to do both the malloc and strcpy in one call it would be better to use strdup as it also remembers to allocate room for the terminating nul which you left out of your code as written

1863195
printf	strtok
the actual segfault you are getting is likely to be inside strtok not printf because your sample as written is attempting to pass a string constant to strtok which must be able to modify the string

1863219
integer	unsigned
for unsigned integer types size_t being one of those the c standard and the c++ standard too i think specifies precise overflow rules

1863221

1863306
organization	naming
while you may end up with more files they shouldn t be hard to keep track of if you have a good organization and naming system keeping models views and controllers in 3 separate folders or have some kind of naming convention that tells you what is what

1863332
subtraction	addition
two s complement is very nice for doing subtraction just like addition

1863342

1863380
curlpp	libcurl
the main thing i don t understand is if i have to compile libcurl and curlpp then how does it work when trying to take it over to the other platforms

1863388
versioning	upgrade
do not upgrade to this versioning without carefully reading the documentation and reviewing the new examples

1863450
post	get
my assertion consumer service acs page will accept the saml response through both get and post methods

1863450

however i would like to declare that i support both http-redirect get and http-post post

1863477
yacc	bison
i m assuming here that you have some additional rules such as commaloop expr otherwise your grammar doesn t actually match anything and bison yacc will complain about unused non-terminals

1863479
int	chars
gamestate is a class the implements gamestateinterface and an object that implements this interface can be passed to the agent so the agent can read and analyze the data from game state and the agent must return the appropriate action returned as an int that the chars should take

1863484
superclass	subclassing
as for finding this in the java language specification i first missed it as well as it is not as one might expect specified where overriding or the subsignature relation is discussed but in members and constructors of parameterized types â 4.5.2 which reveals that formal type parameters of the superclass are syntactically replaced by the actual type parameter in the subclassing prior to checking for override equivalence

1863501
ubuntu	debian
in debian ubuntu for example it is part of the default python install

1863518

might take a bit of googling--and i m fairly sure you ll find it s all done in a special classloader or securitymanager

1863560
public	protected
this grants code permission to query a class for its public protected default package access and private fields and or methods

1863588

the optimization is enabled only if explicitly requested either by using the saxon stream extension function or the saxon read-once attribute on anxslt xslt copy-of instruction or the xquery pragma saxon stream

1863710
post	get
i have inspected the whole shebang with firebug and it seems that the _post is getting cleared because the processing page does a 302 redirect back to itself that obviously uses a get and so the post data is discarded

1863720
many-to-one	one-to-many
assuming that article to category is a one-to-many relationship and that the category has a many-to-one property called article here is a very dirty way of doing this i am really not proud of this but it works

1863753
mouse	keyboard
the behaviour i want is similar to windows waking up from screen saver sleep on keyboard or mouse input

1863782
kde	gnome
however under windows xp linux with gnome and linux with kde the screenshot contains a white area where the overlapping window obstructs the view

1863799
zoo	xts
you have several good options timeseries its fts xts but the most popular of these is the zoo package

1863848
getter	setter
one property with attribute and getter setter and one field with the same name starting with an _ character

1863890
int	double
nstimeinterval is a double and you re doing int division

just change its type from int to double and you should be good

1863895
haskell	ocaml
use haskell ocaml or f# instead

1863924
ubuntu	linux
for this example i am running ubuntu linux 64-bit

1863931
setinterval	settimeout
edit knowing nothing about the widget i would probably set an interval to make requests from client to server either by using javascript setinterval or settimeout .

1863960
int	double
use doublevalue in order to get the string as a double so you can avoid int division

1863970
equals	compareto
you would correctly feel like replacing this with equals and use compareto in cases where you are interested in more that just one case

1863984
changeset	cherry-pick
furthermore it causes cherry-pick at the file level which is even more dangerous than ordinary cherry picking by changeset

1863984
changeset	cherry-pick
discarding some changeset only to accept subsequent ones is yet another name for cherry-pick

1864019
opera	safari
trying switching over to a clean ie safari opera and see if you re seeing the same problem

1864041
google-chrome	firefox
at the moment i m getting varying results between ie firefox and google-chrome

folder	directory
after that i also deleted all .cvs folder inside the directory i wanted to get rid of

min	max
i don t believe so but there is min and max

1864752
min	max
i don t know of one but you could use min and max

1864753
centos	linux
el stands for enterprise linux in this case so i think redhat or a clone like centos

1864753
ubuntu	debian
note the ubuntu doesn t modify etc debian_version when they pull changes from debian so my ubuntu karmic system has squeeze sid in debian_version.

i m working on a site for a friend and the code i m using is showing up differently in firefox and google-chrome - the way it is in google-chrome is the way i want it to look but firefox is messing something up

1865335
google-chrome	firefox
if anyone has any ideas how to get it to work in firefox like it works in google-chrome i would really appreciate it

1865339
width	height
then put this image into your content pane div table whatever you are using for layout but set width 800px height 1px this will force your content to always be at least 800px wide but not cover the fullscreen on resolutions that have width greater than 800px

1865716
versioning	upgrade
if you cannot upgrade to the latest versioning you should use

1865736
hide	show
if so you should use javascript to show and hide them based on what is clicked on the previous list

1865736
hide	show
using javascript to hide show elements doesn t need any tutorial

1865801
tcombobox	tmemo
let me prove this by a simple example create a new application with a new form drop a tmemo and a tcombobox onto it and run the application

1865813
config	ini
the point here is that you can use the very readable ini format but still be able to have your config file in a public directory

1865857
fadein	fadeout
another option is to use fadein and fadeout the animation is till ugly but at least it ends up nicely

1865875

google-chrome	safari
this all works fine in all the browsers except the webkit browsers safari google-chrome

1866136
serializable	deserialization
during deserialization serializable classes do not have their constructor called

1866168
int	double
and in your example an int is not a double so the cast will fail

1866176
single-quotes	double-quotes
use single-quotes rather than double-quotes

1866252
google-chrome	firefox
files generated by other browsers firefox google-chrome are behaving perfectly

1866278

i once had a bet with a colleague that i could write code using asp.net controls to display nested data using either a repeater or gridview far easier than he could write the same code usign xslt

1866318
int	double
for your average calculation you may try casting the int values to double like double total double size even though casting just one value should be enough

1866437
folder	directory
the application fails to load my plug-in dll because my dll depends on a private assembly which is never found it is not located in the application directory nor in the winsxs folder but in my plug-in directory whose location is not controlled by the application

1866479
gridview	radgrid
personally i would question whether a gridview is the most intuitive way to display such nested data - but if you have no other choice and don t mind paying for a third party component i would recommend at telerik s radgrid which supports nested tables very seamlessly

1866485
firefox	safari
it s distributed as a straight-forward and self-contained zip works out of the box with safari and firefox you may want to combine it with svgweb that brings svg support to internet explorer

1866557

1866611
mouse	keyboard
then you just need a massive power supply a separate keyboard and mouse and a big monitor p

1866668
int	chars
if you want to figure out what encoding is being used in your case i d advise printing the actual value of the chars as an int

1866730
serializable	deserialization
as i see it a big benefit of using the out-of-the-box xml serializable api is that you can get started with persisting your objects without having to do almost anything except a few rows of serializable deserialization code

1866731
onmouseover	onclick
when onmouseover changes to onclick it works

1866775

int	chars
how do you convert a unicode int into a unicode chars in sql server 2005

1866841
inherited	properties
check out the system.web.ui.webcontrols.webcontrol class - it inherited from system.web.ui.control and has an attributes properties

1866887
implements	extends
for example userrecordsclerk might be better explained as extends a generic recordsclerk interface that both userrecordsclerk and companyrecordsclerk implements and then specialise on meaning one can look at the methods in the interface to see what the its subclasses do are generally for

1866898
uiview	subviews
i think you need to set the container uiview s userinteractionenabled property then as you tried set the footerview to the container with the subviews

1866928
folder	directory
put these in a different folder under the base symfony directory

1866939
superclass	subclassing
the superclass should not know about its subclassing

1866939
superclass	subclassing
if all the subclassing are going to implement -doauniquebehaviour then it should be implemented in the superclass even empty and each subclassing will override it to its needs

1866950
multiplying	add
then multiplying the direction vector ab by the original length minus the circle s radius and add back to the lines starting position

1866997
int	chars
you need to cast the int param to be a chars varchar so that you can add it to the existing string

1867021
ubuntu	linux
we use gcc on both windows and ubuntu linux

1867021
ubuntu	linux
tested on machine with same architecture with dual boot win + ubuntu linux

1867039
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in google-chrome and firefox but it simply will not scroll in ie

1867125
mouse	keyboard
as others have pointed out in this forum this event is fired for either a keyboard row selection or a mouse row selection

1867144
google-chrome	safari
it was the float left that was breaking safari and google-chrome

1867274
post	get
as i did not get anywhere after finding the comment left in the ie mobile blog by charles morris - program manager on the ie mobile team on his own post i am forced to add this answer and state it is

1867281
vim	textmate
i used to love textmate but changed to vim after finally giving it a chance

1867281
macvim	textmate	vim	textmate
if what you re looking for is a mac integrated vim through textmate you might try macvim too

1867309
public	protected
create a protected string property that is mapped in nhibernate and wrap a public uri around it

1867318
cos	exp
if fitting is not allowed at all the four functions can be divided into two distinct subgroups repeating functions cos and tan and strict increasing functions exp and log

1867355
openssl	m2crypto
as far as i could find only m2crypto supports reading from these files but it can t be used inside gae because it s a wrapper around openssl so not a pure python solution

1867361
getter	setter
also again a lazy loading thing you should never refer to member vars directly in an entity class you should always use the getter and setter

1867361
equals	tostring
so your equals tostring .

1867375
ilist	icollection
in fact you could implement ilist of whateverbase icollection of whateverbase etc too - and throw runtime exceptions if you get an incompatible type in your add method for example

1867393
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
ie use different approach at setting cursor position than firefox opera and google-chrome

1867406
post	get
if you are querying relatively small numbers of stories at a time you can probably get away w o denormalizing the post information including vote count itself and just multiget that

1867521
google-chrome	firefox
i was having problems with externalinterface and firefox and google-chrome and discovered that the adobe script was not writing the flash tag quickly enough so when the browser tried to find the addcallback function it was not there at the time

1867603
youtube	vimeo
i am interested in taking a screen shot of flash movies on sites like youtube and vimeo

1867605
richfaces	icefaces
i ve also looked at richfaces and icefaces demos and there s an awful lot of tables-for-layout there as well

1867607
put	get
.htaccess contains a few basic directives but if i put some random stuff at the top i don t get internal server errors so i don t think it even reaches the .htaccess stage

1867670
richfaces	icefaces
i ve also looked at richfaces and icefaces demos and there s an awful lot of tables-for-layout there as well

1867713
authorization	access-control
if your application s security policy requires clients to have appropriate authorization to access the resource the application should force reauthorization or provide a custom access-control mechanism

1867760
junit	testng
both junit and testng provide mechanisms for iterating over a collection of input parameters and running your tests against them

1867760
junit	testng
in junit this is supported via the parameterized annotation while testng uses dataprovider

1867766
webkit	gecko
update this only works in gecko webkit

1867788
apache	nginx
finally you need to set up an apache or nginx or whatever instance for each domain and use the appropriate site_n.py as the settings file for that server

1867798
subclass	abstract-class
i ended up defining an static string in each subclass holding the tag of the element so i decided to turn the interface into an abstract-class and give it more functionality

1867846
cos	sin
glulookat 0.0f 2.0f 0.0f 0.0f 0.0f 100.0f 0.0f cos cameraangle sin cameraangle

1867853
subclass	abstract-class
this forces the subclass to define a static variable itself and return it to the abstract-class via the abstract gettag method

1867870
edifact	x12
it s a fairly good tool just for that purpose it supports x12 edifact and tradacoms standards and it s free

1867880
put	get
remeber that if you put a condition in the where clause it s going to apply that condition to the whole set so any row that doesn t bring back a product will automatically get filtered out because your condition can t be true

1867958
for-loop	arrays
i want to replace the above code with a for-loop that iterates on an arrays of strings

1867997
for-loop	arrays
note array_filter will iterate over your arrays and is going to be much faster execution time-wise than using a for-loop as array_filter is a wrapper to an underlying c function

1868005
folder	directory
from what i can tell about your problem i would just specify the user s home directory as the directory to include and perhaps exlude the cache folder

1868022
superclass	subclassing
in each method that superclass checks if the corresponding class is equals or a subclassing of that class

1868040
inherited	subclassing
this createchildcontrols method is part of the control inherited hierarchy and is typically overriden by subclassing controls

1868316
implements	sealed
my current thought is to have my generated comparison function only use on member fields whose t is sealed and instead to use the virtual object.equals object obj if t is unsealed even if t implements since the field could potentially store subtypes of t and i doubt most implementations of are designed appropriately for inheritance

1868359
inherited	subclassing
i defined a base class node that has only a few fields nodeid parentid nodetype and several subclassing that inherited from node and add their own fields

1868375
public	protected
to get all object fields including public protected package and private access fields simply use class.getdeclaredfields

1868378
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
typically it is stored as a salt hash of either md5 or sha1

1868378
hash	salt
so you have a random salt store it in the user s table and then you hash their pass and the salt like this

1868485
implements	sealed
i ve been thinking about this question for a bit and after a bit of consideration i agree that implements and should only be done on sealed types

1868525
hash	hmac
im using hmac to get a hash version of the hole object but first i serialize the object into a string format json format

1868553
rsa	aes
you could use a combination of rsa and aes much like pgp works

1868553
rsa	aes
the client makes a random string wich will be used by the aes algorithm encrypts it with the public key and sends it to the server this is all with rsa

1868568
apache	nginx
now i switched from apache to nginx and therefore php runs now not as an apache service but as fast-cgi and i can t find a way to configure eclipse to work nicely with xdebug

1868603
std	ostream
i have even tried using the std cout but i get another error that says intellisense namespace std has no member cout when i have declared using namespace std included iostream + i even tried to use ostream

1868603
std	ostream
all of the .h files have using namespace std and include iostream and ostream

1868610
integer	fractions
the reason that this works is that access stores its date time in a similar method as delphi as a float where the integer portion is the number of days since a specific day and the fractions part as the fractions portion of that day 0.25 6 am 0.50 noon etc

1868621
firefox	safari
this particular client has an office full of ie7 machines so no firefox or safari etc.

1868639
tunnel	vpn
truly hiding your ip would require that you are leveraging some type of proxy service or tunnel service vpn which is relaying your requests on your behalf and acting as an intermediary

1868639
tunnel	vpn
you could write a vb.net 20005 application which simply connects you to a proxy server or tunnel your internet traffic through a vpn which in turn hides your ip address

1868659
hide	show
in the first view when i scale down to 50 its size then the second view will show and then the first view will hide then the second view will continue scrolling down

ready	each
when you have the module ready you can put the module in gac and reference it in the web.config for each of your applications

1868761
getter	setter
you can either use the objective-c runtime itself and call either class_copypropertylist or protocol_copypropertylist and deal with those or use foundation and call respondstoselector on the object for the kvc getter setter for a given property for a property foo you would call something like

1868801
width	height
only box elements can have its width height attribute set

1868841

i ve got a qframe with a qvboxlayout and i m adding my own custom widgets to the layout

1869036
equals	compareto
the compareto implementation if its elements must not have the requirement to be consistent with the implementation of equals

1869128
google-chrome	firefox
witnessed this technique working in google-chrome and firefox

1869159
equals	compareto
i don t think priorityqueue requires compareto to be consistent with equals

jquery	simplemodal
i m trying to use jquery simplemodal confirm to show a yes no confirmation when a form is submitted

1869218
integer	fractions	floating-point	fractions	floating-point	integer

1869324
mouseover	mouseout
obviously i don t want mouseover mouseout queue buildup

1869331
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
drag a uinavigationcontroller in ib show me an under navigation bar and using identity inspectory i can change class type and set my own subclass of uinavigationbar but programmatically i can t navigationbar property of navigation controller is readonly.

1869335
children	parent
i have a situation where children are built but not saved and are then being used in the view with references to the parent

1869335
children	parent
i d like to have the parent eager loaded with the unsaved children records

1869345
coalesce	isnull

1869450
mouseover	mouseout
the mouseover and mouseout events fire continuously as the cursor is moved inside of an element

1869474
ant	maven
there are certainly other more modern alternatives although many of them are oriented towards java - but you can still use things like ant and maven with other languages with the appropriate plugin or extension

1869514
profiler	perf
then when you see you are not meeting your perf goals and a profiler indicates that adding removing from dictionary are your bottlenecks you can consider replacing with a more targeted class

1869559
wordpress	joomla
that way you can install wordpress in that directory test and deploy without killing your joomla install

1869570
httpwebrequest	ftpwebrequest
if you pass it an http url for example you will actually create an httpwebrequest instance - an ftp url will create an ftpwebrequest

1869574
maven	pom.xml
the maven support or whatever it is officially called lives happily with the pom.xml file no extra jar directory pointers needed at least in intellij

1869588
crypt	hash
i d prefer to use the crypt function and use blowfish encryption but the current implementation of this module uses the hash function which doesn t offer this encryption method

1869623
firefox	safari
also it works fine in ie but not firefox or safari

1869628
config	ini
rather than doing serialization of some custom object or working with ini files i thought it would be easier to just save and replace the config file that the application uses

1869633
skip-lists	tree
based on the usage it s possible that sortedlist could be faster if combine with some kind of skip-lists or even a self-balancing tree or tries

1869655
int	double
in the example given you don t want to clog your int class with how it could become an int from a string or a double so you create your factory whose sole responsibility is to create x object from y parameters

1869763
lisp	scheme
i m considering learning a lisp dialect probably scheme since i am constantly hearing how good of a learning language it is in order to improve my general programming skill

1869815

implements	extends
however implements a new or extends an existing viewresolver is a pretty simple solution and would be the way i d go with

1869842
imperative	declarative
i think the best you can gain from studying a functional language is starting to think in a more declarative less imperative way

1869856
hide	show
i m not sure i understand your question but if you are trying to selectively show or hide one of the controls in your itemtemplate depending on the data use the onitemdatabound event use findcontrol to get the controls and set the visible property on each appropriately

1869880
put	get
instead of using why don t you get the wsdl as a file and put it in src wsdl or another location in which case you ll have to specify it using the element

1869938
x86	64bit
if it s in c program files x86 xxx as seen on 64bit windows this is a known issue

1869947
salt	md5
as overslacked said i think the problem has to do with salt but i couldn t find any sha or md5 documentation that the algorithm is using in each platform or any parameter to customize this

1869981
getter	setter
you could do this with this method as both getter and setter methods are defined for each attribute

1869987
google-chrome	firefox
the download happens in a new window and what i m seeing in ie7 8 but not google-chrome or firefox is the tab opens and closes but no file dialogue is shown

1869991
put	get
you would need to use git ls-files --stage or to get sha-1 identifiers of blobs file versions you want to put in index or if you want to generate version of a file from scratch from working area version

1870004
put	get
the first time i load a request it does automatically get put in the cache has it

1870025
onreadystatechange	onload

as the webbrowser control does not expose a get accessor for the documenttext properties you cannot use it to obtain the html that was loaded into this control

1870029
avr	microcontroller
i have no idea if there are any useful wifi boards that can be connected to an avr based microcontroller system or any small microcontroller any hints would be highly welcome

1870047
rsa	aes
i don t mind if its symmetric e.g aes or asymmetric e.g rsa - but it must be a recognized algorithm for which i can get a fips-140 approved library

1870056
public	protected
we also need to change the search.aspx.designer.vb so that the dropdownlists and textbox are public properties not protected

1870065
slideup	slidedown
find a div slideup all of it s child divs then after all of them are up show one of those child divs via slidedown

1870065
slideup	slidedown
what i think should happen is that each time i click one of my .toggletrigger elements it finds the children of my togglepaneswrapper and then in order does a slideup for each and then upon the last child being slid up will slidedown one of my elements

1870076
uilabel	uibutton
instead use a uilabel subclass where you override the touchesbegan ended withevent set of methods to show the uidatepicker or a uibutton where your action is a method which slides up the uidatepicker

1870100
public	protected
with structure the inheritance is public by default with class it s private by default if you don t specify public private protected

1870204
ring	counterclockwise
adding is counting clockwise around the ring and subtracting is counting counterclockwise

1870204

you can add or subtract any number and it will work

1870306
activescaffold	hobo
if you want something a bit more full featured check out activescaffold or hobo

1870345
subtract	add
using add subtract instead of xor should still produce random output if one of the inputs are random

1870374
put	get
if you can get the user to put the file on a fixed position you can access the file c shared file.jpg using a path like tsclient c shared file.jpg

although you ll predominantly see cross tabs pivots use the count or sum aggregates you can just as easily use max and min on text values

1870484
lift	playframework
since your question is not specific to lift i d recommend you the playframework

1870501
pop-up	dialog
once the execution hits this line a dialog will pop-up allowing you to attach vs to it

1870520
google-chrome	safari
since google-chrome uses webkit you could also as an alternative test against safari or konqueror instead

1870521
int	chars
you would have to pick off the hex chars two at a time convert them to an int and spit out the chars

1870550
jobs	cron
i would prefer not to use a cron because of the nature of the the jobs i ll be running and how often they need to be run waiting a minute to refresh is not an option

1870595
avr	microcontroller
you can get modules for both wifi and bluetooth that will connect to an embedded system through a uart interface however a wifi module will have far more processing power than your avr microcontroller often with spare capacity and i o to execute additional user code so connecting one to an avr maybe somewhat redundant in many cases

1870611
cas	shibboleth
cas shibboleth ldap.

otherwise you are going to have to parse the file string which the simplest method is to use explode manipulate the array in this case setting the last element to otherplace and then use implode to reassemble it

1870750
free	malloc
feel free to replace my malloc with your own malloc

1870842
int	chars
first you have bytes chars int and floats

on debian linux it is located on etc mysql my.cnf

1876098

1876156
google-chrome	safari
i searched around and allegedly body nth-of-type 1 is used in css to target only safari and google-chrome

1876197
getter	setter
getter and setter is far different

1876205
inherited	properties
edit besides the fact of inherited the points pointed out in the other answers like visibility are also a huge benefit of properties over fields

1876209
int	chars
if it is really only a chars and 6 int for each node you wouldn t need to store two lists

1876214
getter	setter
one thing you can do with properties that you can t do with fields is limit visibility for either setter or getter

1876269
google-chrome	safari
there is no css for only google-chrome afaik but google-chrome and safari

1876292

post	put
have your request put it s information on the queue and return the thread then takes the item off the queue and post it to the db

1876528

you could use a std vector or a map or a dictionary or some other kind of data structure for the entity table of course but our requirements have typically been for constant memory cache coherency and absolute maximal performance since handle_t get gets called thousands of times per frame

1876551
inline	inlining
also most compilers are very bad at inlining functions from different compilation units -- if you define foo in file a.c but call it in b.c odds are pretty slim that it will intelligently inline b.c s calls to foo

1876568
accessor	properties
previously i had the properties implemented with objective-c 1.0 style explicit accessor

awk	ksh
as already mentioned this problem is probably best solved using bc awk ksh or another scripting language

1876763
put	get
some are even incapable of performing operations sometimes even load operations on unsuitably-aligned data - in order to work on such data it has to be loaded into two registers and then a series of bit shifts and masks need to be performed to get a usable value and then it needs to be put back

1876795
width	height
it defines the left top width and height of your label

1876795

only replacing find with findvalue gives just the value on stdout but also error messages on stderr

1877318
min	max
you don t need to worry about the details basically it just returns the max and min of a given vector in a value form

1877328
redmine	trac
you might be interested in tools like viewsvn or the more sophisticated trac or redmine

1877348
put	get
the other alternative i considered was using pagemethods to render the control and send the html back to the page to let the javascript put it in the appropriate place then deal with it but it won t let me render the control - i get an invalidoperationexception of page cannot be null

1877374
children	parent
as far as i remember it won t work on children s if if you apply to parent so it has to be on this very element that gets aliased

note that an array of length 11 gets you only 10 a s since array.join puts the argument between the array elements.

1877479
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
simon also points out that according to this jsperf it appears that it s faster in safari and google-chrome but not firefox to repeat a character multiple times by simply appending using a for-loop although a bit less concise

1877506
uidatepicker	uipickerview
it seems uidatepicker is not customizable via a delegate like uipickerview

lisp	prolog
when i studied ai mostly we worked with lisp and prolog but i ve been most productive in ai with java c# and f# has a lot to offer

1877569
nfa	dfa
the normalized dfa for the nfa is using different collections of the states of nfa as dfa s states for example state0 - 1 - state1 state2 to remove the non-deterministic part there is no way to avoid the state explosion as dfa has to do that to represent the language

1877570

1878556
hide	show
i know how to hide and show them it is just hide and show

1878572

where i am running into trouble is when i try to submit a comment on the submission

1878695
inline	inlining
in general i would say not only is it possible that the compiler reordered things it is probable - ie for the code you have there is probably a reordering once inline and inlining is likely that is better than the order given by the c++ code

1878732
temporary	tablespace
how to shrink temporary tablespace in oracle

1878732
temporary	tablespace
yes i ran a query to see how big my temporary tablespace is

1878732
temporary	tablespace
the first question you have to ask is why the temporary tablespace is so large

1878732
temporary	tablespace
if data and the temporary tablespace is 13gib - just shrink it and move on

1878732
temporary	tablespace
of oracle you are running and how the temporary tablespace was set up

1878732
temporary	tablespace
oracle will only shrink the file if the temporary tablespace

1878732
temporary	tablespace
if the temporary tablespace is the default temporary

1878732
temporary	tablespace
if the temporary tablespace you want to shrink is your default

1878732
temporary	tablespace
temporary tablespace you will have to first create a new temporary

1878732
temporary	tablespace
tablespace set it as the default temporary tablespace then drop

1878732
temporary	tablespace
your old default temporary tablespace and recreate it

1878737

1878820
udp	tcp
a port tcp udp etc

1878861
datamapper	activerecord
for example you can use a table data gateway row data gateway activerecord or datamapper

1878925
folder	directory
you can share local folder with the vm which reduces the pain of switching back and forth once the vm has python setup you can just hop in and and run the code direct from the directory on the mac you developed in

1878927
calloc	malloc
in fact as mentioned below you don t need to set the memory allocated to all-zeros so you can replace calloc by malloc

1878927
calloc	malloc
be sure to whether you call calloc or malloc .

1878927
calloc	malloc
since you overwrite the memory allocated immediately and don t need it to be zero you can replace calloc call by a suitable call to malloc

1878935
google-chrome	firefox
while the jquery tools code seems to work well in google-chrome and firefox it is not working in ie 6 or 7 .

1878942

you can add ant tasks to your maven

1879118
postgresql	mysql
you can use them with postgresql or mysql but you loose joins

1879137
csc	vbc
this is a cute hack but with the csc and vbc both supporting the target module and addmodule options you could actually do this without ilmerge just by using a shell script or make file

1879167
width	height
i d also like to add that it seems adding a width and height attribute solves this problem

1879180
webclient	httpwebrequest
i ve seen webclient and httpwebrequest and all that

1879191
realloc	malloc
malloc or realloc function or if

1879191

i ve found that what works best for us is to create the zip ear war jar contents in exploded form in the file system and then as the final step zip ear war jar it up to a file

1879246
awt	swing
that is an old awt trick and should not be used with swing

1879263
vcard	mime
i have write permission to the directory i ve already added the mime type for vcard and restarted the iis server however it still refuses to take it

1879281
csc	vbc
this is a cute hack but with the csc and vbc both supporting the target module and addmodule options you could actually do this without ilmerge just by using a shell script or make file

1879291
move	drag
also this statement evaluates to true which is why you can drag anywhere and move the circle

1879291
width	height
this is because of your drawing filloval takes an upper-left corner of the oval and a width and height of the bounding rectangle

1879340
listview	gridview
regarding comparison between gridview and listview my experience is that listview is more lightweight as compared to gridview

1879343
switching	screens
this is good for when you want to switching to another task temporarily but if this is the case then you might want to look into using the gnu screens utility instead

1879370
width	height
so if you need to save the position x y and size width height of a list of elements then you need to loop through all those items and fetch the properties store them in an object and then store the object in a database maybe as json

1879386
width	height
in the case of a pc display it should simply output normally with a the width x-axis being 1.6 times the height

1879386
portrait	landscape
but for iphones i would like it if rather than having it overflow in portrait orientation the page defaulted to landscape orientation encouraging or forcing the user to turn their phone to see the chart as pc users would

1879457
free	malloc
only when allocating memory dynamically eg with new or malloc in the case of c code do you need to explicitly delete or free it

1879506
kde	gnome
in stead of going for kde and gnome desktops i want to design my small desktop environment for the device

1879507
next	except
when building this structure you have also problem that you do not know which peace you will you get except for next peace so there is little probability involved

1879533
super	self
super is similar to self they both represent the receiver of the message

1879533
super	implements
super starts the lookup of the following message in the superclass where the implements method is defined in

1879533
super	self
self and super are not messages but implicit variables therefor you cannot find them in the message finder

1879540
gridview	datalist
reperter datalist gridview

1879550
free	malloc
short accessing free pointers can cause data corruption if malloc allocates memory in the same spot unless the free pointer is set to null

1879590
folder	directory
if you install the plugin in the vendor folder all files in both tasks and lib tasks directory are automatically loaded into your rails scope by the following two lines

1879628

i read from the documentation that on the touchesended event i can get the alltouches array which is a list of the user touches collected from touchesbegan

1879771
touchesbegan	touchesended
i will also get the time interval between touchesbegan and touchesended from which i will get the speed of the swipe

1879817
temporary	tablespace
you obviously need very large temporary tablespace but you re not consuming more space overall unless you ve been making heavy use of table compression unavailable in gtt s at least up to 10gr2

1879817
temporary	tablespace
using a tablespace group rather than a single temporary tablespace can alleviate problems caused where one tablespace is inadequate to hold the results of a sort particularly on a table that has many partitions

1879817
temporary	tablespace
a tablespace group enables parallel execution servers in a single parallel operation to use multiple temporary tablespace

1879826
entity-relationship	diagram
we are developing a web application which allows a user to draw diagram flow entity-relationship diagram and we need the representation of that diagram in some xml or other formats

1880001
simplexmlrpcserver	xmlrpclib
python 2 xmlrpclib and simplexmlrpcserver

1880020
hide	show
you could hide the whole table do the changes then show the table again

1880057
mouseup	mousedown
edit rereading that page it d been a while it looks like mousedown and mouseup are even more reliable than contextmenu although all major browsers trigger contextmenu

1880117
filtering	grouping
there s no way for any grouping filtering only one by one as you say

1880121
post	get
some of the earlier events in the asp.net lifecycle will fire before the file upload completes but honestly i don t know exactly how far into the request you get before it waits for the rest of the post data

1880127
free	malloc
there s your only place in your whole codebase where malloc and free are called

1880144
children	parent
jquery itself doesn t do anything with the html it just holds the functionality for checking children categories when a parent is checked

1880179
post	get
you can create a get or a post connection with httpwebrequest

1880186
integer	unsigned
in c# you can use unsigned integer types and then the and do what you expect

1880186
int	chars
since java doesn t support unsigned int apart from chars this additional operator became necessary

1880200
inherited	subclassing
workarounds would be to execute the code on every pageload or inherited the checkboxlist in a subclassing that overrides the render method to always produce the output you want

1880243
children	parent
parent and children properties are correctly defined as navigational properties

1880243
children	parent
i actually get my items in a tree structure because ef works its magic behind the curtain and populates my parent and children on these items

1880263
hash	md5
create a md5 hash of the script like this

1880263
hash	md5
hash md5 script raw_output true

1880284
versioning	upgrade
if not then you ll obviously have to upgrade to a newer versioning of the plugin compatible with the new api likely using it as dependency which is what you did

1880313
button	checkbox
the button is #selectall the checkbox are class .tf and they all reside in a parent div called #check inside a div called #friend inside a div called #friendslist

1880338
gif	png
for menus and line drawings - in general any mages with large homogeneous areas many adjacent pixels with the same color - gif or png note musicinmybrain s comment below is usual the best choice as it compresses stronger and the results look better especially because of sharper edges

1880342
gif	png
i would recommend gif over png because there are some issues with color profiles in webbrowsers and pngs

1880393
switching	screens
then switching back on the eclipse screens and wait for the breakpoint to be activated

1880398
cvs	svn
i have had a look at svn and cvs but i m having trouble finding either an add-in or easy to use client for use with delphi 7 on winxp

1880405
pull	push
they are often targeted at guys who just want to use git and hack locally without using the full power of git like pull fetch merge and the like between multiple developers who would all have cloned the svn repository with git-svn then still expect to be able to push their changes any time to the official svn repository and get back to working in git and sharing their stuff etc

1880431
cvs	svn
if you want an easy to use client for cvs and svn on windows take a look at tortoise its really nice and easy with right-click functions

1880434
cvs	svn
i would definitely advise choosing svn over cvs

1880434
cvs	svn
svn could have been called cvs 2 - it s basically cvs but with a whole lot of pain points removed

1880434
cvs	svn
for example you can rename files in svn but you have to delete them and re-add them in cvs

1880435
bazaar	git
if you are looking for a distributed version control system there is git and many others like mercurial bazaar et cetera

this is not strictly true as the ntfs filesystems supports paths up to 32k characters

1880487
pull	push
git-clone pull merge push operations

1880496
gif	png
there is a very good article on the pros cons of gif jpg png formats here

the first step is to establish whether the problem is client-side or server-side

1880547
vsts	tfs
once your team foundation server tfs is installed visual studio team system vsts is installed on your development workstation

1880547
vsts	tfs
i forget how to select your tfs server instance for vsts to work with but i don t recall having trouble with it when i did it a few months ago

1880547
vsts	tfs
once you ve configured all that you interact with your tfs work items and source code from the team explorer and source control explorer panes in vsts it should begin to feel rather like using vs without integrated source control from there forward

1880551
width	height
that depends on whether you want the width height to depend dynamically on the content or if you want it fixed

1880570
spaces	delimiter
i have a sentence words delimiter by spaces

1880579
put	get
you could have put the function right in the master page but then you wouldnâ t get intelli-sense on it for the rest of your code

1880606
viewdidload	didreceivememorywarning
so as long as you implement viewdidload viewdidunload and didreceivememorywarning correctly i wouldn t worry too much about memory consumption of an array of view controllers

1880620
versioning	upgrade
msi makes major upgrade to this installed service uninstalls old versioning and installs new versioning

1880623
submit	submission

1880671
gridview	linqdatasource
when using linqdatasource s onselect method the e.result has the data i m after but my gridview pagesize is set to 20 which means that the linqdatasource rightly so only fetches the first 20 records

1880688
installation	upgrade
i ve just upgrade our ccnet installation to build 1.5.6444.5 and now while a build is running on one queue none of the other build checks on another queue run at all until this build completes

1882852
treemap	linkedhashmap
if you are looking at a specific class that implements map hashmap linkedhashmap treemap etc then you could see how it implements the keyset function to determine what the behaviour would be by checking out the source you d have to really take a close look at the algorithm to see if the property you are looking for is preserved that is consistent iteration order when the map has not had any insertions removals between iterations

1883341
sorting	filtering
for one thing database engines are highly optimized for doing exactly the kind of work that sorting and filtering entail

1883341
sorting	filtering
but even barring thatâ even assuming you could write code that could match the kind of sorting filtering and paging performance of a mature database engineâ itâ s still preferable to do this work in the database for the simple reason that itâ s more efficient to limit the amount of data that is transferred from the database to the application server

1883384

1884599
firefox	safari
this happens to me on both my macs on safari and firefox so i m not hopeful of a solution

1884611
put	get
but when i put a php page in the htdocs folder and try to access it using 127.0.0.1 mypage.php i get the object not found error

1884616
hash	salt
if you don t use a salt then an attacker can precompute a password - hash database offline even before they ve broken into your server

1884628
hash	salt
another intention behind the use of a salt is to make sure two users with the same password won t end up having the same hash in the users table assuming their salt are not the same

1884628
hash	salt
however the combination of a salt and a password may lead to the same string or hash in the end and the hash will be exactly the same so make sure to use a combination of salt and password where two different combination won t lead to the same hash

1884629
hash	salt
if an attacker creates a giant table of hash values for plaintext passwords using a salt prevents him from using the same table to crack more than one password

1884641
post	get
please post your table design and the error that you get when the inserts fail

1884656
proftpd	vsftpd
vsftpd proftpd are two oss ftp servers worth mentioning

1884693
prepare	pdostatement
two subsequent calls to pdo prepare even with the same sql query should return two different pdostatement or handles to avoid collisions especially between previous and current bindings you may apply to it

1884693
prepare	pdostatement
the cost of creating a pdostatement with prepare is low anyway

1884827
folder	directory
i created a fixtures folder in the app directory and put data1.json in there

1884838
put	get
in the click handler for the button i do something iteratively that generates strings which i want to put in the listbox as i get them

1884863
filtering	grouping	sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping
if you require sorting grouping filtering then consider using a collectionview

1884868
min	max
you have included several functions min max avg which you don t use and the elements to display those values are also missing

1884868
mouse	keyboard
the recalculation is mainly bound to the keyup event which clearly won t fire on checkbox and select unless the user uses the keyboard instead of the mouse to select the values

1884878
firefox	safari
overflow-x and overflow-y are supported by ie5+ win firefox 1.5+ mozilla 1.8+ and safari 3+

1884905
mouse	keyboard
the reason is for fast pace games which aren t graphically intensive to stop the screen lag induced by large changes in framerate however vsync isn t suitable as oddly it increases latency between keyboard mouse both are polling at high rates so not a hardware issue

1884929
put	get
the only way i ve found to get around it for my case was to put a time check in my wrapper and to check how long it s been since the last time i reconnected before executing the query

1884930
mouse	keyboard
the way an fps game operates is it paints the screen does keyboard mouse etc handling and game logic then it paints the screen again

1884956
uilabel	uibutton
i have a uitableviewcell with a custom uibutton and uilabel in the contentview

1884956
button	checkbox
the button is a checkbox and toggles between a checked and unchecked state with different images for each state

1885145
temp	tmp
on the server side the session data with matched sessionid is saved in a temp file on linux it is defaulted to tmp

1885146
width	height
if width height of source and target are known use following function to determine scale of the image

1885184
crossover	mutation
you can do mutation the same way you do crossover except you fill it with random data that is legal rather than swapping with another specimen.

1885225
post	get
you need to set this hidden fields so when the user post the form the values get bind from this hidden fields as the td s are not intent to be posted within a form

1885296
width	height
when the script validates max file size and possibly extracts the width height it inserts a row into the database

1885370
harfbuzz	freetype
both pango and qt use a forked version of an abandoned freetype layout engine but this is being reconciled into the harfbuzz project

1885392
width	height
i m making a jquery plugin for full browser flash which has a minimum size limit say 800x600 so if the browser is over 800x600 the containing div is set to 100 width height it s it s below that size it s set to 800x600

1885451
gif	png
note perhaps a better way to do this would be to use a png image that has transparent background rather than my gif image

1885499
rss	feed
rss feed of #sharepoint tweets that also have links to usually good stuff

1885548
jquery	simplemodal
i am using tinymce and simplemodal jquery plugin

1885552
pull	push
just need a way to pull push the data so that the user loses nothing that he she sees on screen

1885560
hash	salt
if the attacker knows that you use a single salt for all member accounts then he can create a single set of pre-calculated hash values from dictionary words using your salt

1885560
hash	md5
md5 is not a very strong hash function

1885560
hash	salt
if you want to use sha-256 you have to fetch the user s salt and then use hash in php code

1885630
hash	md5
i am trying to store md5 hash

1885637
hash	md5
since your md5 hash will always be the same size you should probably use a char

1885654
hash	md5
if that is the question then as long as you are using a proven hash algorithm such as md5 there is very low risk of a user manipulating the bits of their hash to get another user s id

1885682
rss	feed
what i have in mind is a user could send a message to checking-in example.org and this would trigger a script which would then do whatever needed to be done either irrelevant to the message an automated message that gets sent whenever some other even occurs like a server having issues or related to the message like it could store the subject in a database that other users could view as an rss feed

1885763
width	height	actualheight	actualwidth
in order to let the user control to adapt itself when the main window is resized i want to bind the user control s width and height to the grid s actualwidth and actualheight

1885767
apache	lighttpd
i want to migrate some sites running on apache to lighttpd

1885786
actualheight	actualwidth
the problem with binding is that the actualheight and actualwidth might increase if something in the panel makes it increase

1885786
actualheight	actualwidth
if you arr using a grid it might work with binding to the parent actualwidth and actualheight

1885812
lisp	scheme
the recursive call is in tail position so both scheme and common lisp will compile this code into a tight loop

1885852
jobs	cron
use special tools that can call shell scripts and force cron jobs

1885873
google-chrome	firefox
this happens consistently in ie8 standards mode firefox 3.0 and google-chrome so i m assuming there is some property of empty inline-block elements that i don t understand

1885917
jquery	scriptaculous
edit it might also be a conflict between jquery and prototype and or scriptaculous

1885951
for-loop	loops
the reason it might be more efficient is that having the size function call inside the for-loop means it would have to go call the function each time it runs the test to see if loops is finished instead of testing against a static value

1886021
ssl	https
https is a combination of the hypertext transfer protocol with the ssl tls protocol to provide encryption and secure identification of the server

1886025
ssl	https
https is http over ssl encrypted connection

1886043

direct3d 11.0 direct3d 10.1 10.0 dxgi 1.0 1.1 direct2d 1.0 directwrite windows imaging component wic apis

1886048
doc	rtf
for example it might supply html rtf doc and plain text formats

1886119
post	get
for my framework i want to empty disable request array for security reasons and users should only use proper arrays such as post get or cookie

1886119
post	get
even something like below doesn t seem to work it empties even get post etc

1886139
ivar	subclassing
-add an ivar to the uiview subclassing bool hasmoved

1886140
stdout	stderr
use exec.run by specifying pipe as the stdout and stderr if you want

1886140
stdout	stderr
it will return cmd which contains an os.file in the stdout and stderr fields

1886161
post	get
stick to conventions get to pull post to insert data and don t forget _cookie

1886179
for-loop	arrays
when i interate through it using a for-loop javascript turns the arrays key into a string

1886197
for-loop	arrays
the for...in statement should be used to iterate over object properties for arrays use a simple for-loop

1886229
width	height
the div is styled with the height and width of the image with the overflow the second image hidden

1886267
cos	sin
the basic theory is yes you set a timer that moves the image on some sort of interval either fixed or based on some sort of mathematical equation eg sin cos etc

1886308
hide	show
or you can use css to hide that content and show it after a certain point

1886311
post	get
your form could insert update query this table all it likes with post to get the rows into the table

1886315
button	checkbox
for checkbox and radio button use code like this

1886338
nsmenu	nspopupbutton
the menu of an nspopupbutton is an nsmenu

1886361
min	max
my backend database is ms access and using vb6 for max and min time

1886468
codeigniter	cakephp
if it s not too late you could use a framework like cakephp or codeigniter that support both

1886493
vbscript	jscript
vbscript unlike jscript doesn t provide any means to get the current routine name

1886520
extjs	sproutcore
sproutcore or extjs are alternatives but sticking with gwt might be a good bet

1886537
width	height
height and width are undefined

1886554
error-handling	exception-handling
the reason for terminate is that exception-handling handling must occasionally be abandoned for less subtle error-handling techniques

1886615
uisegmentedcontrol	uibutton
the way i do it here on the image below for instance is to use a uisegmentedcontrol as a custom view of the uibutton

1886637
hide	show
the function you call should be written to hide the flash object and or it s container and display the container with all of your content that you re ready to show

1886637
hide	show
however set the css to only show the div with the flash object then finally use javascript to hide that div and show the one with the content in it

1886810
implements	extends
proxies do not extends classes but they do implements interfaces which you can map on your class implementation through the invocation handler

1886862
bluetooth	usb
i tried via usb only though don t know if bluetooth gonna work

1886880
javassist	cglib
apart from using a jdk dynamic proxy which works only by interface you can use cglib or javassist for extending classes at runtime

1886889
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
what s nice about this new doctype especially is that all current browsers ie firefox opera safari will look at it and switch the content into standards mode - even though they don t implement html5

1886905
put	get
then i want to get all the values after the sign so for the type i want to get openbook and put this in an array

1887017
sorting	filtering
these are plain datagrids with filtering sorting and that sort of stuff

1887023
folder	directory
you ll find msbuild in the microsoft.net folder in your windows directory

1887028
serializable	deserialization
well conceptually this method is known as serializable deserialization

1887055
ubuntu	debian
the wiki contains step by step installation instructions for windows and debian ubuntu

1887094
gtk	clutter
gtk doesn t offer that much although you can use clutter alongside with it

1887094
kde	gnome
i m not sure you will get a crystal clear answer for your question which explains why some people keep preferring gnome over kde or vice-versa

1887094
awesomium	berkelium
others are embedding webkit into their application using for instance awesomium or berkelium

1887185
nsstring	nsdata
they come for nsdata nsstring nsmutablearray and everything i ve initiated in this function.

1887204
haskell	ocaml	haskell	scheme	ocaml	scheme	lua	scheme	perl	tcl
you can also use some other languages c c++ d haskell lua ocaml php perl python ruby scheme tcl to be precise

1887239
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome has the inspector

1887263
min	max
adjust the use of min and max to fit your needs

1887323
pop-up	dialog
then when excel refreshes the data the password dialog box pop-up

1887364
pull	push
my resulting answer is probably a combination of these so points for pointing out how to run a bash script and how to script the pull push

1887382
firefox	safari
the images look nice in safari but they are off about 4 pixels at the top in firefox

1887457
getter	setter
if so just use intellij s feature to fold trivial getter setter and forget about how lines does it take

1887457
accessor	properties
settings - ide settings - editor - code folding - show code folding outline - simple properties accessor

1887506
integer	unsigned
i want python to treat the first byte as an unsigned 8 bit integer

1887511
src	attr
part of me also thinks it would make sense to just have one copytosibling function where you check this attr src for whether it s left_arrow.gif or right_arrow.gif and act accordingly rather than the two selectors i posted before

1887518
javassist	cglib
as said before i d recommend to look at cglib but there is also javassist which is a class library for editing bytecodes.

1887615
ant	maven
i am trying to convert a java project which uses ant into a maven project but am having difficulties finding out which dependencies to include

1887637
jquery	curvycorners
after i load the menu items with ajax i use jquery to increase the height of the div and then call curvycorners to round the edges..

1887639
m2e	pom.xml	maven	m2e	maven	pom.xml
then having the m2e plugin you right-click your pom.xml - maven - add dependency and type the name of the jar there

1887679
websphere	ibm
hi i am using ibm websphere application server 7.0 trial version and the priod was expired

1887687
nsmanagedobjectcontext	nsmanagedobjectid
i have a different nsmanagedobjectcontext for each search parse operation and one for the controller and only pass the nsmanagedobjectid between operations or proxy objects

1887687
nsoperationqueue	nsinvocationoperation
the controller then enqueues the nsinvocationoperation for execution in its own nsoperationqueue

1887721
getter	setter
with other setter and getter methods you can do it better this is just a fast sketch

1887732
put	get
during debugging i realized the file actually does exist by the time i get to checking manually for it - after several iterations it occurred to me that the file doesn t show up until some delay passes by - so i put in the loop below in component b as shown below

1887732
put	get
i put a cfile getstatus in component a immediately before it calls into component b and that indicates success - it can see the file and get its true size yet the call into component b made immediately after can not see the file until the above indicated delay passes

1887735
stdout	stderr
when bash parses your command line it will come upon the clause and redirect stderr to the target of stdout which at this point is still the console or whatever is attached to cron s stdout

1887772
stateless	stateful
since most dev are migrate from coding stateful class we found some of stateless bean actually contain instance variables which themself are stateful

1887799
hide	show
in detail view i.e tapping on cell in main view takes you to the detail when in navigation bar i tapp the back button the viewwilldisappear is not being called as i want to remove some keyboard hide and show observers

1887846
factors	mean
to resolve the correct methodinfo i normally try to pick the simplest unique factors and work with that - which might mean the number of generic-parameters method-parameters etc

1887864
int	double
now if you re manipulating real-world money you d better not use double but int or biginteger

1887876
coldbox	model-glue
try coldbox coldfusion on wheels mach-ii or model-glue

1887882
punctuation	words
i chose w over s because of punctuation and other non-word characters that might constitute a words boundary

1887926
int	double
you can use for int s and double s because they are primitive data types

1887930
ant	maven
maven compiler plugin or ant task doesn t do more than javac does

1887931
zoo	xts
xts extends this further but zoo is a better starting point

1887938
pull	push
what are commands for incoming pull push commands using dos command promt from mercurial hg in details i want to know that how i do this..

1887955
children	parent
i have considered hiding the parent window ws_showwindow but i am fairly certain that that will hide all children and afaik resizing the window to a minimal size with any combination of clipchildren clipsiblings would fail in a similar way.

1887997
apache	lighttpd
each node has access to postgres mod_wsgi apache lighttpd memcached pgpool2 for database replication and glusterfs for media file replication and is running ubuntu 8.04lts

1887997
apache	lighttpd
so far the setup is four nodes running apache lighttpd memcached pgpool2 all reading writing to one master node that is running the master postgresql

1888008
google-chrome	firefox
with google-chrome and firefox i have no problem

1888053
folder	directory
2 but the pages which is under admin folder are able to display the image what is the issue is it the directory structure

1888068
rss	feed
that s from the december 2 entry of the rss feed summarising daily changes in the subversion archive the developer page for details about the feed

1888069
rss	feed
i need an rss feed generator

1888071
maven	pom.xml
of the maven repo sends a 301 moved permanantly and it simply take that message and write it as the pom.xml file

1888071
maven	pom.xml
simply if the maven repo sends 404 it skip that repo and go for another but here with 301 it just dump the message as the pom.xml file and later on this failes

1888088
stdout	stderr
stdout stderr operations will be

1888107
folder	directory
however when i click add source folder in eclipse it s not letting me drill into any .app directory

1888124
rss	feed
generating an rss and atom feed is far

1888161
mouse	keyboard
i m starting to feel the need to run fastly through code with keyboard shortcuts to arrive faster where i want to make any changes avoiding use of mouse or long times holding uarr

1888195
rss	feed
php universal feed generator supports rss 1.0 rss 2.0 and atom

1888195
rss	feed
generates rss 1.0 rss 2.0 and atom 1.0 feed

1888243
hash	hmac
a keyed hash such as sha256 hmac would be a good option to prevent brute force attacks if your data store is compromised

1888324
post	get
can inspect all get post content headers etc

1888358
debian-based	ubuntu
the path to the c library varies from system to system it may be lib libc.so.6 lib64 libc.so.6 on 64-bit redhat-based systems or something like lib x86_64-linux-gnu libc.so.6 on modern debian-based systems such as ubuntu

1888413
viewdidload	viewwillappear
i ve tried the code both in - void viewdidload and - void viewwillappear bool animated but with the same result

1888442
int	double
the api uses a pointer because the size of this type is the size of an int on almost any computer compiler combination so you can use it to pass most things except double simply by casting

1888487
sequence	permutation
the permutation that should be allowed in the below sequence are adult and child adults and child adult and children and adults and children

1888507
put	get
i discovered through reading the documentation that if you put on a public property field it will not get serialized much like for the xml serializer

1888537
submit	submission
in a form submission scenario form is post to submit

1888561
client-side	server-side
for web metrics analytics we currently use both client-side js page tags and server-side log files data

1888574
width	height
i need to get the width and height of a .mov-file with php

1888600
spoofing	traffic
now anybody with a network sniffer can intercept your traffic steal the token and spoofing your requests

1888653
migrate	upgrade
i am developing using sf 1.2.9 using propel orm but i am increasingly being tempted to upgrade to 1.4 least of all i feel it will be less of an effort to migrate a life system from 1.4 to 2.0 later on than from 1.2 to 1.4

1888666
post	get
after about 40 post imports i get a sql error

1888703
user-controls	tabcontrol	tabcontrol	tabitem
another key realization was that in order to switch the tabcontrol by index i can get a reference to the main user-controls and set the selecteditem to the tabitem itself like this

1888786
put	get
what i want to do is to just get the text test 1 2 etc of any clicked li a and put into the textbox

1888811
width	margin
the only way to ensure the text lines up is to get the margin text width values correct which can be done via trial and error or using a measuring tool such as xscope

1888841
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
unchecked-exception also known as runtimeexception are those that the compiler does not force you to catch

1888858
put	get
put it all together and you get something like this

1888925
versioning	upgrade
but do not upgrade to 1.4 but to versioning 1.3

1888947
vbscript	vb6
the optional keyword like in vb6 is not allowed in vbscript

1888954
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
i have methods of doing this in firefox 3.0 3.5 ie 6 7 8 safari 4.0.3 4.0.4 opera 9.0+

1888954
firefox	safari
ideally i would also like a method that works in firefox 2 and safari 4.0.3

1888962
vmware	bootcamp
i highly suggest doing your dev for asp.net c# on windows bootcamp or vmware or w e

1888963
stdout	stderr
spawn from java an external proc c# c++ etc that connects to sqlsrv using oledb and redirect the stdin stdout and stderr to your java program

1888964
jstl	taglib
we ve got an app that makes heavy use of jstl expressions and custom taglib which means our pagecontext attributes could have been set just about anywhere

1888973
yacc	menhir
the action routines in your yacc or antlr or menhir or whatever... grammar can directly build the abstract syntax tree so the concrete syntax tree only exists as a conceptual entity representing the parse structure of your source text

1889004
ucfirst	substr
perl has many functions for string processing substr index chomp length grep sort reverse lc ucfirst .

1889004
int	chars
you can read the chars string 100 from a file and add one to it without needing to do an string to int conversion first

1889048
serializable	deserialization
so proto will generate messages class and then for your serializable deserialization it will convert the stream to an object of its own class and your job is to convert the proto object to your actual object or group of objects

1889048
serializable	deserialization
it s a nice way to decouple the actual implementation of the class from the serializable deserialization mechanism imo

1889066
versioning	upgrade
in my opinion you should upgrade your osg to new versioning and try to build it again until you get no exception

1889089
addition	multiplication
where op is a binary operator multiplication or addition

1889193
post	get
essentially the controller action will get all the post details in frmemployees and saves the changes to a database through ajax

1889193
post	get
i am interested in the logic to load the dialog with the ajax content in it get all the post variables through the controller action say public empdetailcontroller via ajax

1889201
post	get
i will try to remember to post a link here to my code once i get it online but to get around the issue i attached a scroll bar to a panel and used the value of the scroll to calculate what data should be visible in the panel

1889246
hide	show
under show hide make sure the message bar is checked turned on

1889287
submit	submission
bind function submitform to form s submit event returning false to prevent normal non-ajax form submission

1889345
google-chrome	firefox
this is observed both in mozilla firefox and google-chrome

1889352
post	get
usually on the main page of the blog you only see a section of the post and when you click on the title you get the full content of that blog post

1889390
post	get
to my mind the simplest thing that could possibly work would be to scan the blog post that you want to summarize until you get to the first close-paragraph tag

1889404
pop-up	dialog
i m using a jquery ui dialog and when i put the following code on my page i have the dialog open and when i click the back button on the browser it never pop-up the msgbox

1889422
installation	upgrade
i m experiencing some weirdness related to an msi installation upgrade perhaps someone out there can help me

1889435
client-side	server-side
obviously that can be done just by calling the client-side search code or if searching takes place server-side submitting the form with the correct arguments values

1889442
avr	microcontroller
a 5 low-cast avr microcontroller can talk to the computer over the usb port and generate a pwm signal

1889487
width	height
i need to determine the width and height of the current mouse cursor used on our webpage

1889507
versioning	upgrade
in order to use .net 4.0 assemblies the apppool running your moss site would have to be upgrade to the 4.0 versioning of asp.net

1889509
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade the main plugin versioning to 1.2 the dependency to groovy 1.7 and wrapped it all in a pluginmanagement tag so that it will nicely leverage the inheritance model

1889553
nant	cruisecontrol
since i m working on the windows platform i use msbuild to create my build-scripts which are executed by cruisecontrol but you can use nant instead

1889564
svg	vml
google maps uses the vml svg or canvas graphics systems depending on the browser

1889564
georss	kml
the amount of data will vary depending on whether you choose kml or json or georss but if you end up with 20 bytes per line segment that would take 50 seconds to fetch on a 1 megabit broadband connection

1889626
folder	directory
the problem is that you are strongly coupling the directory structure of the shared folder to all your projects - which is bound to cause you trouble especially if it changes

1889626
move	drag
the key to easily moving things around in tortoise is to use the right-click drag feature which does an svn-aware move

1889698
portrait	landscape
since there is no paper orientation in ssrs it is assuming this to be a landscape report when it should be a portrait thereby printing the labels sideways

using this list i am trying to implement a business rule where up to 4 children objects will be removed from the list when their parent is of a certain type

1890178
children	parent
put differently if a parent of this type has 20 children 4 of them should be removed from the list

since referenceequals works for null parameters so should the comparer s implementation of gethashcode

1890230
referenceequals	gethashcode	equals	gethashcode
referenceequals specifically ignores any overrides of equals so the implementation of gethashcode should use a special method that matches the effect of referenceequals which is exactly what runtimehelpers.gethashcode is for

1890283
outputstream	inputstream	outputstream	bufferedinputstream	bufferedoutputstream	inputstream	bufferedoutputstream	bufferedinputstream
also if you use stream classes that are not already buffered remember to wrap your outputstream and inputstream in bufferedoutputstream and bufferedinputstream to improve performance and flush after you re done writing if you don t flush the bufferedoutputstream the inputstream may stall or hang waiting for input

1890283

1893564
getter	setter
from a design perspective if you have classes that need to get at the same closured variables frequently they should probably be part of the same function scope closure or you should expose getter and setter for those closured variables perhaps with the _foo convention that shows they are intended to be used only by your code

1893565
post	put
you should put everything in the post and simply leave out the url query string

uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
in your applicationdidfinishlaunching method or wherever else you want to add the uinavigationcontroller just use this assuming ghazalviewcontroller is the name of your nib and uiviewcontroller subclass and that navigationcontroller is an instance variable

1895835
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i actually don t like this method of combining the uinavigationcontroller and uitabbarcontroller since the tab bar controller must always be visible which can be really confusing sometimes

1895840
mouse	keyboard
cannot be made to appear on a higher z-order than other windows through mouse or keyboard clicks

1895850

1896049
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox it is possible in google-chrome it in not possible yet but this is a common request from extensions developers so they are working on it google-chrome devs are mainly worried about performances hit

1896075
gridview	rowdatabound
i think that should be done in rowdatabound event of gridview but i don t know how

1896082

1896291
udp	tcp
using socket for sending data tcp ip or udp or ...

1896298
udp	tcp
note also that tcp and udp are fundamentally different and for reliability purposes i wouldn t use udp normally for this sort of stuff

what i want is some kind of omit functionality like iconv s -c flag which simply does not copy source chars which have no equivalent int target encoding

1896502
many-to-many	one-to-many
i have two entities that usually have one-to-many relationship but in rare cases should have an opportunity to be many-to-many

1896519
many-to-many	one-to-many
if something is usually a one-to-many but sometimes a many-to-many relationship then it is only a many-to-many relationship not a transient intermediary

1896523
put	get
to get that information you would have to put an app on the pc that the device would talk to and that app would provide the info you re after

1896589
many-to-many	one-to-many
you d end up with every query having to check the one-to-many relation first and then check the many-to-many as well which would be more overhead and would be a much more complicated query to write

1896610
jstl	taglib
it look like that you re using jstl 1.0 with taglib uris of 1.1 1.2

1896610
jar	manifest.mf
you can find the exact jstl version by extracting the jar file with a zip tool and reading the manifest.mf file

1896637

1896797
min	max
with datetime field being the unqiue and key field i want a query to output min and max date time for each values so that it will show something like below

1896797
min	max
if there are multiple rows with the same min max value then it should get the latest one

1896797
min	max
with inner join on a field i know to get the details of min max row for a field but only way i can think getting everything in one query is to union them all

1896812
versioning	upgrade
or and this this imho the preferred solution upgrade your jstl versioning to match the versioning expected by the jsps use jstl 1.1

1896857
width	margin
each column has a fixed width of 200px with a 20px margin

1896889
setinterval	settimeout
you may want to consider using jquery timers instead which abstracts away many of the ugly details of settimeout setinterval and makes them easier to use in your code for things like what you are describing

1896896
datalist	objectdatasource
i use objectdatasource and datalist

1896916
min	max
you can get both max and min values in a single query

1896916
min	max
to get max min datetime you will have to join the max min query back to the table once per every value

1896929
min	max
work out min max per type allowing for max datetime if ties

1896929
min	max
extract min max values

1896962
opera	firefox
upcoming firefox 3 and opera 9.5 will

internet explorer 7 seems to ignore the not-selector in the second line in following example it show and then hide the content - instead of showing the content with the right index and hiding the rest

1897030
width	height
tilesize - they are squares so this is width and height

1897044
accessor	properties
remove all properties usage writing your own accessor where needed

1897065
udp	tcp
probably because tcp gives you certain guarantees about how a message is delivered that udp lacks

1897072
int	chars
this returns an int bigger than zero if success and the chars value will contain a null-terminated string that points to the executable that launches this file extension

1897090
free	malloc
if you want to toy around with this try using malloc and free inside your wrapper to get up and running

1897099
firefox	safari
firefox and safari displays the pages all right

1897122
post	get
i m also not to keen on sending params which may include user_id etc via a get even a post is not that much safer since it is fairly sraightforward to see what requests a browser is making

1897141
width	height
now you have the maximum window width and height so that

1897159
.htaccess	httpd.conf
i ve searched the system php.ini files httpd.conf everywhere else i can think of--there are no .htaccess files can find nothing that points at php5

1897165

1897232
stdout	fflush
try calling fflush stdout

1897274
bash	tcsh
it s very much like bash and takes some of the good features from ksh tcsh etc

1897306
getter	setter
the problem is that all those getter and setter are painful to write especially if i replace foo and bar with real-world data types that have lots of fields

1897306
getter	setter
put another way is there a way of connecting the functions created by record syntax up with type classes both the getter and setter

1897333
google-chrome	safari
my problem is that events on safari google-chrome don t have initkeyevent but initkeyboardevent

1897351
google-chrome	firefox
there is also an ie dev toolbar and developer extensions for google-chrome and firefox that do the same thing

1897353
mouse	keyboard
sleepx is almost perfect for me but i want it to only go back to sleep if noone is moving the mouse hitting the keyboard etc..

1897449
children	parent
it allows you to travel back up in the tree even if there aren t any pointers from children to parent

1897455
filesystems	ntfs
we run a web server on top of a windows filesystems ntfs

1897465
datamapper	activerecord
edit - the main feature i would like is for it to automatically discover foreign key associations from the database metadata without explicitly mapping them - i have tried activerecord sqlalchemy sequel and datamapper and from what i can tell none of them can do this

1897483
datamapper	activerecord
in ruby there are several orms like activerecord datamapper or even sequel

1897683
jobs	cron	rss	feed
i have a function that is hooked to wordpress scheduled cron jobs that goes through some rss feed and adds links

1897694
width	margin
if you actually want to center a block element give it a fixed width in pixels and apply margin 0 auto

1897717
public	protected
public protected visibility may be adjusted as you need

1897759
stdout	stderr
you can give it a stdin stdout and stderr stream for communication if you want

1897806
ubuntu	linux
server venice linux ubuntu 9.10 10.0.1.2

1897807
octree	quadtree
i suggest you take a look at bsp trees and possible quadtree or octree links available on that page as well

1897818
unix	solaris	unix	aix	solaris	aix
if you really mean unix and not linux i would recommend solaris eclipse does run on solaris and it s much easier to understand than aix

1897818
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	centos	centos	linux
if you mean linux too i would recommend a distro designed for servers like rhel centos rather than ubuntu or fedora

1897840
addition	multiplication
addition and multiplication also have single instructions

1897874
cos	inverse
and you just need the arccos function or inverse cosine applied to cos î to get the angle

1897910
r-tree	quadtree
your r-tree approach is the best approach i know of that s the approach i would choose over quadtree b+ trees or bsp trees as r-tree seem convenient to build in your case

1897962
min	max
x test x min x test x max

1897962
min	max
y test y min y test y max

1898012
cpu	hyperthreading
it s been given quite a few different names hyperthreading smt cmp but they all refer to the same basic idea a cpu that can execute multiple threads simultaneously using a combination of some resources that are independent for each thread and some resources that are shared between the threads

1898016
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i m not sure of your exact issue with numbers moving - i tried firefox google-chrome and opera and they all played ball

1898041
int	chars
if there s an invalid chars for representing int in the input for scanf the function will stop at that chars leaving it in the buffer ready to be read again and again and again .

1898043
serializable	deserialization
serializable deserialization

1898055
plone	buildout
been working on a plone site for the last few weeks it s the first time i ve worked on one using buildout for recipes and paster for template generation and it s been a learning curve

1898055
versioning	upgrade
googling indicated that this was due to a versioning mismatch and that i should upgrade to the latest versioning of distribute so i did so to 0.6.10

1898066
superclass	subclassing
in terms of the java language when a subclassing is created the superclass is also constructed either implicitly or explicitly

1898066
superclass	subclassing
so when a superclass has a private member this is still part of the subclassing object in terms of memory jvm etc

1898066
superclass	subclassing
for instance a method on the superclass which uses a private member can be called from the subclassing without problem

1898066
superclass	subclassing
so at some level you could argue that subclassing do have-a private field of the superclass but i d argue this is at a physical level not a conceptual one and can be disregarded

1898078
post	get
build the request string inside flash pump it to javascript and let javascript send it to the server in a post request and get the response back to flash through the callback

1898095
mp3	ogg
you should pass it through a codec as xvid for movies or mp3 or ogg for audio for example

1898097
mp3	wav
you can use the lame mp3 encoder to convert the wav output to mp3

1898131
keydown	keyup
109 is the correct keycode if used in a keydown or keyup event

1898140
getter	setter

1898173
google-chrome	firefox
working for all browsers that i have on my computer google-chrome ie firefox

1898189
width	height
i am currently writing a get_image height xxx width xxx method for a model

1898197
getter	setter
just data no methods except if apt for the platform some -simple- getter setter

1898197
hide	show
the only code in the view should be the required to show hide rearrange populate controls for initial view load and when user is scrolling or clicking show hide detail buttons etc showing hiding parts of the view and to pass any more significant events to the rest of the code

1898197
getter	setter
if the complexity of validation rules is such that merely validating a successful user form fill or incoming message against a list of field regular expressions and numeric ranges and checking any objects against a cached or specially fetched copy of relevant reference objects and or keys is enough to guarantee that updates to business objects will be with integrity and the rules are tested by the application as part of the event handler then the model can just have simple getter and setter

1898197
getter	setter
the simple getter setter approach is in my view preferred when analysing each individual transaction unless the vast majority of updates for your app are complex in which case one can use the facade pattern throughout

1898197
getter	setter
the other way the model ends up getting more complex than a bunch of fields with possibly simple getter setter is if you start enhancing classes getter setter with an o2r mapper tool or adding extra aspects like calls to transaction monitoring apis security apis to check permissions for logging etc accounting apis methods that pre-fetch any related data needed for a get or set or whatever upon get or set

1898203
subtraction	addition
we do however had support for addition subtraction and or and branching for-loop control like branch on equal if you are familiar with mips

1898212
unsigned	short
but the data that i m reading from file is a 16 bits image and i d like to put the data in a vector of unsigned short

1898214
multiplying	addition
first implement multiplying using repeated addition

1898214
multiplying	multiplication
however given that you don t have a fast multiplying i m not sure it s worth it - you might want to first work on implementing a fast multiplication algorithm

1898228
hide	show
module show and hide

1898289
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
uitabbarcontroller manages an array of uiviewcontroller

1898294

it s not so many years back that processors didn t have an alu that could do any advanced operations like multiplication and division

1898372
messageformat	decimalformat
however you might want to think about using java.text in particular numberformat decimalformat and messageformat

1898386
children	parent
i m trying to wait in the parent until all children are completed

1898401
int	chars
you are probably getting trash numbers because you are casting from an int 4 bytes to an unsigned chars 1 byte so if c 255 or 0 you won t be memsetting the values you are expecting to be

1898414
int	chars
the problem here is that you are iterating in a vector of int for example which is 4 bytes but iterating over it using chars pointer arithmetic 1 byte

1898426
sudo	passwd
edit seeing as sudo prompts for a passwd you d might wanna use proc_open which allows you to use pipes

1898470
ant	maven
both ant and maven support this sort of pattern matching

1898479
width	height
anyway i need to define a height and width for each item

1898484
min	max
this can be the center of mass a midpoint between the min max x y and z or any convenient point inside or near the mesh

1898492
background-repeat	background-position
the method i usually see is nesting all the divs to layer them then setting the background-repeat and background-position on each one

1898511
innodb	myisam
also know that mysql limits the amount of space set aside for indexes - they can be up to 1000 bytes long for myisam 767 bytes for innodb tables

1898523
nunit	mstest
as far as knowing which assertion fails when there are several in one function you will note that both nunit and mstest give you both a description and a link when an assertion fails that will take you right to the offending line nunit will require an integration tool such as testdriven.net

1898568
hide	show
the header will contain some simple text and some javascript driven code that show hide the body pane

1898614

1898714
getter	setter
getter and setter

1898714
shadowing	named
to influence the results a little shadowing seems to be the most robust at least in my case where class a extends an abstract class with named defined then b shadows with its own named when applicable

1898721
pop-up	dialog
on my website i have it setup where when someone clicks on one of my items a modal jquery dialog box pop-up

for me that would be debian ubuntu others prefer fedora

1898940
goto	break
but sometimes a goto is just fine when it avoids complexity such as extra flag variables to break out of multiple nested loops

1898944
udp	tcp
what i have thought of so far is that tcp is going to be more reliable than udp and in rmi corba we want network reliability

1898950
memcached	ncache
apart from memcached and appfabric velocity there are commercial solutions like ncache or oracle coherence

1898953
short	base
an idea is to survey your proposed customer base so see which linux version they run and make a short list from their feedback

1898968
post	get
that way you can pass that to a query and get newer post

1898971
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
your best bet for a formal package format is probably between deb debian linux derivatives like ubuntu and rpm red-hat derivatives like cent-os

1898977
cvs	rcs
it doesn t have to be rcs but no reason not to dump the cvs rcs repository with the backup

1899019
filesystems	xfs
it was designed for the amazon ec2 environment but the principals apply to any linux system with the xfs filesystems

1899027

either way you re going to use a jquery post to get the json html from the server ajax style

1899046
tabcontrol	tabitem
i have a number of usercontrols inside tabitem in a tabcontrol in a main window

1899148
google-chrome	firefox
it has always been quicker cheaper for us to teach the handful of users how to use the spell checking features of ie firefox or google-chrome instead of putting it in the editor

1899156
popupwindow	pop-up
it opens a search popupwindow with search criteria and after entering the search criteria and clicking the search button in the pop-up window will close the pop-up window and displays all the records in the gridpage.aspx

1899178
move	drag
if you need to move several string constants by hand the most convenient way to do that is through drag and drop select the strings you want and drag them to your constants class

1899179
filesystems	ntfs	folder	directory
how to programmatically set ntfs filesystems folder permissions by using active directory service interfaces in microsoft visual c#

1899241
min	max
how to show max time in first row and min time in second row for access using vb6

1899276
width	height
the cleanest way is to set an id or class for the form and set the width and height for the form using css

1899276
width	height
set the width and height of the form in public stylesheets application.css

1899276
width	height
you can prevent this by setting overflow scroll in your stylesheet right after the width and height declarations but in most cases you re probably better off letting the form occupy the height it needs

1899296
client-side	server-side
in addition to web deployment projects which will let you merge your entire site into a single dll you can also use a web application project which uses client-side compilation instead of a web site project which does server-side compilation

1899304
installation	upgrade
however you ll be modifying the core code and thus won t be able to easily upgrade your installation when the next dnn release is made

1899353

1899477
button	checkbox
i m stumped at the input section where i am trying to allow the user to select choices for radio button checkbox for each record

1899484
getter	setter
lets say i have an user object with getter setter and an read method

1899538
profiling	instrumentation
i guess profiling might need more permissions so it can reflect instrumentation

1899578
width	height
edited even if you specify width height most browser allow you to allow javascript but not allow it to resize your windows and firefox also allows you to force new windows to new tabs

1899607
folder	directory
if you use zend framework you basically have to copy the zend folder to your lib directory and you are ready to go

1899630
width	height
but the best will be to separate attributes height and width into a css stylesheet

1899681
hash	md5
i have to encrypt a text by using the des algorythm with a hash created in md5

1899681
salt	md5
the md5 function has the parameters salt byte 8 and key string 6 it has to iterate 1000 times

1899734
post	get
by default these strings correspond to a query string value sent with get method attributes or a parameter sent using the post method

1899747
post	get
by default these strings correspond to a query string value sent with get method attributes or a parameter sent using the post method

1899749
ant	buildr
that said if ant doesn t give you satisfaction in terms of flexibility then i don t see why buildr would be better

1899749
maven	buildr
and don t forget that buildr and ant+ivy have much smaller communities compared to maven

1899848
cifs	smb
i want my html page to link to a directory in a samba share protocol smb cifs windows share

1899859
easymock	jmock	mockito	jmock	mockito	easymock
second if you don t have to talk with the db i d use a general mocking library be it easymock jmock or mockito for example and make the tests not really talk to a db which will usually make tests faster and simpler

1899977
addition	multiplication
with addition and bitwise operations and and or you can implement multiplication in one step per bit rather than having to add as many times as the magnitude of the smaller operator

1900064
width	height
wpf setting the width and height as a percentage value

1900082
folder	directory
works because the boost root directory contains a folder called boost and that folder is either in your default include path or you did something like

1900096
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox are correct

1900098
google-chrome	firefox
i can have dynamic height only tested on google-chrome and firefox by adding this function to last line of onshow

1900099
width	height
maybe you did that in your own implementation of init i don t know but it may very well be that your view has a frame of 0 0 0 0 and therefore 0 height and 0 width

1900234
ant	maven
iâ m busy converting an existing project from an ant build to one using maven

1900234
ant	maven
i ve had a look around on the internet and some people seem to do this i think using ant within maven and others with the maven plugin

1900234
ant	maven
i d prefer to avoid mixing ant and maven

1900264
punctuation	words
so when im prsing text with input n n it is grouping in punctuation matches - in other words space and space.

1900320
ant	maven
well there is the maven hibernate3 plugin if you don t want to mix ant and maven which is a good idea here imo

1900320
put	get
so if you put your mapping files in src main resources they will get copied into target classes during the process-resources phase which is invoked by the plugin and things will just work

1900343
retaincount	dealloc
if you are absolutely sure that you had sent equal number of alloc or any message that increases object s retaincount and release messages for your object and dealloc method doesn t be called anyway it will be more complex

1900427
ubuntu	linux
works smoothly on win machines even on slower ones but flickering badly on linux which installed to a decent machine tested on ubuntu only

1900429
yacc	bison
the most significant difference between yacc bison and antlr is the type of grammars these tools can process

1900429
yacc	bison
yacc bison handle lalr grammars antlr handles ll grammars

1900429
yacc	bison
yacc bison generate table driven parsers which means the processing logic is contained in the parser program s data not so much in the parser s code

1900447
versioning	upgrade
if you don t want to upgrade the appserver or to change the servlet api versioning declaration in web.xml then you need to live with the fact that you cannot use the element

1900460
post	get
i tryed to imitate browser firstly get newticket page and then generate post request with headers like browser generates.....but programatically i have 200 ok from server but this newticket doesn t appear at list of tickets

1900613
integer	unsigned
well we recently made a timestamp format where time is stored in a unsigned 64-bit integer as microseconds from 1970

1900614
width	height
edit 2 just to add more details to the situation when the positions fo rsetting are passed in they are passed in as a of the screens current widht height so basically setting position x would be pos x as portion of screen screen_width where screen width is the width of the current screen itself

1900643
child-process	spawn
if you are spawn a child-process it is quite hard and you d probably need to use each browser s specific api it won t be the same between ff and ie for example

1900656
srp	principles
injecting such a serivce registry into each class works against the single responsibility principles srp because once a class has access to the registry it is too easy to request yet another dependency than originally conceived and you will end up with a god object

1900699
webclient	httpwebrequest
use httpwebrequest class or webclient class to check this

1900718
pull	push
4 write some async javascript code that pull down the xml and uses the dom model of the xml to count the nodes pull out the note text push it into the menu object in the right places and update the visible counter-parts to the menu at that point if apt

1900788
getter	setter
both classes have setter and getter methods for all fields and default constructor constructor which takes primary key as argument

1900794
floating-point	integer
depending on context floating-point code may be as fast as or faster than integer code or it may be four times slower

1900794
division	multiplication
the same goes for multiplication or division

1900825
cos	sin
you are building two perpendicular vectors which are added to each point and scaled with sin cos multiplied with the radius

1900837
children	parent
if you want to save the parent without saving each of the children you need to map it something like i can t remember the exact syntax

1900859
translation	localization
note by the way that translation is not localization

1900896
getter	setter
this way is done so because until with the current el 2.1 version you cannot invoke methods with other signatures than standard getter and setter methods in the upcoming el 2.2 it would be possible

1900969
xslt	xquery
java-based nonsql data stores like existdb use xquery to transform database entries with xslt to any other xml format including xhtml

instances	transient
as i have a mix of transient and singleton objects it d be very useful for me during debug to be able to see how many instances of each are being created so that i can fix object scopes where needed

1901071
folder	directory
i am currently building a backend to a site using the codeigniter framework i have hit a bit of a problem i needing a way to allow the user to upload a zipped folder of images on completing the form zipped folder must be unzipped and the files need to be moved to a folder else where on the server have thumbnail version of each image created and have there file name add to the db and also if the images are for a content type that does not already exist then i need to make a directory with that content type

1901073
width	height
mx form xmlns mx width 400 height 300 verticalscrollpolicy off

1901095
versioning	upgrade
i have joomla site which was upgrade to newest versioning

1901140
int	boolean	int	double
for most data types int decimals double dates and boolean there is a very strict format

1901162
udp	tcp
assume i have a reliable udp library and want to tunnel arbitrary tcp connections over it

1901162
udp	tcp
if the 4-byte id is new it makes a new connection to its local tcp socket and sends the data and spawns a new thread which receives any replies from the server and forwards them through the reliable udp connection with the appropriate id

1901212
int	boolean
you can easily pass int floating point numbers boolean objects it s all there

1901293
postgresql	mysql
the app has only been tested with mysql but it should fully work for postgresql with few adjustments

1901310
switching	screens
in my application 4 screens r there.when i switching to from one screens to anther screens 2 or 3 times at that time i want to go to 1st screens but previous screens r coming.how to close previous screens

1901346
put	get
i choose not to use active directory to put users in groups for access to different programs however as it means i have to contact it to get users added

1901381
margin	height
the html and body must besides having a height of 100 no default margin to avoid the footer being pushed further to below that amount of margin

1901411
put	get
just put that in a file called lib tasks testing.rake and it will get picked up when you next run rake test or other test-related task

1901492
versioning	upgrade
the upgrade patch cannot be installed by the windows installer service because the program to be upgrade may be missing or the upgrade patch may update a different versioning of the program

1901508
vb.net	vb6
when you say you ported from vb6 to vb.net that means using new concepts and adapting new methods of doing things

1901515
min	max
see this question maximum value of int - you can also use min in the places where the answers used max

1901519
entity-relationship	entities
which describes some ways to map entity-relationship model entities and relationship into the relational model tables and foreign keys

1901553
matplotlib	scipy
if this is for plotting scientific data i would use numpy and matplotlib combined in the scipy package

1901583
minimum	max	min	max
the numeric type of your variable is used to find a specialization of that template class that will provide the maximum value via function max and the minimum value via min in addition to several other facets of the type

1901585
submit	submission
i have a form that i submit after submission i reload the page and appears the following message

1901619
post	get
alternatively you can keep it an http post and have the server send a redirect in response to the post telling the browser to send an http get to a separate page

1901620
width	height
try setting an setting an explicit width and height on your image element

1901627
post	get
take a look at the post redirect get pattern

1901641
int	boolean
if it matches exactly the number you want return to your template or the extra variables are simple structures like int or boolean then i guess there is no point in explicitely returning them as this requires more work

1901689
urllib	httplib
this is an unfortunate side effect of the way urllib and httplib work

1901689
urllib	httplib
httplib urllib won t preemptively send authorization which is unfortunate

1901705
firefox	safari
so far i found this is best and works in ie 6+ safari 2+ firefox 2+

1901772
.htaccess	httpd.conf
this varies wildly depending on your web server but if you are using apache 2.2 put this in your httpd.conf or .htaccess

1901784
jar	war
i m packaging a war with a number of legacy jar dependencies in it for the sake of keeping this simple they can not possibly be altered or excluded from the deployed war

1901808
google-chrome	firefox
edit firefox and google-chrome are not using messagebox so technically they should be following the browser ui language settings though i don t have a french install to test it on

1901850
ubuntu	linux
i want to write a programme in python on linux ubuntu linux 9.10 that will keep track of how many key presses per second minute i make

1901903
google-chrome	safari
although the above answer seems to be correct it does not work in webkit browsers safari google-chrome

1901923
super	extends
if you do not want to extends a super class with the common code you can try to use delegation and wrap the common functionality let us call it subwidgetloader

1901970
ant	maven
i use build scripts to checkout from svn and download files into dirs that are mapped to subdomains like test.clientsite.com i work primarily in java and use ant and maven but i think you can use whatever scripting language you re familiar with

1902051
width	height
as a result some content that spans the entire height or width of a form will be cut off

1902077
range	max	range	min	min	max
allows empty string items up to three items change the 0 or 2 to alter the min max range

1902089
iboutlet	ibaction
4 attach iboutlet ibaction event handlers to your class and wire up all the button events touch up inside to your class event handler methods in ib

1902091
put	get
use the onitemdatabound event handler and make the link an asp.net hyperlink component that way you can then get the values you wish to put into the query string from the item.dataitem parameter and simply append then to the link.navigateurl property

1902104
union	distinct
union will only give you the distinct values concat will give you the union all

1902131
width	height
setting these values just messes up the scaling rather than resizing the form so you instead have to do calculations so you can set the normal width and height properties

1902164
nant	partcover
i had to go through a number of steps to finally get partcover working when calling it from a nant script

1902164
x86	64bit
next again if your os is 64bit and you use nunit or another test exe with partcover you will need to invoke a version explicitly compiled for x86

1902209
public	protected
you can override a protected method with a public one

1902209
public	protected
you can t override a public method with a protected one

1902270
filtering	grouping
i was thinking about adding a expression field to the permission table so that when accessing a certain resource the filtering is applied in fact it would be a little more complicated i would have to apply each filtering of the grouping to which the user belongs joined with an or

1902287
distance	polygons
the actual distance is not that important since it s calculated for each found polygons later but it would be a huge optimization to just do that calculation for the polygons that are close

1902297
umask	mkdir
this solution also has an issue with mode mkdir may fail when directory exists but doesn t conform to umask so you might want to check that as well

1902303
inherited	subclassing
inherited works because everywhere you can use the base class you can also use one of it s subclassing

1902404
pull	push
have your monitor thread sleep for 50 or whatever milliseconds lock the buffer and check for flags pull out what s needed unlock the list and push the data out

1902417
dictionary	map
if you are trying to map a key consisting of a set of values to a dictionary can be useful in memoization and dynamic programming you need to declare your own comparer to compare the contents of the keys rather than solely considering their references

1902452
folder	directory
anyway ntfs uses btree directory structures so you really could place all in one folder

1902456
hide	show
i would rather have some sort of client side pagination where we can hide show contents than going to the server and doing a databind every time

1902467
post	get
if you need help finding the problem you will need to post more specifics ideally the smallest example of real code for both ends of the connection you can get to exhibit the problem

1902474
put	get
the project url is when you create an account and put your issue into the prokect s bug tracker you will get help there

1902548
versioning	upgrade
to upgrade the app without any app restarts put a new versioning in the gac and just edit the string in the text file

1902576
post	put
i am importing various formats of piped data and my end goal is to try put the different data into a suitably normalised data structure but need to do some post processing on the data to put it into my model correctly

1902588
put	get
if you put the above in a file called log4j.properties and put that file in your classpath you should get tons of debug output from c3p0

1902601
typedef	typename
the typename keyword is presented to enable context-free nested typedef s

1902611
margin	height
what that site essentially does is make the footer stick beneath the browser edge and gives it a negative margin that has the same value as the footer s height

1902622
width	height
uchar image- imagedata + height image- widthstep + width

1902622
width	height
image is an iplimage width and height are just the corresponding widths and height of the image

1902633
nunit	mstest
i m also planning on axing mstest as i ve found it to be buggy and will use nunit instead

1902713
realloc	malloc
if you check the signatures of malloc realloc you will see that you can achieve correct memory allocations without dreaded pointer

1902792
opera	google-chrome
but in other browsers like mozilla google-chrome opera and so on it works

1902794
getter	setter
java has the concept of a bean which is a class with a no-arg constructor and getter setter methods

1902797
int	chars
well like operator is usually used with textual data with varchar or chars columns and you have numeric id column int

1902808
width	height
aspect is the aspect ratio of the frustum its width divided by its height

1902853
nexus	artifactory
i would err on the side of creating more artifacts instead of fewer and using a repository manager like nexus or artifactory to manage them

1902868
textview	imageview
i assume that you have custom layout for listview items and this layout consists of button and some other views - like textview imageview or whatever

1902868
textview	imageview
my custom_row.xml file is relativelayout with button of id button textview of id text and imageview of id image - just to make things clear

1902883
allocator	stl
it s probably better to defer to the clearer and more generic in terms of stl containers push_back rather than apply premature optimisation - if a profiler is highlighting a push_back as a hotspot then the most likely cause is the memory allocator which is best resolved through judicious use of reserve

1902888
google-chrome	firefox
i found identical results in firefox google-chrome and ie

1902926
hfs+	ntfs
hfs+ and ntfs both do which will cover a majority of users

1902994
min	max
write a loop that goes through every element and compares min max values with your arguments

1903042
free	malloc
in that same example we re using malloc so i assume we need to call free at some later point

1903042
touchescancelled	touchesended
should i free the individual points in touchesended touchescancelled

1903068
rel	attr
so it d just be #confirmdeleteitem attr rel this .parent attr id .dialog open

1903163
children	parent
for everything parent you have an undefined number meaning it can lie between 1 and something-bigger-than-one of children

1903209
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	transpose	multiplying	add
i need to be able to do the following matrix add subtract multiplying scalar multiplying inverse transpose and determinant

1903223
memcpy	memmove
as long as the array is modifiable you can use memmove to shift them but don t mistakenly use memcpy as memcpy is not meant for overlapping regions

1903224
tunnel	vpn
setup a quick vpn either tunnel other ppp over ssh see ssh s man page between your machine and a special machine within the corporation which is allowed to see the web then update your routing tables to route traffic through the vpn

1903224
tunnel	vpn
then use the tunnel to establish ssh vpn

1903264
post	get
for the search information you could use get instead of post

1903278
put	get
you could either put in a call to session.refresh inside your getperson method to always get the most current state from the database or you could expose that functionality through your own refresh method

1903296
post	get
one way around this is to use a get request instead of a post

1903296
post	get
as a side note - whether using a get or post you should think about whether you need to use the session in order to cache your results in order to prevent an unnecessary database call

1903296
post	get
edit there s some good info on forms post get requests and the differences between them here including info on the redirect after post pattern which addresses this issue

1903305
glfw	sdl
next there is the windowing system native ones win32 cocoa ... or libraries built on top of it qt glfw sdl sfml .

1903339
put	get
i have left joined the two tables and put a where clause to get me the y and null instances those are easy

1903344
for-loop	loops
otherwise throw in a before your for-loop a couple more prints and a check inside your loops just to more finely try to pin-point the source of the problem

1903479
children	parent
i m looking for a clean way to filter the children of a parent in a has_many relationship without hitting the database and thus reloading the db s view of the objects back into the app

1903479
children	parent
returns all the parent s children that have a attr value of foo in the db but because it hits the database again any children that have had their attr values set to foo before being saved will have their db values restored thus overwriting any changes

1903518
pull	push
the advantage of git over something like svn is that it utilizes a pull model instead of a push

1903528
google-chrome	safari
i would recommend going with mp4 because it s already supported on the latest version of safari and google-chrome

1903536
jpopupmenu	jmenuitem	hide	show
from here i would have a series of if statements that access my jpopupmenu object and perform the modifications necessary to hide show specific jmenuitem

1903590
width	height
i assumed that i only needed to set the layout height and layout width to something other than fill_parent but it still shows up as a black screen that completely fills the screen

1903594
many-to-many	one-to-many
my understanding is that you can make any many-to-many relationship into separate one-to-many relationships by adding an intermediate entity

1903599
folder	directory
i often set the initial directory to the user s my documents folder using calls to shgetspecialfolderlocation and shgetpathfromidlista from shell32

1903622
division	modulo
you can use the modulo and division to get your code

1903623
rar	zip
user uploads an archive file zip rar tar.gz tar.bz etc content - several image files

1903625
int	chars
chars const get_button_name int index

1903647
folder	directory
one place it uses the library is the my documents folder which at least by default is a library that includes both the user s documents directory c users whoever documents and the public documents directory c users public documents

1903734
hide	show
i have realized show hide function in css

1903737
profiling	instrumentation
i recommend doing some code profiling with instrumentation to figure out where this issue is occurring

1903752
initializer	class-method
you would have to initializer and wrap this proxy inside your class-method

1903761
folder	directory
without coping all the .svc files for every bindings that i whant to support since a url in iis is a folder or a virtual directory

1903831
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
sounds to me like you might want viewwillappear or viewdidappear

1903853
rss	feed
might be that you re using the wrong feed url and or have a rss plugin working against you

1903853
rss	feed
feed shows full text of posts and your sharing links feed rss doesn t

1903856
submit	submission
internet exploter will submit the text between the and tags while also submission the value of every other one in the form instead just the one you clicked

1903866
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
for things that might change every time the view is shown use viewwillappear or viewdidappear

1903933
int	double
it is bad programming to put a double into an int imho

1903945
width	height
for rectanimation by cannot be negative for height and width

1906276
range	max
you need to express the allowed range some other way by passing a max length

1906337
post	put
if your web service has a resource that isn t side-effect free it changes something in a database you should use put post or delete put for updates post for creating and delete for delete as the http specs state the gets shouldn t have side-effects

1906337
put	get
similarly put and delete should be safe to repeat if you get an error back or the network connection times out

also i took the liberty to send the warning and notice messages to stderr rather than stdout thinking you probably want to separate those

1906597
post	get
you access any post get data with the params hash

1906669
getter	setter
there is concept called property in objective c 2.0 which does similar task this basically add getter and setter method for the data

1906835
put	get
just get the data in json format and put it into the dom

1906899
width	height
so if i set the width and height of the new image the function must fit the uploaded image and mantain aspect ratio in the new width and height

1906935
put	get
when i put it in somewhere at random i get the error expression expected however when i look at the examples i am working from they do not look like expressions so i am very confused

1906979
children	parent
since the children are divs they will fill to the maximum width they can which so happens to be the width of the parent

1906979
children	parent
to get some of the parent to show around the children try setting the size of the children to something less than that of the parent or try adding padding to the parent

1907011
inherited	subclassing
the associations should be defined in the parent class so they can be inherited by the subclassing

1907046
opera	firefox
haven t tried it in firefox or opera

1907046
firefox	safari
you can quickly hide the options again by using the blur focus method in the ondblclick event and if this method works in firefox and safari i still think it s the best solution considering most people don t double click select boxes

1907050
direct3d	directdraw
as directdraw is now deprecated it s maybe preferable to use the direct3d functions

1907050
direct3d	directx
you can check the validity of this code by forcing the software rendering in the directx control panel by checking the software only checkbox in the direct3d tab

1907071
post	get
so this class will handle tcp handshake and will have methods that override what i send on http get and post like do_get and do_post

1907151
int	chars
so they had int for arithmetic and chars for string storage

1907151
int	chars
to this day i code almost all my c programs like as if there were no type other than chars and int

1907151
int	chars
this reflects that chars were meant for chars storage strings and int for arithmetic

1907151
int	chars
an int is always signed but with chars you can not be sure

1907171
int	double
as for int and double being added the int gets turned into a double immediately then the above applies

1907185
width	height
the resize then crop approach compute the aspect ratio of the source image and use it as a constraint to create an intermediate image which is going to be larger than the destination image either in width or height - finally crop the intermediate image to the destination dimensions

1907200
many-to-many	one-to-many
it s been a while since i ve played with many-to-many mappings i usually just map as two one-to-many relationships but i believe that if you use use a different construct for example a set which does not allow duplicates you should find that the behavior is different

1907205
innodb	myisam
mysql myisam engine supports full-text search but i will use innodb

1907214
int	double
floats and double are built-in types just as int is

1907216
expression-blend	silverlight
this will depend on what languages you are using for development but with a ui design tool like expression-blend you can develop a ui shell quite quickly in this case in wpf or silverlight

1907217
width	height
the height and the width was originally 100

1907225
swt	swing
if you used swing and now you want to start with swt this book shows you the differences swt eye for the swing guy

debian ubuntu med have ncbi-tools-bin and ncbi-rrna-data which install the necessary tools and databases in a couple of seconds

1907268
fasta	blast
instead of pondering tool support i would rather hack together a 10 line cgi script that executes blast with an input sequence onto the fasta files that you have and then see if the users aren t already happy with that

1907275
folder	directory
i could use new folder - linked resource but i would prefer to keep the projects independent of the directory structure the developer happens to be using

1907306
dmalloc	google-perftools
jemalloc ccmalloc mpatrol njamd dmalloc and even google s own google-perftools

1907312
getter	setter
it is quite verbose to have to explicitly define getter and setter for each variable

1907318
int	boolean
instead expressions in the java programming language that operate on boolean values are compiled to use values of the java virtual machine int data type

1907318
int	boolean
the above implies although i may have misinterpreted it that the int data type is used when operating on boolean but this is a 32 bit memory construct

1907340
rtp	sip
as sip is only use for session initiation you ll also need a library for audio streaming an rtp library

1907347
getter	setter
most ides provide a shortcut for generating the code eclipse right click - source - generate getter setter although i realise this is probably not the answer you are looking for

1907373
getter	setter
with netbeans just start typing get or set where the getter setter is to be replaced and call up auto complete ctrl+space it ll give you the option to generate the getter or setter

1907382
getter	setter
another if you have a lot of objects that need this is to write your own code generation tool that takes a base class and produces a wrapper with getter and setter

1907382
getter	setter
imo behavior classes with getter and setter are a code smell

1907430
equals	icomparable
implement icomparable see so icomparable and equals and then loop through each list building the required two output lists

1907442
integer	fractions
integer and fractions parts of each

1907452
uniq	comm

from your list you ve missed new and delete - some say never to use malloc and free

1907724
catransition	subviews
it s very simple to do using subviews and a catransition

1907741
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
malloc free calloc and realloc are all probably more advanced than what you need to worry about

1907742
getter	setter
that s the work of the ide to generate repetitive verbose code as getter setter

1907753
hide	show
that would allow your existing controls to be ignorant of the refreshing stage and allow incapsulation of the progress-visualization inside the adorner and the chunk of code that is required to show hide the adorner layer

1907765
onfocus	onblur
this works perfectly in ff but none of this works in ie when i say none i mean onblur and onfocus

1907772
google-chrome	firefox
in this case after clicking add new button ie will give exception unknown runtime error while google-chrome and firefox will work

1907798
width	height
keep in mind this only calculates the width and height you must call imagick yourself to actually apply these calculations

1907809

i ve scoured the net and found some solutions however it is hard to distinguish which is the correct latest .net 3.5 way given the colourful history of getter setter and managed c++

1907836
accessor	properties
in c++ cli you cannot control the accessibility of each accessor method separately when you use the automatic properties syntax

1907860
free	malloc
first of all you should never delete a malloc ed pointer and never free a pointer created with new

1907860

qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
qt python bindings pyqt is a flexible and mature framework that can certainly do that take a look at qgraphicsview and qgraphicsscene for example

1907913
wsimport	xjc
wsimport uses xjc from jaxb to create java files and the documentation here indicates that changing the character encoding in the xml file should suffice although i have not tried this

1907927
innodb	myisam
though it can be configured to talk to mysql automatically sphinx is really a separate tool to myisam or innodb

1907927
innodb	myisam
otherwise you can take a hybrid approach with myisam and innodb

1907927
innodb	myisam
put all your canonical data in the proper innodb tables and just use myisam for storing fulltext searchbait

1907927
innodb	myisam
you then have to make sure you update the myisam tables from any new text inserted into the innodb tables after a successful transaction

1907931
google-chrome	firefox
no problem in firefox and google-chrome also

1907934
addition	multiplication
just something for you to try but this would only make a difference for large matrices seperate out your addition logic from the multiplication logic in the inner loop like so

1907934
addition	multiplication
since multiplication is more expensive than addition you want to let the machine paralleliz it as much as possible so saving your stalls for the addition means you spend less time waiting in the addition loop than you would in the multiplication loop

1907942
xslt	xquery
as for whether to use xslt or xquery the proof is in the pudding xslt is better at transforms and xquery is better at queries

1907951
xslt	xquery
xslt and xquery do two different things

1907951
xslt	xquery
xslt actually relies on the functionality of xquery take a look at the tutorials on www.w3schools.com

1907968
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
as far as the malloc free calloc realloc these are just functions like any other commands in these particular cases functions included in the stdlib

1908051
width	height
if these width and height values are wrong fill in the correct ones and make the appropriate recalculations

1908051
width	height
if .card doesn t have fixed width height it may still work but i m less confident and you won t be able to get the bottom text to go to the very bottom of the card just below the top text

1908053
width	height
in the code below you first load the image then create a new image with the new width and height grab the graphics object from it and finally draw the old image onto the new image

1908073
force.com	salesforce
you can also negotiate with salesforce over the pricing but afaik there are not people building mass market applications based off of force.com largely because of these issues

i prefer to use google analytics since it would save me a lot of work but i would use another script or put in original code to get the following

1908318
pull	push
in my case my push provider pull rows from a db table and sends them at the time specified

1908326
stateless	stateful
you can create a stateful session bean that holds your cache and pass this bean to your stateless bean method

1908351

you can toggle show hide with the toggle function

1908452
put	get
the default operation of your browser is to put the values in the get form in the query string

1908452
put	get	post	put	post	get	submit	submission
instead of submission a get request submit as a put because you don t need a post you can do this with js with a friendly degrade to post and redirect to a get

1908455
getter	setter
this expects a property bill_sent with a getter and setter in the billdoc bean

1908481
hide	show
another option is to use the show and hide methods

1908497
gina	winlogon
once you create the proper gina dll you can register it here hkey_local_machine software microsoft windows nt currentversion winlogon ginadll

1908498
int	double
javascript doesn t have int all numbers are actually double

1908500
vb6	vba
and since vba vb6 doesn t have shared methods it doesn t really matter if you prefix with me or not

1908501
int	chars
the short answer is no since a single chars takes the same storage space as an int

1908524
int	double
ipv4 uses only 32bit addresses so javascript should be fine using double which gives you an 52bit int part

1908532
rtsp	sdp
it s an online radio stream rtsp in the sdp format

1908590
children	parent
i want to select all p s that are children of the clicked element s parent and remove the hidden class from them

i have vb6 dll which i am referencing in vb.net i am calling the following function in it

1908730
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
the uitableview is inside a uiviewcontroller inside a uinavigationcontroller inside a uitabbarcontroller all of which are being created programatically

1908733
xslt	xquery
both xquery and xslt rely heavily on xpath

1908733
xslt	xquery
the flwr syntax of xquery is quite intuitive if you have an sql back-ground imo xslt is the more powerful language when dealing with one input one output situations especially if the output will not be xml

1908733
xslt	xquery
if your input is based on more than one xml document you are pretty much stuck with xquery if your output is not xml based you are pretty much stuck with xslt

1908743
profiling	debugging
if you want to know this for debugging optimizing reasons look for a memory profiling

1908746
folder	directory
depends what you re looking to do exactly - you could create a virtual directory underneath your site that maps to the directory hence the folder will seamlessly slot in as if it was located in your application sites directory

1908747
width	height
i think you have to subtract 1 from height and width on for-loop

1908778
subclass	abstract-class
either it is an abstract-class which you must subclass and provider the implementation for a specific method which the controller will call whenever it needs its data

1908783
width	height
i just finished reading yslow recommendation to always define the image dimensions height width to improve html rendering performance

1908783
width	height
what i do know is that the height will never be larger than 200px and the width will never be larger than 300px

1908785
int	chars
for example add an int column to your table as well as the chars 36

1908876
xslt	xquery
the majority of the functionality of xslt 2.0 and xquery 1.0 overlaps and for the most part they are similar languages with different syntax a little like c# and vb

1908876
xslt	xquery
xslt is a lot more verbose but its templating features add a lot of functionality that can be fairly cumbersome to replicate in xquery particularly making small changes to node trees

1908876
xslt	xquery
unless you are using the static typing feature xquery is no more strongly typed than xslt

1908881
width	height
setting the max height and width of an image in the css will make the img tag resize the img based on the contraints but if you are using a backend scripting language like asp.net or php you an use their img libraries to scale the image on the server side an either save then to the hard drive to use later or resize on the fly

1908882
post	get
i am trying to get php to check that a form has been successfully submitted it post to itself and once this check is done then it would render a jquery modal box informing the user that the form has been successfully edited

1908922
addclass	removeclass
jquery has functions toggleclass removeclass and addclass

1908972

i think this would work and it would handle primes up to 2 the largest unsigned integer you can represent

1909061
post	get
i didn t want to post the whole thing that might just be too painful to look at but you get the idea

1909072
maven	pom.xml
if the open source project in question uses maven as the build system there is a pom.xml file in the root of the project and you have maven installed you can run mvn eclipse eclipse to build the project files for eclipse to use

1909075
put	get
as strawberry says jade doesn t put any restrictions on your database use so long as you can get at it from java

1909156
post	get
from the responses it seems that this is pretty common so i ll just post what i do to get around the issue for now

1909156
folder	directory
the way that i get around this issue is just to publish the files using clickonce to a folder locally and then ftp the files over manually excluding the crystalreport install directory that is created

1909182
width	height
the reason for specifying the width and height of images is that the browser will know exactly how much space the image will take up

1909184
versioning	upgrade
on this site you can download any versioning of the iphone ipod touch firmware thus no need to pay 10 for the upgrade

1909196

1909298
kohana	yii	cakephp	yii	cakephp	kohana	codeigniter	cakephp	codeigniter	yii	codeigniter	kohana

it also a good practice to hold the size of an image list that contains landscape and portrait format

1909385
sfdc	force.com
force.com is absolutely a paas offering making sfdc more than a crm saas player

1909397
onfocus	onblur
all event handlers in the web app are added with element.attachevent which means the onfocus and onblur properties which i believe are the ones i want are not set

1909411
client-side	server-side
in most instances client-side and server-side code are written in different languages javascript python so validation code has to be written twice

1909455
folder	directory
i need a script that will delete all files from a ftp directory and then upload a folder on my local machine to that same ftp location

1909470
stdout	stderr
it uses very simple interface and allow to get stderr and stdout

1909472

get a cheap server any 1u with a dual core processor and 512mb of ram will do and put it at your remote location

1909472
asterisk	ivr
configure your asterisk dialplan to receive calls from your sip account to your ivr menu

1909472
asterisk	ivr
now if you are looking to save money and have the most cost-effective setup for your remote ivr i would recommend throwing up a second asterisk server on site at your client location where the pots line comes in and throw away the pots line and just setup an iax2 trunk between your client location and your hosted server location

1909472
asterisk	elastix
if you would like to learn more about telephony and asterisk especially if you are going to use it for your business you may want to use a simple free asterisk distribution like trixbox ce elastix or asterisknow

1909484
post	get
you ll note if you click the button the web service is called and everything works even though post and get have been removed

1909484
post	get
if i alter the web.config and add the get and post protocols back in this error goes away - but then it allows access to the web service remotely using get which we don t want

1909544
fflush	gets
then try to fflush then activerecord nhibernate understandably gets unhappy that there are now two taxcalculators with

1909593
emacs	textmate
have the new window create a new emacs process not just a new buffer so that i can manage and navigate multiple projects similar to how textmate does it using one emacs process for each project

1909642

you are getting 5.97999954 which is basically the answer as best represented by ieee floating point which is a binary format that cannot exactly express every decimal number

1909757
puts	fflush
setting to a true value fflush the currently selected filehandle and puts it in unbuffered mode

1909760
mousemove	mouseup
it seems that mouseup events are only fired when they are not in conjunction with a mousemove

1909776
mouseup	mousedown
the mouseup event is binded when the user clicks mousedown this forces it to fire when the user lets go of the mouse button no matter how much it s moved

1909798
jobs	cron
i want to start using cron jobs

1909798
jobs	cron
our cron jobs are managed manually so we don t always remember which cron jobs we have scheduled to run

1909802
margin	height
the drawback i see in this method is that with css you have to know in advance the height of your content so that you can apply a negative margin of half this height to the floater

1909813
hide	show
note i don t need cases to show the scrollbar since the richtextbox handles that part fine after i hide it sigh

1909814
domcontentloaded	onload
i chose not to replace the body onload event on purpose instead i m using the new domcontentloaded event that the old browsers don t support if you need old browser support you can use any other load event to initiate prettyprint for example jquery

1909833
jobs	cron
the one thing that you could consider doing is using a different bootstrapper which would reduce the cost as you don t bootstrap the views which the cron jobs have no need for

1909840
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
it s used by uinavigationcontroller and uitabbarcontroller and many other properties rely on it for example the navigationcontroller property

1909842
submit	submission
i have thought of having separate datacontexts for the two tables doing submit on one before the other but the i guess it will be very slow submission for each row

1909884
restructuredtext	textile
some source code hosting platforms like github and bitbucket also will display markdown and similar text formatting languages textile restructuredtext â as html

1909889
hide	show
then inside your code when you want to change views just use the sethidden method to hide one and show the other

1909920
width	height
you can then position it absolute and set its top and left to 50 and the margin-top and margin-left to the negative half of its width and height respectively

1909997
google-chrome	firefox
tested in google-chrome firefox and ie

1910013

1910089
vbscript	jscript
asp with jscript is 100 times better cleaner simpler nicer than vbscript and makes my job a joy rather than a vbscript head ache

1910095
pop-up	dialog
i have a timer in my website which would pop-up a modal dialog with a count down timer count down for 2 minutes if the user is inactive for 20 minutes

1910107
ubuntu	linux
i d like it to work on linux ubuntu if possible

1910124
children	parent
it seems to me that when you use relationships in hibernate jpa that using relationships like onetomany can have a performance boost on reads because only one database call would need to be run to get a parent entity and all children entities

1910142
fish	zsh
note that in some shells you need to quote like zsh and fish

1910156
xstream	dom4j
i d recommend using hibernate with your pojos and use something like xstream or raw dom4j for doing your xml serialization to and from the pojos

1910175
wadl	wsdl
following on the comment above about wadl you can also try wsdl 2.0

1910184

as i understand it xml.sendandload uses post not get so i don t understand why this shows up in the log as a get

1910248
post	get
using a get request when the post

1910248
post	get
data in a get post hybrid format

1910403

i ve created a vsto 2.0 se add-in for outlook 2007

1910405
google-chrome	firefox
i found the following worked in ie firefox and google-chrome pc only don t have access to a mac just now

1910406
jobs	cron
cruisecontrol.net writes two log files one for debugging and one for its cron jobs

1910409
google-chrome	safari
the website that i m currently working on is having a few issues with webkit browsers google-chrome safari etc.

1910444
fast-forward	merge
i wondering whether i can cook something up with git-read-tree -m --trivial to get the fast-forward merge out of the way then do some magic with git-merge and a custom mergetool that simply copies the remote file to merge

1910460
client-side	server-side
so it s a good candidate for both client-side and server-side validation

1910542
integer	fractions
that means that the 16 upper bits of a glfixed represents the integer part and the fractions is the lower 16 bits divided by 65536

1910586
getter	setter
the text function works as both a getter and a setter

1910634
printf	fgets
if you plan to use ansi standard c you ll need fopen fgets and printf to do what you want

1910646
uiview	subviews
customize the uiview in ib to your hearts content and then you load it as a subviews in your view controller with something like this

1910665
width	height
here is the code used to set the width height of the form image

1910692
updatepanel	scriptmanager
i m trying to do the following i have only a scriptmanager and an updatepanel with empty contenttemplate on a page

1910698
public	protected	inherited	properties
a child class inherited all the protected public and published properties functions and procedures of its parent classes

1910722
calloc	malloc
when you pass the address of some data to a thread that data s lifetime becomes unrelated to execution of the parent thread so your only real choice is to allocate the memory for that data in way that decouples its lifetime from execution of the parent thread -- allocate with something like malloc or calloc

1910736
post	get
basically it s doing a post with get

1910808
qhash	qmap
qt also provides it s own map implementations - qmap and qhash

1910859
udp	rtp
matt h mentioned that rtp over udp packets can be checksum ed so that if they are corrupted they will get resent

1910859
udp	rtp
in asterisk for example you can enable disable checksums on your rtp over udp traffic in the rtp.conf configuration file with the following line

1910862
post	get
but as far as i can see this option would not be ideal because when the page first loads it has to do an ajax post get request

1910895
oncreate	setcontentview
i have an nocontentviewactivity which has no content view i did not call setcontentview in the oncreate of my activity

1910936
maven	m2e
try creating your eclipse project with mvn project m2e or use the maven import option under import project

1911035
width	height
the width of each character and height of each line for that matter is rounded to the nearest whole number of pixels with no error correction

1911063
richtextbox	textblock
rather than use a textblock take a look at using the wpf version of the richtextbox

1911068
post	get
i bet if you read that post you will get ideas about how to improve upon what you already have working

1911125
directx	gdi
in windows there seems to be at least two ways to get to the frame buffer gdi and directx

1911125
directx	gdi
the problem is that in order to use gdi or directx it seems that you must be running a gui application and then from this application you can call the appropriate gdi and directx functions

1911131
maven	m2e
using m2e my fallback in these situations is to do maven update dependencies and then maven update project configuration

1911136
width	height
problem was the variables for width and height were globals that got changed elsewhere in the application when the main form was resized they usually keep track of the onscreen displayed image but i had used the same variables inside this procedure to track the memorystream bitmap width and height

1911136
width	height
once i localized the width and height variables everything works as expected

1911148
jobs	cron
this approach may not work for you in your situation but you might use cron jobs to call a php script that loads the required information then caches it to a more speedy data source xml or database

1911151
csla	.net
i am using mvc .net in a distributed environment with csla and i can reference httppostedfilebase from one of my web layers eg website.mvc but i cannot reference httppostedfilebase from a separate layer lets call it otherlayer.web

1911175
gif	png
of course you need to swap the mime-type in case the file is a png or gif

1911215
postgresql	mysql
in this context mysql databases are analogous in function to postgres-schemas insomuch as postgresql lacks off-the-shelf cross-database functionality that mysql has

1911215
postgresql	mysql
in summary postgresql fully supports schemas but lacks some functionality mysql has with databases while mysql doesn t even attempt to support true schemas

1911277
super	extends
basically super corresponds to write semantics and extends corresponds to read semantics

1911296
filtering	grouping
one option is to create a new grouping or filtering in vs.net parlance to make it obvious which grouping of files are affected by the particular settings

1911305
for-loop	arrays
maybe in a arrays where all element are there and start at zero 0 to x it would be faster to use a for-loop

1911365
inherited	properties
if you inherited from the object now then all you need to do is to inherited from your complex object and change one piece of code as well as add the new properties and your done

1911423
memcpy	strncpy	memcpy	strcpy	strcpy	strncpy
also x needs to be null terminated or you need to replace strcpy with strncpy or memcpy and pass in a length

1911459
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i m mainly interested in google-chrome safari and firefox and other standards-compliant browsers

1911482
spaces	linefeed
to include tabs cr or linefeed in attribute values without them being turned into plain spaces by the attribute value normalisation algorithm you must encode them as character references

ant	emma
i created an ant build file specifically for the build chain target with help from the emma doco

1911685
vmware	virtualbox
vmware and virtualbox allow multiple cores to be configured and 64-bit guests

you will have to append as opposed to assign the name of your submit callback function to the field #submit of the button you use for submission the entire form

1916483
free	malloc
allocation of memory on the stack is very fast - it just involves moving the stack pointer whereas dynamic allocation deallocation using new delete or malloc free is fairly expensive especially in multithreaded code that doesn t have a heap per thread

1916511

1917084
dictionary	map
even if you don t want a full library consider finding a map dictionary hashtable for general use

1917118

1917175
int	double
for example with int_of_float ocamlc will compile it into a call of some c function but with ocamlopt it will compile it into some special assembler opcode that transform double to int

1917850
rss	feed
i m running wordpress on mamp and for some reason i get an error on all of my rss feed saying

1917856

1917866
division	subtract
then run you count id group by division on this recordset may be a temporary query and subtract the dummy record from the count so the select clause would be

1917918
gina	winlogon
hosting .net in winlogon where gina dlls are loaded is probably not such a hot idea- could cause all sorts of conflicts if something else decides to do the same thing and if you trash winlogon you re not getting anywhere with that pc

1917953
google-chrome	firefox
the code below works in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie

1917976
int	chars
if possible php treats all incoming vars as an int first of all so if the text files are of predictable length 24 12 12 chars that i can see then 0000000974 will be correctly parsed as being the int 974 without having to resort to trim

hash	salt
require the user send a hash a unique id for the user a timestamp and a secret salt along with a plaintext timestamp

1918317
hash	salt
the plaintext timestamp lets you validate that you didn t give them permission last tuesday the timestamp in the hash lets you validate that the has belongs with that message the uid in the has ensures that the hacker didn t jack the request from someone else and the secret salt in the hash ensures that they didn t generate it on their own

1918478
width	height
for all integer zoom levels in between you would have an integer width and a non-integer height of this text

1918478
width	height
but text output doesn t work this way you can t set the width of a line of text and have the system compute the height of it

1918478
int	chars
the exttextout api call takes an optional int array of chars origins as the last parameter

1918478
int	chars
multiply all chars positions by this scale value and round them to the nearest int

1918478
width	height
this is untested and may contain some errors or oversights but hopefully this would allow you to smoothly scale the text width independently of the text height

1918515
multiplying	add	multiplying	multiplication
so pointlessly multiplying by zero is just the first step in the following steps the multiplication is actually needed to add the new digits to the end of the number getting accumulated

1918567
jax-ws	jax-rs
get familiar with ejb 3.1 servlet 3.0 jpa 2.0 the java persistence api hibernate being one implementation jax-ws jax-rs maybe jsf this may still be controversial but i think that the new servlet 3.0 api makes any advice about web frameworks irrelevant so.

1918764
facade	memento	composite	memento
finer-grained patterns like state command factory method composite decorator facade flyweight memento template method are perhaps more common in group 1 code but often several design patterns apply not to an object as such but to different parts of an object whereas in group 2 code patterns tend to be present on a one pattern per object basis

1918770
width	height
when you resize the window you will want to work out which dimension width or height has most effect on the scale and take the others one - this will stop the object expanding too much
