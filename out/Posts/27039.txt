fadein	hide
another alternative would be to simply hide the new element before calling fadein as so

20643362

to change the brightness which would be on the slider use hslcolor.luminosity in the equation and it would probably be best to use the colorwheel class instead of the image unless you feel confident adjusting the image brightness based on a double int attached to the slider

superclass	subclassing
afterwards you can use findviewbyid to find your drawers set them up in the superclass and then just handle your subclassing s views from within it s own class

20643971
setcontentview	findviewbyid	oncreate	findviewbyid	oncreate	setcontentview	superclass	subclassing
your views are likely returning null because your running your superclass s oncreate before your subclassing s - therefore setcontentview hasn t been called yet so findviewbyid won t work

superclass	subclassing
since java 5 a method in a subclassing may return an object whose type is a subclassing of the type returned by the method with the same signature in the superclass

20645489
superclass	subclassing
yes it is possible to have an overriding method return a type that is a subclassing of the superclass method s return type

20645489
superclass	subclassing
this works because a circle and a square are draw s so even if you have a superclass reference and you don t know or care which subclassing you really have you still are guaranteed to get back a draw

also strlen and strcpy should be implemented with perhaps more modern unshortened names

20645658

one solution is to make both members private and provide both a setter function and a getter function for the next pointer

aim	instant
my aim was to get that to work properly which i did so by installing the oracle instant client

20646832

it would be quite possible to determine the xml fragment you need to represent your new user id parameter and then write code to fetch each report definition insert the new fragment in the appropriate place and write a new copy of the report definition to the server ready to be tested

20646878
google-chrome	firefox
since your code works fine in firefox and google-chrome all i can suggest now is to try different locators

20646903
repo	egit
i m using eclipse juno and egit plugin to manage my repo

20646910
setcontentview	findviewbyid
i don t see setcontentview called anywhere in your activity which would mean that findviewbyid returns null

20646910

note that et.constructor is a properties inherited by the prototype

20647083

20647152

20647184
int	double
that s why you re getting back a double not an int - that s simply what lives in the file

openssl	gnutls
what worked for me is using a gnutls port for windows instead of openssl and removing any customization of tls-program

20647193
openssl	gnutls
i suggest using gnutls before trying openssl it probably comes first in the defaults for a reason

20647211
multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract	subtract	add
therefore when reading an instruction from a the program we can see that different parts of it are used at different times read memory addresses used cycle 1 the type of operation add subtract multiplying would be used in cycle 2 and the store memory address would be used in cycle 3

i can flip it using the following code in the ondraw method but it messes up the ontouchevent method

maven	pom.xml
in the maven pom.xml file you have to add the resource directory so you don t have to add it to the build-path in eclipse manually

20647276
put	get
when i put this into a loop i don t get the right results - it seems that the return for each loop is the same so i get 10 identical values back from getclosestmatch

20647289
textarea	textbox
also htmlcode inside a textarea is standard not possible so you should probably make it a div with an textbox inside if you need that

20647303

so in my opinion using hide method and creating a new object again to show the form is not the right move

20647832
put	get
or in other words how does the output of fs.readfile get put into the data argument

20647838
submit	submission
you might want to do it in a more automated way but just as an example to disable form submission you can subscribe to the form submit event and trigger event.preventdefault if it s in a state in wich you want to cancel the submission

the 6th parameter to mssql_bind is a boolean the 7th is an int

to anyone that is looking for the answer to this later as sammitch suggested using the rss feed is a great way to do this here is a code snippet below

20648142
libs	library-project
the only reason why i see someone would go for a library-project instead of a jar is because the libs contains resources images layouts strings dimens etc.

20648142
libs	library-project
currently the only reason i use a library-project is when i want to modify some parts of the libs or if i make frequent changes to it

20648144

20648209
width	margin
what i did was use margin and width for the animation to keep it centered

20648222
hide	show
the next step is you may be able to use this in a variable expression which you can then use to in conditional formatting to hide or show report elements

20648278
post	put
i m then sending it to a rails backend using a post put request

20648330

if you really really need to do it i believe the only way you can do is to do the serializable deserialization by yourself and return the object as an octet sequence or string

20648430
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
i have experimented with qgraphicsscene and qgraphicsview and i can make rectangles and text scale

20648441

for example you can dynamically extends a copy of a base object in a constructor function to push the super and subclassing functionality into same object rather than rely on prototypical inherited

20648522
folder	directory
i used to have the spefic directory as folder file instead of website folder file but when i did that the error page would have this line as well

seaborn	matplotlib
finally my cursory looks at seaborn and prettyplotlib lead me to believe that they re more akin to mpltools in that they provide convenience functions that build off of matplotlib

xml-conduit	hxt
commonly used haskell xml libraries- xml-conduit hxt haxml

20664189
subtraction	addition
i know that i can use specialization of the implementation template class to specialize however this will result in a lot of code duplication as there are a number of operators such as matrix-scalar addition subtraction .

20664190
ssl	https
from what i researched so far this is not trivial since the first request connect is done without encryption over http on port 443 - using regular server socket proceeding with tunneling to ssl over http https which needs to be handled by a secured server socket taken from slserversocketfactory

20664231
emma	jacoco
i am using jacoco emma and idea to collect the metrics from inside intellij i am getting the following

20664250

if i can get some free time i might try this and post it here

20664318
slideup	slidedown
you might want to try using some of jquery s slidedown slideup or slidetoggle methods

20664318
slideup	slidedown
jquery will interpolate and animated from 0 to this defined value in slidedown and the reverse in slideup

20664321
public	protected
you can reuse this completely just change a few namespaces and at one place from protected to public and it builds and works

20664335
width	height
i m trying to change the size of the coding4fun roundbutton i realised that the width and height properties does not work

20664356

20664454
implements	extends
you can implements your own by extends org.springframework.context.support.abstractmessagesource and injecting your dao or using your hibernate domain class es to resolve the messages and then registering it as your messagesource bean in your application context

20664462
focuslistener	listeners
i tried finding listeners on the table element and the tableviewer element but with no luck i tried focuslistener on the table and selectionchangedlistener on tableviewer

20664463
width	height
probably something similar would happen on the right side of the image but i always use the full width of the image and only narrow the height and y position of the subregion

20664466
implements	extends
as with most things in the standard library the random functionality defines concepts that can be implements by a user to extends the library

20664522
google-chrome	firefox
so in google-chrome and firefox i can launch the inspector with cmd + alt + i

20664538
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
in practical terms google-chrome doesn t ask and neither does safari but firefox will present the user with a popup box confirming the redirection

20664552
setinterval	settimeout
to achieve async behavior you must either use settimeout setinterval or the winjs scheduler in windows 8.1 to do async work on the ui thread or use a web worker for a background thread and tie its completion via a postmessage into a promise

20664586
getter	setter
i want to override the setter and getter and find the class of an objc_property_t without doing it individually for each property

20664586
getter	setter
this is an example of how i want to override the getter and setter - if there is a better way let me know

20664586
getter	setter
well i am using nskeyedarchiver - i don t want to manually override every single setter and getter

makes sense only for prepare and execute methods

20664683
cos	ceil
what does it means because cos and ceil is file function

20664706
put	get
to get it running you basically have to add only the intended program logic and put all the pieces together

20664712
hide	show
you can use method show and hide

20664738
viewdidload	viewdidappear
since - void viewdidload is called before - void viewdidappear bool animated

20664775
rss	feed
it s a old thread but here is my solution that a use to extract information from a rss feed in order to sort by title

20664796
hide	show
that s because you re selecting every .hot_post_title each time you show or hide it

20664881
min	max
i m getting an i o 998 error my task is to rewrite numbers from file to array and find max and min values

20664888

a persistence unit may be packaged within one or more jar files contained within a war or ear as a

20664947
jar	war
war or application jar file within the ear the persistence unit of that name defined at ear

20664947
jar	war
level will not be visible to the components defined by that ejb-jar war or application jar

20664960
hide	show
however if i tried the invert aka show it on start and hide it on hover it works perfectly as intended making space when it reshows itself

20664963
getter	setter
if you are binding to a business object then you could create a getter setter property for an un-encrypted name

20664973
button	checkbox
from a listview control when checkbox are checked and a button is clicked from outside the listview i need to be able to delete the items that have been checked

20664987
hide	show
i want to dive the list because i want to be able to toggle between hide and show using jquery

20665015
getter	setter
this would of course also require getter setter functions for the private members of the class that are accessed within that function

20665021
udp	tcp
i really like easily scripting my basic http reverse proxy needs but the lack of any udp or tcp reverse proxy is causing problems--i constantly have to remember that foo.com 49182 is mysql instead of just using mysql-test.foo.com

20665083
hide	show
show hide elements based on id from select dropdown javascript and

20665083
hide	show
jquery show hide text field based on a dropdown selection value and a radiobutton

20665111

for me it s working fine on google-chrome but not working on firefox and the reason i found is that you have missed this

20665113
pull	push
to transfer files between repositories use hg push and hg pull assuming you have commited files on one of these repos like this

20665121
ssl	https
when we had same issue we purchased ssl certificate from one of those providers and after installing it on server we were able to make https requests to our services with no problem

20665128
integer	fractions
i m not sure how you will want to have your collection store things however given that the numerical types that support fractions won t be able to hold your result unless you want to define a big integer plus small fractions type or store your numbers as strings

20665143
hex	binary
here s an example of converting the text from hex to int and binary

20665151
rcharts	nvd3.js
i m writing a chart in rcharts using nvd3.js

20665182
x86	64bit
check your computer s system information to see whether you need a x86 32-bit or a x64 64bit version of the program the contact the software publisher

20665279
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox do not have this behavior

20665324
children	parent
the serialised copy of the parent contains a list of children etc etc

20665330
submit	submission
for some reason though after one submission every time you refresh the page it submit the form with the previously submitted data the browser warns of this before refreshing the page

20665331
hash	md5
what we do is we calculate an md5 hash on the byte array before we send it then send that text value with the byte package to the host which then calculates another md5 hash again based on the bytes and does a comparison between the expected md5 hash sent by the client and the one freshly calculated on the host

20665338
width	height
you are grabbing window content height and width which is page instead and not your window

20665338
width	height
you should use mainwindow height and width

20665450
versioning	upgrade
next step will be to perform an upgrade to a newer versioning

20665475
next	except
this next part of code is where i am inserting my select answers into my ms sql table note everything is populating in my ms sql table properly except for my animalcommoner variable

20665529
for-loop	loops
additionally is there a way i can change the while loops into a for-loop

20665531
range	max	range	min	min	max
however there s various spin controls that return decimal types and allow you to set min max range and they reject any bad text etc

20665536
setinterval	settimeout
settimeout and setinterval are creating a new timer each time you call them

20665537
folder	directory
there is no standard function but just delete the contents of the .cn1 directory in your home folder and you should be set

20665550
uninstall	upgrade
i also considered running an uninstall but this would mean that the upgrade could not be fully rolled back since the application would have been uninstalled

20665597
for-loop	loops
but whether you make a code like the second for-loop you can reach better results in special cases and second loops can overperform the first one on some achitectures

20665600
post	get
it couldn t be limit of the post - because in this case you will never get any information on the server and all request would be cancelled

20665631
submit	submission
with that approach your page will not the contaion a form to submit however this will not prevent it from submission on refresh

20665685
for-loop	arrays
and one to add n rows though this doesn t prevent user from undersizing the arrays which will throw an error in the for-loop

20665695
put	get
if i try to get another field i don t know if this is correct i put this

20665730
post	get
you need to log in the user you want to post for get their access token and secret then use consumer key secret user access token and user access secret to post on their behalf

20665747
google-chrome	firefox
you can open the url in a browser google-chrome firefox works for me that is used in to view more properties that data contains such as data.kind data.nickname and data.occupation

20665750
post	get
i am trying to test using both get and post

20665750
post	get
for both get and post i am invoking the apis as

20665750
post	get
however if i comment out get and keep post i am not able to get any results just blank

20665762
versioning	upgrade
maybe you just need to upgrade the api versioning to be able to use it in your trigger

20665781
feedback	review
i am facing problem in designing a review feedback box

20665781
feedback	review
i don t want to use overflow hidden because review would be varying according to user s feedback

google-chrome	firefox
using firebug in firefox or google-chrome dev tools in google-chrome you can see inspect http traffic data in the network tab

20665907
client-side	server-side
-has to be performed server-side my customer would prefer to keep client-side scripting at a minimum

20665909

20666100
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
after you set these properties they become available to your amazon-web-services elastic beanstalk application as system properties

20666132
getter	setter
and you can create your own getter and setter like

20666161
xlsx	xlsm
if you are using a later version your extensions will be xlsm or xlsx

20666186
cpu	processors
you cannot read from an actor s variables directly inside a future because in general that future could be running on any thread on any processors core and you don t have any memory barrier there to force the cpu caches to reload the value from main memory

20666195
width	margin
percentage values for the margin padding properties are always relative to the containing block s width even in the case of margin-top and margin-bottom - from the 2.1 spec

20666205

20666295
build.gradle	gradlew
my gradlew configuration build.gradle configuration

20666347
public	protected
i don t know which group that would be in python but it most other languages it d be group 3 0 would be the whole string 1 would be public private or protected 2 would be class or interface 3 would be your class name.

20666355
for-loop	arrays
you have to iterate over the arrays using a for-loop and check the value for each index

20666359
ubuntu	linux
however i am uncertain on how to implement the features using qt c++ on ubuntu linux

20666405
post	put
i ve felt like i ve explained the situation fairly well but any code you think i should post i can put up here

20666433
dictionary	map
for example to get that dictionary just use the grouper recipe or to group into pairs then use a dictionary comprehension to map either k v in those pairs to next k list v

20666448
oncreate	setcontentview
just don t forget to add setcontentview ... in oncreate

20666485
getter	setter
one method the getter returns a value of the property type and one method the setter accepts a value of the property type

20666485
getter	setter
there is no requirement that the getter and setter actually get or set anything

20666487
getter	setter
this is a property it defines a getter and a setter

20666487
getter	setter
the getter and setter are methods

spaces	delimiter
the filenames are printed with the given printf format which lists a numerical timestamp followed by a spaces followed by a null delimiter

20666536
for-loop	loops
edit - for-loop version with proper loops execution count

20666549
g++	gcc
but if i compile it with g++ -o run simple.cpp instead of gcc it works

20666555
vim	emacs
first of all this is not a question on emacs vs vim

20666555
vim	emacs
having read many advantages of emacs and vim especially the ability to do almost anything without using the mouse i want to use a similar typing editing scheme in my eclipse ide

20666555
vim	emacs
i m aware that there are plugins available for eclipse to change the editing style to emacs or vim emacs+ vrapper to name a few..

20666555
vim	emacs
since i plan to continue using eclipse the various advantages of vim and emacs like small memory foot print vim elisp scripting availability on different platforms configurablity etc are all lost

20666555
vim	emacs
so i would like to have an objective comparison of the benefits disadvantages of only the text editing styles of emacs and vim

20666598
put	get
get put operations you may implement reversible encryption on your payload like rijndael

20666602
getter	setter
the best way to describe properties is in terms of the idiom of getter and setter methods

20666619
google-chrome	firefox
i have tooltipster working perfectly in firefox google-chrome on mac and windows various os and versions but it will not work in ie 8 or 10 on 2 different laptops using two different pages

20666637
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
but it doesn t work when called in viewwillappear viewdidappear or even in a dedicated method i created that get s called once the purchase is made

20666684
treemap	treeset
i just mention it because using treemap treeset etc

keyevent	onkeydown
or you can try to use the onkeydown method see here onkeydown int keycode keyevent event as below

20666712
comparator	comparable
create a comparable object to store your time and value or create a comparator for the sortedset

20666728
mouseup	mousedown
mousedown is blurring the input while mouseup is triggering the click

20666755
hash	md5
so what i would like to do is for every row generate md5 hash from username in that row

20666839
vim	emacs
my advice use your ide for work as you have to anyway and try out vim as well as emacs in parallel maybe for recreational tasks a little scripting blogging whatever

20666949
width	height
adjust width height of iframe to fit with content in it

20666957
post	get

20666962
google-chrome	firefox
this works in node.js google-chrome and firefox

20666975
google-chrome	firefox
tried in firefox and google-chrome

20666979
int	chars
in the last example there is no addition so the chars is not converted to its int representation

20666984
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
internet explorer even ie 11 renders a simple table differently to every other browser i ve tried google-chrome firefox safari and i can t figure out why

20666997
versioning	upgrade
will it cause issues with other developers when this is stored in versioning control and they haven t upgrade to this versioning yet

20667025
google-chrome	firefox
the engine and examples should work in all modern browsers google-chrome 7+ firefox 3.5+ internet explorer 9+ etc although it might run quite slow in some browsers on certain platforms

20667034
int	chars
when you perform an operation on a chars type with an int java will take the decimal value of that chars and use it for the operation

20667056
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
works in the latest versions of google-chrome firefox and safari

20667078
for-loop	arrays
i know that i have to create an arrays and then use a for-loop to save and print it but i don t know how

20667078
for-loop	arrays
what i want to do i so make a simple currency converter use a for-loop with an arrays to save the converted input and display it

20667096
pop-up	dialog
i can not for the life of me figure out why but my google account intent isn t showing up in a pop-up dialog

20667097
int	chars
therefore it will convert the chars 1 to its aschii value int value which is 49

20667097
int	chars
however when you pass just the 2 as a parameter it will simply print the chars as is because it has no reason to be parsed into an int like in the other cases

20667111
google-chrome	firefox
this works beautifully in firefox 17 google-chrome 32 and ie 11

20667149
hash	md5
3 as third example let s say you have an old user database and your passwords are hash using md5

20667175
put	get
if you want to get fancy you can put a shebang on the top and set the execution bit using chmod

20667180
button	checkbox
hi i am able to render the boolean column as a jtogglebutton but if i keep the button pressed i am seeing the checkbox instead of the button

20667208
google-chrome	firefox
if the functionality and behaviors are the same across all javascript engines used by modern user agents such google-chrome ie firefox etc. i d rather use the simpler version

20667219
subtract	add
add both values and subtract 578

20667225
required	placeholder
the trick address the placeholder text add a required class to required inputs and use the after pseudo element to add an appropriately colored asterisk

versioning	upgrade
i am using jquery 1.7.2 and can not upgrade to higher versioning

20667270
hide	show
using jquery i have a click event set on .top that hide .top-wrap and show .bottom-wrap

20667283
post	get
on top of that if i change the form action to get instead of post the parameters show up just fine

20667338
dlsym	dlopen
don t have static dependencies on the shared library open it using dlopen and get the functions with dlsym

20667352
pull	push
however if you are working with collaborator or you have multiple clones of the repository for example at work and at home it may create additional complications when you ll try to push or pull from the outdated copy

20667370
folder	directory
i include the native dlls by having them in a project s root directory as a linked file pointing to a lib folder flagging them as content with alwayscopy set

20667391
vim	emacs
a big difference that you will notice is that vim uses modes which makes it have a high initial learning curve while emacs is modeless and you can use it like a normal text editor notepad but with added functionality

20667391
vim	emacs
i personally don t like holding control down to move around in emacs where in vim you escape to normal mode and use hjkl to move around

20667467
multiplying	add
you can the multiplying this by the first constant and add 1

20667482
inherited	properties
i have added inherited tpt on some classes customer person and since the generated metadata from the customer entity does not have the person properties i cannot add them to the metadatastore type

20667487
scheme	racket
you can find stream-based soe code here though in scheme not racket

20667491

if you absolutely need grunt-contrib-watch then make sure sass caching is activated using the gruntjs task

20667520
put	get
put your items in the main report and then get the description out by using a subreport

20667542
folder	directory
both folder are in the same directory and i take that path via the command line

20667548
versioning	upgrade
if it would be better to do this in vs2008 old versioning and then upgrade or directly downloading it in vs2010 i am not sure you will have to try that

20667557
for-loop	loops
as for how to tell how many steps it took you should have an extra counter initialized to 0 outside of the nested for loops and inside the inner nested for-loop you should increment it

20667631
multiplication	modulo
so you can calculate 2 7830457 using multiplication in a loop where you take modulo after each multiplication

20667650
versioning	upgrade
usr local opt ruby is actually a symlink to the current versioning of ruby that homebrew automatically updates when you do an upgrade

20667652
google-chrome	firefox
f12 works for google-chrome or firefox too and it s easier to press for sure

20667679
client-side	server-side
however generating the div s server-side would obviously reduce client-side computation and code size

20667693
equals	compareto
apart from equals method try compareto method it will work fine

20667701
post	get
if your only goal is to use one view model for the get action and another different view model for the post action then you should really just stop and ask yourself seriously why you need to do that

20667715
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
the certificate is enhanced and valid as you can see in google-chrome firefox safari opera ...

20668154
getter	setter
they should be private with getter and setter

20668179
versioning	upgrade
as it s very hard to debug i tried to upgrade to a new jetty versioning but it was the road to hell

20668268
getter	setter
one of the features that s been requested is making them fieldname-agnostic -- passing in fieldnames as parameters rather than having them bound to specific getter setter in the backing bean

20668300
google-chrome	firefox
basically the buttons are positioned fixed within each div which works in google-chrome but in explorer and sometimes firefox they just show up as gigantic buttons at the bottom of the page as if they are not within a div element

20668315
post	get
i started playing a bit with the admin but occasionally when making get or post requests i get the following message operationalerror at some route unable to open database file

uitableview	reloaddata
my uitableview calls reloaddata when the orientation of the device changes makes sense since the number of cells displayed changes is called in layout subviews as far as i could understand from the documentation however this is problematic for me because i am performing a download in the background and i don t want some of the files to suddenly appear

20678225
uitableview	reloaddata
the problem is the uitableview automatically calls reloaddata when the user changes orientation so the cells fill with the information from the json before the downloaded files finished downloading

20679139
getter	setter
i m not sure if this topic will be a duplicate but while searching for an answer to the topic i found just three topics here here and here somehow related to the topic getter setter vs public member without pointing into the direction as our debate went

20679139
getter	setter
my co-worker argued against this solution because with that solution the door is opened to replace the object also when using a reference-returning getter while bypassing any setter

20679139
getter	setter
with the getter setter the internals are hidden encapsulation

20679139
width	height
also possibly ugly internal names with prefixes and or suffixes are covered with a nice and easily describing name internal int m_x m_y - external width height yep people do things like that making code using the class more clear and easier to understand

20679139
getter	setter
providing getter setter the class-consumer can be sure that things are done in the way they should be done public member for me only would make sense for simple types as int ect

20679139
getter	setter
i think the first two points are mainly arguments from the classic getter setter vs public member discussions

put	get	getter	setter
for me it looks like you are searching for a ways to set one pair of getter and setter for all your variables inside your bean so if you are to lazy them for alle your data in your managed bean you can implement java.util.map into the bean then you can overwrite the put and get methode like this

20684517
hash	md5
even md5 which is not a good hashing function to hash passwords because it s not secure anymore is good to hash url

20684537
inherited	properties
your application will require that the parent window functionality be defined in a base class while leaving the opportunity to inherited and customize the child part for each specific window type therefore we will create a base generic viewmodel to define all the common reusable functionality while also defining a generic child properties

20684537
post	get
i ll finish my post when i get some more time

20684547
floating-point	integer

now i am wondering if it s possible to perform serializable and deserialization on that - i d like to recreate all the screens in the same hierarchy

20684750
client-side	server-side
but actually i d have to say never do client-side login validation and never do login validation with an unencrypted password not even server-side

20684770
post	get
that way you get all the ajax and unobtrusive functionality loaded in the main view and you call it when your partial view is loaded so everything works out without the double post

20684789
debian	linux
it also puts them into one file note that i tested on debian linux not mac

20684790

a meta-object contains information about a class that inherited qobject class name superclass name properties signals and slots

20684816
qstring	qobject
needless to say this will only work for qobject so not for qstring etc

20684849
vb.net	vb6
even if you could get all of the error messages i would say it s not the best way to judge the amount of time it will take you to port from vb6 to vb.net

20684849
vb.net	vb6
they are very different environments vb6 being essentially an sta com environment while vb.net is just another clr language and these differences can manifest in unexpected ways

20684898
difftime	mktime
the best solution for now seems to be using the classic localtime mktime difftime trifecta in c++

20685068
mouseup	mousedown
the library will be detecting the mouseup event and zooming on the marker that was selected by mousedown i imagine

20685151
width	height
if that is an issue you can control the height width of the individual regions on the ods region statements but that may or may not cause an issue in your results since only some sas outputs will scale the output to fit the space

20685203
d3.js	leaflet
i m using leaflet 0.7.1 and want to draw a radial menu like openstreetmap s id editor on top using d3.js

i m afraid i m confused by the combination of how to build a jar -file to be used in a war -file to be deployed on a tomcat using gradle and i don t know from which of these parts my problems originate

20685320
folder	directory
as to where to place assets assets that are to be private for the current package are placed in the web directory and assets that are not specific to the current package or are to be shared with other packages belong to the folder asset

20685404
floor	sqrt
you re missing some dividers if a b c and b is a divider of a then c will also be a divider of a but c might be greater than floor sqrt a for example 3 floor sqrt 6 but divides 6

20685404
floor	sqrt
then you should put your floor sqrt n in a variable and use the variable in the for otherwise you recalculate it a every operation which is very expensive

20685460
draggable	droppable
accordingly to jquery ui docs the selector element that becomes droppable will then accept to be dropped on by draggable elements in order to be able to use ui droppable functionality towards other elements these other elements must be ui-draggable more info at jquery-ui droppable

20685568
button	checkbox
for this i use the default button and you are using checkbox they should both work

20685603
for-loop	loops
what we have left no longer really makes good use of a for-loop though--we might about as well use a while loops

20685623
screens	tablet
this happens on the larger screens even though it does seem to drop the columns without any trouble once i hit my tablet breakpoint which is 768px 9

20685630
hide	show
i have a form with 2 radio buttons and when either button is toggled it show or hide a certain fieldset

20685645

you then need to infer whether the link refers to an rss feed

20685658
rss	feed
a url like might be an rss feed

20685681
versioning	upgrade
note that you should also upgrade reinstall scipy if you use it so the numpy and scipy versioning correspond to one another

20685705
portrait	landscape
one for portrait and one for landscape

20685705
portrait	landscape
the images with the 2 on the end are the landscape ones and the ones without are the portrait ones

20685705
width	height	portrait	landscape
i was told to put the width and height values in the portrait ones and then by default it would take the ones without values as the landscape one

20685718
for-loop	loops
the inner for-loop then loops on n-1 elements

20685752

cloudant	couchdb
due to many improvements to couchdb and that cloudant has more features than vanilla couchdb my suggestion would be to use a c++ http library to communicate with cloudant

20685887
autoresize	scrollbar
but this native autoresize method is so wrong because when i resize the application the horizontal scrollbar is shown

20685887
autoresize	scrollbar
ofcourse if i pick by myself with the mouse the last column separator to increase the column width then i want to see use the horizontal scrollbar but the framework autoresize just autoincreases the size displaying that horizontal scrollbar is so ugly an uneficient there s no need to auto display that scrollbar when resizing the form

20685887
autoresize	scrollbar
the look that i would is just like jdownloader and all the nice programs has an autoresize that stops exactly on the start of the vertical scrollbar without showing the ugly horizontal scrollbar if not needed for example like this

20685899
gridbaglayout	springlayout
gridbaglayout or springlayout will give you the most flexibility but they can be frustratingly complex to work with

20685900
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
instead you should return a json arrays from your php file then move the for-loop to the js success callback and loops through the json arrays response there

20685908
google-chrome	safari
i ve seen it done on a google-chrome extension called soundcontrol but have no idea whether it is at all possible to implement on safari

20685975
folder	directory
i now want the rpm to refer to this newer glibc lib directory in my home folder while installing mono

20685976
dictionary	map
you could implement in your example that takes an and the map function as constructor arguments and keep a dictionary of all mapped items as we don t know whether find stops iterating after finding the match

20685998
button	checkbox
i have a scenario in which i ll have a list view which will have the combination of checkbox and radio button in other words the listview will have

20686021
next	except
so far so good it works except that after the call to copycsv.bat the next call to playersync seems to be skipped and i the goto is ignored and i hit the echo some other error line and then the goto eof works

20686040
put	get
what should i put in last else if to get str word not found

20686098
floor	sqrt
calculate floor sqrt n before the loop but compiler may be doing it anyway though

20686141
getter	setter
i also see that setter and getter method should follow java naming convention

20686186
innodb	myisam
first i discovered it only was used for myisam which after reading i found to be less than desirable in comparison to the current innodb

20686201
chameleon	phptal
consider using the zpt chameleon or phptal tags as needed if the question is specific to an implementation

20686202
chameleon	phptal
tal template attribute language is a xml-attribute based templating language standard used by zope page templates chameleon phptal and other templating libraries

metal macro expansion template attribute language is a an extension to tal xml-attribute based templating language standard to add macro functionality used by zope page templates chameleon phptal and other templating libraries

20686249
inherited	properties
isolated scope means that it doesn t inherited properties of its parent

20686249
inherited	properties
it only inherited properties that you explicitly bind inside the scope object

20686249
inherited	properties
therefore the content inherited all the properties of your mainctrl controller

20686249
inherited	properties
but if you look at the inherited tree you will find that the content inherited properties of aisolated scope which brings us to isolated scopes

20686288
children	parent
i suggest ignoring parent children and adding an unique id to each node instead

20686293
ssms	ssdt
i am not getting any visible errors in any applcations such as vs2012 with ssdt and report builder or ssms add-ins that i am using apexsql complete ssms tools dell spotlight essentials

cause if you are using an https or ssl load balancer with back-end authentication enabled the public key authentication will fail if the public key on the certificate does not match the public key configured on the load balancer

20686426
postgresql	mysql
however mongoid targets only the mongodb database while activerecord targets relational databases such as postgresql mysql and sqlserver

20686426
datamapper	activerecord
you can compare activerecord with datamapper or sequel

20686426
mongoid	mongomapper
likewise you can compare mongoid with mongomapper actually you could but there is no comparison because the last one is almost dead

20686439
floor	sqrt
there are obvious microoptimizations such as ++i rather than i++ or getting floor sqrt n out of the loop these are two floating point operations which are really expensive compared to other integer operation in the loop and calculting n i only once use a dummy variable for it and then calculate the square of the dummy

20686450
google-chrome	firefox
however on our dev iis server ie9 and ie10 take several minutes to display while ie8 google-chrome and firefox are fine

20686512
lme4	predict
it s on its way to becoming a book chapter. the author of daag has also published daagxtras which has a comparemodels function which you could set up after using the newly introduced predict methods in pkg lme4

20686535
mouse	keyboard
the issue however is that when the icons are clicked on none of the mouse event listener methods within piano keyboard are being triggered

ispf	cobol
the ispf editor on ibm mainframes has been optimized to handle the kind of coding cobol requires

20686611
ispf	cobol
it is difficult to describe in a post but having facility in both programming worlds and with both types of editors i have to say that i would not want to edit cobol in an ide style editor and i would not want to edit java and c-family languages in an ispf editor

20686646
for-loop	arrays
you can create a new arrays and fill it manually using a for-loop as follows

post	get
if i use web dialog to post on facebook can t get the comments.if i use fbrequestconnection startwithgraphpath method i am getting comments

20686802
inline	inlining
if you want built-time selection of a function with a given name that has 2 or more different implementations and you want to support machine code inlining of that function then declare it as inline which requires also supplying the implementation in each variant s header and use include and lib paths to select the relevant header for compilation and lib for linking ndash

20686802
inline-functions	inlining
as with any inline-functions this doesn t guarantee machine code inlining

20686802
inline	inlining
with respect to machine code inlining inline is just a hint it s guaranteed effect is about permitting a definition in each translation unit and requiring such a definition in each translation unit where it s used

20686834
memcpy	memmove
memcpy or memmove will move the whole block in one shot and eliminate the loop

20686848
oncreate	recreate
when the app is recreate the bundle passed to oncreate is not null and contains your saved state

20686912

20687088
mouse	keyboard
you can install mouse and keyboard hooks

20687092
for-loop	loops
what you have is a for-loop going through the input but inside of that you also have a while loops going through the input which is very awkward and it looks like it would result in you being able to enter that -99 number 100 times

20687092
for-loop	loops
instead of using both a for-loop and a while loops just the clauses together in the for-loop

20687119
button	checkbox
creating a view where the list of the business locations are in the form of checkbox so the user can choose which locations to show ideally it should be ajax-y so the user does not need to press the submit button but the map marker will toggle on-off as user checks and unchecks the location

20687128
for-loop	loops
i have workng matlab code that uses a for-loop to send data via serial ports then wait a specified time before the next iteration of loops

20687221

so i have a constructor but i don t pass values through parameters rather i want to initialise all to 0 and the use getter or setter to retrieve them

20687242
tcpdf	fpdi
i solved it by using tcpdf together with fpdi

20687243
memcpy	strncpy
in good c++ raw arrays raw pointers and functions like strncpy and memcpy are generally quite rare

20687246
children	parent
another fact to take into account is that when parent qobject belongs to a thread all its children must be in the same thread

20687278
min	max
if every one of those attributes has a min max value then create an static function to restrict the value

20687311
getter	setter
here s what your setter getter functions should be looking like for your mapped objects

20687323

width	height
that view and the text view had height and width constraints as well as top and left for the view and top and right for the text view

20687368
rss	feed
notifications have little to do with core code they re just an rss feed from magento hq and any extension vendors

20687393

my own approach for trail development is to use cloudera hadoop distribution over any ubuntu centos vm on windows host lot of options for guest vm including their own free bundle

20693788

the pusher javascript library also supports various versions of websocket so in theory they should work together

20693949

folder	directory
what you can do though is put your index.php folder in the app views directory

20694392
dbcontext	objectcontext
during the tests i discovered that the only method that refresh data with the current records from the database added updated and deleted is to use objectcontext s objectset and set mergeoption to overwritechanges dbcontext does not expose such a method

20694590
fadein	fadeout
taken from jquery fadein fadeout - ie8 does not fade

20694596
fadein	fadeout
you need to create a manual fadein fadeout function for ie that removes the filter attribute

min	max
all values will be grouped by the same key so here you ll just need to process each input value and calculate the min max and sum for each column

20694670

floating-point	integer
it would be valid if x and y were of some integer or enumeration type but there s no such permission for floating-point

20694700
int	double
i settled on a scheme where i used a vector of 8-bit int as a subscript into the double vector which i shortened to 256 elements

20694700
int	double
the tiny int all had the same values before 128 ahead of zero and 128 after zero so except for the middle 256 values they all pointed to either the first or last value in the double vector

20694700
int	double
since the tails of the curve were seldom touched it s very possible that only the middle 200-300 elements of the tiny int vector were actually kept in cache along with 160-240 middle double representing 1 8ths of percents of interest

20694744
width	height
my current knowledge tells me that i could set the fixed width height in style or template or in every layout which was used

20694950
ant	maven
if you are using some other build tool like ant maven or gradle the best solution would be to have the source generation in a separate step than your compilation

int	chars
the dates were originally int which i converted to chars using as.character

if you chart the results of both functions ntile will be a perfectly linear line from 1-to-n whereas percentile rank will usually have some curves to it depending on your data

20708688

it is also possible for some operations to be width-pipelined add subtract bitwise logical operations and left shifts

20709720
put	get
however the put get printmap and other operations are only ever called by thread2

20709720
put	get
since put get printmap etc are only ever called by thread2 there is no need for mutual-exclusion

20709779
put	get
in this case it s not thread-safe because thread2 can call put get printmap etc before the constructor running in thread1 has finished resulting in a npe

20709787

width	height
change height by changing the height in the img tag in the html file and change width by changing the width in .slider-wrapper in style.css

20710281

the other way would be to use a percentage width for example width 70 and then also use margin 0px auto this would mean that the styled element would grow or shrink to the screen size

20710294
post	get
regardless the communication is being happen through a form it is essentially a get or post request

20710334

you can maintain the user state in sesisonstorage create array for addition and subtraction or single array whatever you feel is fine and store it in sessionstorage

20710439

cppcheck	cpplint
you must provide cpplint an absolute path to your source code directory in order for the hyperlink generation to work on cppcheck results page

i have calculated the min and max values before minaverage maxaverage and add some space on each end

20710567
hide	show
and then when you initialise your fragment in the framelayout you set hide and show methods for display it

20710607
instances	transient
the way it works now is that if you happen to register the handlers with their interfaces mt will completely bypass your registration logic and call resolve on the concrete type instead which works in unity out of the box possibly causing unpredictable behavior because you think it should be a singleton like you registered but it ends up being a transient object the default instead for instances

20710614
post	get
will post final code when i get it to work and i ll mark pat s answer as correct

20710665

20718113
highcharts	rickshaw	d3.js	highcharts	d3.js	rickshaw
consider that we use graphite only for querying the values in json and use a third party charting tool such as d3.js rickshaw or highcharts we would then land across the problem where we have just one value to plot

apache	nginx
however when set up as a server-side language it s usually paired up with a http server like apache iis or nginx who manage several child processes to handle multiple requests

20718130
groupbox	panel
actually your code is pretty ok there should be another problem like wrong panel or more likely there would be another container in your panel like a groupbox which in that case another container you should iterate through that container

20718130
groupbox	panel
but if you want to write a more general code you should check for each container groupbox panel etc

20718203
width	height
right now i m simply checking for width and height and figure out which needs to be resized

20718235

there are a lot of these classic methods already implemented like roulette wheel selection tournament selection ox1 crossover pmx crossover rsm mutation uniform mutation elitist reinsertion pure reinsertion time evolving termination fitness stagnation termination etc

20718638
implements	extends
you can extends the library for your need just implements new classes of the available interfaces of classic gas method

20718654
requestfactory	gwt-rpc
another approach could be using requestfactory instead of gwt-rpc which is designed to transfer only a part of the server side object to the client ideal for cases like yours where you cannot send the entire internal data to the client

20718675
clang	llvm
as a bonus i would prefer to not enforce the compilation of the library with clang instead llvm shall be a runtime-dependency so just invoking clang at compile time even if i do not know how to do this is a second-best solution

20718678
maven	pom.xml
this is really the reason behind the popularity of maven the pom.xml file has become a common standard for determining a project s build classpath cross ide support

20718678
ant	maven
a very fine build tool that appears to have adopted some of the modern approaches of maven but preserves the control of ant

20718678
ant	maven
ant pre-dates maven so has no standard way to track it s classpath

20718710
gtk	cairo
gtk uses cairo which will use fast paths for 2d rendering

20718710
gtk	cairo
what cairo and thus gtk does not use is hardware acceleration for blending and compositing of surfaces

20718728
margin	height
for the s characters it will be at the top as your container element is out of the flow and hence no height will be considered in the document flow unless and until you wrap that s in some element and bring it down with margin padding or css positioning

20718749
apache	nginx
this is all about your front-end webserver apache nginx or whatever configuration

20718813

20719056
maven	m2e
import samples chat as an existing maven project in eclipse using m2e plugin

20719115
cout	cin
but you don t need to use the namespace std you simply add std to the reference of its members like std cin std cout and your code will be more clear yet

20719133
onresume	onpause
by the way if i minimize the application he goes into the onpause method and the onresume and everything works fine

20719152
width	margin
margin takes area around the element i.e if an element is 50px in width and you use margin of 10px it takes 10px on all sides so it will actually make your element take up 70px in total where as using position it doesn t expand or decrease the area around the element it just changes the position of the element which may or may not affect other elements on the page depending upon the position whereas margin changes the box model and thus it also affects the position of other elements such as static and relative

20719155
ubuntu	linux
docbook is used for documenting high profile projects such as the linux kernel and ubuntu

20719183

so i m wanting to know how i can validate a value before its actually set on the viewmodel but with contextual information about the type itself so i can then use reflection to get values such as min and max etc

20719312
matplotlib	scipy
i strongly suggest that you install a complete scientific python distribution such as anaconda or enthought python which contains all the packages you need for science numpy scipy matplotlib numba pandas etc.

20719347
put	get
this is mainly to get away from the unfamiliar interface of linux and terminals etc and put them in a friendly basic interface which will pretty much just allow them to write their code and click a big red button to compile and run it to interact with the hardware

20719370
int	chars
each element of is a chars but you re casting to unsigned int

put	get
the problem that i have is that when i put a click event on the menuitem objects i get a xamlparseexception stating the following

20724353
onclick	onmousedown
on way to fix this is to use onmousedown instead of onclick since the mousedown event is triggered before the text selection is lost

20724431
autocomplete	typeahead
i m using twitter bootstrap typeahead and i have these two java script functions to init the autocomplete

20724432

20724594
tortoisegit	svn
in tortoisegit it is done by cloning from the svn repository yep

20724623
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays

width	height
i m using the jquery 1.10.2 and used a div to be resizable but i saw that i have the events start and stop which allows me to get the div size just when start to click or when stop to click but i want to get the div sizes in real time when the div is being sizing and write them height and width into a textbox or div or whatever like this

20724709
tcplistener	networkstream
the console host program will start a tcplistener and once a client connects it will read messages from the resulting networkstream object and print them to the console

20724750
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i am seeing this unexpected behavior on firefox google-chrome and opera

20724768
hide	show
2 you may want to consider using the hidden property of the nodes to show hide them rather than actually adding and removing them from the scene

20724768
hide	show
3 to answer your question one approach is to modify the dodamage method so that it show hide the right number of health containers

20724779
ready	each
i have assumed that at the end of each month sheet month will be archived before being wiped clean of data ready for the following month

20724821
prepare	execute
finally it has nothing to do with sql injection but a good practice is to check the return value from prepare and execute because they return false if an error occurs in parsing or execution

20724843
int	chars
if passed as a simple int you can use std to_string then parse that string to check every 2 chars

20724847
hide	show
you need to leave the elements alone and programatically hide show them rather than completely removing them and replacing them with the other element

20724856

20724938
put	get
also strangely enough i upload and download files no problem using put and get

ubuntu	linux
source -it applies to ubuntu though it refers to another linux distribution-

20725018

once you have a bearer token you put it in the header of a get like so

20725497
for-loop	loops
loops is working correctly but the client has requested the option to attach a unique identifier to the first entry every time the for-loop is run

20725507

i use the following code inside the method cellforrowatindexpath to set the size of the image for the cell yet at runtime the image gets blown up to the maximum height and width that the table row will allow

20725573
memcpy	memmove
i was reading from a c++ reference about memcpy and memmove and they seems to be doing the same thing except that memmove has a specific think called allowing the destination and source to overlap

20725588
memcpy	memmove
others will fail for one or both of the two if you use memcpy here instead of memmove

20725614
inherited	properties
if you want to add only the properties specific to a properties which are not inherited you can do it like this

folder	directory
note the footer view files and header files will be placed in a header and footer directory within the views folder

20725976
uiview	calayer	uiview	subviews
on ios uiview is a fairly shallow wrapper around a calayer so it generally makes sense to create subviews instead of directly making sublayers which is why you aren t so familiar with this usage

20726015
width	height
if the text is too long it will break and wrap to the next line thus increasing the height of the button while maintaining a constant width

20726027
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
i want to fix some errors on css displayed on google-chrome and safari however firefox and opera mobil are showing correct

20726027

20726053
filtering	grouping
color is a filtering grouping and contains filtering which are the actual colors green red blue

20726053
filtering	grouping
what i came up with are subqueries for each filtering grouping but that seems very inefficient

20726098
int	double
the method in a does not override b s method because the parameter type int is different from b s double - it s invisible to the calling code

20726154
min	max
if you only have two preferences then you can use min and max

20726285
screens	tablet
you said you are having the issue when orientation changes occur only on large screens tablet and esp

20726285
portrait	landscape
when changing from portrait to landscape

20726309
min	max
i like using max over min just because it s easier to digest when trying to understand when looking at how my rules will react as the browser increases in width

20726334
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
it works fine in google-chrome and safari but got problems on firefox and ie

20726407
width	height
character dimension comparison as typically all fonts are different in size in height and width and that difference is easier to detect when the font size is large hence why it uses 72 pixels

20726420
google-chrome	firefox
the problem with this method is that i guess because it s loading the content as the page loads the screen flickers briefly only in google-chrome not firefox during the load

20726440
hex	binary
well you can use id represented in binary or hex

20726451
try-catch	exception-handling
turns out you don t need the try-catch block after all since vars won t throw any exception-handling but will return null when the given key does not exist

20726469
try-catch	exception-handling
and this is the code that i m using note that the try-catch statement is there in order to catch the exact exception-handling otherwise i ll just get a system.aggregateexception

20726497
put	get
you can directly put code in get param

20726506
express	node.js
node.js and express - sessions

20726526
cos	sin
the main trigonometric functions sin cos and tan can accept any number as a input for instance sin pi sin 3pi just as the domain of these functions in mathematics is all real numbers

20726741
hlsl	glsl
i m starting to learn shaders now hlsl glsl and i saw a lot of tutorials where there weren t many variables created and that made reading harder

20726760
shim	polyfills
to solve that you d need some other setup-function using a shim polyfills etc.

20726806
client-side	server-side
so let s say you want to pimp out an input with validations but you want to export your validations from a server-side orm class dry and have them auto-apply and generate the proper client-side ui for those validations

20726810
firefox	safari
in safari ie and firefox it instead refreshes the page thus seemingly going right past the ajax call that should keep it from refreshing

20726855
traceback	attributeerror

this would force the application to get the state value from the url post user authorization as _request will pick up any stored state cookie you might already have

20726941
h.264	webm
for a starting point you are going to want to look into webm and h.264 mpeg-4 avc

20726941
h.264	webm	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
it use to be that firefox only supported webm while safari and google-chrome both supported h.264

20726947
put	get	post	get	post	put
the problem is when i debug my code and watch what is in the apidescs i can only see get methods only - i can t see any delete put or even post methods

20726947
post	put
the same goes for all post put and delete methods in all apis

20726952
mdpi	hdpi

note that the table contain string int boolean fields

20727157
for-loop	loops
the inner for-loop traverses the columns in the row selected by the outer loops

20727185
nswindow	nspanel
the only problem i have with this is that when my nspanel is the key window the main app nswindow is not obviously which causes the red yellow green window controls to go dim

20727192
int	chars
the reason we make ch an int is because the function fgetc returns an int that is how we can have eof be returned yet eof isn t a legal chars value

20727236
sudoers	passwd
you need to add an entry for the user in etc sudoers file to not prompt for passwd

20727262
google-chrome	safari
i am not sure what the problem is but the css stylesheet appears under the images group when i inspect my web page with safari or google-chrome and shows that the resource type is image even when the mime type is correct and shows text css

20727271
free	malloc
boehm gc replaces malloc new and free and manages its own memory arena

even better and to get rid of the need to somewhere type the sudo passwd add the three commands without sudo to etc rc.local just before the exit 0

20727289
paradox	dbase
i tried paradox dbase access reader using utf-8 character set but the database is not readable

20727386
hash	salt
so i m trying to store a hash and salt

20727386
hash	salt
the code that generates the hash and salt looks like this

20727398
int	chars
as the type of lcnum column is int the where clause in the queries should be without quote chars

20727401
google-chrome	firefox
it works perfectly in firefox but not in google-chrome ie9

20727458
inherited	subclassing
simula 67 introduced objects classes inherited and subclassing virtual methods coroutines discrete event simulation and features garbage collection

20727475
scheme	racket
in languages like racket and scheme quasiquotes are smart enough to remember things about the lexical context they are written in but in scala this is a bit more difficult because there are so many different scopes in the language

20727550
folder	directory
i got tired of typing a very long auto-named directory from my android sdk folder structure into the command line so i changed one of the names to shorten it and now many other files cannot be accessed by my project when i work on it in eclipse

20727550
folder	directory
it had a space where i could edit the directory structure name so that fixed the files and folder in the android section but this did not update the other categories like general ant c c++ help .

20727560
put	get
i know the logic is to get nextpagetoken and put it into the loop but i do not know how

20727626
awt	swing
unless you have a particular reason for doing so avoid using awt components and use swing components instead you ll generally get better support

20727633
for-loop	arrays
when you are dealing with 2 - d arrays that is which consists of both row and column the nested for-loop can be used

20727687
client-side	server-side
since php is server-side and javascript is client-side php will output what you wan t inside your javascript code hope it helps

20727692
hide	show
i have done a workaround show below and it works partially it will increase width dynamically but not so precise and it will hide past entered characters after a while because of my poor logic applied in it

20727701
post	get
you post a notification every time the action is executed so naturally you get just as much notifications

20727764
post	get
with http get you can send some parameters in url but not objects as in post

20727778
maven	pom.xml
regarding nbe_42 s maven shade plugin where the plugin block is put in the pom.xml file is very important or maven will miss it

if you are using an older versioning of .net i suggest you upgrade to 4.0 before starting to use code contracts

20727866
versioning	upgrade
my application uses xquery and when upgrade to higher versioning i can see some self closing tags getting created in the transformed xml which is not the case with 8.1

20727869
int	chars
thus the variables are chars sport chars court int start_time int end_time

20727934
int	double
you can rearrange your equations such that you never need double assumimg your numerator and denominator are int

20727936
width	height
this works perfectly fine if the parent container has an explicit height and width â jquery ui converts the percentages back to pixels before subsequent resize or drags and my callbacks return them to percentage after the finished resize or drag

20727947
children	parent
now every contenttype has a parent and a list of children

20727954
air	flashdevelop
i am trying to build a actionscript side library for my sip library adobe air native extension following this blog from adobe in flashdevelop ide

20727965

20728034
hash	md5
i use md5 hashing to reduce a user nickname of arbitrary length to a hash

20728037
int	double
where number if an int or double is a number of days

20728106
width	height
it is easier to consider all width and height attributes to be hints only

20728121
hash	md5
the problem is that md5 has been broken with respect to collision resistance so an attacker could easily generate a pair of usernames that have the same hash with whatever security and or functionality implications that would have for your design

20728133
width	height
like one column have 2x height and width on another one

20728167
ws-trust	ws-federation
the relationship between ws-trust and ws-federation is that ws-federation is built on top of ws-trust

20728167
ws-trust	ws-federation
this is very technical and frankly despite using ws-federation for years i still am not sure where ws-trust ends and ws-federation starts

20728175
width	height
however to make something like that you can use 2 textarea s and then give them a specified width and height

ftp	telnet
telnet and ftp are two different protocols that run on different ports

20737999

so you can create a c# program that issues telnet commands to one port typically port 23 and the same program can also send ftp commands to another port typically ports 20 and 21

20737999

width	margin
since the smaller child view is 50dp you have added a margin of 130dp the total width it needs is 180dp but the parent view itself is only 150dp wide

20738305
width	margin
the decision that it makes in the end is that it can alter the width of the child box and still respect the margin constraint

20738305
width	margin
basically it shrinks the width of the inner box down from the assigned 50dp to 20dp so that it can fit inside the parent with its added margin

20738305
width	margin
this is clever behaviour by the interpreter because as screen sizes change and it runs into issues like this it should always preserve the margin constraint opposed to the width constraint

20738305
width	margin
it is choosing to preserve the given margin over the given width - probably because of the top-most parent layout

20738305
children	parent
this is not the case though because it will always try to keep children inside the bounds of parent in most layouts

20738305
width	margin
the choices that are made depend on the top-most parent layout too some layouts may prefer to preserve the width of the child box rather than the margin or even render the box outside of the parent s bounds

20742621
folder	directory
the working directory - that an application is executed from - is often different from that of the source or binary folder in eclipse you can actually set it manually in project settings

20742625
union	distinct
note that i have used union all which is faster than union as union uses distinct to unique records which i think in your case doesn t apply

20742630
post	put
the problem is that your form is inside the modal this is why you re not being able to pass them to the action what you need to do is put your form outside the modal this way when you post everything gets posted along and you wouldn t have to pass the values to the modal itself

20742644
installation	downgrade

20742781
folder	directory
thats because your folder dont have proper permissions.change your directory permissions

20742795
hide	show
the easiest way is to wrap your button in a div and then just hide show it

20742800
width	height
as always alohci is in a better position to explain why the width and height attributes are specified anyway even if they differ from the dimensions specified in css for whatever reason

20742813
google-chrome	safari
it all works fine in google-chrome but in safari after you have rolled off the icons the browser resizes them really small

20742830
width	height
then you add width and height attributes to img tag the browser will know some not final image size before image is loaded and will add it native cap for images with images size

20742830
width	height
then you add width and height attributes to img tag the browser will know some not final image size before image is loaded and can calculate for example offsetwidth or offsetheight of image container right

20742830
width	height
also width height attributes will save you from image html container repaint if you don t crop image from css because browser already add some space for image

20742833
children	parent
do this inside a directive on the element whose parent gets new children in this case

20742838
put	get
if you put strings inside you get strings back and then you can just use a cast

20742870
width	border-color
notice the border given to the images in the last case the border has been set inline and it shows the inline border-color but in case of the width its taking the one set in css and not the inline

20742950
hide	show
everything will show and if i put it back it will hide everything

20742958
postgresql	mysql
but don t use full search from databases like mysql or postgresql

20742972
min	max
i have set a max and min you could just set width instead - its up to you

20742987
width	height
not inherit any styles from the stylesheet so it would only have a height and width

20743014
versioning	upgrade
i saw that the newest versioning 0.8.4 has since added some bug fixes related to loaddata so i upgrade to it

20743055
margin	height
margin and padding are added to the 100 height so it stetches the content down

20743057
width	height
this issue has been solved it happened because the glreadpixels reads the buffer which is connected with the surfaceview that the preview is displayed on and the size of this surfaceview is bigger than the width and height params i setted in glreadpixels so it just displayed part of the preview begins from the left bottom corner of the preview

20743143
super	self
because in your initwithlevel method you are calling the super s init and not the self s init

20743148
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
uinavigationcontroller is not automatically presented in uiviewcontroller

20743159
super	extends
since b extends a and doesn t call the super constructor implicit constructor of a is called behind the scene

20743166
notepad++	sublimetext
i conducted some tests nothing fancy with notepad++ and sublimetext 2 on windows and it turns out that r and n are indeed 2 distinct characters but.

qwindow	qwidget	qwindow	qquickview
the only window in my application is a qquickview which is a subclass of qwindow not of qwidget so if i want to use a qfiledialog to give the user the option to save a file i do not know how to set its parent to be the qquickview

20743414
listview	gridview
so might want to replace the gridview with a listview

post	put
i have a shortcode that i put in my post but somehow it doent execute for some reasong

20743465
superclass	subclassing
when subclassing extends superclass if there is no constructor written it takes default constructor

20743465
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
it is necessary to have default constructor when subclassing inherited superclass because for inherited compiler will always first go to superclass constructor and then subclassing constructor

20743482
getter	setter
do they need user.java and populate it through setter and getter

20743485
public	protected
inheritance public private protected etc

20743496
put	get
if you re saying that the first column is enough to identify the rows then perhaps as the first line of your success handler you could get those values from the table and put them in an array

20743496
for-loop	arrays
...and then within your for-loop when you need to see if a row just retrieved via ajax is already in the table just check if it s in the arrays

20743496
for-loop	arrays
i suggest the arrays because it should be rather more efficient to test for a value in the arrays on each iteration of your for-loop than to test for a value in the dom

20743514
put	get	post	get	post	put
the http request thus contains the http method post put get etc.

20743588
listview	gridview
you should never nest listview or gridview inside scrollview because both of these views provide scrolling as soon as your data is more than visible area of the view

20743652
hide	show
i have a jquery code to show and hide a div

20743652
google-chrome	firefox

20743691
firefox	safari
firefox 27 ie10 and safari 6 support an old version of the spec

20744057
ready	each
when each module is ready normally some kind of initialization function is called

20744060
int	boolean
these must be set to true but in great interop tradition a boolean value is not accepted must be an int and again in great interop tradition of not being consistant the value for true is actually -1

ng-view	ng-include
the html would consist of the obvious ng-view and number of ng-include

20744161
shim	polyfills
whilst typescript seems to be maturing quite well along it s road to version 1.0 i d noticed quite early on in it s infancy that it was not easy to polyfills shim monkey patch extend the functionality of core objects object string number boolean etc using typescript...however this is perfectly legal in pure javascript and in my opinion necessary for creating cross browser compatible and compliant apis

20744244
tablet	galaxy
what looks strange is that it works on the tablet galaxy tab 3 10.1 and not working on my phone samsung ace3

20744312
hide	show
again hide show of right panel fixes the problem but just for a while

20744361
children	parent
these two children send two different signals to its parent when their job is done

20744361
children	parent
in the meanwhile the parent waits for its children using two pause

20744374
width	height
in the given case the actual dimensions of the images seem to match the html attributes so the css settings cause them to be rescaled without preserving the width height ratio

20744374
width	height
it makes more sense to do this for height than width though.

20744439
put	get
if i put the console.writeline in the loop then i will get the expected result

20744452
width	height
what i d like the function to output is a 3d array where one dimension is frame space another is different bounding boxes for the given frame and finally the 4 elements that define a bounding box minx miny width height

20744455
hide	show
it seems to be you want to switch between show and hide functions

20744480

this capture for setter and getter

20744551
button	checkbox
i have a form that has a list of radio button and one checkbox that represents a special button

20744551
button	checkbox
my idea is that once the checkbox is checked all the other radio button are disabled which works quite well with jquery

20744551
button	checkbox
if the checkbox is unchecked the user can select some channel with the radio button

20744556
post	get
i see the output in browser with get and post only after 100 th record and not after every record

20744620
width	height
the attributes width and height are probably not set

20744646
children	parent
if the parent of a current field is 0 we just go further because that means our parent is a leaf and is not supposed to have any children

20744665
ssl	https
http without ssl or https with ssl

20744675
sudo	passwd
the error message is quite explanatory - you cannot use sudo in a shell script without terminal as it expects a user to enter the passwd

children	parent
1 take first bit if its 1 root - then next 2 1 are values of children of that parent

20745060
notepad++	sublimetext
it s already easy to pick-up and any nice editor like sublimetext or notepad++ would probably be easier and more natural than whatever you ll build using the admin site

20745109
post	put
jsp file method is post or put

20745126
width	height
you can always use a max width and height for larger screens but you need the percentage to ensure it is visible on smaller devices

20745198
return-value-optimization	nrvo
what is worse is that your move blocks return-value-optimization nrvo just like c++11

20745214
versioning	upgrade
if you want to upgrade to a newer versioning you can simply copy and override these files to your shell to upgrade the module

20745218
box-sizing	border-box
you can add padding to your #left div together with box-sizing border-box and the layout should remain in tact

20745226
xts	quantmod
your code should work if you just use xts instead of as.xts however it s not really the r way or quantmod way to attack the problem

20745231
google-chrome	firefox
and as you can see getusermedia works only in firefox and google-chrome

20745270
width	height
i tried adding linearlayout.layoutparams but i can set only width or height not both

20745308
integer	unsigned
use a similar trick for nsinteger and nsuinteger always scan as a unsigned long and cast to ns u integer

use this for giving giving height and width to imageview

20745405

20745439
put	get
1 is running on windows using memory channel and other 2 are on linux using file channel to get data from windows agent and put in to hbase

20745448
apache	nginx
another possibility is to replace apache with nginx and mod_wsgi with something else for example gunicorn

20745528
hide	show
i want when i hover over .image-normal to hide that specific div and show fade in image-hover and .tooltip and on mouseout for reverse to happen

your test environment already has a database with schema versioning 1 and when you modified the schema by adding another table the database is not upgrade nor created since the schema versioning are the same and the database already exists

20745628
hide	show
then do the hide show with css

20745656
folder	directory
this prints out all of the files and folder in the current directory

20745754
button	checkbox
it is phpmyadmin which says it does not have enough information to offer you the checkbox and button you will normally see in a result set with unique id

20745762
superclass	subclassing
now i wish to unmarshall the following xml file which contains different element names in that collection because these are subclassing of the superclass

20745938
int	chars
if a chars rather than an int was input by the user the program would break and go into some infinite loop for some reason

20745954
solaris	bsd
works with linux bsd os x and solaris smartos

20745968
implements	extends
assuming you have the wrapper service class wrapperservice extends service an interface extservice and a class myserviceclass implements extservice where myserviceclass can be loaded from your dex file

20746042
centos	linux
as scientific linux is a redhat deriative i expect rhel or centos information would be as relevant for me

20746055
int	chars
chars fgets chars s int size file stream

20746072
ng-show	ng-hide
so be sure to include the following style in your css in order to benefit from ng-hide and ng-show directives

20746075
implements	extends
class gameview that extends surfaceview implements surfaceholder.oncallback

20746087
getter	setter
instead of having the user do the string manipulation i want to hide it inside setter and getter methods

20746087
getter	setter
i have searched high and low for ways to use setter and getter that suit my needs but all i see are people asserting that python doesn t need them and we should all just be adults and access the attributes directly

20746123
pull	push
following is my controller its really simple trying to pull data when a button is clicked and trying to push it into ng-repeat

20746176
awt	swing
you should skip doing awt and move to swing

20746220
inherited	properties

20746326
mdpi	hdpi
unfortuantelly you need to make the layout xml properly and test it keep in mind you have ldpi mdpi hdpi xhdpi layouts to help you if your widget doesnt turn out right on all phones with default layout

20746333
mouse	keyboard
for controls that are not qabstractitemview s implement two signals one emitted on any change another one emitted only on changes based on keyboard mouse input

20746341
hide	show
i also removed the hide and show calls as they are redundant to highlighting rows like you ask

20746382
getter	setter
as soon as you have to pass arguments to a getter or more than one argument to the setter it doesn t have an attribute semantic obviously so you cannot use a computed attribute

20746382
getter	setter
the solution is simple use an explicit getter setter pair

20746382
getter	setter
the point about getter setter not being needed in python is that for anything that has attribute s semantic but not anything else you can always turn a direct attribute access to a computed one if and when you need it without breaking the client code

20746382
getter	setter
dr abusing properties the way you do is not pythonic and you d be better with explicit getter and setter

20746396
width	height
for a picturebox it returns 0 0 width height so intersectswith will always return true if width and height are nonzero

20746487
getter	setter
you should hide your implementation from outside and provide setter and getter

20746499
width	height
to avoid overlapping of buttons use fixed width and height for buttons

20746540
ssl	https
i m maintaining a typo3 4.5 lts based website which can be accessed with or without ssl connection except some special pages with forms etc which are only available via https

20746544
superclass	subclassing
the subclassing can be accessed through a superclass instance with the lower-case class name

20746545
google-chrome	firefox
have a look at selenium with python and google-chrome firefox phantomjs webdriver that gives you complete control over clicking any button or link in any webpage

20746561
onclick	onsubmit
instead of having the function fire on the button using onclick try firing it on the form using onsubmit

to get around the various issues with you should always put quotes around the parameters

20746666
hide	show
is the content that initially show the rest use content hide

20746667
range	max
in other words having a numerical value where the g or i or c flags would be or no flag at all acts as the max limit of a range affecting the first match on every line

20746716
int	chars
the resulting array will contain the entries chars with value 4 and int with 160

20746725
libstdc++	libc++
this error was because boost was build using gcc standard library libstdc++ and i was compiling using clang libc++

20746850
google-chrome	firefox
again this works fine google-chrome just not firefox

20746854
ssl	https
i can easily set up an ssl connection to the server using a security certificate generated by openssl however i m not sure whether this is the correct way of securing the connection for a desktop application or whether this method is primarily used for https

20746860
jasmine	sinon
i am writing unit tests for my angular code and i have been using jasmine and sinon for mocking my services

20746918
pull	push
the bootstrap devs seem to be refusing to add those xs- ofsets and push pull classes see here

20746930
width	margin
as we know the width margin 0 auto

20747000
int	chars
it could be assigned to variable and pointers like a chars or an int

20747015
folder	directory
taking another look at your gruntfile and directory structure i think you have the folder specified incorrectly you specify the source as being . app .

20747023

for-loop	arrays
below is some basic code as to the main for-loop that currently draws the maze and the 2 boolean arrays that it references in order to draw the walls

20747244
opencart	vqmod
however if it s only the catalog side that is having an issue then it s most likely your opencart index.php for the catalog side doesn t have vqmod installed whereas the admin side does

20747276
super	self
in your example super testing2 self .__init__ will resolves to object.__init__ so it wouldn t do what you expect but - as you mentionned - it won t get called anyway because it s not in the __mro__ of neither child1 nor child2

20747301
post	get
i ve tried several different combinations with no luck and post as well as get

20747332
filtering	grouping
the outer query then filtering the rows by distance and grouping them by category to produce the desired output

20747350
inherited	subclassing
the rule is that the root class of inherited describableversionedentity has to contain all the subclassing in discriminatormap - not only the direct ones

20747352
google-chrome	firefox
i would prefer a solution in google-chrome if its not possible then in firefox or ie11

20747366
children	parent
i see that the performance for copy from statement postgresql degrading when i insert through a parent table rather than inserting directly into children

20747366

int	chars	unsigned	short
so if i understood it well integral promotion provides that chars wchar_t bool enum short types always are converted to int or unsigned int

20747614

hide	show
listen for the sizechanged event and then show hide the correct layout depending on the new size

20749096
width	height
now in your code what is happening is that you have set the input fields width and height to 150px and 25px respectively.now when you add 1px border to it it will reduce the inside white portion of the input field to maintain the width and height as mentioned 150px and 25px

20749096

int	chars
here you are trying to dereference the pointer which points to size chars but you try to load an int from it

20749638
metaclass	subclassing
i think the most straightforward explanation is that the metaclass is just a normal object of type type referenced by parent and subclassing and instantiation do not copy the metaclass but just create a new reference to it or strictly speaking actually not even thatâ it s just how attribute lookup works

20749723

20750509
super	self
return super groupawaremixin self .dispatch request args kwargs

20750530

20750674
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
this works perfectly fine on my laptop in google-chrome firefox but not in safari and ie the latter is not relevant for me

20751158
addeventlistener	preventdefault
preventdefault works only when the event listener is attached using addeventlistener

20751265

while width of image is fixed height varies and i got problem with that

20751328

you can also nest controllers to have the parent controller s scope properties inherited by the child scope

20751346
post	get
in mvc 5 there aren t get and post attributes

20751393

in your case i would recommend creating a style for your button with setters for common properties such as height width font etc

20751463
nlb	iis
the nlb is installed either directly on each backend server or if layered features are required through separated apache iis or other frontend service directly on the frontend nodes

20751857
width	height
i think lars had the right idea if you specify a for height and you have responsive true enabled you are not giving it a percentage of the parent wrapper you are declaring a ratio of height to width

20751857
width	height
therefore if your slider is 1000px wide at full width and you want it 500px tall at full width setting height 50 will give you the correct starting height and your image will be refreshed based on page resizing

20751858
width	height

20752426
fflush	gets
that ensures it gets fflush

20752489

when i try to git push myfeature so that myusername x myfeature will have a single commit and can be cleanly merged to otherusername x master git complains that my local branch is behind the remote branch and that i need to pull the changes from the remote branch

20752791
daemons	systemd
i currently have an application that needs to know all the applications running on the systemd not daemons but apps like chromium firefox gedit .

20752815
getter	setter
consider using setter and getter methods to gain access to those variables you would like outside classes to have access to

20752815
awt	swing
i would also consider taking a look at performing custom painting and painting in awt and swing so you understand how painitng works

20752865
lxml	beautifulsoup
look into beautifulsoup with lxml

20752870
nsscanner	nsnumberformatter

this appears to be a bug with the default configuration of nginx in debian ubuntu which uses only will not contain the

20752916
ubuntu	debian
this is configured in etc nginx proxy_params for the debian ubuntu package and you might override it in your configuration after including it.

hlsl	glsl
i need to decode the data in a glsl or hlsl vertex shader

i ve followed the official internationalization localization guide and i got all my site-specific messages translation as expected

20753009

this has quite a bit of redundancy it takes log2 16 16-bit but that s exactly 64bit

20753016
apache	nginx
ec2 - apache nginx php front end

20753033
jboss	glassfish
i didn t tried it yet but this says that it supports major jee-servers jboss tomcat glassfish jetty and all major browsers and transports websockets sse long-polling etc

20753033
wildfly	glassfish
furthermore because of jsr 356 aka java api for websocket i think it is only a question of time when the so to say mainstream java web-frameworks will be shipped with out-of-the-box support for websockets+fallback especially considering the fact that all main servlet conteiners like tomcat and jetty and jee 7 servers glassfish wildfly have support for jsr 356 already

20753164
children	parent
the first object is a parent and the other two are children

20753200
sudo	passwd
is it possible to ask for sudo passwd in the beginning when the script just starts but still run some lines of the script as a current user

20753205
getter	setter
you should be providing simply getter and setter to allow outside classes access to the information contained within and managed by the class.eapqually you should provide the class s with management functionality that other class might need to use such as refresh

20753221
integer	unsigned
naturally this requires that float be 32 bits in the c implementation and that uint32_t be a supported type but you can use another 32-bit integer type if it is not likely unsigned int

20753243
subtract	addition
we know result of the addition calculate the old value of p1 by subtract current value of p2 current p2 20 from value coming from p1 p1 30 and store result on p2 calculated p2 10

20753267
postgresql	mysql
these are used to quote identifiers in postgresql in much the same way as backticks are in mysql

20753282
maven	pom.xml
i ve added maven dependencies in my pom.xml

20753298
pubnub	mtgox
for me the best solution was to convert the jsonobject s from the pubnub api to bean classes which i found in the mtgox module of the xchange library

20753338
sudo	passwd
just like using sudo interactively you will be prompted for your user passwd if you haven t done so recently

20753359
put	get
that is not possible for a normal sdk application as there is no requirement that every app that downloads a file put the file in a place where you can get at it

20753406
folder	directory
i have a directory which will have some folder and some files within it

20753406
folder	directory
this bat data snapshot directory will have some folder and some files within it as shown below -

20753410
getter	setter
alternatively you can declare a class which has a myname field with a getter and setter say fooclass

20753416
getter	setter
encapsulation is not only a matter of making getter and setter for a field

20753416
getter	setter
getter and setter don t have to reflect the acutal fields

20753416
getter	setter
there could be getter and even setter for fields which value is calculated on demand

20753416
getter	setter
hide complexity a getter setter could peform something more complex than just setting a value

20753421
margin	height
however when you add the three divs below into it it will have a height of 2px + the margin-top + margin - bottom of those three divs inside of it.

20753428
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
you specified margins in div #four #five and #six so the height is based on your content exactly the margin of 10 to a top and 10 based on the container width

20753428
width	margin
specifies a margin in percent of the width of the containing element

20753450
cpython	ironpython
the garbage collector has to clean up the first object before your code even starts to allocate the second objectâ which is guaranteed to happen with cpython or any other ref-counting implementation when there are no circular references but pretty unlikely with a generational garbage collector as in jython or ironpython

20753467
subtract	add
if you re always subtract 1 one way would be to add an to your where clause

20753480
postgresql	mysql
if that s the case you d really be better off using like instead of mysql regexp or postgresql and using the pattern somestring

20753501
width	height
notice percentages in the translate function refer to the object s width and height rather than its container like top and left so you ll have to rethink those numbers i used pixels

20753513

20753695
setinterval	clearinterval
the setinterval method will continue calling the function until clearinterval is called or the window is closed

20753719
glfw	glew
glew which very much is maintained and glfw serve very different purposes

20753719
glfw	sdl
in this regard glfw is a subset of the functionality of sdl which attempts to do the same thing but with a larger focus allowing access to audio output and and game device inputs as well

20753719
glfw	glew	glfw	sdl	sdl	glew
whether or not you have to use a loading library such as glew with either sdl or glfw is mostly dictated by the platform you re trying to target and the opengl functionality you want to use

20753727
ddms	systrace
according to ddms systrace the device lowers the cpu frequency of the cores after some seconds images are processed continuously

20753729

20753861
google-chrome	firefox
i still always see jitter and i still always see the loading icon latest google-chrome firefox

20753875
udp	tcp
also if you have very limited memory processing resources it is worth bearing in mind that udp is a less costly protocol as it avoids a lot of the overheads tcp incurs due to its inbuilt connection management

20753875
udp	tcp
for instance when you send data over either tcp or udp the bytes you send may not all arrive to the server at the same time

20754180
pygtk	pygobject
i am equally migrating to pygobject due to pygtk being depreciated

20754191
superclass	subclassing
it s not a good design to select specific subclassing instance in superclass methods by dynamic_cast due to runtime overhead and future maintenance etc

20754198
ostringstream	std
properly convert your numbers to string representation using std to_string boost lexical_cast a std ostringstream etc.. or

20756150
put	get
i have many inputs with diffrent values i need to get all of them and put them to the loop

20756226
addition	multiplication
a compiler may call those functions in any order that is the only guarantee is that f1 and f2 are called before the multiplication and all three are called before the addition and that all three will only be called after the value of their arguments is known

if an int chars constant contains

20765159
int	chars
so yes in c single chars constants such as x have type int

20765159
int	chars	printf	getchar
why this is the case is afaik largely lost to history 1 although i suspect it was to minimize conversions when comparing against the results of getchar which returns an int or working with variadic functions like printf which would automatically promote any expressions of type chars to int

i have service which goes and gets the message from a external system and puts them in the database oracle db

express	node.js
with a basic ajax web app running locally a form posts data through express node.js to mongodb and a button onclick responds in a rendering of the mongo document s in a div-box

20765443
hash	md5
given the further explanation of the op the aim is to exlclude the file itself from being moved and since this wouldn t happen because it s being used it would throw an exception so i d take another approach check the file md5 hash only when it s being used this would greatly reduce the number of files checked thus improving performance

20765865
setinterval	clearinterval
anyway now you can wrap this in setinterval and clearinterval functions

20765865
setinterval	clearinterval
if you really want to do the whole mess with making clearinterval call setinterval you can but let s at least clean it up a bitâ use isinstance instead of type and don t try to set a flag that you use in a second if when you can just do it all in a single if

20765872

20767530
perl	tcl
i ve got pretty extensive experience programming in other languages but in recent years have stuck mainly with scripting languages like python tcl and perl

20767530
perl	tcl
this sounds like the sort of situation that a call to flush_events would solve in perl or tcl

20767555
request-uri	url
placing the key in the url fragment component prevents leakage via the referer header but also complicates the dereference operation since the fragment is also not sent in the request-uri of an http request

ok since firefox is having a fit about the bad date format google-chrome overlooks it you ll have to manually fix the format

20767630
google-chrome	firefox
during the support call we attempted to get this to work multiple times using both the latest google-chrome and firefox browsers with cookies cache etc

jar	manifest.mf
new security requirements for ria related to jar because you need to specify in meta-inf manifest.mf from which site application could be distributed

20767653
jar	manifest.mf

20767653
jar	manifest.mf
create by hand manifest.mf and put to your jar under folder meta-inf

20767683
width	height
resize does not necessarily only indicate a size change but a change in any of the properties that defines its size being left top width and height

20767684
hide	show
a way to do this is to generate the popups within the html and show or hide them when you need like this

20767684
hide	show
now while user navigates the page you are going to hide and show the .pop-message s while replacing those .dynamic-field s if needed

20767722
udp	tcp
see tcp vs udp on video stream

20767745
associativity	operator-precedence
in every textbook on c c++ you ll find an operator-precedence and associativity table such as the following

20767745
associativity	operator-precedence
i was once again surprised to find out that very little is mentioned on operator-precedence and associativity

20767745
associativity	operator-precedence
if it is ansi who makes the definition why is little mentioned about operator-precedence and associativity

20767750
put	get
i have tried using both the tar task and the distribution plugin but for each one i am not able to find a clean way to just get the generated tars or any tar and put them at top level excluding everything else

20767764
width	height
you just make the height half of the width and only set the first 2 values of the border-radius

20767765

i do this exact thing by creating a junction or hardlink see below to my directory that s outside of the tree so that it appears to be mounted inside the directory hierarchy where my .git folder repo sits

20767842
addition	multiplication
would not be allowed since it has 5 operators 3 function calls multiplication and addition

20767842
addition	multiplication
associativity and precedence specify that the last two statements must be performed in that order since multiplication has higher precedence than addition

20767843
trie	tree
although it s exponential but in practice it could be much faster than you think because the trie tree is very sparse and the m is a small number

20767843
trie	tree
in this case you could link each word to all its prefix nodes by pointers during building the trie tree

20767874
accessor	properties
use the isasync properties when the get accessor of your binding source properties might take a long time

20767874
accessor	properties
one example is an image properties with a get accessor that downloads from the web

you must use memcmp or better yet strcmp for string comparison instead of

20767942
min	max
maybe i m just not getting something simple here but i am not able to set the min and max values as the same as the handle values in my jquery slider

20767942
range	max	range	min	min	max
the min and max are dynamically defined via php variables and when the slider first appears i want it s range to be the same as the range between the min and the max the entire slider

20767942
range	max	range	min	min	max
i only want the range slider to be within the bounds of the initial values which also happen to be the min and max

20767977
implements	extends
at 1 abstract methods are a way to suggest to a programmer that extends your code that there should be a method like this implements in your code

20768046
implements	extends
so by having abstract methods it forces the implementation of the abstract method in the class extends the abstract class however it also gives control to the programmer on how it should be implements

20768199
integer	unsigned
by unsigned long you mean unsigned 32-bit integer

20768222
width	height
the problem basically boiled down to the fact that the titledpane was not coded to support a horizontal content bias where its min preferred height is calculated based on its available width

20768222
width	height
so even though its content the label supports this functionality its rendered mote by the titledpane which calculates its minimum and preferred dimensions without the consideration of the other in which case the label control simply requests a width and height necessary to display all its text on one line

20768222
width	height
finally i update the skin s computeprefheight function to take into account the available width when its asking its children how much height they need

20768245
google-chrome	firefox
this was indeed how a lot of webfonts google webfonts and also highly professional fonts from typekit etc. looked in firefox left and google-chrome right on windows systems and eventually elsewhere too

20768434
hash	md5
instead of using an md5 hash to check if the file changed use the last modified time which should be less resource-intensive than computing an md5 hash each time but for some reason on my windows machine it still uses a lot of cpu so i m not sure you can try my code

20768478
post	get
and if the data is two large you will need to use a post instead of a get

20768884
width	height
on all my earlier android devices and earlier oses i get a valid positive width and height for my image with this same code

20768887
width	height
you have to give the outer div s width height some fixed value.so that when the inner div s content is overlapping then scroll will come as setting overflow auto property for outer div s class

20768887
width	height
you can try giving some fixed height width like windows height or width to the outermost div and then overflow the content of inner div should get you the scroll if overflow auto style property is defined

20768910
division	modulo
for the general case i don t think you can eliminate the branch but you can eliminate the slow modulo by offsetting the number before division

20769240
udp	rtp
comparing http live streaming to p2p video streaming over udp rtp is almost like comparing apples and oranges

20769240

searching around for solutions i ve read it s good practice to set float none display block and position relative for the target and parent elements but i haven t had any luck getting it to work in safari or google-chrome which supposedly no longer have support issues

from what i understand you want a animation well if you want to do it in jquery it be simple just add slow or fast as a parameter to your hide and show methods

20790665
mouseout	mouseleave
use mouseleave instead of using mouseout since mouseout causes events to bubble up and trigger the event when hovered over a tag or any other descendants as well which is inside of .tableitems

20790665
mouseout	mouseleave
mouseleave doesn t cause event propagation so it gets trigerred only when you move out of tableitems and not its containing li s when using mouseout

20790740
google-chrome	safari	webkit	blink
ù adding kashida â ù â for text styling on html itself is not a good idea because if user copy the text it will contains added kashidas and it will make problem for browsers find-in-page however as current webkit bug blink bug safari google-chrome versions do not support joining cursive script characters like arabic persian during inline pseudo elements there seems there is not any chance you get this type of justification without inserting kashida or you should handle oncopy event by your own that has its own problems

in attempting to put in the pieces for the rsa sha encryption handling i cannot get the signature to verify as verifier.verify always seems to return false

20790838
i2c	spi
i don t know that it s horrible but if you have spi or i2c peripherals already available there s certainly a don t reinvent the wheel argument to be made against bit-banging especially as you might have a bug in your code - for example you might be sampling on the wrong edge of the spi clock and depending on the tolerances involved and what hardware you test with you might not notice it until you re already in production

20790840
ant	maven	gradle	ivy

just get and hide or show doesn t affect the grid

20791685
hide	show
use can really hide the column but it cannot be show again as getcolumns does not return that column after that

20791697
onresume	onpause
just a small edit don t pass activity interface instance in the task constructor rather use onresume and onpause of activity to set and remove nullify the interface reference to the asynctask that way you can even save the response for later use if the activity goes in pause state while the task is running and gc can flush the activity objects if the task is taking too much time

width	height
a few things to note i did add in a height with the jsfiddle so that i could see the actual dimensions and i also added in width for the exact reason

20792735
width	margin
you need to have a width set on your section in order for margin 0 auto to work

20792743
width	margin
alternatively set a width on the section element and use margin 0 auto

20792746
addclass	removeclass
note 1 if you could use classes as suggested by kasper-taeymans consider to make small and big classes and apply jquery s addclass and removeclass to change your classes on the click events

also these don t expand on height only width

20792799

the width works fine but the height is just staying small you have to scroll which bothers me and potential clients as well

20793122
width	height
also the width works fine its just the height

20793147
jobs	cron
reason i ask is because i m aware there s a method for using cronjobs but i m curious to know if there s another method that does not require cron jobs in order for it to function

i have the above piece of code to work with a simple html file with only 1 of id map with style height and width 500px

20793307
puts	gets
the sample model is responsible to describe how the raster is going to store the data maybe you are using a model that puts more info per pixel and then the image gets only a part of the original buffer

20793375
getter	setter
part_id doesn t create getter and setter with column .its only setting up with relationship

20793375
getter	setter
if add getter and setter its giving org.hibernate.mappingexception repeated column in mapping for entity

20793383
post	get
and you have a button that make post back to an asp.net page then you get that parametre on asp.net side using the request.form and the name of the input control as

20793401
min	max
the confusing part is that instead of an index the column class provides a min and a max value

20793412
try-catch	exception-handling
however i don t want to write try-catch around every call neither do those calls need to catch the exception-handling

20793426
post	get
this can save your life if the string is coming from a get post request - but ii it s from a trusted source just use html_entity_decode to convert it back

20793478
superclass	subclassing
now your subclassing knows that method exists in the superclass and can use it but you are not exposing it to anyone else

20793523
getter	setter
as an aside this getter setter pattern is not usually appropriate for python

20793523
getter	setter
you should ask yourself why you want to use a getter setter pattern over simply accessing the object s variable directly

20793523
getter	setter
see the section on getter and setter in this article for more detail

20793545
int	chars
keep in mind that these chars values are treated as int s until step 6 below

20793545
int	chars
ch - a gives the initial chars s int offset from capital-a

20793545
int	chars
a + ch - a + key 26 adds the ciphered chars s offset from capital-a to capital-a itself resulting in the ciphered chars s int value

20793545
int	chars
chars a + ch - a + key 26 casts that int to chars type resulting in the ciphered chars as a chars

20793545
int	chars
casting 75 to chars allows it to be treated as a chars rather than an int

20793552
ostringstream	std
btw you should use std ostringstream when you are only writing to the stream and there is no use of std endl ever

20793570
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
since these are unchecked-exception one does not need to catch them explicitly as part of the contract - this can lead to situations where a loose coding practice can bring the system service down because one did not plan for an exception that got thrown from within the runtimeexception block

20793600
folder	directory
it will not load code.jquery.com jquery-1.9.0.js from code.jquery.com because it will check jquery-1.9.0.js in folder code.jquery.com in directory same as your html file

20793618
put	get
i need to figure out how to get the username of the user who s currently accessing the webpages so that i can put that in place of the fxusername 0 which i hard-coded earlier just for testing

20793622
getter	setter
you can use setter and getter properties instead of your custom defined methods

20793624
express	node.js
so if you have a suggestion for other captcha type solutions for a node.js and express project please leave a comment

20793639
config	ini
it s useful to put your connection string in some kind of config file xml or ini or whatever in case you move your database to another server or you change your login credentials and so on.

20793673
width	height
one big advantage to using soil_load_image is that you can retrieve width height and channel number from the original image which soil_load_ogl_texture doesnâ t provide

20793686
put	get
using the block is how i currently get around this issue but because i have 10 different section templates i have to put that in all of them

20793692

i m not sure what the sql standard is in this regard in terms of isnull nvl ifnull and coalesce or even which of this is common to both sqllite and postgres

i m trying to create a program that displays a large grid of numbers say filling up a 6 by 4000 grid where the user can move a cursor around via keyboard or mouse and enter in numbers into the grid

20793714
qscrollarea	qwidget
this is for a guitar tablature program. i m new to python gui programming and thus far my idea is to have a very large qwidget window say 1000x80000 pixels inside of a qscrollarea inside of the main window

20793744
accessor	properties
you can put accessor to these properties in a second header file and import that file on a need-to-know basis.

20793762
width	height
to be clear this is different from measured width and measured height

20793802
put	get
from that query get the three profile ids out and put them in place of and in the following query

20793838
width	height
i want the div width and height to be exactly the size of it s content and have no empty spaces

20793868
width	height
the general idea is that a view has a desired width and height which is constrained by two factors

20793868
width	height
if the view has asked to be wider or taller than the parent view then it s measured height and measured width will be constrained such that the values are no greater than the parent s

20793868
width	height
these values which can be match_parent wrap_content or a dp value get converted to measured widths and height once the parent view s width and height constraints are included

20793868
width	height
the viewgroup layout will resolve a view s width and height such that it displays correctly

20793868
width	height
these resolved width s and height s are the values you get from getwidth and getheight

20793868
width	height
this leads me to believe that the bit will be set whenever a fixed dp px value is given to the view which is larger than the parent s width and height and therefore the view s measured width and height will have been scaled down

20793871
int	chars
the boring part of the question is how to transform an int into a sequence of chars with the roman representation of the value

20793871
std	ostream
when an std ostream needs to convert any of the built-in numeric types integers floating points or the types bool and it obtains the facet from the stream s std locale and calls put on the object essentially using

20793871
integer	unsigned
the example also implements all four integer version of do_put for long long long unsigned long and unsigned long long

20793898
addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	addition
the calc function allows mathematical expressions with addition â +â subtraction â -â multiplication â â and division â â to be used as component values

20793902
put	get	post	get	post	put
i m trying to solve the flow of a user logging in with plaintext user and password send that to the api to authenticate the api just needs to say yes or no yet all requests from the site on behalf of a user to the api should be signed in some way with their credentials for when they want to post get put del one of the protected resources

20793918
put	get
that will get every text node that is a direct child of the parent div and put it in your array

20793918
put	get	children	parent
that will get all the contents of the direct children of the parent node and put them in your array

20793975
put	get	post	get	post	put
this may seem obvious but look at xml-rpc or soap where there s only one url for the whole system. a resource might send documents to the client in response to a get request and or it might accept documents from the client along with a post or put request

20793975
put	get	post	get	post	put
web apis often map the four most common http methods post get put delete onto the four crud operations create read update delete

20793975
post	get
web sites can t do this because web sites run on html and html forms only support two methods get and post

20793979
int	chars
expects to see either an int in its argument list or something that can be converted to it for example a chars

20794006
jobs	cron
like you already know there are cron jobs server side wich allow you to execute some php scripts at a precise time on your server host

20794006
google-chrome	safari
1.ajax function for modern browsers google-chrome safari ie10 ios android..

20794023
margin	height
the explanation jquery ui blind effect will set margin 0 while it s animating on the height of your element

20794025
disk	ram
disk space and ram are far cheaper than your labor and they are cheaper than a delay getting your project completed and into the hands of users

20794060
post	get
if all you re submitting is that id and you re using get instead of post you might as well not even use forms and use links instead

20794061
hash	salt
in the db on the api side generate a random salt per user and save the salt and the hash password + salt

20794061
hash	salt
when a request arrives throw on the salt and hash it then compare to what you ve saved

20794070
folder	directory
one option i m looking at right now is to create a native unit test project and use the folder for my model layer project as an include directory for that

20794073
put	get
i know i need new at least once inside the method but if i put the statements shown below outside the loop and either inside or outside render if i omit new from those two lines defining z1 and z0 in the block of code above i get the error

20794084
subtract	add
alternatively you can just calculate the difference between your result on your server and the online php compiler s and use it to add subtract on your functions result hardcoded but that s a bad practice

20794096
folder	directory
i ve made some assumptions based on your directory names that it will be looking for a user s home folder etc

20794218
implements	extends
moreover if you can t modify the class itself you should extends it by creating a wrapper class of the form class mycomplexnumber extends complexnumber and then implements the setter methods for mycomplexnumber

20794242
apache	nginx
i have installed centos6 + apache backend + nginx frontend + apc

20794281
jar	war
to my understanding the pom dependency only fetches the thing specified in their pom like jar or war export bundle

20794287
put	get
in the oncreate getrandomnumber methods returns a random number using which you can get a random image from the array and put it as a background to layout

20794304
super	implements	getter	setter
common problem #2 implements a getter setter and calling super

20794304
getter	setter
internally i suspect that it requires the nsentitydescription to dynamically generate the getter setter for your object

20794304
nsentitydescription	nsmanagedobjectmodel	nsmanagedobjectcontext	nsmanagedobjectmodel	nsmanagedobjectcontext	nsentitydescription
if you don t want the object inserted immediately you can pass nil as the nsmanagedobjectcontext but you must pass in the nsentitydescription acquired from your nsmanagedobjectmodel

20794317
width	height
width and height should be in mm

20803465
for-loop	loops

20803618
width	height
as part of the process i trim each layer before creating a new png file but there are some layers that are either all-white or all-transparent thus causing an alert message to be output whenever you try to trim those layers telling you that trimming the layer would cause it to have no width height thus causing the trim operation to fail

i would like to be able to detect any layers that have a width height but are all-white transparent so that i can remove them from the list of layers and not bother processing them at all

cos	sin
the quaternion itself actually a unit quaternion or versor can be represented as a 4-vector w x y z where w cos 0.5 a and x y z u_x u_y u_z sin 0.5 a meaning a 2 arccos w and u x y z sin 0.5 a x y z sin arccos w

20804993
cos	inverse	cos	sin
following from this the identity quaternion no rotation is 1 0 0 0 as cos 0 1 and sin 0 0 and very usefully the inverse conjugate of a quaternion w -x -y -z represents the opposite rotation x y and z are technically imaginary components

20805035
d3.js	highcharts
the application was based on backbone.js and had svg charts highcharts so it would presumably work with d3.js

20805057
puts	gets
in the generated code i have a button called .update-info in the element appended that when clicked gets the fields above it and puts it into an object array like submitting a form but without leaving the page which will be submitted via ajax

subnet	packets
linux by default will send all packets out the default interface for the subnet which is most likely eth0

20805179
subnet	packets
so to answer your question most packets on your system will probably already go out eth0 assuming it s the same subnet

20805219
hash	salt
the information about the salt and hash methodology is encoded into the hash

20805219
hash	salt
note that password_hash returns the algorithm cost and salt as part of the returned hash

20805219
hash	salt
this allows the verify function to verify the hash without needing separate storage for the salt or algorithm information

20805244
hex	binary
instead encode the binary data as hex or base64 or some other text representation and let the application code convert it back to binary when needed

20805276

google-chrome	firefox
i ve been doing all of my testing for a specific website with ie10+ firefox and google-chrome and i ve got tons of click events on divs and spans

20805610

would be an even better choice as it makes going from portrait to landscape and back a much more pleasant user experience as with height would adopt naturally because of the possible auto-scaling

20805637

20805777
width	height
at first 720p videos were showing with horizontal black bars because the default width and height parameters are 800 x 600

20805777
width	height
changing width and height to 1280 x 720 causes my 4 3 videos to have vertical black bars

20805777
width	height
setting width and height to auto shrinks videos to the size of a thumbnail for some reason

20805791
put	get
what i did to delete the uploaded file is to create a deletebtn in the done and add the click function to it and in there just do an ajax call using that file name i had to also re-create the full file name that get s extra stuff put on it before writing it to disk somewhere then it will delete it from the specified location from your props file

i m using user_id + token in the cookie and saving hash with salt in the db

20806076

when i try to change the height and width using and the height changes perfectly while the width only changes if it is less than the width of the viewport so it wont go wider than 323 pixels

20806076
width	height
they both expand at the same rate and when i log what values i am using for the width and height they are both correct the width just isn t working

20806148
post	get
when you call your password function with a second variable that is not null it will return false unless a post or get variable is set when you call your page

20806148
post	get
the name of that post or get variable needs to be the password hash of the password you hashed the first time you used your function as you are using

20806235

or how can i get width or height of blobs

20806351
division	multiplication
but if you wanna put multiplication division etc

20806351
subtraction	multiplication	division	multiplication	division	subtraction
because multiplication and division has priority over summation and subtraction

20806375
pop-up	dialog
when i tap one i want a pop-up to appear asking for a confirmation so an ok and a cancel button and then conveniently close the dialog and access the user response so that my main activity can do something with it

20806378

i ve followed the instructions from apple and while that fixed my dynamic content height issue it has not solved the issue where the uiscrollview content does not expand to match the width of the screen

20806408
ubuntu	linux
i m using ubuntu linux to do this and attached below is my c++ code

20806438
avro	thrift
it s very compact smaller than protocol buffers and thrift only beaten by avro

20806438
avro	thrift
protocol buffers google originated avro apache based used in hadoop thrift facebook originated now apache project and asn.1 telecom originated all involve some level of code generation where you first express your data in a serializer-specific format then the serializer compiler will generate source code for your language via the code-gen phase

20806504
inherited	properties
if you re on python2.x you should inherited from object since properties are only documented to work with new style classes .

20806509
google-chrome	firefox
this works perfectly fine in current google-chrome and firefox browsers but crashes ie 11

20806598
getter	setter
you need to store your value in a separate private variable instead of using the same name of the property inside the getter setter

20806598
inherited	properties
inherited from object for properties to work right

20806630
ubuntu	linux
i am trying to ftp a file from a windows box running python 3.3 to a linux box running ubuntu 12.04

20806643
int	chars
to make things even worse they re formatted as both 3 and 4 chars int so 830 and 1630 for example not 0830 and 1630

20806658
inherited	properties
i m basically stuck into a double question of object properties inherited and extending base class method

20806658
short	base	inherited	properties
is there a short and elegant way to make and object inherited properties from a base class and extend its existing method

20806658
getter	setter
b.y is not set so we should use a setter and a getter decorator i suppose

20806668
inherited	properties
we have a fairly elaborate data model built from an existing database then enhanced using partial classes to support additional methods properties inherited etc

20806668
dbcontext	objectcontext
we have not yet bitten the bullet to update this from objectcontext to dbcontext

20806683
int	chars
the ord builtin function takes a string and turns it into an int that s its corresponding unicode code point for chars in the ascii chars set that s the same as their value in the ascii table

20806754
for-loop	loops
i have a vector of i insert elements in a for-loop and then if i try to access some element s function outside loops it will give me an access violation

20806767
division	modulo
since starttime and endtime are both integers you can use simple modulo and division to separate minutes and hours

20806801
mdpi	hdpi	screens	hdpi	screens	mdpi
and i want to convert size of it to other screens sizes xxhdpi hdpi mdpi ldpi

20806811
spaces	delimiter
my problem is that the file is spaces delimiter and the first variable has some entries that include a spaces so reading into r creates an error due to different rows having more columns

20806840
chown	sudo
sudo chown -r root wheel system library frameworks python.framework versions 2.7

20806849
floating-point	integer
this is because of integer division - neither operand is a floating-point value so the floating point result is discarded

20806854
google-chrome	firefox
on ie7 8 google-chrome firefox it works just like i see it on dreamweaver

20806859
mouse	keyboard	minix	linux
mouse and keyboard functions in the minix neo -- and probably android devices in general -- builds on the desktop linux keyboard and mouse support specifically on dev hidraw -- the human input drivers

20806859
bluetooth	usb	mouse	keyboard	hid	keyboard	minix	linux
a variety of external mice keyboards or air mouse keyboards can be connected to the minix neo x5 x7 by usb bluetooth or other wired or wireless connection and feed mouse events of keyboard events to the normal linux hid processing that java -- and the android apps consume

20806859
mouse	keyboard
i use this air mouse keyboard with the neo x5

20806859
mouse	keyboard
air mouse means that the device is not placed on a desk but accelerometers in the device allow you to wave the thing around to produce mouse movement. what ever perhaps proprietary protocol is used between the device and the device driver is converted in the device driver to a data stream that emulates the signals that a conventional old style wired mouse or keyboard produced

20806868
int	chars
you might also consider just getting a substring of the first chars in the string and trying to convert it to an int and if it fails then the same thing is true

20806880
for-loop	arrays
you are thinking procedurally write a for-loop that fills your ui with content from an arrays

20806885
spaces	delimiter
selects elements that have the specified attribute with a value containing a given word delimiter by spaces

20806896
profiling	debugging
for debugging the regionservers you can take a look at jprofiler this is mentioned in the hbase wiki as the profiling they use

20806919
range	max
the shuffle algorithm involves initializing an array of size n where every element is equal to its index picking k random numbers each number in a range with the max one less than the previous range then swapping elements towards the end of the array

20806949
screens	mdpi
then undo and set the resolution to 160 dpi for mdpi screens and the image will scale to 1 2 the original so it will be 30 30 - save it

20806951
translation	localization
the storyboard localization process works fine because it creates me all strings files with label text and it actually apply the translation in all cases but on splabel

20806957
fadein	fadeout
and also i would like the fadein and fadeout transition to be smoother - currently it fadeins before it fadeouts then fadein again

20807036
rel	src
rel 0 html5 1 in the src

20807075
versioning	upgrade
i recommend to upgrade to last versioning of ksoap because may be you ll have to use

20807114
fadein	fadeout
you can fadein the content of the div tag after the end of fadeout operation by doing this

20807148
implements	extends
ok so i know that an anonymous inner class is either implicitly extends a parent class or implements an interface and therefore a constructor of the superclass will need to be called

20807185
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
the non-obvious one is that you have a global variable editing which is set in touchesbegan for whichever point you are editing and then used in an or condition in touchesmoved meaning that as soon as you drag anything it immediately falls through to the first point of the first item in the array

20807185
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
you should be determining which point of which segment is being edited in touchesbegan and then in touchesmoved only doing anything if you are editing a particular point - don t try and work out what you are editing again

20807198
public	protected
also you always want to use access modifiers ie public private or protected

20807236
getter	setter
the abstract base class can even assign an arbitrary object in a setter and the subclass setter getter still works

20807241
post	put
i m pretty uncomfortable with this and think that we should post to create and put to update but since browser support is somehwat iffy in terms of put and delete the argument is we should do it this way

20807273
client-side	server-side
php is designed as server-side scripting language js for client-side

20807288
textview	imageview
but there is going to be textview and imageview like a half activity

20807299
button	checkbox
the blur event doesn t fire on checkbox and radio button in some browsers

20807355
implements	extends
i solved it by implements another converter which extends entityconverter and checks if the id is null

20807359
children	parent
create a parent model so that all the children models will have one or two attributes from the parent model

20807359
post	get
use javascript in order to get data from the server to gather and post data without messing up each other payments on the view already

20807360
lxml	elementtree
i ve used both the elementtree built-in to python as well as the lxml libraries but get the same results

20807360
lxml	elementtree
i would like to continue using elementtree if i can but if there are limitations to that library then lxml would do

20807360
children	parent
now as the above hand modified example shows each connection id parent has the appropriate classes classnames children

20807371
hide	show
execute the code below after your show hide logic

20807376
int	chars
you re putting int into a chars array

20807390
folder	directory
iis 8 express does not have any gui so i cannot go into it create a virtual directory point to the physical folder where the web app files are

the function handleresponse just parses the responseapdu from binary to hex an highlights the statusword

20807455
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox work fine

20807490
folder	directory
how do i define sub projects in a nested directory tree where the sub-project folder are not immediate children of the root project

20807494
getter	setter
i also see that you can access the current document s body via window.document.body however there are no getter setter methods for this body property

20807499
versioning	upgrade
finally i ve never noticed this bug before recently and the only thing that s changed since it was first created is that the android versioning was upgrade from some flavor jelly bean to kitkat

20807548
fflush	gets
though i can reproduce the behavior that updates are not fflush although the session object gets disposed correctly

20807580
ant	maven
if you are using ant you probably need to collect the tests into test suites but if you are using maven the test plugins for maven will find all your test classes for you so you don t need suites

20807605
post	get
this query will get or select the title and content columns from the post table where the id value of the row is equal to 42

20807647
hash	salt
after a little bit of research and some work i finally was able to hash salt the password now there is a question which is on my mind i have used the sha1 method and i would like to try to use the sha512 because i was told it s better more secure so the following is my code its a little bit all over the place but i think its comprehensible so

20807659
dbcontext	objectcontext
but it for objectcontext and i need for the dbcontext

20807685
apache	nginx
basically my advice if you really need this functionality install apache and maybe just use nginx to server assets and proxy to apache

20807731
folder	directory
my current directory where i have the executable file and java file is in a folder called auto-mkvmerge

20807739

20807847
typedef	struct
of course you can also rename the original foo to genericfoo or something and provide a foo struct with a typedef to it so that you offer a consistent interface

20807981
fadein	fadeout
when pushing on a button the content of a div should fadeout delay change it to another content fadein

20808005
free	malloc
if you feel the need to use malloc and free for dynamic allocation then there are some good answers already here

20808059
width	height
i have a parent div with a specific height and width

post	get
i m new to posting but i ve yet to see a post with a .mdb on it so i m not sure how best to get the details needed for this one

20808104
outputstream	inputstream
each client should have their own inputstream and outputstream server-sided

20808118
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
given it places in the inner loops arraykey will get incremented many times per iteration of the for-loop and will thus exceed the size of the arrays easily

20808120
getter	setter
the data requires no flow control getter setter that maintain or protect an internal state nor starts acquiring any major functionality

20808140
inherited	properties
i ve been using the js console mainly to view js objects as it displays all the properties methods and inherited stuff in a neat little pick list

in python pandas there is a function to create an arrays of 1 2 3 4 5 6 ...n and then using the values in the arrays instead of using a for-loop

20808412
disk	ram
with so many threads their working sets are large enough to occupy all available ram so every thread context switch requires that the currently running thread is written to virtual memory disk and the next available thread is read from disk

when i use the controller action as recommended from the previous post i get to here localhost home logout and this isn t correct

20808555
post	get
to use another real-world analogy it is a bit like addressing an item of post to a town or village - without including the recipient name street or house number - and then expecting it to be received and to get a response

20808568
doc	rtf
one big challenge is to convert microsoft word doc docx and rtf contents to and from our proprietary data model

ant	maven
i found examples of how to use maven but nothing for ant

20808851
width	height
i ve tried exactly what you need before and after alot of research found out that for some reason you must have a preview started and even showing that content in a surfaceview to be able to get the picture apparently the system behind the scenes flushes whatever is in the buffer for the surfaceview rendering the preview now what i did to overcome this issue taking the picture without preview was just to set the surfaceview in my layout to 1dp width and 1dp height notice it has to be 1dp 0dp will cause a crash

20808856
getter	setter
it is the equivalent of writing setter and getter methods

20808865
tilemill	mapnik
customising the style is of course much easier if you re using tilemill rather than pure mapnik xml

pop-up	dialog
you have to use findelement to get the dialog to pop-up

20808988

if it fails with a 401 i need to tell the view to pop-up a modal dialog asking for the username password and then retry the http request

20808991
portrait	landscape
turn to landscape orientation modal view obviously stays in portrait orientation

20809001
portrait	landscape
in case of portrait mode the list is a classic list and in landscape mode a grid should be shown

20809032
hide	show
keep track of whether the user is authenticated using the root scope and then you can just hide show partial depending on that boolean

20809043
min	max
the issue you re having is that you are searching for a vector min max and instead you should be searching by each of the verctor dimensions two in your case

20809043
min	max
so you should look for the min for x and the min for y and the same for the max

20809064
post	get
firstly you need to understand the difference between get and post method

20809070
width	height
use this after initializing video control change width and height as you see fit

20809070
width	height
videocontrol.setdisplaysize width + 4 height - 25

20809115
children	parent
the word all in previous paragraph really means all it doesn t respect the normal flow of cascade delete from parent to children

20809115
children	parent
this method can also flow in reverse direction from children to parent and because it is recursive your parent s navigation properties will be loaded and deleted as well

20809144
3des	aes
hmacsha1 is used even if validation is set to aes or 3des

20809172

20809515
hash	salt
even though the password is hash and salt or should be eve likely still has access to the hash function and salt

20809522
hide	show
you could use javascript to hide the page as soon as it is executed and then show it again when the page is ready onload as suggested by php_nub_qq

20809522
hide	show
however if you had a slow mobile browser it might happen that the page appears in the browser then the javascript executes and hide and then show the page leading to nasty flickering

20809530
onresume	onpause
in the main activity i have radio buttons in the method public void onradiobuttonclicked view view i associate each radio button selected with a value so i have two variables a and b after that i click on the button bton i have according to the method ajouter a and b values into database.until now everything is okey i decide to use onresume and onpause methods to save the state of activity so when i return to the activity i see that the radio buttons are selected the problem comes when i click on button to save info i get 0 as value for a and b in database instead of values that i saw selected and the weird thing is that when i click again on thoses radio buttons and after that on save button i get the right values

20809643

i would rather just hide and show them and insert them to the dom by default demo

20809701
hide	show
and then show and hide them according to the checkboxes

20809711
hash	salt
seems 1 big catch point for making strong user password hash is using random salt as opposed to static ones

20809711
hash	salt
the random salt changes each time so if i stored it now and the user re-logged in the hash would be different so the db password wouldnt match the posted one..

20809760
linefeed	delimiter
bash uses linefeed as its line delimiter so when it reads from the second file it leaves the cr at the end of each line

20809761
octal	binary
there s a couple of other alternative representations this way - 0 as a prefix means the number is octal and since java 7 0b means it s binary

20809761
octal	binary	octal	hex	hex	binary
hex is by far the most used of these though since the octal notation is incredibly confusing and binary literals were a much later addition

20809782
draggable	droppable
hi guys i have a 2 draggable divs #schedule and #events and a droppable div #droppable

20809810
bower	npm
after the scaffolding is complete you must run the commands bower install and npm install to install the required packages described in the bower.json and package.json files

20809813
hide	show
so far i only know that you can emit a loading and doneloading event for the show hide of the one div though that only works with a single http request

20809814
hide	show
#in order to hide errors show to user by php

20809815
fadein	fadeout
the solution is to cache the elements that are fadeout then fadein them inside a promise

20809859
width	height
so i can scroll horizontally 3x the width of my viewport and i can scroll vertically 2x the height of my viewport

20809865
hide	show
js code for modal with options to show hide modal footer and there buttons within docready and after the foundation call also includes js for close modal link in footer since they did away with data-dismiss modal

20809867
width	height
when i output the width and height of the div it says 100 100

20809916
hash	salt
seems 1 big catch point for making strong user password hash is using random salt as opposed to static ones

20809916
hash	salt
the salt is included in the password hash itself

20809916
hash	salt
note that password_hash returns the algorithm cost and salt as part of the returned hash

20809916
hash	salt
this allows the verify function to verify the hash without needing separate storage for the salt or algorithm information

20809916
hash	salt
the algorithm cost and salt are all returned with the hash

20809916
crypt	hash
we could have created the same hash by using crypt directly which is precisely what password_hash does behind the scenes

20809916
hash	salt
if everyone used the same salt then users with the same password would also have the same hash

20809932
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
deploy to amazon-web-services elastic beanstalk

20809932
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
amazon-web-services elastic beanstalk environment

20809945
pull	push
since iostreams have a push interface which won t be married easily with a pull interface it seem you d best implement a stream which buffers all output until it is complete and at this point have libcurl pull for the readily available buffer

20809962
post	get
a web application running on a web browser needs to do everything with get and post requests

20809979
super	self
i have tried it with self super and i think this example shows what i really want to go on

20809988

configuring the php development environment in linux ubuntu -

20810009
post	get
today we were able to capture all rest calls the idea is that once you get an error automatically post the stacktrace of that error plus the responses of the rest saved services so we can detect reproduce and solve the problems in almost an identical environment situation

20810025
put	get
everything appears too match up in my eclipse when i put it all together but when i try to run it i immediate get an illegalstateexception

20810026
skshapenode	skeffectnode
i added the resulting skshapenode to an skeffectnode so that i could utilize the shouldrasterize property to cache the shape otherwise your framerate will be horrible

20810048
octal	decimal
the unicode code point for lowercase a is 0x61 in hexadecimal 97 in decimal or 0141 in octal

20810052
min	max
if you create a datepicker with min and max options like this

20810052
min	max
you could either create your own widget or you could remove the min max restrictions temporarily for setting your value

20810072
mutators	setter	mutators	getter	getter	setter
if this is a concerns i recommend not exposing an array directly but create a selector and mutators getter and setter to access and modify the data

20810072
getter	setter
alternatively you can you use actual getter and setter if you know you re not supporting older js runtimes

20810072
getter	setter
the following jsfiddle shows getter and setter in action

20810083
stdout	stderr
i have a script which we will call script.sh that writes to both stdout and stderr

20810083
stdout	stderr
via mailx i get the script s stdout output but i still get an email from cron containing the script s stderr output

20810089
width	height
i have a screen set up and i want to send the width and height to another class

20810089
width	height
edit i feel like creating an instance of classa in classb would be bad programming because it is unnessary besides the fact that i need the width and height

20810108
rspec	capybara
how can i get capybara rspec to find the content there

20810112
getter	setter
getter get values setter set values

20810112
width	height
either way you probably want getters to ensure encapsulation of your width and height variables they should be declared private

20810132
children	parent
wikipedia states that if you have a node to delete with 2 leaf children and the sibling is also a node with 2 leaf children then we can simply remove the node and recolor the parent and sibling

20810134
integer	unsigned
and realized that postgresql does not support unsigned integer

20810134
integer	unsigned
most of the time i use unsigned integer as auto incremented primary key in mysql

20810135
setinterval	settimeout
an advantage of setinterval over a recursive settimeout is that you will not be spawning multiple timers per iteration but instead just one timer

20810139
move	drag
the move event can be done by click or drag as long as the goal is accomplished

20810160
inherited	properties
first you bind the view to the viewmodel when you add the user control to the view it will effectively inherited the datacontext and you can bind the dependency properties you ve created to the various parts of the viewmodel

20810181
for-loop	loops
the table contains data for many different groups and i m trying to move from a for-loop to a foreach loops using the doparallel package to take advantage of the multicore processor installed

20810181
disk	ram
i think that what is happening is that the large data.table containing all data is copied into each new process hence i run out of ram and windows starts swapping to disk

20810197
children	parent
according to the spritekit programming guide the zposition of children are relative to the height of the parent

20810202
width	height
based on your question it sounds like class a has data besides height and width that is irrelevant to class b in which case you shouldn t really give class b the instance of class a

20810202
width	height
you ll probably want getters in class a regardless since you probably don t want the values being updated at whim by any other object in the code which means width and height should be private variables in class a

20810202
width	height
if width and height are required for class b i would make them part of b s constructor

20810202
width	height
otherwise i would write 2 or 4 constructors one with no parameters and 1 that takes both width and height if you really want to be thorough you can write 2 more constructors - that take just a height and just a width respectively

20810202
width	height
in that instance you ll also need setters for height and width in class b so a user can set them after instantiating an object of type b

20810204
getter	setter
in your context it would be a good practice to implement the getter and setter methods you have mentioned

20810211
rspec	capybara
if you indeed don t use capybara turn on render_views so rspec won t stub out the actual template rendering step

for arrays of objects you d use foreach or a for-loop 0 to array.length and for the object of objects you d use object.keys or a for-in loops

20811626
width	height
your problem description lacks some detail so i m not sure what you mean by not looking nice. looking at your code right away i see that you are fighting against bootstrap by setting width and height styles

20811626
width	height

this is what i use it may be a better option for you it is based on the camera the reason that your vector2.lerp is not working correctly i think is because of your time variable in it you could refer to this lerp and tweak your t variable until it is good for you or you can try this this is what i use also i subtract from x and add to y so my finger isnt over the graphic best of luck

note this code requires a fairly modern browser think ie10 google-chrome or recent builds of firefox

20821280
typedef	struct
in the fixed code alias mystruct is given to the struct using typedef and the objects are created using that alias type which are then operated upon normally

20822853
superclass	subclassing
i mean a superclass doesn t know anything about its subclassing so i don t see how this could be

20822853
superclass	subclassing

there were a few environment changes needed for qt5.1 to get a qprinter ie add to the project .pro file and but there seems to be a more fundamental problem that qquickview doesn t provide anything which is obviously compatible with the qgraphicsview qpainter qpaintdevice world of qprinter specifically qquickview has no render method and all the drawing painting rendering-related methods it does have seem very tied up with opengl

20825233

i solved this by examining systemparametersinfo - spi_getnonclientmetrics value and using the imenuheight value for timagelist width height

to avoid the issue you can use ob_start and output buffering although i d strongly suggest separating displaying html from the code setting the headers by either using a template language such as smarty or twig or a more extensive framework with a complete mvc model

however when i repeatedly call the function for example when using a for-loop to fill an arrays with pseudo-random numbers almost no time has passed and therefore the seed is the same making each number in the arrays the same

20826902
prng	random
without your prng is just a hash function applies to the seed generation which is usually not very random

the alarmmanager holds a wakelock

20826983
prng	random
you may simply add some delay or sleep in order not to have the same time in the seed but as others suggested you should not generate your own prng you may want to add some mouse position some packets receive or other factors in order to increase the randomness but it will still not a good way to generate random numbers

20826986

20827604
width	height
that is any padding or border specified on the element is laid out and drawn inside this specified width and height

20827604
width	height
the content width and height are calculated by subtracting the border and padding widths of the respective sides from the specified â widthâ and â heightâ properties

you can do a loops with a while or for-loop

20831160
width	height
in this case the image changes size via having a width of 100 so it s always 100 of the width of the page but the height is changed via the at-rule

20831160
width	height
you can also make the image smoothly resize its height via the screen width by just adding height auto

20831160

ps i suggest using google-chrome or firefox in combination with firebug so that you can see these things for yourself if you ve got some experience with web developing

20831239
strncpy	fread
while i was using the fread and strncpy commands i have noticed that both need to have the n character as the end reference point

20831239
strncpy	fread

htmlgenericcontrol	onclientclick
in the case of a it will be an htmlgenericcontrol which simply writes out the onclientclick attribute of your element as it is

20831432

20831786
superclass	subclassing
suppose we have a class named superclass and another class named subclassing extends it

20831786
superclass	subclassing
now a superclass reference can be assigned to an object of the type subclassing as well

20831786
superclass	subclassing
if we have a method say somemethod in the superclass which we override in the subclassing then a call of that method on a superclass reference can only be resolved at runtime as the compiler can t be sure of what type of object this reference would be pointing to at runtime

20831786
superclass	subclassing
here we see that even though both the object references superclass1 and superclass2 are of type superclass only but at run time they refer to the objects of types superclass and subclassing respectively

20831838
hash	md5
pragmatic solution just create a quick to compute but hard to predict hash like md5 from the ip address and use only the first 24 bits of the result

20831838
hash	md5
yes md5 is obsolete as a cryptographic hash function but this doesn t matter at all in this case

box-sizing	border-box
if you re ok with using css3 you can use the calc function coupled with box-sizing border-box

20832180
width	border-box	box-sizing	border-box
note the reason why i added box-sizing border-box was to make it easier to calculate the center div s width

20832180
box-sizing	border-box
if you don t want box-sizing border-box you can substract the sum of the widths of the left and right borders on the floating divs which amounts to a total of 6px like this

20832186
hide	show
i m using a toggle which is hide or show and that s why it appeared that the code was not working when in fact is was

20844119
for-loop	loops
i am getting either 1 or 2 as the output for all test cases.i think this is because the for-loop at the end of the solution is only running either once or twice only.i am not able to identify why is loops ending after atmost 2 iterations.what is wrong with my solution

20844136
put	get
you can put it inside src java but that solution will not be standard as it really will not be treated as a grails domain example once you get deeper into the application

for-loop	loops
however when i run the program it only loops through the for-loop twice only copying pictures and documents

20845243
for-loop	loops
after hours of tinkering and i now know it cant work regex but would it be able to write a for-loop that loops through two tokens of the string at a time and if they both equal an operator then you can assume that the second must be a negative value

20845259

step through it with a debugger like google-chrome dev tools or firebug for firefox

20845602
rss	feed
it is for a rss feed

20845677
hive	hdfs
it doesn t mean it is on the local filesystem - it must be on hdfs on the same hadoop cluster that hive is pointing to

20845677
hive	hdfs
since it is hdfs data hive queries on it is treated exactly the same as if you had written a mapreduce job operating on that data directly

20845702
integer	unsigned
an ipv4 address is 4 bytes if stored as unsigned integer

20845702
integer	unsigned
an ipv6 address is 16 bytes if stored as an unsigned integer

20845746
jboss	weblogic
note javax.enterprise.inject.spi is not available - if you think this package would help i need to know the oldest versions of jboss and weblogic that provide it

20845753
keydown	keyup
kcgkeyboardeventkeycode uses keys to access an integer field that contains the virtual keycode of the keydown or keyup event

20845768
width	height
the parent div spans the page width 100 but should the div height be a percentage and how should i make the buttons

20845772
int	chars
the chars - are replaced with there ascii code and manipulated as they are int

20845773
range	max	range	min	min	max
- instead of that i want to ask him what the min and max len not a set len and get that full range in my results

20845800
int	chars
originally this was int float chars

20845822
width	height
the height or width of the square an em is used as a unit of space used by the text

20845823
implements	extends
for this purpose you should create a custom validator that extends validatorsupport and implements validate method which is inherited from validator interface but doesn t have default implementation

20845854
addclass	removeclass
only use addclass or removeclass from jquery

20845869
int	boolean
if you used int with 0 false and 1 true instead of boolean as c and byte code does you could write

20845954
folder	directory
5 - saved a text file in the top level of the directory outside of the android project folder that says â œhiâ on the inside

20846026
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
google-chrome and firefox are the same but safari looks to have little less margins

20846026
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
so i have a 2 margin for each of the masonry items which works fine when on google-chrome firefox but on safari the margin is tiny

20846026
google-chrome	firefox
on google-chrome firefox the margin left applies to each item

20846054
cpython	pypy
so switching from cpython to pypy gives you almost as much benefit as switching from int to gmpy2.mpz in python 3 and significantly more benefit in python 2

20846055
int	chars
chars literals are just integral values so you have a simple arithmetic expression of int

20846104
pop-up	dialog
i gonna mention that it is pop-up dialog windows when i try put this on a other row

20846110
opencart	oscommerce
i had a 301 htaccess rule that redirected all old urls from our oscommerce website but when i enable seo urls within the new opencart admin panel the redirect for the old urls no longer works

20846110
opencart	oscommerce
i m thinking that it may have something to do with the fact that oscommerce and opencart both have directories named catalog at the root directory level

20846112
ant	ivyde
with ivyde you can manage non java dependencies and put them any place you want just like the ant task retrieve

20846134
bower	npm
then run npm install and bower install

20846160
matlab	simulink
i want to integrate a simulink model into a matlab script to do different things in a loop with the simulink part of the program

20846183
addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	addition
i am writing my own game about mental operations in your head such as addition subtraction multiplication and division

20846183
subtraction	addition
right now the game is running smoothly with addition and subtraction operations but what i want now is to ask to the user his her guess but if he she delays 5 seconds the input message should disappear the correct result should appear and another operation should appear

20846230
post	get
also this blog post has a nice example of the surprise most programmers will get

20846244
prepare	execute
sounds like a bad idea but you could do it with prepare statement from sql and execute statement like this sqlfiddle

20846287
websphere	ibm
using ibm websphere application server liberty profile and developer tools for eclipse plugin

20846302
width	height
i assume unless height and width of the block is not defined its will be zero

20846389
mp3	wav
from amr file to mp3 or wav or pcm

20846393
width	height
so its width is 100 but since it is empty its height is 0px

20846393
width	height
then its width will be 0px so its height too

20846399
express	node.js
we have built an app based on node.js and express

20846401
salt	md5
i know how to add md5 to the password in js but md5 isn t secure anymore and i can t add a salt with js because everyone can find out what the salt is

20846415
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
the code produces strange results in these browsers and works fine in google-chrome safari firefox and opera

20846415
width	margin
inner container has a set width and margin 0 auto to keep it centered

20846427
put	get
when i put a valid or invalid sql statement in action_sql i always get printed

20846429
uu-parsinglib	parsec
i know parsec and uu-parsinglib and i ve written parsers in both of them

20846429
backtracking	greedy	uu-parsinglib	parsec
the difference is that in parsec many would eat pairs of ab greedy until it is not matched anymore while in uu-parsinglib plist_ng is not greedy so it will keep in memory possible backtracking ways after parsing each

20846429
uu-parsinglib	parsec
with parsec we would get error because ptest is greedy parsing pairs of ab but in uu-parsinglib the string would be parsed with no problems

20846429
uu-parsinglib	parsec
and a sample input of ababa would success in parsec but fail in uu-parsinglib when using greedy plist

20846449
uiview	calayer
the uiview implementation of this calls the equivalent calayer method and so has the same behavior as calayer

20846478
awt	swing
jframe is from swing and frame is more outdated from awt

20846478
awt	swing
here you have more information swing vs awt

20846505
awt	swing
jframe is swing frame is awt

20846508
put	get
using this page you could implement your logic in the acceptcallback method to get the socket that s connected and put it in an object

20846511
stdout	stderr
i am using the glib vala function glib.process.spawn_async_with_pipes which outputs some ints corresponding to stdin stdout and stderr

20846512
glfw	glew
i figured it out and for anyone ever encountering the issue i will try and make clear what exactly i did to finally be able to create opengl projects with the setup mingw + glew + glfw

20846512
glfw	glew
in the includes tab add the paths to the include folders of glfw and glew

20846512
glfw	glew
again for me this is d external cpp glew include and analogous for glfw

20846512
glfw	glew
in library paths do the same for the folders lib glew and lib-mingw glfw

20846514
awt	swing
jframe is part of the swing library frame is part of the awt library

20846514
awt	swing
generally swing is more efficient and advanced than awt

20846524
google-chrome	firefox
in ie and google-chrome it works fine in firefox it always return 0 as version major number before installing of flash player and after

20846540
range	max	range	min	min	max
i am creating a program where the user teacher enters a bunch of percentage grades and these grades get analyzed and an outputbox prints out the average min max range and the number of grades that are level r level 1 level 2 and so on

20846548
ubuntu	debian
debian or ubuntu have additional infrastructure to allow multiple versions in parallel

20846564
google-chrome	firefox
code posted works for me in the current and a few previous builds of firefox google-chrome and ie however i m getting users reporting in that the button does nothing

20846577
post	get
and date_day instead of _post date_day and date_month instead of _post date_month etc -- do that for all your post and get variables

20846586
vim	notepad++
i tried both the notepad++ as well as vim solutions to no avail

20846588
children	parent
this is an array of form elements that are children to the parent form so for my problem i set the child element in the directive to dirty using

20846628
children	parent
you can do it in your query so all your parent and their children are already sorted before you even insert them into the array

20846628
children	parent
the way your joining tells me you have parent and children in one table it just seems weird wrong

20846628
children	parent
so an example output would be im assumming each parent only has a right or left child but this works for any amount of children

20846628
children	parent
children array should contain all children in order of their parent then themselves

20846632
button	checkbox
the checked binding links a checkable form control â a checkbox or a radio button â with a property on your view model

20846637
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
in this case inserting via the insertitemtemplate fails due to controls located in the insertitemtemplate showing server side as containing no data includes textbox checkbox dropdownlistfor etc

20846650
getter	setter
not only because it makes ef work but also because it s commonly discouraged to put much logic in property setter or getter

20846691
post	get
1 web api decides which controller is called based on the uri the client calls and that web api decides which method in that controller is called based on what type get post etc

20846698
selecteditem	selectedindex
combobox have a property called selecteditem and selectedindex as well

20846777
hide	show
writing an ui programmatically allows you to make it dynamic not only in the sense of if this checkbox is toggled then hide show that element - this could be done in qml in the same way or easier

20846778
mp3	wav
from amr file to mp3 or wav or pcm

20846809
put	get
what you will have to do is traverse the tree yourself to get the elements out and put them in an associative array

20846819
hide	show
use tfloatanimations to hide show slide appear the tlayouts

20846861
onclick	preventdefault
2 the anchor inside the div is reloading your page onclick so you will never see the effect you are looking for unless you stop that element from performing it s intended action usingjquery s preventdefault on it

20846879
memcpy	strcpy
there is no way to copy more than one zero in a c string - unless you use a function other than strcpy for example memcpy

20846879
memcpy	strcpy
but then you can t do a simple strcpy you would have to do memcpy

20846885
post	get
when i try to visit the page of the post i get this error

20846898
google-chrome	firefox
there is nothing wrong your your code i ve tested in google-chrome on three different macs and on windows 7 8 and also firefox ie where available

20846907
width	height
all have a width of 912 but the height vary

20846930
hide	show
your functions with hide and show functions are called only once during page loading

20847027
versioning	upgrade
upgrade the rspec versioning in the gemfile

20847077
width	height
therefore width and height properties should be converted to an integer with toint function

20847141
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
when you write a for..in loops over the elements of an arrays the compiler deals with that by inlining a classic for-loop

20847163
uicollectionview	uitableview
in fact i m seriously considering replacing all uitableview in my future projects with uicollectionview which are far more adaptable

20847181
hash	salt
since salting really only creates a certain number of different values that a particular plaintext hash to instead of the password password hashing to value x1 with for example a 16-bit salt there are 65536 different possible values that it can hash to the effect of salting is really only to change the constant multiplicative factor in the equation

20847181
hash	salt
yes it will take more time to match the hash of a particular password by a factor of up to however big your salt is but it really doesn t change the o complexity measure

20847196
post	get
however the method to get uploadid is a post http request and getpresignedurlrequest method does not take post as an http verb

20847196
post	get
i finally ended up putting a bucket policy where i granted my amazon s3 account permission on the bucket in question which does not belong to me and using that account i am doing http post to get uploadid

20847289
post	get
however i get this error back when making the post

20847289
post	get
i am thinking this is because of an issue with my api routing defaulting to get requests and then failing to accept post types even though it is made explicit in the ajax call

20847317
google-chrome	firefox
it s working for me ok in google-chrome but then i tried it in firefox and i find that inline editing doesn t work

20847317
google-chrome	firefox
i traced the problem down to the fact that on mousedown event clicks happen with grid cells that the handler ui-disableselection gets called in firefox but not in google-chrome

20847353
express	koa	express	node.js
koa is a web framework for node.js designed by the team behind express aiming to be a smaller more expressive and more robust foundation for web applications and apis

20847354
express	koa
koa is a new web framework designed by the team behind express which aims to be a smaller more expressive and more robust foundation for web applications and apis

20847364
width	height
you need to add to x and y position 1 2 of the width and height of the rectangle

20847365
google-chrome	firefox
i did some thorough researching experimenting with different expires headers and different approaches and i came up with this that was tried on google-chrome 31 and firefox 26

20847365
google-chrome	firefox
i must have tried this more than a hundred times and google-chrome didn t reload a single image from cache whereas firefox would in some rare cases behave unpredictably and reload but only when cache-control headers were set to 0 no-cache or were altogether missing

20847365
google-chrome	firefox
with this the browser network consoles stay quiet even if you leave the computer to come back an hour later to loop through the images remember tested on google-chrome and firefox only

20847371
post	get
two-column layouts there is a so post on how to get multi-column slides from pandoc but it is latex- rather than html-oriented

20847380
puts	gets
i m trying to learn some of the basics of c and i have been reading nonstop about gets fgets puts scanf and can t seem to get this right.

20847461
apache	nginx
i have just switched my servers away from apache mod_wsgi to go towards a nginx uwsgi stack

20847470
int	chars
you should cast each chars value to unsigned int so it works properly with the 02x format.

20847475
uiview	subviews
a subviews was added to this view could have been a controller but i just made it a uiview

20847496
put	get
the problem is that if i put for example 2014-01-20 in the text_field i will get 1993 in the temp variable

20847664
put	get
so if i put some logic in onrestart method which forces the activity to get re-rendered with fresh data then i can reach my goal

20847682
int	double
dgemm works on double precision real numbers not on int of any kind

20847686
portrait	landscape
this view with a series of buttons is properly designed for portrait but not for landscape

20847740
hide	show
i would love to learn how to hide and show elements in html using dart

20847786
free	malloc
there is no need to malloc or free

20847801
min	max
i have created a jquery datepicker and set the min max years

20847822
post	get
i want to get tags of a post

20847849
glut	glew
i am doing terminal application in xcode using c c++ i don t want to use glut glew

20847866
post	get
mainly the integration with node because i have been at this for a couple of days trying stuff out myself and reading blog post but i can t get it to work

20847879
post	get
i have already seen some post on this but i cannot get it to work

20847929
salt	md5
yes i know md5 passwords are not recommended and that will be changed to use salt once i can get functionality in my app

20847976
min	max
the statistics you can calculate with min max functions

20848006
min	max
the default annotations of min max size would be great to use on custom types

20848007
width	height
now i want to get the size width and height of an image

20848061
fread	textscan
i suggest to use textscan instead of fread

20848112
width	height
try adding some items that has a width or height and you should see the scroll viewer

20848118
spaces	delimiter
the first delimiter is a spaces the other two are

20848129
accessor	properties
but it is not triggering the accessor to my view model properties editingmytargetfield with the following line in my xaml

20848161
width	height
you cannot specify width height for inline elements

20848170
width	height
inline elements cannot have defined height or width they take the height and width of their contents

20848184
post	get
in my view i have input field to search the post title and 4 checkboxes where when i check the first check box which is buying i get all results from the post who have assignation buying

20848184
post	get
but when i check also to see and buying and selling post i dont get any results

20848214
maven	pom.xml
i have a parent maven pom.xml that looks like this the oss-parent can be seen here

20848221
selecteditem	selectedindex
you have not bound the selecteditem selectedvalue or selectedindex property of your internal combobox to anything so it maintains its selection

20848221
selecteditem	selectedindex
so to answer your question you will probably want to bind either selecteditem selectedvalue or selectedindex of your tcardqueryparameters usercontrol to a property on the datacontext which in your case appears to be another different usercontrol

20848224
width	height
divide the original height and width by 2

20848250
spaces	delimiter
it appears the extra spaces are kept once you switch delimiter

20848259
hide	show
the li items are floated left to create a strip of content and carousel-container has overflow hidden to hide the elements within the strip not currently on show

20848264
put	get
i couldn t figure out where to put it to get it to typecheck

20848332
post	get
refer to get_permalink if you want to get the permalink for a post given its unique post id

20848345
getter	setter
i ve got 2 classes - one is rb.h where there are all the functions needed such as insert and delete to provide functionality for the tree another is node.h which consists of the basic attributes of the node and the corresponding getter setter functions to provide for encapsulation

20848361
libstdc++	libc++
mac os x 10.9+ no longer uses gcc libstdc++ but uses libc++ and clang

20848392
getter	setter
i m a beginning ios developer and still getting accustomed to this concept of synthesized variables and xcode automatically creating variables and setter getter methods

20848426
for-loop	loops
if you want to use for loops for whatever reason the for-loop is looping over the date objects not the numbers

20848474
getter	setter	accessor	properties
if you manually create both accessor the setter and the getter for an properties the compiler assumes you don t need want it to synthesize them -- and the corresponding instance variable -- for you

20848474
accessor	properties
or my preferred approach use an explicit synthesize statement above your custom accessor to tell the compiler that you do still want to synthesize an instance variable for the properties

20848502
width	height
this sets the play button to be next to the left and top and the right and bottom are set to be left top plus the width height

20848546
roboguice	robolectric
i m searching the web and still not found nothing on how to integrate robolectric 2.0 with roboguice 2.0 i also use mockito as mocking framework and there s no problem with it

20848546
roboguice	robolectric
just don t know how to integrate robolectric with roboguice

20848580
cos	sin
allowed must be variable named x no other variables numerics 0-9 math operations brackets no other types and functions abs e x ln log sin cos tan asin acos atan sinh cosh tanh

20848600
slideup	slidedown
you could try switching slideup with slidedown which is designed to take an element with zero height and slide it down to its target height hence making it visible

20848713
bmp	png
use png or bmp or something lossless

20848714
put	get
however when i put in 2 inputs i get an error instead of the usage prompt even though 2 is not equal to 3

20848742
std	ostream
it seems you want to get the best formatting which is the default for std ostream you can use g lg for long double to have the formatting function decide how the values should be formatted

20848780
children	parent
either you have the child call a method on the parent icky or you have the parent watch the values on its children via kvo better

20848805
post	get
or you can create an html file that would redirect get to post then usage would be like follows

20848866
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome latest versions it appears as blank squares

20848875
sorting	grouping
when not sorting before grouping it is much faster but then i get values from random parts of hour

20848877
inherited	properties
this makes it possible to serialize weak models where object is used for properties members however currently this is limited to contract types not primitives and does not work for types with inherited these limitations may be removed at a later time

20848931
inherited	properties
this makes it possible to serialize weak models where object is used for properties members however currently this is limited to contract types not primitives and does not work for types with inherited these limitations may be removed at a later time

20849013
width	height
i work on bitmap i read header of bmp 24 bit per pixel width 320 height 240 offset start of image data in location 54 use c#

20849022
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox and maybe others if you ve got an input focused pressing space and enter clicks them for you

20849039
google-chrome	firefox
and it even seems to be implemented in firefox and google-chrome already

20849085
post	get
this is usually done by sending get or post -variables

20849129
capybara	minitest	rspec	capybara	rspec	minitest
i write sinatra applications and i use rspec and capybara but command line applications i would try to learn and use minitest which is part of ruby core now

20849196
post	get
for some folks using the iframe regex to suppress the welcome message works - however could be what is causing the issue when rendering the interactive post and you should be able to get by without it

20849205
folder	directory
considering cleaning of directory build issue will help i deleted the the tmp folder in .metadata which contains the project but still the things are not working

20849209
keydown	keyup
i think what you re wanting is keyup or keydown

20849272
client-side	server-side
i have an asp.net app server-side and i would like to visualize some results by using webgl javascript client-side

20849274
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
it looks fine in firefox but in google-chrome and opera using the latest stable versions the sides of the cubes are showing through

20849311
hide	show
one thing that i cannot quite explain is in the chrome developer tools if i hide the then the correct color for the .us and others show up which almost seems to indicate it is hiding or overriding the color somehow which does not quite make sense

20849311
google-chrome	firefox
there is no exact magic number but given the above experiments it does seem that there is some smaller character limit based on number of selectors to a selector size for google-chrome as opposed to firefox or ie10

20849341
for-loop	loops
you can just extract the iterator from the iterable and use a good old for-loop or a while loops

20849353
width	height
you need to give the links a width and height in addition to float or inline

20849364
google-chrome	firefox
we can t seem to reproduce this problem in google-chrome or firefox but that doesn t mean it s not happening there

20849365
min	max
now the problem is that for the calculation of the mean st.dev. max min etc

20849371
google-chrome	firefox
from what i can tell the problem doesn t seem to be browser-specific i ve tested on google-chrome firefox and ie on both computers but rather computer-specific which seems really strange to me

20849419
swt	windowbuilder
i created a java eclipse swt application window on a eclipse kepler 4.3.1 32-bit running windowbuilder and swt swt.jar

20849423
folder	directory
but first create a css folder in the root directory and put style.css there

20849493
post	get
see my other post android maps v2 - get map zoom

20849521
post	get
when i try to post my form i get a bad request error

20849524
width	height
you could possibly add another transparent div that covered the full height and width of the page give it a high z-index and make sure that both it and div4 are displayed when that div is hovered over as it will always be but that sounds like a bad idea

20849539
width	height
this version gives me a fixed 500px height and an image that looses aspect ratio when viewport is smaller than image width

20849544
rss	feed
one way that wordpress exposes blog output to other applications is through the rss feed

20849544
rss	feed
i ll paste a couple links to start with and you can easily search for more online with something like rss feed widget in google

20849567
ember.js	qunit
i am trying to test associations between the two ember.js models below using qunit and ember.js v1.0.0

20849635
for-loop	loops
if needed use separate statements before the for-loop for the initialization clause or at the end of loops for the update clause

20849636
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i tested this with firefox ie google-chrome and opera opera is the only one that has this behavior

20849641

width	height
the only way you d be able to force the sizing to stay within 100px is to use js to force the border to be width height divided by 2

20854308
width	height
it because your border size is bigger than your width and height

20854308
width	height	min	max
the specified width and height and respective min max properties on this element determine the border box of the element

20854308
width	height
that is any padding or border specified on the element is laid out and drawn inside this specified width and height

20854308
width	height
the content width and height are calculated by subtracting the border and padding widths of the respective sides from the specified â widthâ and â heightâ properties

20854308
width	height
as the content width and height cannot be negative css21 section 10.2 this computation is floored at 0

20854332
width	height
if i m not mistaken i want increasing the width must not increase the height of image means that you want a way to change the width of an image while keeping the height constant

20854332
width	height
if you change the width or height attributes of the image-container class you ll see that the image stretches correspondingly

20854334
width	height
change your linearlayout height and width to fill_parent as below

20854393
min	max
note that min max and number will be on the heap anyway as they ve been captured by your lambda expressions.

20854427
width	height
the application window should take 944px width 698px height

20854427
width	height
the application window should take 720px width 530px height

20854427
width	height
the application window should take 944px width 530px height

20854469
post	get
in simple html javascript i using ajax to get post json data

20854525
hide	show
above code works fine the only problem is when the width is less than 500 and user clicks on the z button to show the menu then again clicks back to hide it and the window is re-sized to greater than 500 the buttons doesn t show back

20854555
width	height
chnage your width and height parameter of the linear layout to fill_parent cause the use code

20854598
post	get
when using rapache each time you get get post cookies files server variables which were passed on to the api call

20854598
post	get
so if you want to use post in your call instead of the get example go ahead

20854619

if loginbean has two fields with getter and setter username and password then remove the modelattribute login annotation because the loginbean is not a attribute but a command object

20854620
rar	zip
an alternative to consider if you want to play the media data stored in a file is to store your media in a zip or rar since vlc has plugins to play media from directly inside such archives

for implementation in a fpga you must use a dedicated fpga resource like phase-locked loop pll see altera and xilinx or digital clock managers dcm see xilinx to multiply a frequency

20854847
persistent	transient
variables may be marked transient to indicate that they are not part of the persistent state of an object

20854847
instances	transient
here actionlistener instances is a suitable candidate for marking as transient

20854847
persistent	transient
we use transient keyword when the class implements serializable and we don t want the member to be persistent

if using a 32 bits unsigned integer to manage a q24 the remainig 8 bits can be used to ease calculations

20855017
floating-point	fixed-point
before translating from floating-point to fixed-point representation you always have to define the range for your original value

20855017
division	multiplication
by the way you have to define a generic function for each operation division multiplication etc. to prevent overflow and save precision

20855023
pull	push
if you only push and pull using git commands it may seem you re talking to a bare git repo at the other end

20855055

so to first solve communication i started with jax-ws soap binding webservice since it has an endpoint and ws-addressing for push mechanism but it seems to be a lot of overhead heavy as per the docs and since unfamiliar with ws- i haven t implemented it as i need multiple clients listening to the stream at a later point and the stream is 24 7 i wanted thread manageable sockets

20867641
pdfbox	itext
i have a brief idea about itext pdfbox

20867714
strlen	strdup
this is safe in that it can never cause a crash reading 4 bytes from a 4-byte aligned pointer can never cross a page boundary but it may over-read past the end of an allocated block if the string came from strdup hello -- here only 6 bytes were allocated yet strlen will read 8

20867765
min	max
however for practical purposes - if you don t want to use this date column in the group by clause and still want to display it in result set one option is to use max or min function over your date column

20867765
min	max
but if the dates are different across the record set under a same group max or min will produce an incorrect result

one thing to note cvs is a pretty broken rcs

20869806

your for-loop loops while i 10

20870032

20870129

which takes a signed int x can be signed chars short int long long long or anything else even something longer than a long long and it converts x to the corresponding unsigned int type of the same size

20870129
integer	unsigned
so to convert any value positive or negative its two s complement binary representation should be taken and that should be interpreted as an unsigned integer of the same size

20870177

20870215
addition	multiplication
this is a pragma to decide whether the compiler is allowed to replace source-level additions and multiplication with fma instructions this has the effect that the multiplication is virtually computed at infinite precision because this is how this instruction works instead of being rounded to the precision of the type as it would be with separate multiplication and addition instructions

20870342

but to my weak defense i ll say that if the value of the unsigned long long result of the macro is assigned to the appropriate unsigned type unsigned short for short the value should never be truncated so the macro might have some use

20870351
superclass	subclassing
also the usage of a superclass in place of a subclassing

20870353
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays

20870857
for-loop	arrays
also i don t want to do it by writing a for-loop over the arrays as they are very large

20870902
post	get
you have access to context.request so you can simply use its httpmethod property to find out whether it s post get or something else

20870906
post	get
to check whether the request is post or get you can use httpcontext.current.request.httpmethod from detect if action is a post or get method

this may seem useless in your example but you will find in many cases the vm s getter setter need to do some sort of transformation on the values rather than simply passing them through

20870975
google-chrome	firefox
or is it atleast possible in browsers like firefox and google-chrome

20871039
google-chrome	firefox
i have tested this on css deck and jsfiddle both in firefox and google-chrome and it seems to be a consistent issue

20871094
versioning	upgrade
so instead of using the iap feature to download say a weapon pack or a song can it download a completely new binary of the same app that way when the user upgrade they no longer have ads and they have additional features that weren t present in the free versioning

20871094
versioning	upgrade
situation as brief as possible apple has approved both my iap package and my new free versioning for the public to have accessibility to upgrade

20871101
children	parent
you can watch this in action in this fiddle by first typing in the top parent input and then in the children

20871105
getter	setter
if i just override the setter and not the getter everything is fine

20871119
implements	extends
compile-time error for a class to attempt to extends or implements null

20871147
accessor	properties
the latest version of objective-c does not require you to synthesize properties it does it when one or both accessor are missing

20871147
accessor	ivar	accessor	properties
synthesizing includes creation of one or both accessor methods along with the ivar for storing the value of the properties

20871147
accessor	ivar
once you override the second accessor however the _locked ivar is no longer added to your class implicitly

20871149
igraph	networkx
you might also be interested in the networkx igraph or graph-tool packages

20871171
pop-up	dialog
that means no dialog pop-up

20871171
pop-up	dialog
without the pop-up dialog i can t untick search strings

20871199
margin	height
i know that i could play with margin top but in my case that would not work as the red header div will have a variable height when users scroll down by 10px header height will change from 120px to 80px - note that for some reason that js part does not work on jsfiddle thanks

20871211
multiplying	multiplication
so the problem with multiplication can also be better resolved since you know that after closing bracket must come an operator if not then default multiplying or end of term has reached

20871218
public	protected
public and protected members can be accessed directly and private members can be

20871231

20871317
google-chrome	safari
the jquery docs do mention some cross browser issues but this was tested in the latest version of both google-chrome and safari and both failed

20871347
nsstring	nsdata
since you ve just created a category on nsstring and nsdata you can easily call it on a string or data like you call any other method for example init

20871356
google-chrome	safari
it works with google-chrome on my iphone and on my ipad and laptop it works on all browsers including safari

20871404
background-color	transparency
the reason it has the same background-color as body the parent of that div is because by default div s have background-color transparency

20871470
int	chars
your loop doesn t work because chars is not a chars in s but an int in the range from 0 inclusive to length-of- s -minus-one exclusive

20871500
int	boolean
for the builtin types such as lists int floats and strings every value evaluates to a true when a boolean is needed you can do this explicitly by calling the function bool an object except for empty values

20871563
hide	show
i try to add onclientclick to button and show progress but not seems to be a better solution to hide the modal progress

20871569
tinyint	boolean
actually this is a boolean column but as far as i know mysql does not support this type and auto-converts it to tinyint 1 .

20871611
rational-numbers	integer
as you suggest if you absolutely don t want to lose accuracy when storing a rational-numbers the best solution probably is to store the number in terms of its integer components

20871611
rational-numbers	integer
thus each rational-numbers would be defined and stored as the two-component integer vector

20871649
mouseleave	mouseenter
an interesting way to solve this is to store arbitrary data as the object with mouseenter and mouseleave properties

20871723
try-catch	exception-handling
the exception-handling s not being thrown it s telling you that you need to put the code inside a try-catch block or have your function throw the exception-handling

20871750
sorting	filtering
i want paging and sorting to be done through my controller as well as filtering search.this is a dynamic search-filter so searchonenter false

20871750
sorting	filtering
i don t want loadonce true because it will stop paging sorting but it will enable client-side filtering search

20871757
int	boolean
for any of the types int float string boolean and resource converting a value to an array results in an array with a single element with index zero and the value of the scalar which was converted

20871758
gridbaglayout	grouplayout
hand and do not want to use grouplayout then gridbaglayout is

20871810
children	parent
when the css style opacity is applied to the parent it does it to all it s children try using a rgba method for a background instead

20871832

use your own instance of mediawiki to parse the wikitext into html and then parse that

20871839
mspec	nspec
there are a lot of bdd spec frameworks specflow mspec nspec storyq to help wire the behavior of your system to tests

20871877
filtering	grouping
these filtering are attributes that belong to attribute grouping

20871897
try-catch	exception-handling
but if you do this then whatever the methods that will be calling this method also should be declared like this or they should handle the exception-handling inside a try-catch block

20872020
gridview	rowdatabound
this will trigger the gridview s rowdatabound event

20872069
clang	llvm
this problem comes from attempting to do the exercises in accelerated c++ 5 in chapter 3 for anyone who has a copy and has been confirmed to occur only on mac machines running lion and mountain lion with both clang 5.0 and llvm g++ 4.2.1

20872136
versioning	upgrade
update as a follow-up to the comment thread the hartl tutorial has been used and verified by thousands of users while there are occasional defects as michael upgrade to accommodate new versioning in general it is quite accurate and you ll be ok if you follow it carefully

20872165
for-loop	arrays
also the first for-loop cycles through all the arrays slots even if they were already counted so cats would be counted twice so instead of cats counted as 7 they would amount to 14

20872176
slider	sidr
the slider javascript error is there because it is not being used anymore and i need to remove that from my code when i get to work tomorrow so i didn t upload it to my site but this shouldn t affect the sidr menu

mouseup	mousedown	move	drag
a drag event made up from mousedown mouse move and mouseup drag the control vertically

20872233
move	drag
i think that setting boundaries when control move only 5 pixels play sound otherwise drag control should solve the problem but i tried to create them unsuccessfully

20872234
tablet	galaxy
genymotion tablet version emulator doesn t provide any google apps only galaxy nexus-4.2.2 with google apps-api 17 -720x1280 comes with google app support

int	chars
i m trying to create a code that writes an array backwards and can only use an array chars and an int

20872244
post	get
you ll have to first get the page then parse for __eventvalidation and __viewstate to find their generated values and only then add them to the post data

20872249
dictionary	map
map your neighbor nodes in a dictionary grouping them by their direction value

20872300
stateless	stateful
the tyrus user guide says that one can mix together anyone of the famous session bean declaration annotations with the server endpoint stateful stateless and singleton

20872304
screens	tablet
media queries is a css3 module that allows content to render and adapt itself to multiple screens resolution smartphone and or tablet vs

20872305
setinterval	settimeout
you need to use setinterval instead of settimeout

20872337
for-loop	arrays
while learning about pointers arrays and functions on tutorials point i realised that i could achieve my goal of returning an arrays from a function by creating a new arrays in the main function creating a pointer and assigning the return value of the function to this pointer and then using a for-loop in the main function incrementing the pointer to reassign the values of the arrays to the arrays internal to the sorting function

20872337
for-loop	arrays
then the for-loop in the main that assigned my arrays called unsorted_array to the pointer as it is incremented through the arrays created inside the sorting function

20872344
lodash	underscore.js
it s a common documentation model that i like underscore.js backbone and lodash

circling back on this there are a couple of objective-c testing frameworks which layer on top of ocunit xctest and provide an rspec -like test organization

20872488
width	height
change the 1.0fs inside your gltexcoord2f to width nearest power of 2 and height nearest power of 2

20872539
children	parent
the parent of a floated element collapses and you want the parent wrap around include the floated children

20872562
post	get
it allows you to use separate controller functions one for post one for get which stops repetitive to check when you should and shouldn t be attempting to access the posted data and such

20872583
gif	png
downsizing or re-sizing involves chrome having to both decode the image jpeg png gif you re sending down the line and then do extra work to resize that image into the container div that you would like to display it in

20872583
width	height
where possible the advice from the chrome team is to prescale your images to the correct width height needed

20872630
range	median
by repeating the simulation 1000 times ie calling the function ehr 1000 times calculate the mean of k the median of k the variance of k the interquartile range of k

however it has no results on google-chrome and opera

20872679
for-loop	loops
i m starting to learn php and i sometimes have trouble with my loops mostly the for-loop

20872707
pow	math.h
what you want is pow 5 3 which is available after including math.h as you did

20872707
int	double
note however that it acts on double not int so your return value will be a floating point and in general not exact

20872707
int	double
also to print the returned double you either have to cast the double to an int printf d int pow 5 3 or print it as floating point printf f pow 5 3

20872711
pow	math.h
instead you should use the pow function from math.h however pow returns double

the problem is the sqlalchemy function get_data is lazy loading that is it will emmit 100 sql queries if there are 100 children but i need sqlalchmey to fetch all parent nodes and their children with one sql statement

20872804
post	get
i don t have much experience working with rest interfaces but it seems that get and post are not entirely appropriate here

20872804
post	get
the solution that i m leaning towards right now is that the client does a post to the server here s what i have and subsequently does a get tell me what you need and lastly does a post here s the data you wanted

20872804
post	get
i didn t realize that you could get the post response with pythons urllib using the read function of the object returned by urlopen

20872821
vbo	vao
only with the vao and with the empty vbo is the triangle drawn

20872838

20872946
post	get
and here is the view where i am trying to get all of the boards ordered by the number of post on each one

20872948
min	max
all the algorithms that i know end up with the additional property that h and t are such that min h max h and min t max t do not overlap

20872954
afnetworking	sdwebimage
since updating the afnetworking library what i noticed was at times the setimagewithurl from the afnetworking was invoked instead of from sdwebimage

20872989
post	get
one reason is your handler for head does not behave the same as one for get post assuming some sort of asp.net or other server side code handlers

20873017
put	get
use getitem to get the object that you put in the adapter depend on the row position

jpeg png or bmp

20873173
implements	extends
one possible solution would be implements __call in databaseconnection or extends pdo like chris barrett said

20873239
qapplication	qcoreapplication
if qt_gui_lib is defined the application object will be a qapplication otherwise it will be a qcoreapplication

20873239
qapplication	qcoreapplication
this means you will get a qapplication rather than qcoreapplication since the qt variable contains core and gui by default

20873239
qapplication	qcoreapplication
behaves like qtest_main but instantiates a qcoreapplication instead of the qapplication object

20873311
erd	diagram
here is a similar diagram using mysql workbench erd tool - no little circles or zero is shown with either types of lines

20873321
folder	directory
for that add path to your glew folder project - properties - configuration properies - general - vc++ directory - include directory and library directory

20873321
folder	directory
c c++ tab - general - additional include directory - add lib folder there

20873363

post	get
you would get the same result if if tried to open it in a browser unless it responds to a get but not a post -- i just tried it myself to confirm it is giving an http 404 error at the address you supply

20873439
postgresql	mysql
i just moved an app from a local instance where i used postgresql to a google compute engine virtual instance where i m using google cloud sql built on mysql

20873445
post	get
and i am submiting the post request and i get

20873466
mouseover	mouseout
i have an attempt at a smil animation of a simple svg figure at the idea is that every mouseover the words up or down will cause the yellow puck to shuttle in that direction stoping a short ways determined by the mouseout event .

20873466
google-chrome	firefox
unfortunately the reality in both firefox google-chrome is not so

20873476
put	get
2 of these use ajax to get the data to show in the expanded section so i put the toggleborder inside a settimeout function which works fine for when i expand a single row

20873480
for-loop	loops
take the while loops out and replace it with an if that breaks out of the for-loop

20873480
for-loop	loops
after that change your for-loop to a while loops and manually increment j if j 12 set j to 0

20873488

versioning	upgrade
all your existing code would need to be changed too and until you made the change anyone using your code would be out of luck when they upgrade to the later versioning of excel

20873641
min	max
these 2 number pickers are for minutes and seconds and are set to max value 59 and min value 0

20873694
background-repeat	background-position
the background style overrides everything including background-repeat and background-position so those are all gone

20873714
google-chrome	firefox
my switch function works perfect in safar but less so in firefox and google-chrome

20873717
apache	nginx
didn t get an answer but i was able to confirm this works fine and both apache and nginx can use the same pool at the same time

cydia	tweak
i ve been using flex to create patches for ios 7 and decided i d try creating a dedicated cydia tweak

20873776
int	double
though i do not understand why age should be double because the number of months in year is an int value.

20873798
serializable	deserialization
in my case i have some custom formatting serializable deserialization code that isn t being hit during these tests but it s hit when i run in a real web server

20873798
serializable	deserialization
and it also just seems risky to exclude the serializable deserialization code path when testing

20873831
int	chars
console.read returns an int more specifically it returns an int representing the first chars you put in so say i put in a console.read will spit out 97 if i input a it ll give me 65 and if i write ab it ll also give me 65 because it reads the first chars in the stream and returns its int value

20873864
inherited	properties
the way i solved this issue on my own was to create a generic class that inherited from selectlistitem hides the original value properties and implements its own value setter

20873886
hide	show
i modified bartosz s cleaner coffeescript code to achieve the desired show hide functionality with the correctly named selector

20873921
hide	show
my markup is populated but the javascript does not work to hide and show the sibling

20873923
postgresql	mysql
mysql doesn t support the non-standard syntax of postgresql

20873933
.htaccess	httpd.conf
i modified my httpd.conf to allow .htaccess directive like this

20873945
rspec	capybara
this is my first time writing a test using rspec with capybara

20873957
public	protected
however if what you meant to type was i want an external class file to call the setcoor function to change the x and y property of this class then you have to change the function declaration to be public instead of protected because protected functions and variables can only be accessed by subclasses

20874024
super	self
self super initwithnibname nibnameornil bundle nibbundleornil

20874031
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
perform a for-loop to loops through each index of the tidesummary arrays

as a side note a button element accepts any phrasing content descendant which isn t interactive content another button or a checkbox for example

20874119
post	get
i am not sure why post doesn t work properly but changing it to get worked

20874134
folder	directory
as with java_home you want to point to the parent directory rather than the bin folder inside

20874162
serializable	deserialization
following is a quick example of what you could do to force formatters to go through serializable deserialization

20874195
width	height
make sure your width and height match the video s dimensions

20874204
implements	extends
the eotgremote interface which extends remote and is implements by globalnetio

20874235
hide	show
where clearbuttons hide all of the buttons so only the correct ones show and button is the nodelist for the buttons

20874255
children	parent
basically it means the event is bound to the parent in this case document but affects the designated children in this case .exit

20874256
shapefile	geojson
the format is shapefile but you can easily convert it to geojson using ogr2ogr for instance

20874260
width	height
determine how to set width and height using a pixels-to-inches converter like in the following matplotlib documentation

20874293
post	get
this is the http post headers fields that i tested with httplive from firefox where it works correctly and with wfetch where i get the 301 error

20874299
for-loop	loops
because when i becomes menuitems.length the for-loop condition becomes false so loops stops

20874362
width	height
here is a working example that displays a game using the browser s full width and height

20874366
tablelayoutpanel	picturebox
use a tablelayoutpanel or flowlayoutpanel and a add a list of small picturebox with the background color set on the color you want

20874391

the situation is that i have a mainfragment extends a listfragment implements which is called from mainactivity

20874461
pow	math.h
others have already recommended using the pow function from math.h because is not the correct operator for performing power of

20874467
shim	polyfills
with this code you don t need any shim or polyfills or any of that stuff

20874493
width	height
when i get data via a server request i apply formatting to a nsattributedstring calculate the height of the text for a certain width and then store that value for when the tableview calls heightforrowatindexpath later

20874504
abstract-class	superclass
i want the concrete versions to implements an abstract method from the abstract-class but for a specified type t rather than specifying the superclass and then checking instanceof

20874584
put	get
you are trying to get i before it is defined in the loop put it after

20874610
hash	salt
so it s a bit confusing whether you want secure obfuscation in which case you would want to use a hash algorithm salt it if you re paranoid that then quickly checks whether there is a document with the same id and generates a new one to avoid document-id mismatch or that user and document ids be included in which case creating a format that includes both and a brief usually session-dependent id to prevent document-id mismatch will be just perfect

20874631
cifs	smb
some people have suggested connecting to the share with cifs instead of smb however this does not appear to solve the issue

20874631
komodo	aptana
i can replicate the null characters in komodo edit and aptana so this doesn t appear to be a netbeans specific issue and is probably related to the nas smb issue

20874675
slider	supersized
the number comes from the slider number in the supersized plugin

20874726
slideup	slidedown
so when user hover over div #cart-quick-view child .cart_details_box needs to slidedown and to slideup when mouse gets out of parent #cart-quick-view

20874805
redhat	fedora
this probably isn t an issue for fedora redhat but it is for ubuntu because it separates the configs out under etc php5 into different folders

20874830
int	chars
create an int called i which is equal to the number of the final chars in the string

20874856
width	height
depending on the screen size of the user i would like to resize the image with specific values width and height and i already calculated these values

20874856
width	height
i create the spritesheet and easeljs used the image in hd without the width and height modifications

20874857
put	get
if i put there i get the above error if i remove there is no error

20874857
put	get
but if i put some text in layouts gallery.html and have again that in my index.html i get literally that text in layouts gallery.html so it gets included and without error

20874904
mouseover	mouseout
if your nodes that shouldn t respond to clicks need to respond to mouseover mouseout events for instance go with lars solution

20874916
folder	dir
you can use dir to see all the files in the folder

20874916
folder	dir
dir -recurse outputs all the files folder and sub-folders

put	get
i m trying to get the program to take the hp stat from enemyunit the attack stat from unit and the damage stat from tackle and put them into one math problem in the method gethit

20874957
free	malloc
you should not malloc it first because you will not be able to free it later as the value of the pointer will be changed - resulting in a memory leak and a segfault when you try to do free word later which you don t show but you should have if you use malloc

20874957
free	malloc
and don t malloc or free word

20875065
division	multiplication
using multiplication instead of division which should be ok without overflow for another couple hundred years you ll also find that the number of origins computed that fail the equality check is much larger about 99

uitableview	uisegmentedcontrol
i ve set up this uisegmentedcontrol like this so far however it scrolls with the rest of the uitableview content

20875161
folder	directory
of course if i go into the headr.php page and add the .. to each image i am calling in then it works great in the php files in the art folder but then i get the exact same broken icons when i go to any pages in the root directory such as index.php

20875161
folder	directory
the conclusion i am at is that while adding .. does point the page inside the art folder to look in the previous directory it is still trying to locate images from an image folder within the art folder and not the images folder in the root folder

20875219
hide	show
alternatively add it to your main layout file and show hide as needed

20875242
width	height
you can use the chrome.system.display api to query the usable area of the screen and then set that as the width height of the window

20875242
width	height
chrome.system.display.getinfo returns an object with data regarding the display s inside of which the workarea property specifies the usable height width

20875244
dataoutputstream	bufferedoutputstream
wrap bufferedoutputstream in dataoutputstream and use its and writeint int methods

for-loop	loops
as in c c++ 101 we learned that for-loop can be mostly translated to a while loops by

20875459
onchange	onkeyup
in this case i would suggest you to use the onkeyup event rather than the onchange event

20875467
getter	setter
while i ve never set a breakpoint in this place in my code i suspect what is happening is that both the setter and the getter are getting breakpoints

20875563
stdout	stderr
i think that eclipse changed the way in which it grabbed console output from programmes like gcc without realising that gcc which is in itself compiled with gcc would not necessarily be putting out stderr and stdout messages in strict time order

20875633
treemap	linkedhashmap
difference between hashmap linkedhashmap and treemap

20875640
getter	setter
does it make sense to have a public getter and setter and make the static double private

20875640
getter	setter
for non- static members i can see benefit in setter and getter but i m not sure for

20875642
serializable	deserialization
however i am struggling to find much information on how to use jsonconverter for serializable most of the questions people ask seem to be related to deserialization

20875652
getter	setter
it s better to use getter and setter because you can later add synchronization or perform additional actions when you modify the variable in case you need to

20875656
many-to-many	one-to-many
users have an one-to-many relationship with groups and groups have a many-to-many relationship with permissions

20875699
put	get
my code below returns newarray with both objects stored but i am stuck on how to get the values out and put them into the array

20875703
crypt	salt
i m probably not even using the crypt function properly but according to the php docs the first parameter is a string the password and second is the salt

20875705
getter	setter
use getter and setter because it is more flexible

20875705
getter	setter
please do use getter and setter

20875723
jobs	cron
and so limiting your actual cron jobs to simple commands to run a particular script are a good way to divide the configuration into smaller parts which can be individually tested

20875750
int	double
because all of variables are binary except one x6 which is continuous and coefficients have double values the problem turn into mixed int linear programming so i used cplexmilp function with this configuration

20875760
google-chrome	safari
for some reason when i run the following in google-chrome or safari on my li tags

20875765
width	height
it doesn t scale the image only sets the height at 100 of the screen width

20875784
eigenvalue	diagonal
this might produce a diagonal containing negative values which cannot be properly interpreted as eigenvalue so pos is there to trim out the negative eigenvalue setting them to 0

20875784
eigenvalue	diagonal
note that we can skip some steps in haskell as svd and its economy-sized partner thinsvd return vectors of eigenvalue instead of mostly 0 d diagonal matrices

20875797
getter	setter
i d use a setter getter iff that variable is static but not final and you have to validate it when a new value is set and it s probably you have to make that methods synchronized if you are in a multithread context

20875809
width	height
if the width of the image is changing when the browser is resized then more than likely so is the height

20875825
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
data other input streams like fileinputstream fileoutputstream allows

20875825
bufferedreader	printwriter	outputstream	inputstream
typically you could wrap the underlying outputstream with a printwriter and the underlying inputstream with a scanner or bufferedreader

20875850
width	height
if one should be zoomed it gets twice its previous size and the rest of the elements fill the remaining space uniformly so all elements except the ones in the same row or column with the zoomed element get smaller height and width the ones in the same row get a smaller width and zoomed height etc.

20875852

depending on the language a module may be called a module modula-2 a package ada java a unit pascal a class eiffel so on

20875867
crypt	salt
the standard des-based crypt ... only uses the first eight characters of str so longer strings that start with the same eight characters will generate the same result when the same salt is used

20875921

after you install upgrade to a new worklight studio versioning in eclipse if you have existing worklight project already in the workspace then worklight utilizes internal custom-written upgraders to check for the project versioning and will replace all old files not just cordova but also other worklight framework files with new files

20876765
versioning	upgrade
again the upgrade process of a worklight project is more than just replacing the used cordova versioning in the application

20876823
for-loop	loops
or if you prefer using foreach loops with counter to determine first and last iteration then i think it is the same as using standard for-loop

20876831

20877931
width	height
use a frame layout and use drawer for a fixed width and height

20877937
free	malloc
regarding the array size too large errors you should consider using dynamic allocation using malloc and free for both arrays in c or using std vector in c++

20877987
width	height
the gridbaglayout â s size is then determined automatically by the largest coordinates and probably the grid width and grid height of the component at these coordinates

the error seen is cannot convert from int to chars

20878349

first things first malloc realloc do not return void they return which is perfectly capable of being implicitly cast to any other pointer type

20878493
multiplying	addition
in addition sizeof char is always one you do not need to multiplying by it

20878511
int	chars
so when you perform in on two chars s they are both promoted to int s and only then xored

20878511
int	chars
the result is of course an int which cannot be assigned to a chars - you must explicitly cast it back down to a chars

20878511
int	chars
note that since the msbs of both int s are known to be zeros as they were promoted from chars s this is perfectly safe and does not risk any data loss

20878635
charindex	substr
try the combination of charindex and substr

20878710
int	double
does the compiler really calculate the result first as int and then in a second step casts it to double

20878712
post	get
note - for conversion to time i get concept from ravinder s post

20878737
int	double
so if rhs contains double int or int double the type promotion occurs and rhs operands are promoted to double before calculating the result and hence you get 3.3

you can use a remote desktop connection or tools like synergy to interact with multiple machines from one keyboard mouse combination without having the drawbacks of unintentional interaction

20879649
int	chars

if you just put the shadow on the td itself you can get the same effect and it should work cross browser

20885022
webkit	gecko
it looks like webkit based browsers will try and treat td s like a block-level element where as gecko just doesn t care and positions it against the first valid containing element

i want to subclass different components either with implements or extends to add uniform functionality to all the subclasses

20885429

strange that these defaults get put into my final config.xml

20885433
superclass	subclassing
what you are trying to do is treat two subclassing as a single child of a superclass overriding the same method at the same time

20885461

i think that in google-chrome the file gets converted into a specific forward lock file but in firefox this process doesn t happen

20885574
dictionary	map
which is pretty much working but missing out some data because of bit in the script but couldn t quite figure out how can i iterate through two nested loops and map that with the json to get the desired dictionary

20885632
width	height
maybe you can use a linearlayout as parent linearlayouts for each row using weight to be sure all buttons are the same width and height and placing empty buttons on the empty spaces

20885699
int	double
.distinct will work for list of int double or in places like linq to sql entityframework

20885724
listview	gridview
the anchor syntax is only valid inside a gridview listview etc

20885748
width	height
this is not really what i want since height and width could potentially be equal or even inverted if the gles code gets used in a smaller sub-view later on

try using the mouseenter and mouseleave events

20886008
mouseout	mouseleave

rss	feed
you don t need to use .parsexml when you call the rss feed via ajax with a datatype of xml

20886547
inherited	properties
that s why lazy-loadable navigation properties should be virtual - entity frameworks provides dbcontext to class inherited from entity and overrides these properties to use dbcontext for lazy-loading data

20886568
min	max
you can set the min pref and max width on the column constraints to control how much that column is allowed to be resized for example setting all three to the same fixed value will force the column to be that size

20887885
folder	directory
instead of using to get all the files and folder in one directory then a query-of-queries to extract just those files that are pdfs you might be faster using the filter attribute on the cfdirectory to only get the pdf files and avoid having to then do the qoq

20889203
portrait	landscape
here s the context of my problem i m using storyboards for my ios app and for a particular nav tab in my app i had to create two separate scenes for both the portrait and landscape orientations

20889203
portrait	landscape
so the take away to keep in mind from all of this is that these two separate portrait and landscape scenes represent the same tab in my app

20889203
portrait	landscape
here s a practical example for a clearer picture i have one uiviewcontroller that contains a uitableview called mxsannouncementsviewcontroller and this same view controller exists in both the landscape and portrait scenes

20889203
portrait	landscape
i did not create an explicit portrait or landscape version of that view controller but instead have the controller keep track of two iboutlet properties tableviewlandscape and tableviewportrait that point to the orientation-specific uitableviews -- and this approach works perfectly fine

20889203
portrait	landscape
when that method finishes the previous landscape instance of mxsannouncementsviewcontroller invokes its viewwilldisappear method which is then followed by the portrait instance s invocation of its viewwillappear method which then lastly ends with the landscape instance calling its willrotatetointerfaceorientation callback -- that s the order of operation that i m seeing from the breakpoints

20889231
hide	show
basically a script that checks to see the value of a select box and show or hide a div based on the value selected

4.0.23.3 we have an issue with the following situation in which a subclassing and a superclass both unregister for the same message when happening to have the same method name for their action

20889739
superclass	subclassing
in the example below the superclass will have the surprising side-effect of unregistering the subclassing action as well as its own well we were surprised by it

20889739
superclass	subclassing
in our real case the subclassing and superclass in the example are separated by several intermediate classes in our hierarchy

20889794
onclick	onchange
what you need is to remember the currently selected item and whenever the itemindex property is changed from code or whenever the control receives the lbn_selchange notification which currently fires the onclick event you will compare the item index you stored with item index which is currently selected and if they differ fire your own onchange event

20889845
width	height
every measurement i give width height top position left position is given to it based on a 0 degree rotation

width	height
so the height isn t 100 of the viewport s height but 100 viewport width

20889850
ostream	istream
since the standard algorithms use iterators having iterators for istream s and ostream s allows for usage of streams with many common algorithms

int	chars
creates a stringbuilder converts an int and copies a bunch of chars before it can even decide that there is nothing behind system.out

20890948
stdout	stderr
from experience we found there was an improvement in performance under windows if redirected the stdout and stderr thur a null stream which consumed the streams but we were dealing with a lot of output not just from our program but also the rmi server we were communicating with

20890949
slimv	slime
as of about a week ago slimv slime for vim supports racket

20890954

is there a way of producing post instead of get parameter by clicking on this link

20890966
width	height
this div also has a set width and height

20890968
post	get
if you want to inform other parts of your program of messages you get from a single-subscription stream it is probably the best to create a new broadcaststream independent from the single-subscription stream where you post messages when they arrive from the single-subscription stream

20891043
hide	show
if you need to hide show it on a given view controller dynamically you can do something like this

20891057
width	height
if you only need the default style make sure you have the following width height otherwise the numstars could get messed up

20891070
post	get
i ve looked at many tutrials and post about creating ember radio buttons and for the most part they work i just can t seem to get past saving the state of the radio button

if you re using faraday and start out with net http you can later decide to use excon typhoeus patron or eventmachine without changing more than a line or two of configuration

20891139
int	chars
basically you typecast the int to its equivalent chars

20891143
width	height
the width and height of your imageview are set to fill_parent that is likely pushing your other views offscreen

20891189
inherited	base-class
that is why it inherited from the hashalgorithm base-class rather than the symmetricalgorithm base-class

20891316
client-side	server-side
of course it s also worth noting that unless your server-side code is modifying the contact in some way you re just returning something that the client-side code sent in the first place

20891326
width	height
first put the width and height on the container

20891344
versioning	upgrade
note that the comment along with fixed suggests this won t be in release 1.8.9 so you ll have to re-apply the fix when you upgrade to that versioning

20891405
asterisk	pbx
i am new to pbx terminology and or asterisk

20891452
slideup	slidedown
it ll trigger the slideup animation which will follow up with the slidedown animation when the first animation completes

20891458
put	get
but if you want to first execute the file as it s php code and get the resulting content and put in the file then i guess it s what you want you have to use the buffer

20891504
postgresql	mysql
it s similar commands with any shell postgresql mysql whatever

20891516
range	max	range	min	min	max
i am using validation to check some max min values of some user inputs to a form and if outside a certain range to warn the user

here s a complete and working example using get i don t have a test service available with basic auth and post

20891528
put	get
i ve tried setting the globalalpha over time but i can t quite figure out where to put it the results i get are comical at best

20891537
width	height
you could stick a console.log ... with the width height for each call to resize and that ll tell you exactly what s happening there

20891537
width	height
using the width height attributes vs using the height width css settings you can create a conflict where the attribute size specification takes precedence over the css

20891537
width	height
if your width height values are being parsed incorrectly and subsequently getting set incorrectly it ll just ignore those css settings and the size will never change

20891537
width	height
finally it scales the svg element which handles resizing the stuff and sets it to the correct size given the size of the parent container scaling the height based on the original width height ratio

20891557
put	get
get and put are overloaded with different versions none of which match the versions you are asking for

20891557
put	get
to get and put integers you want the get and put from ada.integer_text_io not ada.text_io

20891557
put	get
you are get ting from a file and put ting to the console

20891565
width	margin
if you have a fixed width for the form you only need to add the margin auto

20891573

the css folder is within the same directory as index.php and i ve already verified the file is there although the site says it s not

20891614
fadein	fadeout
how can i wait for the fadein method to finish visually before starting the fadeout method

put	get
the put request which is called when i do a sync on the collection sends the following json request with the below request body same as the get

20891731
versioning	upgrade
my suggestion would be to upgrade your mac os versioning so you can install xcode 5 and continue development

20891735
trac	testlink
try a fresh install using the latest versions of trac and testlink and follow sections 30-32 in the testlink installation manual

20891787
ubuntu	linux
linux - ubuntu 12.04

20891788
stdout	stderr
the basic gist is you want to use subprocess and pass in the stdin argument and the stdout and stderr arguments as pipe

20891809
fadein	fadeout
when you call the fadein and fadeout methods back to back like you re doing the code is run instantaneously so you ll only see animation from the last method called

20891814
implements	extends
should closure extends a class that implements eq order max

20891826
next	except
after switching out because i m back in the root i perform the entire path to the frame except for switching into that frame of course and then continue to the frame next to it

i ve ruled this out because the font renders fine in safari and firefox which as far as i know use the .woff format

20891921
getter	setter
setup a model to handle your getter setter for profile name

20891921
getter	setter
getter gets the proper content to display setter sets the profile name and handles duplicates same names by adding a 1 etc

20891928
width	height
only other way i know how to do this is by using javascript to get the width and apply it to the height

20891954
springboard	tweak
on the other hand another tweak that hooks into springboard at launch to do the same thing generate alert does work

20891959

tried to put sql query to get country_name of current product but got an error invalid control source

20892040
folder	directory
i have made my working directory the res folder so that in netbeans i access that file successfully through settings settings.txt

20892040
folder	directory
i attempted to make the settings folder a library so it would be added to the build however it refused to copy it because it was a directory

20892048
width	height
originally i had written it to do height so i just expanded it to include width

20892092

unix	aix
i tried to play with sed -i but it is not available in aix unix

20892109
superclass	subclassing
if you find a similar problem especially in code you didn t write you can prevent this crash pretty easily by including the result of the superclass s isshown assuming you are changing code in a direct subclassing of view

20892135
swt	windowbuilder
i have a 32-bit compiled java application which i created with windowbuilder swt designer swt composite inside eclipse

20892135
centos	linux
yes i downloaded the linux version of swt.jar for use on centos and placed that file in the lib folder

20892135
centos	linux
as stated above swt.jar on the centos box is the linux version

20892146
folder	directory
note your directory name and product falvours name in build.gradle file must be same so while compilation from built variant tab available in left panel or command prompt it will automatically take the code res manifest from respective folder

20892147
firefox	safari
firefox on windows and os x and safari on os x do not have the issue

20892164
width	margin
the little known fact is that margins with percentage lengths always refer to the width of the container even if you re setting a vertical margin

20892171
width	margin
because .top-center is a div element has for default display block then is 100 width and margin auto has no effect

20892239
children	parent
i want an element that grows in width with its children the children are floated left i want the parent to be centered inside its parent

20892239
children	parent
my problem is that the parent isn t tight enough around the children so when the floated boxes start to drop to the next line there s a 20px gap on the right hand side

20892243
width	height
i have rectangles and a gridlayout the width and the height of these rectangles are the same

20892249
primefaces	richfaces
i ve read the online official docs in and but the examples sections is actually pretty poor comparing to frameworks such as primefaces or richfaces that have built theirs own showcases

20892274
for-loop	arrays
that tells me it s reading the file and populating the arrays just fine but the plink for-loop is messed up

20892309

20892365
bindparam	pdostatement
public bool pdostatement bindparam mixed parameter mixed variable int data_type pdo param_str int length mixed driver_options

20892365
pdostatement	bindvalue
unlike pdostatement bindvalue the variable is bound as a reference and will only be evaluated at the time that pdostatement execute is called

20892395
public	protected
as you note package access would be the simplest way of handling this - anything at package level anything specifically not marked public private protected is only visible to classes in the same package

20892434
post	get
i see that the sample that generated in metadata document mentions post instead of get which i explicitly set

20892520

20892559
multiplying	transpose
and the backprojection procedure can be performed by multiplying the conjugate transpose of the projection operator to the projection data

20892559

20892574
nsdatadetector	nsstring
i have been using a category on nsstring that uses nsdatadetector to test for the presence of a link within a string

20892587
int	boolean
while the example on the wiki-page returns an int they implement a calculator we only need a boolean return value here to decide if a expression should trigger an action if the expression evaluates to true

20892623
post	get
win 8 and arch linux are installed on the same laptop while the code is on my dropbox folder in both systems so the code is the same - i will post the actual exception after i get back to my laptop

20892625
int	boolean
strpos returns either boolean false if not found or an int offset value which can be 0 if found at offset 0 and so on but it never returns a boolean true

20892627
google-chrome	firefox
closures only include variables if they are used - at least as far i have seen in google-chrome and firefox

width	height
i had the same problem when the image is created passing width and height

20892909
width	height
the library uses the width and height of the image to create the canvas to draw the hit region but the width and height is not used to scale the image that is drawn on the canvas

20892909

a has its own width and height which not only define its physical size unless css steps in but also its logical size the number of rows columns of pixels on its drawing surface

20893030
width	height
to fix the problem you could either do the math to match the coordinates back up or exclusively use the canvases own width height to size them or set the canvases width and height properties after the fact to match the width and height set by css

20893395
serializable	deserialization
i m fairly sure the jsonconverter approach will work if i can get over this hurdle - i suspect the error is there because the jsonproperty attribute is used for serializable as well as deserialization

the problem i seem to be having is only evident in webkit browsers safari google-chrome where everything works perfectly on load

20893725
width	height
the dialog is resizable so all should change width on resixze and bottom one should change height

the idea is i show certain panels for advanced mode in my form and hide them for simple mode

20893772
google-chrome	firefox
when you refresh google-chrome the jquery ui modal text briefly shows up in google-chrome and ie but not in firefox and i am trying to figure out a way to prevent that from happening

hash	salt
here is the salt + hash using the above technique

20893794
imageview	picasso
with picasso you create a custom adapter for the listview and place the .load url call on your imageview in getview

20893832
nunit	mstest
the benefit of this approach is that it will work for any test framework mstest nunit etc and the tests themselves don t need to be concerned with or know anything about browsers

20893832

innodb	myisam
it turns out the table i was testing was using myisam and not innodb as the storage engine

20894020
multiplying	transpose
i would caution against transpose your data because then you re essentially multiplying the transpose of your transpose data the original data with your transpose data

20894039
crypt	salt
it uses crypt internally and depending on the platform will either read from dev urandom directly or use php_win32_get_random_bytes to generate a salt if none is provided

20894039
hash	salt
one advantage in terms of storage is that both the hash and salt are stored in a single opaque string

20894069
for-loop	loops
i recently switched over to developing my software for java 8 and i ve been slowly improving my use of java 8 and becoming comfortable with java 8 and in doing so i ve started implementing more and more functional interfaces and recently netbeans has started to suggest that i swap some of my for loops over to functional interfaces but from the way the program is running it seems much slower than simply using a for-loop 1.9 sec runtime vs

mt mersenne twister used by mt_rand is considered a prng pseudo random number generator whereas openssl_random_pseudo_bytes will attempt to use a csprng crypto secure prng

20894215
hide	show
that one works just fine but i also want the same function to first hide all elements from the class foo and then show the specified elements

20894224
erd	diagram
if you have a well developed schema erd entity relationship diagram these relationships should be in place

20894316
prepare	execute
you can throw all of the execute in a for-loop and get maximum performance since pdo is using a prepare statement

20894322
uilabel	uitextview
at first i assume your text is not editable you can use uilabel instead of uitextview - it also supports multiline set numberoflines to 0 in ib and minimum maximum font scale for autosizing to fit text

that is suggested if you want to include saving to a config or ini file or in a persistence format that is text editable

20894654
implements	extends
for any types t1 and t2 if t2 derives from t1 that is t2 directly or indirectly extends or implements t1 then is a subtype of

20894675
int	double
the column is textbox but the content could be anything that a string can represent text string date int double etc.

20894684
maven	pom.xml
the tokens to be filtered must be enclosed in ... to avoid interferences with maven s normal pom.xml interpolation use project.version instead of project.version

20894749
spaces	delimiter
the reading in part assumes you have your data in all in the text file as a spaces delimiter vector

20894757
width	margin
to fix this i added a right margin to the content the same width as the fixed width side bar

20894757
google-chrome	firefox
this works totally fine and as expected in firefox but is broken in google-chrome

20894769
google-chrome	firefox
when you move scroll bar the top menu will be fixed in firefox but in google-chrome it does not work

20894808
pull	push
if there is not too much work you did on the new layer i would pull your previous docker push from the registry and redo the new layer work then push it

20894808
pull	push	versioning	upgrade
it is probably a good idea whenever you upgrade to push your work first then upgrade then pull and continue working from that pull as things like this can happen where headers and such are different in versioning

20894837
centos	linux
i am using kali linux for sending the packets of course as root and centos for the server

20894846
post	get
if you wanted to make it use a post instead of a get for the requestâ then you shouldn t be putting query strings in your url in the first place

20894894
gson	jackson
something you can try with neo4j 2.0 is to use the transactional endpoint and return the node object which will return just the node-properties as a map which you then can map directly with gson or jackson to an object the row

20894905
oncreate	findviewbyid
you are not setting your contentview and the activity crashes with a null pointer exception in the oncreate method you must set a contentview before being able to try to findviewbyid something like this

20894925
width	height
as indicated in the code you supply the width w and height h the algorithm then returns all of the col row positions where the rectangle can fit

20894925
width	height
input the search width and height

20894925
width	height
if your interested in knowing if your rectangle will fit at all say either width x height or height x width you can simply repeat the search after swapping the width and height

20894936
bufferedreader	printwriter
as a matter of fact i would advice not to use bufferedreader and printwriter for socket-originated streams to avoid platform-dependent issues like this one

20894988
spray	unfiltered
if you want to write rest services in scala please consider frameworks built with the language in mind like scalatra unfiltered or spray

20894993
hash	md5
if your file isn t too big you can just compare file hash like doing an md5 or crc

20895125
public	protected
at the member levelâ public private protected or package-private no

20895152
getter	setter
when you for example always make variables private and accessed them through getter and setter you can later change them from a variable to a computed value and then even later add caching to the computation for performance reasons

20895152
getter	setter
but when you expose it to the outside world through getter and setter all other code can keep using the class as if nothing had changed

20895176
auto-generate	edmx
already in auto-generate model.context.cs of edmx folder

20895183
distance	pdist
what pdist does is to compute the distance between m points using euclidean distance 2-norm as the distance metric between the points

20895183
distance	pdist
what i want it to do is to calculate the distance per row so pdist should only work on a 1x3 vector at a time

20895184
multiplying	add
also i m not done with the assign function but i need so many other functions such as add multiplying scalar_product etc

20895203
put	get
the file contents get put into variables col1 col2 col3

20895209
apache	nginx
you should use a real web server like apache 2 or nginx and not php builtin server

20895240
cgal	leda
perhaps i could even convert the cos i computed in cgal to such a leda real

20895240
cgal	leda
and leda_real.h for cgal 4.3 looks strange it refers to leda_real not leda real so perhaps it is written for an outdated version of leda

20895240
gentoo	linux
since i don t have either rs or leda installed on my computer i d prefer an educated opinion before i start building them and perhaps even writing install instructions â œebuildsâ for my gentoo linux

20895246
auto-generate	edmx
already in auto-generate model.context.cs of edmx folder

20895253
width	height
it seems that the author is not handling when an element is hidden or not so it will return 0 for the height or width making the area not scrollable as first reason description

20895266
put	get
if i just grab itsdangerous.py and put it in the flask directory i get

20895277
auto-generate	edmx
already in auto-generate model.context.cs of edmx folder

20895280
hide	show
by doing this you ll hide all slideshow images and then show only first-child on load

20895309
int	double
the first two columns are strings in both tables and the rest are int in the dataframe they are double which are sorting appropriately

20895313
int	boolean
probably worth thinking about upgrading to yii 1.1.14 note if you have boolean values in ar models that we re validated with int rules previously i ve found those to be buggy in 1.1.14 let me know if you do and i can send over the github issue number for that bug

20895321
ffmpeg	libavformat
libav-user mailing list â for questions involving the ffmpeg libraries libavcodec libavformat libavutil libavfilter libavdevice libswscale libswresample and libpostproc

20895340
int	boolean
uima operates with two concepts 1 featurestructure 2 primitive types int boolean etc

20895340
int	boolean
a work-around could be to define custom types fsint fsstring fsboolean which inherit from top and which would have a value feature of the respective type int string boolean

20895345
google-chrome	firefox
i don t know it may be a silly mistake but i m having this problem for about 2 or 3 months since firefox is my favorite browser it s a little annoying to open google-chrome separately to search for questions on stackoverflow and etc

20895362
post	get
you need fb app to auth after auth get the permission for reading only minimal one which can t post or like

20895384
lodash	underscore.js
use underscore.js or lodash to help

20895385
free	malloc
so you ll either want to make sure there s always a living reference in d for the lifetime of the object or create an destroy it yourself with functions like malloc and free

20895413
margin	height
one more thing make your contact height same as other container or remove extra margin padding from physicians section

20895424
put	get
however if i specify a createcourseoffering block directly from a previous get the put works fine

20895449
uiview	subviews
first i have a custom uiview with a uibutton as its subviews then i set the target-action as usual

20895469
uicollectionview	uitableview
this is standard behaviour with a uitableview and you can use a uicollectionview too

20895469
uipangesturerecognizer	uicollectionview
note that uicollectionview being a uiscrollview subclass has its own uipangesturerecognizer which interacts with the uipinchgesturerecogniser added by me

20895469
uipangesturerecognizer	uipinchgesturerecognizer
i tried to use gesturerecognizer shouldrequirefailureofgesturerecognizer to make my uipinchgesturerecognizer fail the built in uipangesturerecognizer but this instead seemed to stop my pinch recognizer working at all

20895469
min	max
i tried to set this up by setting min and max scales and adding my controller s pinch handler

20895475
put	get
you have a mismatch in your put and get calls

20895525
width	height
it is just supposed to fill the full screen through setting width and height to a 100 but after i click into the sketch board it adjusts itself to a smaller size

20895554
width	height
i m trying to change button size but when i set width height automatically changes too even though height has own value

20895558
children	parent
just add the animated and fadein class to your parent element and all children will fade in

20895579
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i red alot about the web-audio-api and saw a few examples as well but there are some problems - it only works in google-chrome safari so far it should be run on firefox as well but it doesnt

20895591
ant	maven
i also suggest you look into some build tools like ant or maven

20895637
getter	setter
in my struts2 action the getter and setter are not being used according to intellij idea

20895641
required	placeholder
i log.i the 2 placeholder variables and they return the long values as required

20895641
switching	screens
that is the case within a switching that works with the onclick to get the values set them to some place holders on the screens as well as convert the numberpicker values to long for the countdowntimer

20895802
hash	md5
most cryptographic hash today including md5 sha-1 and the sha-2 family are based on the merkle ndash

20895826
width	height
1 it doesn t stay the original size 15px wide and 10px long and gets li s width with adjusting height

20895863
width	height
well from what i see you force the width and height of your wind instances to have the same value

20895863
width	height
wind#getpreferredsize returns a dimension instance that holds both the width and the height that your wind instance wants to have

20895863
width	height
in your case it returns a new instance of dimension made of twice the same value s which is the biggest of the width and height you set via wind#setpreferredsize

20895892
public	protected
you don t have scope modifiers like private protected public although there are several methods to mimic these kinds of behaviors

20895899
min	max
i am able to get the min avg max using pig built in functions but am not able to get them all in each line

20895937
for-loop	loops
i cannot seem to figure out what is returned in the case of a while or for-loop because if i return a value from inside loops i prematurely exit loops

20895948
queue	fifo
concurrent queue is thread-safe fifo fifo collection container

20895949
queue	fifo
concurrent queue is thread-safe fifo fifo collection

20896033
width	height
width and height should of course be cached

20896054
min	max
use the tobag built-in udf to get your fields into a bag and then you can use the min avg and max functions on that bag

20896071
tabcontrol	tabitem
i programmatically add tabitem to a tabcontrol

20896110
qtabwidget	qtreeview	qtableview	qtreeview	qtableview	qtabwidget
given two sqlite tables addresses and messages what is the best way to map them to a qtreeview and qtabwidget in such a way that if i select one row in a qtableview which is either mapped to addresses or messages the selected item is

20896110
qtabwidget	qtreeview
each tab in the qtabwidget should have a corresponding item in the qtreeview

20896260
hide	show
my full solution i have a show hide buttons for login form

20896279
client-side	server-side
run some ajax passing all of the information you need which may even be none depending on your use case from the client-side to your server-side php

20896296
for-loop	loops
the fundamental problem is this i need to figure out whether or not to run a for-loop or a for...in loops on an object

20896296
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
i clearly can t only use object.prototype.tostring.call collection because while arrays do return custom ordered collections such as jquery objects still return and the whole reason i want this test is to determine whether i need a for-loop or a for...in loops

20896305
width	height
search button image size must not be greater than whatever you initialize width and height in your css rule

20896305
width	height
that means if you give width 100px and height 30px so images must be the same size.just re-size your image with the help of image editor software my personal preference is adobe photoshop.if your image size is greater than css rule so images may not come or image will be broken.i have edited your html as well as css

20896327
int	chars
it works well when i enter an actual int but if i input a chars my code just breaks

20896336
onkeyup	onblur
put your functions out of document.ready and change you input onkeyup to onblur event and pass argument this.value

20896345
aggregate-functions	sum
sum is an aggregate-functions that works on a group of records

20896363
google-chrome	firefox
if your trick is working in firefox google-chrome and recent ie i think it s probably okay....though a bit wonky

20896471
scheme	racket
however this definition causes syntax errors in many scheme implementations mit-scheme racket guile etc.

20896476
listview	gridview
it seams that the gridview is a view of the listview control

20896549
folder	directory
first download and extract xlwt folder into python any directory

20896549
folder	directory
if you made chdir to xlwt folder then python will look only into that folder so to view the xlwt directory from python homedirectory just add these two lines to your program at beginning

20896578
implements	extends
to actually make a list object callable subclass it and implements a __call__ method again you probably shouldn t do it in production code in this case we extends the list with the arguments we pass to the list

20896632
nsurlconnection	nsurlsession
while we once would have recommended sendasynchronousrequest effective ios 9 nsurlconnection is formally deprecated and one should favor nsurlsession

20896658
websphere	ibm
i am using ibm websphere message queue for transferring my messages in .net

20896701

the signedness is nice here because in some languages like java there are no unsigned integer types and the default integer type is a 32-bit signed integer

20912380
multiplying	division
assuming you want to stay within 64-bit integer operations you can use binary long division which boils down to a bunch of adds and multiplying by two operations

20913873
ubuntu	linux
i work under linux ubuntu 13.10

20913874
viewdidload	viewwillappear
so moving your current code from viewdidload to viewwillappear should do the trick

20913953
xslt	xquery
once we are at it even better if it provides also an equivalent for xquery and xslt

20913974
equals	gethashcode
but it will require you to override gethashcode and equals methods in t class

20913978
mouseleave	mouseenter
on the other side probably is not working because .hover accepts two function one for the mouseenter and one for the mouseleave event

20913992
shadowing	named
you are shadowing the pw variable inside of your openprintwriterstream method by providing a parameter with the same named - pw - as a field in the class

20913993
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
more details on customization can be found here customizing and configuring amazon-web-services elastic beanstalk environments

20913999
centos	linux
i have done some research and so far i understand that it can be that under my linux distro centos 9.5 instead of tmp .s.pgsql.5432 it is configured to use some other path

20914039
postgresql	mysql
if you want to store data in a database then you can use one of the dozens of db systems out there such as mysql mongodb postgresql etc

serializable	deserialization
i have tried to use a custom serializable deserialization in the hope that i can catch the exception and apply my custom make it null logic

20914165
indexof	replaceall
i ve tried running just tomorse but although it compiles i get no output and an error message of java.lang.arrayindexoutofboundsexception at projmorsejava 22 and 46 i m not sure how to configure toenglish at this point i ve tried using the replaceall indexof and valueof methods

20914196
getter	setter
it s not terribly informative for what we re interested in but it does show me that nvd3 follows d3 s getter setter format if you call .property value you set the property to that value but if you call .property without any parameters it will return back the current value of that property

20914196
min	max
so i just made a guess that same as the d3 linear scale .range function the expected input is a two-element array consisting of the max and min values

20914196
min	max
since we want a constant the max and min will be the same

20914245
isotope	masonry
and bootstrap responsiveness view but the options for masonry and isotope while attractive aren t an option as i must retain ordering for the elements

20914249
vbo	vao	vbo	normals
basically from what i found you can have one vao and one vbo set locations normals etc and then manually manage the memory using glbuffersubdata

20914261
post	get
instagram s real-time subscriptions can send notifications whenever a registered user post to their feed but i haven t found a way to get a list of those users or even a count

20914267
hash	salt
the password hash is generated with the rfc 2898 algorithm using a 128-bit salt a 256-bit subkey and 1000 iterations

20914267
hash	salt
the format of the generated hash bytestream is 0x00 salt subkey which is base-64 encoded before it is returned

20914267
hash	salt
in a nutshell it combines the salt with the passed in password hash it a number of times and produces a bytestream that you can read out as many bytes as you want

20914267
hash	salt
using the above quoted documentation we see that it picks a random salt that is 128 bits large uses 1000 hash and pulls 256 bits out of the stream at the end

20914316
width	height
i set width of element let s say 15 but for some reasons i can t set height not the problem

20914324
serializable	deserialization
i think you might have to roll your own collection serializable with custom deserialization which skips bad apples when de-serializing

20914327
subtract	add
at somepoint i will use this to try and find a way to subtract and add bufferedimages but that is for a different question

20914336
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tried firefox google-chrome and ie webdrivers nothing is happening

20914375
margin	height
should set the element s height to its innerwidth which excludes border and margin

20914473
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome work fine

20914473
google-chrome	firefox
ie sees that key when someone types play.net and quivers and dies without an error message firefox and google-chrome handle it fine

20914479
folder	directory
with the below code i can add the prefix to the sub folder files but i can only replace it with a static value prefix_ here i need to add the first directory name 101 102 etc as prefix to all the files present in f files folder

20914496
free	malloc
however this version isn t the same as what you had because the lifetime of the memory pointed to by pmonitoreddn is now only as long as the method lasts whereas the malloc -ed memory would last until free -ed

20914612
folder	directory
the current working directory was the location of the first file not the file in need of the pictures which was inside the folder rungame so that is where it looked for winp.png when no path was specified

20914615
width	height
width given height automagically selected to preserve aspect ratio

20914615
width	height
i am trying to find the same option with rmagick but it seems that the resize method expects both width and height to be provided

20914745
nsorderedset	nsset
this will mean that you now get an nsorderedset of songs instead of just an nsset of songs

20914804
for-loop	loops
i would normally use a for-loop as it would be easier but the question asks for a while loops

20914833
realloc	malloc
take into account that in 64-bit systems you don t get all available memory in just one malloc realloc

20914867
loops	if-statement
and here s the problem you re incrementing x in your if-statement thus resulting in an infinite loops once the if-statement fails to trigger since your while condition cannot be reached

20914885
sorting	filtering
there is a lot of crazy filtering and sorting going on

20914953
maven	pom.xml
so i setup my settings.xml file with the repository name set in my pom.xml my username for the jenkins and my password encrypted in the maven command prompt

20914978
spaces	delimiter
thinking this uses perhaps the literal column number rather than assuming spaces as a delimiter and accounting for consecutive delimiter i tried again with but i still get the same undesired behavior

20915031
rtl	verilog
you wouldn t have to write any additional verilog testbench or wrapper rtl or call vpi tasks or functions from verilog as the testbenches are pure python

20915113

in this controller i want to fill a modal with edit action result and then get my post in my update action

20915113
post	get
this is the js i am using but i get a http notfound edit post

x86	64bit
this is the __cdecl convention that is still in effect for x86 32 bits but has been obsoleted for 64bit builds

20915152
post	get
if you don t want to get a get first you would need to store the credits_uri of the bank account in question and then post directly to that

20915153
serializable	deserialization
check the saved file but i guess you need to implement properly serializable and deserialization

20915170

my version using thread safe queues and their put get methods that supports timeout

20915214
client-side	server-side
you re trying to combine server-side code with client-side code in a very strange way

20915214
client-side	server-side
sometimes it s necessary to do that use server-side vbscript to write client-side javascript but if i m understanding your intent correctly it s not needed here

20915230
google-chrome	firefox
or however many days he wishes to enter the countdown functions perfectly in google-chrome but in internet explorer and firefox it shows nan nan

20915281
udp	tcp
this will add a new set of inbound rules one for udp and another for tcp

20915304
width	height
the problem however is that only width is implemented in the major browsers so you cannot get the height ascent + descent with this function yet and i wouldn t be surprised if a canvas based word processor from at least one of the major 3 shows up right before this gets fully implemented.

20915304
width	height
in order to measure the font you will have to use a dom element and this little trick will allow you to measure a font s width and height

20915374
google-chrome	firefox
what i mean by changing browsers is from google-chrome to firefox or firefox to ie

20915386
nsxmlparser	nsmutablestring
i have a object that acts as the delegate for a nsxmlparser object and i have a property of type nsmutablestring that i use to hold the characters of each element

20915438
fadein	fadeout
i also tried using a callback complete function for fadein fadeout but i can t do that because there s a case where neither have been clicked when the page first loads so i wouldn t be able to pass in another function

20915442
cpu	processors
the handler will only use cpu cycles that are available so the ui thread can be a processors hog and the device remains responsive the user

20915455
width	height
i have an object with 3 properties width height and quantity and i have it sorting by height with

20915484
background-color	transparency
i kept messing around and i found out that the background-color of the canvas takes away the transparency it was just that all along.

20915500
ng-show	ng-hide
i was hoping to use ng-show ng-hide but i just can t wrap my head around using angular expressions with a variable that s not a boolean

20915513
bower	npm
i tried the troubleshooting as specified on the site updating grunt bower and cleaning npm and bower caches worked well

20915519
glut	glew	freeglut	glew
it took me a while to learn that glut and other libraries are obsolete so i began installing and preparing glew and freeglut

20915519
freeglut	glew
latest stable releases of freeglut and glew

20915526
fadein	fadeout
with function like fadeout and fadein you can use callbacks like this

20915526
fadein	fadeout
so once fadeout is completed it triggers fadein

20915543
margin	text-align
you cannot margin auto to center the div that has max-width and display inline-block set but you can use text-align center - which is recognized by all major browsers

20915551
folder	directory
create a directory in your public folder or any other place

20915564
client-side	server-side
if you re looking for efficiency you should use the same module to render at both server-side and client-side

20915580
ng-show	ng-hide
the value of ng-show ng-hide is just an expression that can be evaluated into boolean

20915585
versioning	upgrade
i simply asked them to upgrade me to the latest versioning which was 5.4.22...and that solved the issue

20915585
versioning	upgrade
so i would bet that if you have this same occurrence upgrade the server acting up to the latest versioning of php or something over 5.3 and you should be good

20915613
ready	each
each split is waiting for the real compute to happen and will then merge the results upwards again when ready

20915623

20915693
versioning	upgrade
you should upgrade your development machine on aws to match the versioning on your local machine

20915697
min	max
in trilinear filtering min max and mipfilter linear you get bilinear filtering for both the next larger and next smaller mip level and then you interpolate again with appropriate weights between those results

20915712
int	double
the problem is that int is specifically double is specifically and so on so to use their compareto you have to pass in a reference of the appropriate type which means that you have to have an object of the appropriate type

20915712
int	double
note that the cast in double new int 0 will never succeed because you can t have a reference of one type that points to an object of an incompatible type

20915716
post	get
as swasheck mentioned in his post since you are having multiple grouping sets in your query you will get multiple rows only

20915746

20916524
hide	show
presently i am using a script to show hide comments on a number of wordpress-based sites

i discovered that if you have a background image with background-attachment fixed on a table data element or another element with display table-cell it s broken in firefox at least in version 26.0 but works correctly in google-chrome and safari for example

20922023
min	max
newurldata rand min max

20922029
folder	directory
1 i want to create multiple folder in my wamp s www directory each representing a website

20922029
folder	directory
2 add multiple entries to my host file with different ip addresses each pointing to one of the folder in the wamp s www directory

20922029
folder	directory
so lets say i create 3 folder in my wamp www directory named - site1 site2 site3 and add the following to my host file

20922044
put	get
for instance if you want to get the company lookup create a ilookupservice and put getlookupsbycompany int companyid method to retrieve the company lookups

20922051
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
1- you are modifying the arrays object in your for-loop after the first splice the arrays is changed and the arr.length is totally different for the rest of your loops items to prevent it create a variable like len and set it to the length of your arrays once

20922067
hide	show
if it is true it must hide the field value otherwise show the field value

20922077
post	get
to try and get a bit more flexibility around setting the headers and to try out what i found in the post on cors i decided to revert back to a standard class based view as below

20922080
free	realloc
you also need to remember that realloc can fail and in that case will set dizi to null making you both dereference a null pointer and loose the original pointer so you can t free it

20922080
realloc	malloc
also don t cast the result of malloc or realloc for that matter

20922083
shadowing	named
you re assigning the named hjk to the sampleclass s object passed into recmod which is shadowing the class member s

20922101
getter	setter
now my question is whether to make getter and setter functions for a x static

20922101
getter	setter
it seems to me that it makes absolutely no practical difference whether i add these getter and setter functions to a as static or as nonstatic member functions

20922103
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
it works properly on my desktop browsers firefox safari google-chrome but on an iphone the map gets drawn but not the images

20922134
width	height
and a link is created which will return thumbnail with width no more than 400 and height no more than 300 px

20922135
post	get
not that it was the fix that i was looking for but i did get eagle cad installed on a fresh install of the regular fedora 20 64-bit by following the link provided by rickhg12hs in the comments of the original post

20922135
rpm	yum
i am not sure what caused all of the problems with yum and rpm db

20922163
hide	show
i have deployed google+ sign-in button now i have to provide sign-out button before that i need to know whether the user is still signed in by which i can then show or hide this button

20922167
min	max
if you were to transform this box s min max by the same matrix that makes up your effect.world property you would be golden

20922215
getter	setter
if you need to call your setter getter when no instance of the class has been instantiated make them static

20922263
submit	submission
you should bind your callback function to the submit event that the form dispatches and make it return false to cancel the actual submission

20922293
mdpi	hdpi	screens	hdpi	screens	mdpi
check the screens density at run time ldpi hdpi mdpi or xhdpi using

20922293
width	height
and then change the height and width of your imageview accordingly at run time say 400 400 for xhdpi

20922299
qstring	qtextstream
another right way would be to fix your current code without using qtextstream by using the dedicated qstring method as follows

20922336
inherited	properties
the keycommands properties is a properties on uiresponder and uiwebview inherited from uiresponder so i can see no reason why it won t work

20922385
firefox	safari
this is my working piece of code for ie 10 firefox and safari

20922406
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
there are some browser compatibility issues but according to this post the guy says that it is compatible with ie 7 ie8 ie9 pr3 firefox 3.0 firefox 3.5 firefox 3.6 firefox 4b1 saf 4.0 win saf 5.0 win google-chrome 4 google-chrome 5 opera 10.10 opera 10.53 and opera 10.60

20922437
pull	push
use server push or pull technology to read saved notifications and add them into snotify queue so that notification will appear in the user page when admin do operations

20922442
jlist	jtextfield
when the user click a value to edit on the jlist the jtextfield have to appear

20922474
maven	cargo
as an alternative to using an embedded tomcat for integration tests have a look at the maven cargo plugin to running a full standard tomcat at the integration testing phase and a tool such has the chronos jmeter maven plugin to sending requests to the server and producing test report results

20922489
hide	show
you need to call revalidate and repaint methods of container which contains your jtextfield if you try to show hide components of visible container

20922511
put	get
i want to put a callback in the form module but i can t seem to get it to expose

20922518
int	double
i ve double checked that strings are strings and int are int etc

20922537
eventlet	gevent
the docs of both eventlet and gevent have several examples on how to asyncronously spawn io tasks and get the results latter

20922576
post	put
the forms are build in extjs and its making put and post request to server for saving data

20922577
free	malloc
if you don t use malloc for obtaining a pointer you should not free it as this will cause undefined behaviour

20922577
free	malloc
in order to not create memory leaks you should free what you malloc ed

20922577
free	malloc
some library function will return pointers which also need to be free because they used malloc to create the pointer for you

20922584
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
edit however while the latest firefox google-chrome safari opera and internet explorer ie10 behave as expected ie9 and below will actually fire both functions even though both script tags are removed from the dom

20922588
int	double
edit or not seems i forgot bitxor will do an implicit conversion to int - still an implicit conversion may not always do what you expect so my point remains plus it s far more efficient to store 8-bit int data in the appropriate type rather than double

20922600
daemons	systemd
note the won t work because the adb daemons writes all output to the systemd standard output

20922616
width	height
in the storyboard size inspector try setting height width and origin with sufficiently large values

20922634
pop-up	dialog

20922637
dictionary	map
i want to create a map dictionary that looks like this id parentelementid

20922642
width	height
the code does add an image with the correct width and height but it is just black

20922653
getter	setter
the property setter and getter

20922669
free	malloc
you need to free q not w since w no longer points to what malloc returned

20922672
interpolation	splines
blue lines cubic splines interpolation

20922682
dictionary	map
instead you just use a big map dictionary and log named events

20922712
jar	war
check if the cglib jar is inside the war

20922714
button	checkbox
it also has a checkbox to allow the user to select certain items and then on a button click do something with them

20922776
post	get
so using the above code i get a line of text on my web page which has the column content and then the count of photos that were uploaded for each post on all the events for a user

20922814
jobs	cron
i need to run some action from command line because i want to do some scheduled task cron jobs

20922943
google-chrome	firefox
maybe open the console and check the javascript error messages ctrl + shift + i in google-chrome firefox others might be different

20922945
luac	luajit
however luajit isn t capable of compiling multiple scripts into one output file at the command line like luac

20922945
luac	luajit
simply replacing luac with an instance of luajit won t do

20922969
preorder	inorder
given here is the code for constructing a tree from the inorder and preorder traversals

20923026
punctuation	words
the example above uses the predefined words break iterator which returns the index of the beginning of a words or punctuation characters and moves through the text on successive calls

20923026
punctuation	words
the loop is just extracting the words by using the current and previous locations returned by the iterator punctuation will be extracted as separate words

20923032
preorder	inorder
you are traversing the whole preorder array inside the recursion and in each stack frame you are searching a number in inorder traversal array

20923038
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome it works like a charm but when i open it on firefox or ie the height of the sub menus aren t the correct size

20923094
preorder	inorder
the o n 2 complexity results from the fact that for every item in the preorder traversal of which there are n you have to search for its partition in the inorder traversal again there are n of these

20923094
preorder	inorder
roughly speaking you can consider this algorithm as placing the nodes on a grid where the inorder traversal provides the x co-ordinates and the preorder traversal provides the y co-ordinates

20923094
preorder	inorder
take the example they gave with the following traversals inorder then preorder

20923094
preorder	inorder
consider this tree where the preorder and inorder traversals are the same

20923106
google-chrome	firefox
the response from the server will be in the network panel in google-chrome browser or use firebug extension for firefox

20923116
jar	war
and that you stick to osgi system by adding in your pom.xml to jar war plugin such configuraiton

20923150
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox looking same on my mac

20923165
subtraction	addition
i managed to write increment and decrement functions but the addition and subtraction seem even less documented and harder to write

20923177
portrait	landscape
the site loads properly on the iphone in portrait but when rotated to landscape it seems to zoom in and only shows half of the page

20923177
google-chrome	firefox
when i test on my desktop in google-chrome and firefox the layout collapses and expands as expected

20923238
implements	extends
the documentation includes a list of classes that implements the interface so you can reference those and or extends one of them to produce the desired functionality

20923282
min	max
i m trying to calculate statistics min max avg... of streaks of consecutive higher values of a column

20923287
post	get
i tried the code found on this so post video encoding using avassetwriter - crashes but can t get it to work

20923307
width	height
first i divide original height and width of element to window height and width qh and qw

20923307
width	height
it works for width but not for height

20923330
happy	alex
alex has no way of knowing what you want to emit and happy has no way of knowing what you chose to emit via alex.

20923350
strsplit	substr
instead of strsplit i would use substr and string.indexof to get only the first line and avoid unnecessary with the entire input string

20923366
strsplit	substr
strsplit will create a whole array of substr which is wasteful for your requirement

20923459
hide	show
in the indexview the tabbar is show when i click a button to present another view settingview i want to hide the tabbar

20923472
hash	salt
but mind you either way you need to somehow hardcode a key salt hash password in your app which can be reversed engineered one way or the other

20923537
mutators	setter
this new class will have mutators setter methods that allow outside classes set its rectangle y position and height

20923552
realloc	malloc
replace the realloc with malloc which is equivalent but reads better

20923555
google-chrome	firefox
tested on firefox and google-chrome

20923556
int	double
i know that the cause of this is the double inaccuracy which stems from math.pow int int returning a double

20923568
post	get
there is totally no difference if you pass authenticity token via get params post data or request headers post get params are virtually the same in rails

20923568
post	put
i should add that token is generated for every request and stored in session for later inspection if subsequent request is post put patch delete

20923600
udp	tcp
the receivers can be grouped some only unterstand plain tcp or udp some of them use a http-rest interface

hide	show
hide show pros

20923755
mktime	strftime
on a 64-bit system the limits are given by std mktime and std strftime in my own code i have unit test for those strings and the corresponding values

20923774
hide	show
in my experience hide and show is a better approach because it doesn t mess with the dom

20923781
versioning	upgrade
according to my experience and expertise you need to upgrade the lower versioning in two steps

20923781
versioning	upgrade
anyhow coming towards your point as you directly upgrade 1.3 to 1.8 so you need to use ssh with some simple commands to see the exact versioning upgrade and any other issue you can see via ssh

20923845
rspec	capybara
every time i run rspec and capybara my firefox browser opens

20923856

so far i am able to find out the public rss feed url of a facebook page s status update

20923958
division	multiplication
for a small number such as 3 8 there is not much significant improvement even those we minimize the number of multiplication but we also slightly increase the number of division operation

20923958
division	multiplication
multiplication division

20923958
division	multiplication

20923971
printf	strlen
character or the strlen and printf will just keep going until they hit a null character or crash the program

20923978
min	max
try to assing the smaller values to an other yaxis so the graph will show 2 different yaxes the first with a big interval the second with an interval that permits to show correctly the smaller values if you want to show the difference between the two kind of data you could use min and max on the smaller yaxis

20924012
integer	fractions
recall that under integer division rules the fractions part is discarded

20924044
min	max
what you can do is resizing the interval try with min and max

20924081
folder	directory
where a is the directory containing the original files b is the desired repository folder which the script will create and c is the filename to use for all versions of your file

20924142

i.e if it s google-chrome it will show image x if firefox it will show image z if ie it will show image y

20924151
post	get
curl_exec makes it easy to quickly and easily do get post requests receive responses from other servers like json and download files

20924151
post	get
you can do get and post requests with curl all you do is specify the parameters as defined here

20924163
realloc	malloc
the correct code which creates a memory block with malloc and extends it with realloc after 32 it exits while loop and writes everything from the p1 pointer from memory thanks for help

20924168
put	get
i am trying to put together a page that will have a horizontally scrolling pane on it - here is an example of the layout i am looking to get

20924186
src	attr
i you want just to show that image you just have to add that var to the src attr of a image tag or opening it as a popup passing the var as the href attr of the window

20924223
implements	extends
to implements your own paintcomponent you must extends your jpanel and this is how it is usually done

20924223
implements	extends
you can implements your own paintcomponent method in the extends classes

20924228
src	attr
i you want just to show that image you just have to add that var to the src attr of a image tag or opening it as a popup passing the var as the href attr of the window

20924247
mouseover	mouseout
what i came up with is on mouseover - bind scroll for current element then on mouseout unbind it and in the bind function i change the scrolltop example

20924254
range	max	range	min	min	max
as a work-around you might try asking it to display -setneedsdisplay yes or manually twiddling its min max range after setting the date then setting it back to unlimited immediately after

20924287
width	height
if you use css to change that default width or height the browser will stretch your circle s pixels to fit the new canvas size

20924301
splinter	selenium
this all works fine but im looking for a way to save the webpage once logged in from looking around splinter can not do this also looked at selenium which didnt seem to be able to do it either

20924321
subversive	javahl
i also noticed that when i look at the svn connector dropdown in my subversive preferences it s currently set to native javahl 1.6.15 but some of the other choices in the dropdown are interesting is the path to my eclipse distro

20924325
width	height
the div that i am trying to centre is a scroll-down button that uses jquery and has a custom icon font made by me and default width height

20924426
hash	salt
in this code on line 15 in order to verify if the login password the original and now hash salt password it looks to me like you are just a creating a new hash salt value using the login password and the original and now hash salt password and then b comparing the value created in a to the original and now hash salt password

20924426
hash	salt
for example let s say a user signs up with a password of test which let s say for simplicity gets hash salt to 1234

20924464
pull	push
ios audio queues use a pull model not a push model

20924464
queue	fifo
instead your app has to temporarily save the data into an intermediate data buffer circular queue or fifo and then return to the run-loop

20924508
cos	sin
take a look at the definition of the sin and cos function in text books - in python see what happens as you move from sin 0 to sin math.pi and cos 0 to cos math.pi

20924525
hash	salt
when you use bcrypt is not using the hash password as the salt

20924525
hash	salt
it is extracting the salt from the hash password and then using that

20924525
crypt	salt	crypt	hash	hash	salt
the result of crypt is so if you take the beginning of the hash password you get the original salt

20924532
try-catch	exception-handling
i have tried wrapping some of the places where exception-handling are thrown in try-catch blocks but got the impression that that was crippling meteor too much such that it wouldn t properly initialize for a different reason

20924534
cpu	irq
if your system has numa node then while putting your 10g card in pci_e slot check which cpu pci-e slot you are going to put then according to that assign irq to particular cpu core s and see if it helps

20924552
dictionary	map
second you can then grab the array of locations out of that top-level array create annotations for each location dictionary in that array and add it to your map

20924552
nsstring	nsjsonserialization
also as a stylistic observation many people would generally represent the latitude and longitude values as numbers without the quotation marks and the nsjsonserialization would parse them as nsnumber objects rather than nsstring objects

20924567
put	get
hopefully when if they get out of beta there will be some more effort put into documentation

20924574
hide	show
in your widget you need to look at globalvariables and check the value of above and then do your if else logic to show or hide parts of content in sidebar

20924596
minimum	max
warning max 1024 open files allowed minimum of 40 000 recommended

20924596

google-chrome	firefox
i have problem with coding a header the header i have coded is being displayed well in google-chrome but its not in firefox

20924631
getter	setter
i know i could have a one line getter setter for my properties that pass in the correct string values to the read write methods

20924676
realloc	malloc
however if you want to do it with two pointers instead of array indexing you need one pointer to track the whole array for malloc and realloc and the other to track where the current value is for reading writing

20924733
fast-forward	merge
therefore it might be a good idea to merge stable into your other branches feature-1 and master testing there and then merging back into stable which should now give you a fast-forward merge

20924746
getter	setter
the relationship is that the the property has associated with it a getter and a setter

20924746
getter	setter
the getter setter itself has no a priori knowledge that it is being used as a getter setter

20924746
getter	setter
for instance multiple properties could use the same getter setter

20924746
getter	setter
so the best you can do as it stands is to iterate over all the properties of the type using rtti looking for the currently executing method as a property getter setter

20924746
getter	setter
i suspect that the best attribute based approach involves attaching attributes to the getter setter methods

20924756
octree	quadtree
consider looking into quadtree or for 3d octree

20924821
opera	safari
with opera and safari it s fine

or one might want to persist domain objects to all three kinds of databases like relational postgresql mysql mongodb document store and neo4j graph database just for evaluating

20924981
folder	directory
i am trying to read all files and folder in a directory specified by the user

20924981
folder	directory
this works and gives me a list of the file names and folder in the root directory

20924986
pull	push
note once you start using gerrit as your gateway to github you should not push directly to github anymore but rely on either pull requests imported to gerrit or directly pushing to gerrit and working through changes review

20925002
typedef	using-declaration
a typedef is just a transparent alias similarly a using-declaration

20925002
typedef	using-declaration
typedef names and using-declaration used to specify the types do not contribute to this set

20925053
width	height
by default it opens the pdf and scales it to fit the entire width in the view but not the height

20925057
versioning	upgrade
upgrade their php versioning

20925084

submit	submission
when user attempts to submit the form it is validated with jquery and if the validation is passed the main input field is being modified with jquery and then the submission continues

20925115
rsa	aes
and regarding your first question it is definitely possible to encrypt decrypt messages directly using rsa there are only technical and performance reasons aes is much faster than rsa why rsa is used only to encrypt a session key and aes is used to encrypt decrypt the messages themselves

20925118
cos	sin
you can use interpolation as follows sin x+dx sin x + dx cos x

20925118
cos	sin
cos x sin pi 2-x

20925118
cos	sin
similarly cos x+dx cos x - dx sin x

20925156

20925210
apache	nginx
i ve just migrated my joomla website from apache to nginx

20925215
width	height	portrait	landscape
for example if you re working on ipad simulator and want the view to be full screen set x and y to 0 and set the width and height to 768 and 1024 on portrait or 1024 and 768 if you have selected landscape

20925215

however the text label at that point has adjusted its width but not height

20925251
uiview	subviews
however as a uipickerview in the end is a uiview with subviews i checked what subviews there were

20925253
osx	yosemite
update this also applies to yosemite el capitan and all the other versions of osx that can run android studio

20925267
syntastic	youcompleteme
turns out this was more of a youcompleteme problem than it was syntastic

post	get
you should be doing this as a post request not as a get

20925300
postgresql	mysql
in postgresql mysql .

put	get	post	get	post	put
i am making a booking system and have a big input form and my plan is to load the data into objects bookings customers etc. when it comes into the program so that i don t lose the data during successive post backs get these objects to write it to the database it is a requirement of my client to write all data to the database as soon as it comes in to the program to minimize loss if the system goes down and to then retain those objects software side as the program has to put constrains on what users can book check that these services are available to them and this would require some logic which would be easier with objects instead of having to back to the database a lot

since the crypt function expects the salt kind of base64 encoded you cannot pass 126 bits directly

the way i would solve this is by changing the environment to allow the settimeout setinterval functions similarly to how the browsers do it

20936745

but here to add the data into the collection instead would never work as int and double are not superclass of number and

20936890
super	extends
i understand the pecs concept producer extends consumer super

when you call realloc you must pass to realloc a pointer that was created by an earlier call to malloc realloc or similar

20938644
realloc	malloc
if you do an assignment instead of a copy the pointer no longer points to something returned by malloc making it illegal to pass that pointer to realloc

20938655
free	realloc
it s a static address which is not eligible for realloc free

20938694
ontouchevent	ondraw
it could be that you are not registering the ontouchlistener to the view in a constructor im not really sure but here ontouchevent is a method you override like ondraw for a view maybe that would suit you better

20938771
int	chars
the method public chars charat int index returns a chars so the line

20938771
int	chars
every chars is actually an int value that is interpreted as an chars

20938771
int	chars
therefore adding two chars s produces an int

20938775
int	double
6 double and 1 int go into the dongle 1 double and 1 int are returned

my css formatting works fine on firefox google-chrome and opera but there is a problem on safari browser

20938923
ubuntu	linux
after searching on google i have only been finding issues with other linux distros mostly ubuntu

20938977
pycrypto	m2crypto
i know this works using pycrypto and not m2crypto because a colleague already succeded in decrypting the message

20938985
post	get
that said any parameter you can send in a button post can also be sent in a plain get url so yes you should be able to pass in a notify_url directly in the get parameters as you show above

20938998
post	get
so in the comments of that post i saw that you need to implement the following function to return the uiview to get it to stick

20939039
rss	feed
i am trying to show the images in the following rss feed and would appreciate help from somebody please

20939042
jar	war
if you want to run app builded with guide building a restful web service on server then read guide converting a spring boot jar application to a war

20939075
ubuntu	debian
see this answer about openmp slowing down the convert utility on debian ubuntu systems

20939100
x86	64bit
since the only works on the x86 simulator you will need a slightly different mechanism for the 64bit simulator and devices

20939150
hide	show
the fact is that most of these applications on windows only mimic the multi-desktop behavior but they simply show hide the corresponding windows taskbar background etc

20939163
getter	setter
can anybody explain what this code does exactly i understood that it is some type of setter and getter in java but i am not sure

20939182
subclass	abstract-class
i have an abstract-class in package foo in this particular case a trait that can be implemented by various subclasses and i d like to create an orthogonal subclass for use in a more specific package bar that adds package-specific info

20939182
inherited	subclassing
it seems the best way is by composition wrapping rather than inherited because otherwise i d have to declare package-specific versions of every single one of the foo -package subclassing

20939184
int	chars
if there are not int in the name of datatype then sqlite will look for chars clob or text expressions

20939184
int	chars
if there are not int chars clob or text in the datatype name then sqlite will look for blob expression

20939223
int	chars
for example when i wanted to see if element is chars or int then i used sizeof

20939286
apache	nginx
i can t install http server like apache or nginx and can t install php too

20939297
uptime	reboot
the uptime can also be queried - but i guess most people switch their device off or otherwise reboot it

20939319
stdout	fflush
most terminals will buffer the standard-output until either a newline n is encountered or fflush stdout is called

20939319
stdout	fflush
add fflush stdout

20939380
int	chars
the type of u00e1 is chars but g++ is treating it as an int

20939380
int	chars
the chars literal u00e1 has just one c-char-sequence which happens to be a universal-character-name so it s of type chars but g++ is incorrectly treating it as a multi-character constant of type int

20939380
int	chars
since you re writing to std wcout you probably wanted a wide chars literal l u00e1 which is of type char_t rather than u00e1 which if your compiler handles it correctly is of type int

20939411
rhel	suse
the google compute engine announcement mentions support for rhel suse and freebsd

20939411
debian	centos
on vm creation only debian and centos are available

20939433
int	double
i have array with values from excel int double dates and i have class

20939446
for-loop	loops
i am trying to loops through i and j but when 1 length files i 1 .day j .hour 24 so when the hours are less than 24 i would like to exit loops and continue onto the next iteration of the for-loop

20939446
for-loop	loops
i would also like it to exit loops and continue onto the next iteration of the for-loop if 1 length files i 1 .day j .hour h .halfhour 2 so when the half hours are less than 2 or if 1 length files i 1 .day j .hour is an empty cell no data

20939458
nsurlconnection	nsurlsession
right now i m using nsurlconnection and i m trying to update my code to use nsurlsession instead

20939476
prepare	bindvalue
but now i m getting past the prepare line and want to give my values to the query with bindvalue but this next error is what i get call to a member function bindvalue on a non-object

20939638
for-loop	arrays
to avoid this problem a for-loop would be better since you already know the size of the arrays

20939660
tabcontrol	tabitem
the solution is either to stick with separate datatemplates for both the tabcontrol and the tabitem and just fix it so that the datatemplateselector actually works for the tabitem no idea how to do this

20939674
vcard	vcf
i make my code to get the csv to a vcard vcf again

20939680
int	double
unlike int multiplying floats double and adding them up doesn t produce exactly the same results

20939680
min	max
same for std min max

20939681
rspec	capybara
with capybara rspec you could at least write something like

20939684
pop-up	dialog
i want to be able to call this from the beforeclose event as well however even though it still does what it s supposed to do after the userform message box has displayed and been unloaded then it still pop-up the save dialog box

20939685
for-loop	loops
given that and the fact that your for-loop has no termination expression the compiler knows that your loops will never end and therefore any code that comes after it will never execute

20939692
for-loop	loops
is causing you to break out of thisblock obviously which because of its placement inside the for-loop is causing loops to iterate through again instead of exiting it

20939700
int	double
i would recommend restructuring your loop to iterate using int and then converting the int into double like this

20939711
inherited	subclassing
the code in the question could benefit from a super call in the __init__ in case it ever gets subclassing in a multiple inherited situation but otherwise is correct

20939730
inherited	properties
it may affect object properties and it may be written with some assumptions about the prototype chain but it s not inherently bound up with the mechanism of inherited

20939754
hide	show
what i want to do is show hide the popover s based on the same functions in the ng-show attributes above

20939754
hide	show
so that when the expression returns false hide it and when it returns true show it

20939789
hide	show
should i maybe hide this results after i parse them in java code - results where one company is show twice

20939801
put	get
so it will try to open testxml which is what you get if you put test and xml together instead of test.xml

20939860
inherited	properties
as you say in tpt approach navigation properties can t be inherited

20939891
mouse	keyboard
another words once i click on the scrollbar i would like to be able to move the scrollbar with the keyboard left right arrow keys or the mouse

20939915
http	spdy
their attacks target both the socket layer crime and application layer breach and applies to http and related protocols like spdy

20939915
http	spdy
you still have to watch for compression leaks at higher layers due to breach for protocols like spdy and http

radio button are not checkbox

20940074
spaces	delimiter
i m trying to tokenize a result string from cscope symbol search which is composed of a few fields delimiter by white spaces

20940143
getter	setter
you are passing a string to the .css method this means you are using it as a getter and not a setter

20940168
unsigned	short
these macros reverse bytes in variables of integral types short unsigned short int unsigned int long long and unsigned long long provided that they have correspondingly sizes of 16 32 and 64 bits

20940168
unsigned	short
for example if there is some variable of type unsigned short that has value 0x1234 then after applying the first macro es16 0x1234 the result will be 0x3412

20940225
hex	binary
this means the value of cx was correct in your original post as 1 is 1 whether in decimal or hex or binary so whatever changes you made that should not be what solved it

20940267
cos	sin
where rho is sin theta and phi is cos theta and theta is the angle of rotation

20940306
128bit	64bit
i thought that since cuda can do 64bit 128bit load store it might have some intrinsics for adding subtracting etc

20940348
width	height
since the default arrows are in the .mfp-container i cannot just absolutely position them because the picture can have any height and width and i need it to be pixel perfect

20940353
bufferedreader	printwriter
bufferedreader input and printwriter output are both used with a tcp socket from within the same thread

20940441
width	height
the css that makes these constrained in width and height was in my case

20940450
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream	serializable	deserialization
p.s. if you are having problems with the object replacements in the serializable deserialization objectinputstream and objectoutputstream classes have replaceobject and resolveobject methods which allows us to replace the types of objects in the serializable

20940464
width	height
radx rady is the width and height of the rect bounding the ellipse

20940479
oncreate	onnewintent
i tried adding the intent-filter programatically in the oncreate method of mainactivity and overriding the onnewintent method but with no luck

20940484
min	max
if the axes min max change on a setdata call you need to call plot.setupgrid to recalculate the axeses

20940494
floating-point	fixed-point
you may need to do this when you output some of the buffers if you want to store the normal g-buffer more efficiently in an 8-bit fixed-point texture instead of floating-point

20940524
addition	multiplication
each thread as of kepler can only run 1 single-precision floating point operation at a time with the exception of the fma - which can perform 1 multiplication and 1 addition in a single instruction z a x + y

20940580
google-chrome	firefox
not working in google-chrome but working fine in firefox please help its driving me crazy

20940609
fread	read.table
test out read.csv read.table with and without optimised arguments such as colclasses against fread

20940609
fread	read.table
the results show again in favour of fread with rbindlist over optimised read.table with rbind functionality

20940609
fread	read.table
interestingly for 1 million rows per file the optimised version of read.csv and read.table take 422 and 430 more time than fread whilst without optimisation this leaps to around 1500 and 1005 longer

20940625
ftgl	freetype
i m trying to build a project in windows using vs2012 2010 also available that includes ftgl which depends on freetype

20940646
put	get
assuming you want to get the total sum of all income owned and put it on #totalincome here you have replace your getcost by all this

20940667
post	get
if your videos text and image post differ by a small enough number of fields you ll get much better performance by just implementing what some call single table inheritance a single table that has all the columns for all the subtypes plus a type column with the same purpose as above

20940734
imperative	declarative
are writing imperative instead of declarative scenarios

20940734
imperative	declarative
see here for examples of an imperative and declarative scenarios

20940755
getter	setter
a possible solution would be to make numel return prod size obj and write explicit getter setter functions for all these properties

20940796
free	calloc	free	malloc	free	realloc	realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
you can only free the result of malloc calloc realloc

20940800
packets	pcap
the way that pcap works with receive packets is to just put it in a continual loop breaking when you hit a time when you want to close

20940837
daemons	systemd	daemons	launchd
create a systemd level launchd daemons

20940881
maven	pom.xml
i think pom.xml has proper configuration because i am able to view included webjars bootstrap and jquery in eclipse under java resources - libraries - maven dependencies

20940922
width	height
the width and height can only divide so far

20940923
pop-up	dialog
css html dialog eg jqueryui dialog create a fake pop-up inside your page usually to give the content some prominence

20940945
width	height
if you want to click only the initial image then simply put the width and height variable outside the click function and update them inside for each click

20940957
width	height
just setting the width to half seems to be enough with an img element the height gets set automatically in proportion to the width

20940957
width	height
but if you find you need to set the width and the height here s one way to do it

20940960
fadein	fadeout
i d like to alternatively fadein fadeout two div by cliking on a third one

20940960
fadein	fadeout
i can do the first animation fadeout alpha fadein beta but on the second click i d like to do the inverse and so on.

20940968
getter	setter
i want to be able to create two instances of dell and then extend the prototype to either laptop or desktop so i can use the appropriate getter setter

20940970
width	margin
setting width to 100 does something a little odd in html it makes the width 100 and the padding border and margin will all appear outside of that full width

20940985
implements	extends
you can add your sqlite database file to the assets folder in your application project and then extends and implements sqliteopenhelper to perform crud operations in your database

20940987
ubuntu	linux
install it like this on ubuntu linux for example

20940990
box-sizing	border-box
alternatively if you don t have to support older browsers ie 6 7 you could use the property box-sizing border-box

20940993
pull	push
in addition if i do git pull or git push i get

20940993
pull	push
and i couldn t git pull or git push inside the common folder as in the prototype main project

20940993
pull	push
of course i can add origin master to make pull and push work for common in the cloned project but this seems to defeat the purpose of having a tracking submodule submodule add -b

20941013
children	parent
the parent directive videplayer simply exposes the api for the children to use

20941029
subtract	add
in each next game tick add speed to your y position and subtract 1 from speed

that said if you care about speed the simplest speed-up is often to run pypy instead of cpython if your application allows it

20941099
width	height
width 2 and height 2 for retina display

20941103
qdatastream	qbytearray
if anything i would suggest to send the raw file data over with qbytearray and or qdatastream

20941103
qstring	qbytearray
this would be the first step and then you could build your qbytearray or qstring

20941126
for-loop	loops
i m supposed to use a while loops for the first 4 loops and a for-loop for the remaining 15 loops

20941141
post	get
i will post that here if i get it working

20941158
jar	manifest.mf
the jars already have a manifest.mf file but signtool creates a new manifest.mf file in the meta-inf directory and uses that to sign the jar

20941166
post	get
to add a reservation you should strongly consider changing the server side route to accept a post instead of a get request as you are modifying data

20941204
domxpath	domdocument
catchable fatal error argument 1 passed to domxpath __construct must be an instance of domdocument null given called in c hiddenpath w extensions test test.body.php on line 10 and defined in c hiddenpath w includes parser preprocessor_dom.php on line 984

20941231
vmware	virtualbox
use virtualbox instead of vmware

20941237
gson	jackson
i would recommend that you use a json mapping library like jackson or gson manually parsing json is a waste of time and effort unless it is purely for educational purposes

20941287
google-chrome	firefox
pressing ctrl + shift + j in internet explorer or google-chrome and ctrl + shift + k in firefox will lead you to the console in which you can paste your javascript code to be executed

20941311
folder	directory
i am testing on a local server on my mac both the form file handler and the uploads folder are in the same file directory with one another

20941327
codeigniter	pyrocms
i was taking a look at pyrocms as i have some familiarity with php and codeigniter but i don t know if this would fit the bill

20941371
google-chrome	firefox
it s not an issue in firefox but google-chrome shows this issue

20941381
int	double
now then we try to change the value to 11 while adding no double quotes therefor it thought you were changing it to an int and gave the error

20941401
put	get
you could put each of these things in separate containers probably hash tables or balanced binary trees sorted arrays if they don t change much keyed on their student id but then you d have to find them all separately and access lots of pages of memory to get all the information for a single student

20941412
min	max
the mps file is fine but apparently you need a paramaters file as well to tell the solver what to do min max etc.

20941425
rockmongo	robomongo
you can give a try with robomongo rockmongo i hope you will like them

20941437
getter	setter
if one setter is called second getter socket.taxiid

20941468
inline	inlining
open-coding aka inlining means replacing function calls with inline assembly

20941477

i d prefer not to use tell for this safari google-chrome because i don t want to depend on apps

20941592
width	height
with cover the image will be sized to the smallest dimension that will allow it to cover both the browser width and height

20941614
int	double
the problem is the standard effects that come with the sdk have arguments such as int and double which are just parameters to adjust the effects but the class i created which extends the customeffectbase requires iimageprovider source as an argument

20941628
dictionary	map
structs classes map data and functions whether through pointers or as methods to identifiers provided by the programmer in the source code while hash tables dictionary map data to key values provided by the user of the compiled code either directly or indirectly

20941637
interpolation	splines
since you know both the position and the velocity of the object at each time point the natural choice would be to use cubic splines interpolation

20941641
mouseleave	mouseenter
you can achieve this using mouseenter and mouseleave

20941662
versioning	upgrade
according to bam-502 the solution is to upgrade the thrift versioning

20941662
versioning	upgrade
therefore bam team may consider to upgrade thrift versioning in next release

20941666
free	malloc
in your loop each time malloc is called it looks for a free space in the memory and allocate the size passed as argument which means that each time it s called the pointer point is pointing to a new space in the memory and the previous space is lost but the memory in that space still reserved which leads to memory leaks

20941668
width	height
instead of padding try using width and height

20941676
vim	textmate
i have no idea what s going on and i really miss my vim as good as textmate is i can t be without vim forever

20941729
src	attr
you are using data.filter script which is not returning anything instead use find and in your function you are using but as script has no html inside it so it will not give you anything instead access attr src and append it to your script tag

20941736
width	height
i would use a specific width and height instead

20941747
instances	transient
yes you are correct anything being serialized including all classes referred to by fields instances variables must implement serializable or the field must be transient

20941765
fast-forward	merge
if you keep that partitioning you ll be able to simply git pull in the site repositories and git will fast-forward merge the changes from main into your site repo

20941767
zclip	zeroclipboard
i am quite new to html css js so before trying to apply zeroclipboard to my own project i wanted to get it running using the example code provided at the zclip site

20941786
client-side	server-side
however if both buttons are submit buttons you can test server-side which one was pressed and redirect as appropriate thus avoiding the need for any client-side js

20941786
client-side	server-side
in my opinion a server-side only solution is better for this particular requirement because it s easy to do it keeps the client-side stuff simple and obviously will work even in browsers where the end user has disabled javascript not that many users do that but it does happen

20941796
post	get
idatastruct should be a java interface annotated with restlet api annotations such as get post etc

20941817
submit	submission
there is a captcha meant for the last submission but the problem is that when i add it to the form i can t use any of the other submit buttons because the captcha isn t filled out

20941824
google-chrome	firefox
when i finished the html file press f4 to run it with firefox or google-chrome

20941849
uilabel	uibutton
you are first getting the parent view of view that contains uibutton and uilabel

20941849
uilabel	uibutton
so if i assume there is no error in the line below and that it returns correct uitableviewcell or whatever other view is the parent of both uilabel and uibutton

20941849
uilabel	uibutton
we can clearly see the problem with both uilabel and uibutton having the same tags

20941849
uilabel	uibutton
do not give the uilabel the same tag as uibutton

20941849
uilabel	uibutton
use unique tags for uilabel and for uibutton

20941849
uiview	subviews
you could easily loop through uiview s subviews property which is an array and find the uilabel manually - this works if there is only one uilabel or you are looking for all of them

20941875
google-chrome	firefox
this works really nice on firefox but on google-chrome it doesn t and it goes both for my locak machine and server

20941905
getter	setter
they look like this i removed some annotations getter and setter to reduce clutter

20941937
post	put
post controller put controller id delete controller id

20941943
post	get
from reading a couple post i think i would want to use the csv python module but can t get it working

20941944
hash	salt
in a typical setting the salt and the password are concatenated and processed with a cryptographic hash function and the resulting output but not the original password is stored with the salt in a database

20941967
post	put
i call it in a promise handler for once my post put operation has completed

20941967
post	put
if need be have the post put return the url to call if you can t already infer it

20941967
put	get	post	get	post	put
you ll get the same behavior for the user as if it had downloaded in response to the put post

20941993
google-chrome	firefox
working example in ie11 firefox and google-chrome

20942000
hash	salt
it s not uncommon to store both the salt and the hash result of the password and salt in a single field

20942009
hide	show
in this detailed view it will only show fields that have a value and hide the rest

20942009
hide	show
i am using a third party staticdatatableviewcontroller class to hide and show cells

20942011
skip-lists	tree
conceptually between should efficiently find an element about half way between begin and end but we should be careful to allow a randomized skip-lists or a balanced red black tree to both work

20942059
int	chars
it falls in the padding after the two chars values and before the int value in the structure and is quasi random junk

20942113
draggable	droppable
i have a draggable element with revert true but when it gets successfully dropped the helper clone remains on the droppable where i let go

20942126

20946811
google-chrome	firefox
i did some tests and found that in firefox and google-chrome if a group has a greedy quantifier and directly or indirectly contains one or more lazy quantifiers with zero as the minimum number of iterations then for the iterations of the greedy quantifier where the minimum number of iterations has already been satisfied the leftmost lazy quantifier that can match one or more iterations will match one iteration if the group would find a zero-length match if the lazy quantifier were to match zero iterations

20946811

20951038
x86	64bit
the other is that since the buffer copying necessary for avoiding unaligned reads is created using stackalloc and since on x86 including amd64 in 32-bit mode stackalloc ing a 64bit type may sometimes return a pointer that is 4-byte aligned but not 8-byte aligned i can then tell at that point that the alignment workaround isn t needed and never attempt it again

20951057
keydown	keyup
i don t know if this will fit your situation or not but you can try with keyup or keydown event instead

20951057
textchanged	keyup
keyup event raised after textchanged so you ll have the newly typed text ready in textbox

20951057
keydown	keyup
the downside of using keyup keydown is that you won t get notified if user input the text by copy cut-paste using context menu right click paste

20951125
instances	transient
object references an unsaved transient instances - save the transient instances before flushing or set cascade action for the property to something that would make it autosave

so the width and height on all my product thumbnails are set to auto

width	height
my problem now is that when i set both width and height to auto the product thumbnails scales down to a very low image size

20951248
width	height
i want to enlarge scale my product thumbnails without changing the width and height because if i do that the images becomes blurry and pixelated

20951298
nsstring	nsdata
if the key is ever in a foundation object ex nsstring nsdata there is a potential that it will survive after it s use it is best to stay with c char arrays and clear them after use

post	get
ok so i managed to get permission to post part of the html

20951785

the main difference between a jar and a war is that a jar is not really a single purpose format while a war is

20951940
websphere	ibm
for instance oracle at least in 8.1.x actually uses jar files to distribute the oracle software on the install cds and ibm uses them to distribute an installable version of the documentation for websphere

google-chrome	firefox
in firefox it shows up right next to sometext which is the desired outcome in google-chrome however it appears much further right

20952188
google-chrome	firefox
my initial guess was that since the ul is nested in the span the width of the span is calculated differently that firefox ignores the opacity 0 list for calculating the width of the span and google-chrome uses it

20952191
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
best viewed with google-chrome opera on windows 7 or firefox on android

20952914
width	height
derived classes can add actual width and height members or might choose to store say a centre and horizontal vertical extent there-from or a list of polygon points with no width or height members at all.

20952914
width	height
on the other hand if 99 of derived classes do just want int width and height members you could provide a distinct header with a to ease creation of such derived classes without forcing those details into client translation units or having them hanging around in the 1 of classes that don t want them..

20952959
popover	tooltip
this single piece of code works to decorate either a tooltip or a popover

20952959
hide	show	popover	tooltip
with this single piece of code you can set up programmatic hide and show of either a tooltip or popover like so

20952959
popover	tooltip
so we are reusing everything else that comes with the ui-bootstrap tooltip or popover and only implementing the -toggle attribute

20952959
hide	show
the decorative directive watches that attribute and fires custom events to show or hide which are then handled by the ui-bootstrap tooltip provider

20953363
getter	setter
i overrode the doctrine.orm.entity_manager.class parameter with my custom class which simple extended the default class with an additional parameter complete with getter and setter along with overridden create and getrepository functions to return instances of my class instead of the default

case-sensitive	case-insensitive
this works as intended but it has a nasty drawback that all comparison is case-sensitive which means that if i decided to rely on utf8_bin as a solution for the problem i would have a hard time doing case-insensitive queries like like mã ntel which would most definitely omit records like bademã ntel

20953933
superclass	subclassing
the inverse works though - you can use a subclassing where a superclass is expected

20953984
for-loop	arrays
the simplest and easiest way to do this is to throw your arrays into a for-loop

20956058
treemap	treeset
since you can t sort items in a hashmap nor you can sort them by value in a treemap you could use a treeset with a custom class

20956058
equals	compareto
it should work easily with consistente between equals hashcode and compareto but maybe you should tweak something since it s untested code

20956061
history.js	path.js
i know that its possible to use routers like backbone.js history.js path.js etc - this is not what im looking for - id would like to fully understand how to set up the code in my own script

20956236
int	double
in.readline yields a string - not automatically convertible to int or double

20956240
int	double
you re trying to store that string in int and double variables

20956240
int	double
there are methods in the wrapper classes like int and double for converting from a string to a number

20956242
int	double
it allows you to read in inputs as int strings double without having to do any manual conversion

int	double	int	boolean
property values can be boolean byte short int long float double and string

20956315
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i would say that this is more a bug in firefox and google-chrome than in safari

20956315
google-chrome	firefox
if you were to add left top values to .box you ll see the same behavior in firefox and google-chrome

20956346
internationalization	translation
play has no native support for js internationalization anyway you can easily do it yourself using common js files containing objects with labels + small method for finding proper translation

20956370
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i m getting a flicker in the first 3 of 9 main navigation items in my css menus there are no submenus which occurs in ie safari firefox and google-chrome but only on the home page

it could be kornshell ksh using sed or awk

20956415
memcpy	memmove
alternately you could use memmove not memcpy to manipulate your array directly

20956427
folder	directory
you have to however give write permissions to your upload folder directory - the folder where you wish to upload your files

20956435
int	double
it s worth noting that java can overload a method such as abs so that it works with an int or a double

20956435
int	double
in c overloading doesn t exist so you need different functions for int versus double

20956445

20956613
hash	salt
i have been doing a lot of reading on the proper way to hash the password and adding a salt

20956613
hash	salt
it occurred to me that most of the ways that are recommended would rely on some variation of information that is stored in the database with the password hash be it some variation of using all or part of the username as a salt or some other random value

20956613
hash	salt
of course this to would be compromised if an attacker got access to both the stored hash and the source code of the algorithm but any salt would be compromised in such a situation

20956672
for-loop	arrays
i am trying to create a nested for-loop that fills in values in an arrays from 1 to 20

20956705

the integer literal 000101 is interpreted as an octal representation of the decimal 65 because of the leader zero

20956893

i made them hide show panel 2 but the code should work for any panel

20956912
fast-forward	merge
as a sidenote this will only work if the merge wasn t a fast-forward merge

20956912
fast-forward	merge
a fast-forward merge just zips head up to the ref that s being merge so it doesn t create a merge commit

20956914
portrait	landscape
landscape and portrait orientations will have different layouts

20956914
portrait	landscape
they have to â floatâ left in the landscape view and vertically align to the top in portrait view

20956914
width	height
i m guessing i ll need one container that sits at the bottom of the view and changes height depending on the orientation then have rules for the buttons inside depending on the container width

20956923
int	boolean
it typically is composed from a number of boolean floats and int possibly arrays list between 5 and 100 different variables

20957004
width	height
first the code as you have provided it can not possibly compile you haven t declared x y width and height as member variables fields of your rectangle

put	get
when i run it it get no error put when i call swapchain- present 0 0 nothing is displayed althought the rendertargetview should to be yellow

data is in buf.data along with image height width and rowbytes info

work perfectly in google-chrome firefox safari -however the gauge needle does not appear in ie

20957343
mouse	keyboard
the search mode seems to be selected to other but file search depending on the active perpective debug java when i press ctrl + h keyboard shortcut in eclipse sts which forces me to point to file search using my mouse etc instead of letting me paste my search pattern right away from the clipboard

20957345
calloc	malloc
first is legal but do not cast the return value of malloc or calloc in c as their return type is

20957385
hide	show
i have not tried this on another device but am trying to get one activity to listen for when the soft keyboard show or hide

20957414
rhel	suse
for rhel and suse there is a signup link in the premium operating systems documentation

differences may depend on operating system for example most linux systems use different signs for end of the line than windows and some additional features of the specified processors though it is same architecture depending on the model the cpu may have some different operations available

20957468
nodejitsu	heroku
so i looked into heroku and nodejitsu

20957468
nodejitsu	heroku
because i saw that nor heroku nor nodejitsu offer mysql

20957468
nodejitsu	heroku
the real issue here is that i tried searching over the web for information regrading heroku or nodejitsu security

20957515
int	double	int	boolean
int for int double for double boolean for boolean etc

20957535
base-class	derived-class
you need a virtual destructor in the base class when you attempt to delete a derived-class object through a base-class pointer

20957544
width	height
as you ve discovered changing width height with css will stretch shrink the size of your drawings

20957544
width	height
instead change the canvas element s width height not the css width height

20957544
width	height
when you change the canvas element s width height any drawing you have already done will be erased you must redraw those drawings

20957623
inherited	subclassing
but whether this is the right approach or not i have no idea how i should be documenting subclassing with inherited parameters

20957645
width	height
squares are not rectangles because if you change the width of a square its height also changes and this does not happen when you modify a rectangle

20957689
post	get
if the number of s and post is fixed which seems to be the case based on which answer you selected there s a shorter way to get the same output - using limit and offset

20957793
trie	tree
essentially a small prefix tree or trie this data

20957915
profiling	instrumentation
you should also profiling your application with the memory monitor instrumentation to determine how much memory your application is using

20957926
int	chars
it is not necessary to use here since it will verify that every chars in that string is an int between 0 and 9 so there isn t a way for non-digits to get in

20957962
oncreate	setcontentview
chances that by the time that code gets executed the view is not ready yet are extremely high and keeps a null reference make sure to move that code somewhere after setcontentview is executed maybe in the oncreate right after setcontentview or somewhere after view is set.

20957966
inherited	subclassing
i must create a subclassing that inherited and extends those methods

20958028
matlab	simulink
i have a matlab code and wants to convert into appropriate simulink model

20958028
matlab	simulink
however i m new to simulink having only matlab experience

20958028
matlab	simulink
i followed following steps to design model of refer to signal generation model in simulink from matlab

20958100
realloc	malloc
this is not as memory-efficient as you might think since calling realloc repeatedly will stress the memory allocator waste time doing copies and possibly fragment the heap even more than a collection of individual malloc s

20958108
notepad++	gedit
there s tons - gedit notepad++ etc

20958127
portrait	landscape
but in one or two activities i ve to show landscape layout also in such a way that by default the activity opens in portrait mode

20958127
portrait	landscape
default portrait left-right landscape

google-chrome	firefox
after inspection i ve found out that the css style rules associated with the div class element are being stripped of the element when i render it in firefox and google-chrome haven t tried ie

20958129
width	height
after realizing there was a problem i set the height and width attributes of the element .text-over-image in case the div was just being rendered too small to view the image but the background image still didn t display

20958171
post	put
allowing resources to be handled via their parent resource in post put operations is useful in bulk operations

20958176
hide	show
if you comment out the code to hide the overlay then naturally it show up and never goes

20958185
post	get
and pass the index to the list of the ids then get the id and post it to fromhtml

20958262
unsigned	short
however i have noticed that in vs 2013 char16_t and char32_t are just typedefs for unsigned short and unsigned in

20958266
hide	show
the way we are currently doing it is by having every li in every ul and using ng-if to show hide it based on category but that seems like a shotgun approach and something more elegant would be useful

20958279
for-loop	loops
i wonder if this happens because installanywhere is replacing count inside the batch file with 0 in the first loops and then in subsequent loops it re-uses the same batch file with count already substituted in like in a batch for-loop or if statement

20958287
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
in ios 7 the height of a uinavigationbar within a uinavigationcontroller is extended to 64 points such that it can underlap the status bar

20958288
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
uinavigationcontroller will alter the height of its uinavigationbar to either 44 points or 64 points depending on a rather strange and undocumented set of constraints

20958288
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
using auto layout i was able to get a height of 44 points on my uinavigationcontroller s uinavigationbar by initially setting the frame of uinavigationcontroller s view such that it doesn t line up with the window s top

uitableview	nsindexpath
void tableview uitableview tableview didselectrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

20958339
pop-up	dialog
an example of this could be a parent form that has a jquery dialog pop-up with input field ids the same as the parent

20958339
client-side	server-side
my server-side code should just generate client-side code that grabs the values only knowing those inputs are going onto the page and not knowing about any other tags on the page

20958355
folder	directory
in my case we are running in an active directory domain environment and some of our folder that are normally local are redirected to a network share so they are always there no matter what computer we log into

20958374
versioning	upgrade
i have upgrade from versioning 1.4.5 to 1.4.7 and i still have the same problem

i basically want it where if they check a checkbox and then fill out the input on any of them i want to update a span text with text when they hit a save button

hash	md5
verify hash via assuming that your md5 utility is md5sum for example on a mac it is md5

20958550
int	chars
and for completeness - the same code but with int instead of chars performs as expected

20958622
width	height
i m trying to override this in a custom css file for displaying video embedded tags with height width attributes

20958622
width	height
i tried auto for both the height and width but that makes the iframes smaller

20958649
map	quadtree
this is with reference to map tiling using quadtree

20958730
post	put
i would definitely change this from a put to a post though because the same call with the same currentpassword cannot succeed twice put is idempotent

20958734
width	height
the iframe width and height attributes do not override the css ones

20958734
width	height	google-chrome	firefox
if that doesn t work please post the css overrides you tried and check that the 0 height width isn t being loaded after your css try the firefox or google-chrome dev tools

20958813
hash	salt
the salt is often combined with the hash for storing that makes it easy to store it in a single database field

20958815
boost	stl
just sticking to stl not using boost library are there guidelines to saving a ptr to a struct class vs storing the whole object in map

20958863

email	dkim
even test email need to be signed with dkim spf in order to prevent spoofing and i m not sure if there s a way to do that with smtp

20958929
imageview	picasso
to fix this you should either download the photo from the server in your asynctask or store the internet path of your picture and use a library like picasso to download the image at that path to the imageview

20958976
post	get
first understand that get and post can be use together in a single request

20958976
post	get
browsers often help by not caching post requests hence you often get a warning when repeating a post request by refreshing the browser window

20958976
post	get
post requests can send data that is not visible to the end user whereas all data sent via a get request can be seen in the url

20958976
post	get
as a general rule send processing type data via get eg and user-type data by post for example login-data product data

the above error is thrown during cobertura compile in jenkins server log below

20959003
int	chars
description in this code which is suitable for sql server 2012 because of try_cast function the model value tries to be convert into int data type if the value has just one chars so the operation will result null so the result of try_cast model as int is not null would be the values which are all digits

20959036
min	max
the order by select 1 could be changed to any field that s just one way to get an arbitrary result if you don t want a min max

20959091
mouseup	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown
i implemented this easily registering mousedown mousemove and mouseup on the body element

20959091
mouseup	mousedown
the problem as the page moves under the mouse pointer if the user pan the page clicking on an element then the mousedown and the mouseup occurr on that same element and this triggers a click event too on that element after the mouseup

20959114
width	text-align
you need to define a width to both the logo div and h1 tag width 100 and as travis also mentioned center the contents with text-align center

20959191
ubuntu	linux
i have a very strange problem with a sketch which performs differently if compiled and uploaded to arduino from windows xp home sp3 or elementary os luna a distro of ubuntu linux

20959238
versioning	upgrade
since spark 0.8.0+ the packages have been moved into the org.apache.spark namespace so you might need to use earlier versioning of the docs if you don t want to upgrade

20959247
inherited	properties
when an element inherited a properties it always inherited from its parent not from a class and the properties value of the parent

newer filesystems like ntfs have the option of adding extra metadata

20959465
put	get	post	get	post	put
that is where your question comes in since if â rowâ â shelfâ are the integral part of the resourcesâ url then your should not do â so-callâ bulk post put delete operations but that is fine with get as long as the book-name is unique

20959492
google-chrome	firefox

20959543
int	double
your sprite is using double s and your bounding box is using int s see these declarations

20959543
int	double
in the latter the bounding box you are adding an int to a double which causes it to drop it s decimal places as it is being cast to an int

20959543
int	double
hence why they do not follow the sprite exactly as an int can never follow a double

20959543
int	double
to solve this you need xcoo ycoo and corresponding methods to work with double instead of int

20959543
int	double
update so polygon only takes int s appereantly to solve that take a look at the following question polygons with double coordinates

20959548
free	malloc

the problem is that uicollectionview doesn t know about its content size at the moment you are trying to scroll to specified nsindexpath

20961802

as for ios 7 this was somehow changed and now you have to know neither about uicollectionview content size nor about it s frame in order to get attributes for specific nsindexpath

use the stop or stop throwable method to terminate the threads after timeout

20962296
min	max
because then there is no point in really using a binary heap in c++ the map data structure would then support retrieve min and max in both constant time delete and search in o log n and keeps everything sorted

20962296
min	max
i had an argument about this with an interviewer not really an argument but i was trying to explain to him that in c++ returning min and max from map in c++ which is a self-balancing binary search tree occurs in constant time

sse	avx
by default 32-bit programs cannot rely on anything more advanced than x87 instruction set from the cpu no sse sse2 avx etc. unless you specify this on the compiler command line or use the intrinsics inline assembly instructions in your code. on the other hand a 64-bit program is guaranteed to run on a cpu with sse2 support so the compiler will use those instructions by default again unless overridden by the user. while x87 and sse2 float datatypes and operations on them are similar they are - afaik - not identical

20971159

inherited	subclassing
of course the alternative way in this example would be to declare test abstract in the top level class rather than in the subclassing and that s what you d usually do - but there are cases where satisfying the is-a relationship of inherited means that it occasionally makes more sense from a design perspective doing it this way around

20971349

when i called sizetofit the uilabel became the same size as the uibutton s titlelabel and it also cut off the top of my capital letters

20978640
uilabel	uibutton	skview	sknode

if you can t use a for helper to tie it to your model then you will need to put a unique name on the field and then you can get the value on your controller using

20979695
mouseleave	mouseenter
you can use .hover method binds handlers for both mouseenter and mouseleave events

20979695
mouseleave	mouseenter
but here the best practice is bind mouseenter and mouseleave events with event delegation

20979708
post	get
i have this problem where i call api with get and it works fine while it gives empty object in case of post

20979728
getter	setter
the most likely reason that this isn t working as you expected is that you re not using the testobject setter getter methods to set retrieve the field values

20979728
getter	setter
in particular the setter will mark fields as dirty for db.save and the getter will fetch lazy-loaded field data from the db fields will have default values until loaded

20979728
getter	setter
as you noted it s expected that the setter getter follow java naming conventions with respect to the field names

20979728
getter	setter
when i modify your test code to use setter getter methods on testobject i get the same line output twice as expected

ionic	angular
walking through a tutorial app for use with the ionic platform which is built on angular 1.2.4 i ve hit a confusing error in this angular markup

20980841
uicollectionview	uitableview
in addition to animating uiview objects uikit dynamics can be used to animate uicollectionviewlayoutattributes directly which is necessary for a uitableview or uicollectionview style class that has reusable cells that may not all be on screen but which would still be part of the uidynamicanimator s physics

20980841
uicollectionview	uitableview
there being no equivalent layout object for a uitableview and no equivalent uidynamicanimator code to operate on off-screen uitableview cells it s likely to be much easier for you to switch to a uicollectionview if you want this behaviour

unsigned	short
is it because i used a string as the member of the c# class instead of unsigned short

20981326
stdout	stderr
so after the first two dup calls there are two file descriptors pointing to stdout and two pointing to stderr

20981326
stdout	stderr
so after the dup2 calls stdout now points to the f file descriptor and likewise stderr now points to the g file descriptor and because dup2 closes the second file descriptor there is only a single file descriptor for both stdout and stderr because of the copies made by the call to dup

20981326
stdout	stderr
at the end the last two dup2 calls revert the file descriptors using the copied file descriptors so stdout and stderr point to where you d expect which also closes files f and g

20981332
coalesce	nvl

all this code is doing is attempting to determine a new width height based on a restriction while keeping the aspect ratio the same

20982041
width	height
after running the snippet above the width height will be set to 100 x 56 which is an aspect ratio of 1.7857

20982041
width	height
moving the output width height either up or down by a pixel will not ever get you the exact input aspect ratio unless you allow pixel values with fractional components

20982041
width	height
however you re uploading the file and determining the input file s height width shouldn t matter the snippet above is only supposed to get you the resized dimensions as close as possible to the input aspect ratio

20982062
onclick	onfocus	onclick	onkeyup	onkeyup	onfocus
i am able to set the value to the text box programmatically but onkeyup onclick and onfocus events are not getting fired automatically

20982176
prepare	execute
simply use of prepare and execute in pdo

20982188
textview	imageview
the thing is that i m using a customized layout for each row which contains 2 imageview one of them unchanging and the second one with two possible assignations of drawables and two textview so this is the definition

20982229
min	max
i have a dropdown that dynamically generates any number of text inputs all of which have different validation rules min max length pattern etc.

20982229
hide	show
an alternative solution would be to just output all of the possible text elements for each dropdown selection up front and use ng-show based off of the dropdown selection to show hide each set

20982241
hash	md5
the easiest way to do this could be to check the last modified date time and compare it with previous stored variable and if the file is modified reload the file some other way md5 hash compare also described in this question

20982243
post	get
looking a bit in other post i get that i have in some way to include header files in foo and use attribute in bar but i seem to miss some points

20982264
opera	safari
this is still completely valid css but it does cause ie8 and lower to render different styles and also opera 9.5 and safari 3.2

20982268
sudo	passwd
this with the use of crontab and people trying to guess my sudo passwd just people at my place so not such a big deal

20982278
post	get
in the get action i need to feed the front-end with the post url of which the form values would be consumed

20982282
for-loop	arrays
to achieve this the string has been split into an arrays and iterated through with a for-loop

20982286
codeigniter	kohana	laravel	kohana	laravel	codeigniter
another possibility is to not hand coding things and do your project in a php framework like kohana codeigniter or laravel where all of those functions and features have already been developed for you

20982292
unsigned	short	integer	unsigned
according the books the variations of type integer occupy more or less bytes of memory depending on the architecture however the type unsigned short values â â can get up to 65 535 since the type unsigned long 4 294 967 295

20982292
unsigned	short
this way we can know how many bytes will be reserved for this types because we have we are aware that we are using explicitly the data types however for unsigned short and unsigned long types just there a single format placeholder u

20982292
unsigned	short
for me this means that i have no control about the number that will be set in this variable i want mean i must declare the variable like unsigned and the compiler will interpret if he number belongs to range of unsigned short or unsigned long

20982292
unsigned	short
and if the number belongs to range of the unsigned short type will reserve 2 bytes for this variable otherwise if the number assigned belong to unsigned long type all will work normally and the number of bytes reseved for this variable will be 4 bytes

20982303
innodb	myisam
note that mysql table should use transaction-safe storage engine like innodb as far as i know myisam engine does not support transactions

20982306
min	max
a few others are max min and sum

20982350
unsigned	short
you can combine that with length sub-specifier so you can have hu for unsigned short lu for unsigned long etc

20982362
unsigned	short
for unsigned short and unsigned long types just there a single format placeholder u

20982362
unsigned	short	integer	unsigned
short int or unsigned short int argument the argument will have been promoted according to the integer promotions but its value shall be converted to short int or unsigned short int before printing

20982365
unsigned	short
this way we can know how many bytes will be reserved for this types because we have we are aware that we are using explicitly the data types however for unsigned short and unsigned long types just there a single format placeholder u

20982365
unsigned	short
correction unsigned short and unsigned long have hu and lu

20982365
unsigned	short
the last one unsigned means unsigned int rather than unsigned short

20982374
min	max
or the lowest id when you specify min id instead of max id

20982377
union	distinct
i used union distinct according to shiva s answer but just slightly modified it to be less hard-coded

20982394
implements	extends
i was reading some articles on topic implements runnable vs extends thread and i do understand that implements runnable is prefered because in java you can t have multiple inheritance

20982394
implements	extends
sample code of anonymous thread without implements or extends

20982398
put	get
then when the selected index changes by clicking this gets fired which i can put a breakpoint on the first line and i see the index of what i clicked on get stored in a

20982401
width	height
you need to set the initial height and width so you can go back to that size after the mouse leaves the picture box

20982403
prepare	execute
i am trying to learn how to use the prepare bind-param and execute statement

20982411
implements	extends
if you want something happen on separate thread you either need to extends thread or implements runnable and call start on thread object

20982419
stdout	stderr
if you are in control of what s in 1.py you could have your own instances of stdout and stderr

20982452
vbscript	vba
another approach could be to use the sdk though as you re trying to manipulate web intelligence your only language options are .net or java as the rebean sdk used to talk to webi is not available for com vba vbscript â

20982476
post	get
to get all months in which you have your post you can run this simple query

20982476

and when user lands on this link fetch get parameter and select all post for this month

20982490
unsigned	short
applies to a short int or unsigned short int argument the argument

20982490
unsigned	short
value shall be converted to short int or unsigned short int before

20982490
unsigned	short
if you want to declare an object of type unsigned short you have to specify the both simple specifiers

20982494
implements	extends
in cases for instance that multiple instantiations of a thread object are needed and that thread object also has state some calculation results or communicates with other objects via a queue one has to extends the thread class or implements the runnable interface and then using a thread constructor to actually start the thread

20982504
width	height
this is ideal if your input fields have consistent width and height

20982518
put	get
i see them as simple data transition from the db to a domain object get the field from result set and put it in the object without any validation or other logic

20982574
implements	extends
it looks like flexibility is the main motivator to go for implements runnable approach over extends thread

20982632
textview	imageview
the relativelayout has a few textview and a 9 patch imageview that is meant to scale with the dynamically added custom views

20982723
opera	safari
localstorage websql no more maintained indexeddb not widely supported by opera and safari

20982731
implements	extends
but whether or not your use an anonymous class is orthogonal to the question of whether implements runnable or extends thread is the better mechanism to define your thread task

20982751

stdout	stderr
best practice for node is to write to stdout or stderr

20982836
stdout	stderr
the expectation is that the os will handle the file management throughput that you want or else you can have a custom-written log collector that can do it the way you want and redirect stdout or stderr to it

20982903
loops	if-statement
i have a program that pretty much consists of a simple loops that goes through a bunch of numbers that are arranged in a column among many other columns in the spreadsheet and it consists of a bunch of if-statement that check if each number is within a particular range and based on which range it falls into it will perform a specific task

obviously the google-chrome safari behavior is desired

20985478
hide	show
i originally had it working by styling the elements directly with nth-of-type 2n but users can dynamically hide show elements which breaks that implementation

20985512
fish	bash
i don t have fish set up as the default shell and bundler is working fine in bash

20985541
int	double
there are two types of time 4-byte signed int time32 and 8-byte double precision floating point time64

20985588
sequence	permutation
a permutation is a sequence containing each element from 1 to n once and only once

20985625
slideup	slidedown
if the call to slidedown is made before slideup finishes the call to clearqueue removes slidedown from the queue so the element remains visible

20985637
hash	salt
i personally solved this problem by generating id in the method as a hash of the document being inserted plus a bit of random salt passed as parameter to calm down paranoia and perform inserts with the same id on client and server

20985650
children	parent
this will make it so that when you delete the parent the children won t be deleted as well

20985742
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
if you are sure you want to have only one for-loop instead of two typical for 2-dimensional arrays ensure your loops will go through the number of examples equal to the number of fields in your arrays

20985754
width	margin
then ensure the container has the same width as the largest contained image and apply margin 0 auto

20985784
filtering	grouping
using categories is much better than having to come up with manually filtering tests based on ad-hoc naming conventions because it that is hard to remember to do and to make sure everyone in your grouping adheres to the naming conventions and since the categories are classes you can use your ide to search refactor compile time check your category names

20985808
google-chrome	firefox
i also want to run same scripts on some typical browsers without coding for each kind of browser google-chrome firefox and ie6 because sometimes there would be functional problems due to different features of browsers instead of running tests on every kind of browser as a compatibility testing which would cost too much to maintain the test environments and scripts

20985808
google-chrome	firefox
now i can run same regression tests on three typical browsers google-chrome firefox and ie6 with one selenium server instance all in one machine

20985808
google-chrome	firefox
when i ran this script phpunit sent test requests to selenium servers both on local and remote machines and the test function was executed on firefox local google-chrome remote and ie8 remote

20985812
istream	getline
std istream getline does set std ios_base failbit when the line is too long to fit into the buffer there are more than max_line - 1 characters

20985819
google-chrome	firefox
for some reason my nav collapse function isn t working in firefox ie but works in google-chrome

20985827
pull	push
q2 any changes i commit and push to my repository the other user yyyyy must be notified for a pull request

20985855
multiplying	add
to do this i would multiplying by 9 then divide by 5 then add 32

20985859
int	chars
eof is not a chars it is an int

20985876
hide	show
i assume because it show and hide too quick to show up

20985908
google-chrome	firefox
however i have a problem in that google-chrome and firefox don t allow javascript to parse the cssrules of cross domain stylesheets

20985909
vlan	packets
if you have cisco router users are connected on cisco switch you can use ip helper address command on switch on vlan .you can allow udp packets on router acl

20985930
google-chrome	firefox
this should work on both google-chrome and firefox ie

20985934
width	margin
the only table settings that seem to work are width 80 style margin 0 auto

20985935
requiredfieldvalidator	onclientclick
you might look at ditching the requiredfieldvalidator altogether and handling both validation and your confirm dialog in onclientclick calling a javascript function in onclientclick instead of handling it inline

20985959
hide	show
and here is the hide and show code

20985991
udp	tcp
you may need to deconstruct the udp tcp packets themselves

20986075
hash	salt
so basically what you need to do is retrieve the hash password from the database and the password salt

20986075
hash	salt
then hash the password provided by your wpf app user which is currently in plain text using the password salt you just retrieved from the database

20986075
hash	salt
from the screenshot you provided i can see that all users password salt are empty which might be the main source of all your problems because the passwords are hash

20986139
integer	radix
you could try parsing the integer and float parts separately with parseint as parsefloat does not support a radix

20986155
superclass	subclassing
either declare them as protected or create a constructor in the superclass that assigns them and call that constructor from the subclassing constructor using super

20986157
draggable	droppable
so i studied sortable with the connectwith attribute a bit more and found the solution was simpler than i expected but i was thinking about it sort of backwards because of draggable and droppable

20986158
throttling	throttle
i know i can throttle the operation but even after throttling the problem still exists if _drawplot runs for a long time

20986165
post	put
if you have succeeded in testing post put and delete http methods of a rails api protected with the doorkeeper oauth2 provider gem please share and i ll give you the love

20986198
google-chrome	firefox
the really weird part is i discovered that they show up in google-chrome but not firefox

20986205
hide	show
basically it works fine when you click the blog button it display the blogs div when you click the portfolio button it displays the portfolio div however problem begins when i click blog and then click blog again same with the other my logic hide the divs and show it again i just want to find a logic that allows me to do nothing if i click the same anchor tag several times and only change if i click other

20986250
switching	screens
the colour switching works fine if i click the buttons on screens but they are not changing when i try to play through my midi keyboard

20986284
post	get
get access to the post request body

20986284
post	get
parse the post request body s form data to get the real binary file data

20986284
post	get
there are simple examples 1 2 for intercepting get requests in the documentation for http-on-modify-request however intercepting post requests is more complicated

20986284
post	get
s 2nd post in that thread details how to 1 get at the post body

20986284
post	get
in the post headers you ll get something like

20986310
ostringstream	std
if you want the result in a string use std ostringstream for the output iterator

20986326
super	extends
when extends a class the first thing you have to do is call the super class to grab all of the parent s variables

20986326
getter	setter
the second is to create getter and setter methods inside the vehicle class that allow you to change id from other classes when using the setter

20986347
hide	show
currently hidden if it s not hidden then it will hide it and show it

20986363
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
not only does it implement inotifypropertychanged but it also implements inotifycollectionchanged both of these interfaces ensure that if the collection changes the xaml engine knows about it and displays the changes

20986375
google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari
ime-mode is not supported in google-chrome safari or opera

20986385
super	extends
you could store a reader as a field in your buffin class or you might extends a super class that accepts one in the constructor

20986390
uitableview	uisearchbar
i have implemented a uisearchbar with a uitableview in one view controller

20986418
mouseleave	mouseenter	hide	show
basically bind both the link and the tooltip elements to the hover method which hide show the tooltip element on mouseenter mouseleave

20986455
margin	height
or you could set the line height on both and add margin to the top of the smaller one so the sum of the line-height and top margin are the same on both text

20986461
width	height
i want to get width and height of imageview

20986471
ubuntu	debian
i have tried on multiple debian based operating systems ubuntu 12.04 and kali with the same results

20986493
width	height
this is simple way to get width and height from imageview

20986505
min	max
min max number of connections

20986513
post	get
that will fetch you a list of post loop through them to get their details

20986513
post	get
then in edit-post.php you can get the post_id by doing and then use it in the query to fetch all the information about that one particular post

20986584
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
if python outputs any line containing pass the i makes it case-insensitive - find pass would be case-sensitive then errorlevel is set to 0 otherwise errorlevel is set

20986597
google-chrome	firefox
i have a javascript function that works for google-chrome firefox and ie 11 but not for ie 8 which is what my client uses

20986598
udp	tcp
any kind of proxy whether it is for tcp or udp needs to be told where to forward outgoing packets to

20986598
udp	tcp
however it requires the requesting app to establish a tcp connection to the socks proxy and ask it to forward udp packets on the app s behalf until that tcp connection is closed

20986598
udp	tcp
every outbound udp packet would have to be intercepted then the proxifier would have to check if it already has its own socks v5 tcp connection associated with the packet s local remote tuple and if not then create a new one and send the necessary udp forwarding handshake then encapsulate every outbound udp packet for that tuple and send it to the proxy s outbound ip port and receive every matching inbound udp packet for that tuple from the proxy so it can be de-encapsulated and forwarded to the app s local ip port that sent out the original outbound udp packet

20986598
udp	tcp
and because udp is connection-less the proxifier would have to also implement a timeout mechanism on its socks v5 tcp connection to the proxy so it can eventually be closed after a period of udp traffic being idle

20986598
udp	tcp
that is a lot more work for a udp proxifier to do compared to tcp

20986676
width	height
if the player has left those bounds set the player s position to the opposite bounds possibly adding width height

20986693
folder	directory
download the binaries of apc according to your php version there will be two directory ts and nts copy the php_apc.dll from the appropriate folder and place it in the php ext folder

20986736
width	height
note slide will generally be for the complete width height of the element

20986738
google-chrome	firefox
this work pretty well on firefox but on google-chrome divheader shaking sometimes when scrolling fast

20986747
hide	show
then use javascript to capture the hover event for each main menu item and hide show the submenu as necessary

20986772
google-chrome	firefox
i know you are using google-chrome but in firefox this is trivial by overriding the neterror.xhtml page to do a settimeout location.reload 10000

20986851
post	put
also the post type has tags associated with named in functions.php as locations and i can put city name as tags and browse listing as

20986883
floating-point	fractions
the value 0.1 cannot be represented in floating-point at any precision it degenerates into a repeating fractions in base-2 much like everyone is familiar with 1 3 doing in base-10

20986893
getter	setter
it is a common convention in java programming that you name your getter as ie getstreet and your setter like ie setstreet

20986934
hide	show
i m trying to detect whether the panel is out if so hide the footer and if the panel is in to show the footer

20986939

your responder will receive either touchesended withevent or touchescancelled withevent for each touch it is handling those touches it received in touchesbegan withevent

20987120
put	get
what i get when i run the app is in the listview it just prints the uri that i put in the bitmapimage object and i don t get a picture

20987172
alarmmanager	countdowntimer
i think instead of using alarmmanager you can use a countdowntimer as follows

20987222
ssl	https
but when use ssl so not change https image path in supersized slideshow

20987245
min	max
as long as the string can take the length of the min max value of a signed int i don t see how this is bad or unsafe

20987249
portrait	landscape
i am working on an ipad app using autolayout where if the user enables a certain mode heads-up mode i want to support only portrait or portrait upside down orientation and furthermore if the device is in landscape i d like to automatically switch to portrait mode

20987320
portrait	landscape
once user select any option then call this method because user can be in landscape mode and then he can set only portrait mode in same view controller so automatically view should be moved to portrait mode so in that button acton call this

20987329
hide	show
what i want is to show the season that is selected in the select control and hide all others

20987383
tpagecontrol	ttabsheet
use tpagecontrol and ttabsheet

20987412

all of the business of determining what cells to show and what cells to hide is done in - originaltable prepareupdates which iterates through the sections and each row within to determine what to show and what to hide

20987448
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
this is working fine on desktop have checked in the major browsers - google-chrome firefox ie9 safari opera

it s almost as though it is setting the height to the screen width the shorter edge of the device

20987470
i2c	spi
a company is free to program into it whatever interface best suits their needs whether that be a complex bus like pci or a simple interface like spi or i2c

20987470
rtl	vhdl	rtl	verilog	verilog	vhdl
but ultimately systems with fpgas will tend to use a combination of high-level languages c c++ and rtl verilog vhdl

20987476
put	get
i thought rather than re engineer the system i would just put in a meta tag that would get ie to use an ie8 compatibility mode

20987504
viewmodel	caliburn
if you want something in the viewmodel to trigger the window to open you can always use events or a 3rd party library like caliburn to easily implement this without worrying about coupling

20987506
boost	stl
this problem has largely gone away thankfully and libraries such as boost have stepped in to provide include only versions of the stl containers

20987524
maven	pom.xml
in the maven project put the following dependency in pom.xml

20987581
pop-up	dialog
this is what i suggest to do that.because of there are no dependancy with view in another view model .simply you can write a dialog services to open any of view as pop-up window

20987583
eclipse-kepler	eclipse-juno
i have used net beans 7.4 eclipse-juno eclipse-kepler eclipse-pulsar

20987607
portrait	landscape
i am trying to create a basic application that just counts how many times the user changes the orientation to landscape from portrait and displays the count on screen

20987711
hash	md5
its better to use sha or md5 value instead checking with the hash value directly

20987750
put	get
but i dont want this i want a window which will accept number and that item should get ticked and show the number we put there

20987772
nswindow	appkit
appkit on os x provides this through nswindow

20987819
int	double
you would immediately know that the first parameter was a double and the second parameter was an int

20987861
int	chars
you just used an int by accident instead of chars c

20987869
subtract	add	min	max
finally you need to loop through the contours and find y_min and y_max for each of them since i think the contours are external to the actual patches i think you ll need to subtract one from max and add one to min but i am not sure about that

20987876
put	get
this was my first crack at making a put request after making a successful get i was excited then following a tutorial i get an error that i don t quite understand

20987876
put	get
i feel it could be because of mod_rewrite i had an issue with that and had to set some things in the apache config file just to make the get request so possibly i need to change some things to make the put

20987895
hide	show
edit i think i have the answer as mehow said based on the link i have posted i can first run the part of the macro that finds the file name then lock the workbook all except the start page then save the workbook as the new name then hide the start page and show everything else

20987950

i have custom artisan commands that run locally as well as on my production server when i am ssh d in but are unavailable to any cron jobs

20988330
width	height
where width is the width of each frame height is the height of the image and frame is the current position of the animation

20988330
width	height
the width and height should map the clipping in the xaml

20988382
for-loop	arrays
this iterates through the arrays once and whenever it finds a zero the inner for-loop essentially shifts everything before the zero we found over to the right to make room for the zero at the beginning of the list

20988414
google-chrome	firefox
i am finding an inconsistency with the pixels that are being reported in the box model in firefox 26 compared to what is being reported in google-chrome v32 and ie 11

20988436
hide	show
it seems that you would simply like to show and hide the stackwidget based on the press of those two buttons

20988436
qstackedwidget	qwidget
this is a simple qwidget operation and the problem is not much related to qstackedwidget

20988478

20988684
g++	gcc
i have the same issue compiling the example with gcc g++ and i also have the same issue when compiling ffmpeg with either clang or gcc which leads me to think that there is just something i don t know about linking that should be obvious but i haven t found any references suggesting that it should be different linking a library in c++ vs

20988684
libstdc++	libc++
i have seen posts related to linking issues in mac os x 10.9 because of the change from libstdc++ to libc++ but adding or seems to make no difference

the problem is that it works fine in google-chrome opera firefox but when browsed in the safari browser on desktop there is some delay in playback

20988939
post	get
it also calls the get or post or whatever http method

20989019
folder	directory
the conditions first check that the request isn t already for an existing file or directory then that the hostname doesn t start with a www then it creates a grouping for the subdomain folder then in the first rule it checks that the request inside the folder is a directory and the request doesn t end with a trailing slash

20989019
folder	directory
this is because mod_dir and the directoryslash option will redirect requests for directory without a trailing slash and this will expose your folder

20989023
fast-forward	merge
then the merge back to master is a trivial fast-forward one

20989023
fast-forward	merge
finally you can push master the upstream repo will accept those changes again as a fast-forward merge you are only adding new commits on top of origin master

post are usually done by or get is possible too

20989172
getter	setter
and here is the activites class with getter setter

20989184
children	parent
the mapping as it is does not allow for a simple deletion of parent with their children

20989184
children	parent
you can do it by a bulk update or by fetching the parent that are about to be deleted iterate over the children and reset the parent references

20989184
children	parent
if you remove the parent with a bulk query use a bulk query for the children as well

20989197
g++	gcc
or is there actually such a flag in clang just as in gcc g++

20989216
public	protected
the downside is that the protected can be expanded to public in the subclass so you can t explicitly enforce it

20989237
xmlhttprequest	xdomainrequest

you can also chose to hide the link and show it when it s initialized

20989339
width	height
in core animation programming guide of mac developer library it suggests that always use integral numbers for the width and height of your layer

20989372
children	parent
since the results are used together with an entity framework which only contain an id field for nullable child objects i should be able to get a result of parent with nullable children also populated

20989405
getter	setter
the entity also impliment the basic methods getter and setter

20989441
kohana	yii
i m new to yii and used to kohana

20989563
int	boolean
where true boolean value is implicitly converted to 1 as explaneid here with references to standards too and this explain why true has to be less than 5 though in c might not be totally correct to speak about implicit conversion from bool to int

when dealing with a uitableview there s finally no advisable way to access or interact with cells without using nsindexpath

20989986
int	chars
this way you first convert factors to an int value and then reduce it to the actual chars value

20990026

20997478
getter	setter
if you look at languages like c# or groovy they ve made the ideas of getter and setter somewhat obsolete relying on various mechanics to simply deal in directly assignable readable properties and allowing for some method of under-the-hood addition of get set logic

prepare	execute
accordingly a new instance of the action class will be created which causes the load method to be execute which in turn causes the prepare method to be execute once again

20999003
prepare	execute
the prepare method is first execute as soon as an action associated with or is triggered and then again when the request is redirected this can be understood because redirection of a request results in creating a new instance of the action class which causes the action associated with the load method to be execute and prepare is execute once on every action

how you go about that though completely depends on the relationship one-to-one one-to-many or many-to-many

21000001
post	get
you are reacting to post - the browser will make a get when you just type in the url

21000025
int	chars
from what i understand you want to retrieve the first 2 chars as a string convert it to int and insert to the vector

21000037
junit	mockito
i had a similar case to the one josdem had same error also while running junit with mockito but without jersey

21000046
int	chars
as i have correctly understood you you want to form an int number from the first two chars of the string

21000078
put	get
if you put your code in the cpp you will need a far more aggresive optimization to get this

21000082
margin	height
during the animation when you add the height also add a corresponding amount of negative top margin as well

21000094
nsfilewrapper	nsdocument
based on the apple docs the recommended practice for using file packages with nsdocument seems to be to keep a reference to the root nsfilewrapper in the custom nsdocument implementation

21000094
nsstring	nsdata
however since the file wrapper is an instance variable it s raw nsdata is still around although all i need is the nsstring version

21000140
scipy	scikit-learn
the article gives a recipe for setting the correct bw in scipy so it will be equivalent to the one used in scikit-learn

21000140
scipy	scikit-learn
i was advised over at scikit-learn chat by ep that i should scale the values in x y before calculating the kernel with scipy in order to obtain comparable results with scikit-learn

21000140
scipy	scikit-learn
ie i scaled both dimensions before getting the kernel with scipy while leaving the line that obtains the kernel in scikit-learn untouched

21000165
ssl	https
i understand that i can purchase an ssl certificate to make my site work for https so that it is more secure and all that jazz

21000194
google-chrome	firefox
the code is working fine in latest version of the firefox but not in google-chrome v31

21000203
hide	show
first the handlers to show and hide the submenu

int	chars
the enumerated type itself error_t in my example can however be of any type compatible with chars or int signed or unsigned

21000218
free	strdup
strdup has always free d just fine before.

21000237
children	parent
a parent can have several children each with a different timestamp

21000250
ant	maven
you didn t mention which ide you re using but from my own experience writing an ide plugin has a steeper learning curve than adding a custom step to a build tool like ant maven gradle

21000250
ant	maven
it s not impossible to invoke a headless eclipse netbeans build that uses custom plugins on a build server but it s not nearly as straightforward as running a build that uses standard tools like ant maven gradle

21000250
ant	maven
it can of course be run using ant but both maven and gradle can invoke ant tasks as well

21000308
stdout	stderr
it captures the exit code the stdout and the stderr too of the executed external command

21000362
free	malloc
because strsep modifies the message_copy argument you were trying to free a pointer that was not returned by malloc et al

21000362
free	strdup
it did not free the pointer allocated via strdup

21000393
yacc	bison
but i would prefer a simpler way as possible with perl recdescent or yacc bison

21000457
ienumerable	ilist
because bindinglist accepts an ilist as the starting values and not just an ienumerable source all of the properties of the ilist are also cloned into the bindinglist not just the values themselves

21000474
folder	directory
i ve allready found a solution i had to change the home directory setting it as a shared folder over a network so my keys will save to that address

21000487
free	strdup
your second version doesn t leak as you created a temporary pointer to point to the start of the original char pointer returned from strdup so the memory was free correctly as you called free with the original char pointer instead of the updated one that strsep had modified

21000499
width	height
when i recreated the layout i used the graphical interface to add the properties of the textview object just the id +id text1 width and height

21000587
strcpy	strcmp
the warnings that i get are when i use strcmp to compare and when i use strcpy to switch and values

i am using jcarousel to display more slider at once as it can be seen in the skeleton example

21000590
debian	centos
i m used to debian but this time i m about to install php-fpm on centos

21000607
folder	directory
the solution is to check the permissions of every component of the synced folder so verify your user has read permissions on the directory

21000618
int	chars
i want to copy the value of an unsigned int 32 bit to an array of unsigned chars

21000621
google-chrome	firefox
it also works in google-chrome and firefox

21000626
for-loop	loops
i have a for-loop that loops over the elements of searchcats and i am performing multiple api queries each returning a relatively small number of results about 100

21000627
versioning	upgrade
must upgrade to the google play versioning of the mobile ads sdk by then

21000640
free	strdup
but keep around the original strdup result and this free works

21000649
strcpy	strcmp
the warnings that i get are when i use strcmp to compare and when i use strcpy to switch and values

21000649
strcpy	strcmp
you are wrong argument to strcmp and strcpy

21000649
strcpy	strcmp
signature of strcmp and strcpy are

21000654
gridview	onclientclick
i ve built a gridview with an onclientclick listener for each item in the gridview

21000660

without use each method instead use prop in jquery collection of object

21000739
getter	setter
i added a getter and setter for the variable using the example specified here developer.apple.com library mac documentation cocoa conceptual â â

21000791
hotmail	outlook.com
well outlook.com ex hotmail has an api or live connect api that allows you to access the calendar events too

21000900
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome hide the script tags

21000901
width	margin
if you want to center it first give it a width and then margin 0 auto

21000903
google-chrome	firefox
this works well on google-chrome and firefox but fails on ie

21000948
mouseleave	mouseenter
don t use the mouseleave handler in that case on mouseenter remove the hovered class from other elements

21000959
width	height
i pretty much just want the center div to resize on initial load based on the level of zoom the browser is currently at and fit the edges of the div to that zoom while keeping the div s width and height proportions of 16 9

21000979
folder	directory
i actually got it to work by changing the url so instead of it accessing the files in the src folder it accesses them from the web bundle ... css directory instead

21001008
wordpress	phpbb
i am using wordpress and phpbb with a plugin called wp-united

21001015
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i am trying to pick colours for my web app but realizing a huge difference in the way safari renders the stylesheet when compared with firefox or google-chrome

21001021
google-chrome	firefox
however the max-height calc 100 - 145px along with necessary vendor prefixes doesn t seem to be working for me on firefox or ie worked perfectly in google-chrome though

21001026
post	get
i want to have a get route that will query an api to collect data and then redirect to a post with that data to save to the db

21001075
post	get
just send a post request with pre-defined correct login and password and get the data on the next page

21001080
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade my python and pyparsing versioning and it still did not work correctly

21001124
width	height
maps the point x y or rect x y width height which is in this item s coordinate system to item s coordinate system and returns an object with x and y and optionally width and height properties matching the mapped coordinate

21001153
put	get
if i put 0 i get the points min

21001165
width	height
in eclipse as you re using the designer you can set the width and height of a view within the layout parameters section of the properties pane

21001191
google-chrome	firefox
this seems to be running fine in firefox and google-chrome but not google-chrome is extremely slow

21001215
strcpy	strcmp
do the same s+ i 40 for the sorting algorithm compare to 0 not 1 and strcmp strcpy expect pointers

21001230
osx	yosemite
for osx mavericks yosemite and possibly later earlier versions

21001274
implements	extends
right now i select the classes one by one from type hierarchy that implements interface or extends a class and copy them to text file but i would guess there is a keyboard shortcut or feature to copy the entire hierarchy or even export it in some format

21001299
onkeydown	onfocus
put your regexes into the element as custom attributes data-regex1 data-regex2 then check the data as it changes not sure how many events you want to check but you probably have to check with onkeydown ignoring enter and tab or you could create a timer onfocus and just check every half second or so

21001302
width	height
and passing the appropriate pixel amount to top left width and height styles

21001302
width	height
the css just sets the background-image and position to relative and for each breakpoint it sets the top left height width of the image i do not currently use .make-sm-column or offset for the overlay

21001304
width	height
keep in mind search engines don t like it if width and height attribute does not fit the image but they don t know js

21001388
sse	avx
ffast-math should allow a relaxed floating point model how to use fused multiply-add fma instructions with sse avx

21001388
addition	multiplication
i get 2 for ilp because ivy bridge can do one avx multiplication and one avx addition at the same time and i have unrolled the loop several times to ensure this

21001402
inherited	properties
i think your best bet is to make your own class that inherited from controllablestoryboardaction like the removestoryboard action does and add a delay properties to that

21001405
children	parent
a when the checkbox in parent row is checked or unchecked check uncheck all children row s checkboxes toggle behavior

21001424
width	height
how to present width and height of my shapes in percentages

21001474
inherited	properties
if the grid that you inherited declared their dependencyproperties like this then you should be able to use the clr wrapped properties directly like this

21001501
tabcontrol	tabitem
as zarat mentioned the default style for tabitem in windows 8 has triggers that fire after the remove and then look for the now missing tabcontrol

21001550
prepare	execute
because this is not a prepare statement try avoiding execute so information about the last error is available

21001584
post	get
normally you need to use a specific http get post variable to start remote debugging see remote debugging

21001584
post	get
when this setting is set to 1 xdebug will always attempt to start a remote debugging session and try to connect to a client even if the get post cookie variable was not present

21001589
sorting	grouping
i presume i d start by doing a grouping by fk and then sorting but i m a bit lost as to where to go from there

21001590

21001644
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
http urls are case-insensitive for the scheme and host portion and case-sensitive for the path query and fragment

21001677
post	get
a redirect is not possible from get to post because browsers will keep the request method the same after a redirect

21001688
folder	directory
set a build directory somewhere close to the cmakelists.txt or in its parent folder then click on next

21001698
express	node.js
i am wondering if it is possible to use node.js modules socket.io and express without having to install or run npm

21001698
express	node.js
the goal is to be able to have buildroot configured to create a busybox image that simply includes node.js and then place all my javascript files in the proper directory and execute node app.js from the command line to run the node application which will use socket.io and express

21001702
free	malloc
applications written in c or c++ that use the standard library allocation routines malloc free or new delete respectively including the python compiler interpreter will tend to exhibit the above behavior

21001713
daemons	systemd
an strace of the daemons shows that basically the following systemd calls are involved

21001713
igmp	ospf
wireshark sees igmp and ospf messages with source 10.0.0.1 tap1

21001713
igmp	ospf
wireshark still sees only igmp and ospf messages with source 10.0.0.1 tap1 since mediator not running yet

21001713
igmp	ospf
wireshark now sees igmp and ospf messages with sources of both tap1 and tap2

21001737
ssl	https
but maybe you need to make adjustments to your html etc too so that all resources images script css.. will be loaded by ssl too all these includes should be either be done with site-relative links or with explicite https links

21001783
ubuntu	linux
until we tested it on mac using linux ubuntu normally and figured out that the colors were different

21001783
ubuntu	linux

hide	show
this feature hide the list elements and show those matching the entered characters as you type

21001885
hide	show
what i would like to do is to show all items without the need to enter any characters but when the list itself gets the focus and hide them when it s lost

21001916
httprequest	httpresponse
middlewares allow you to modify process django s httprequest object that is supplied to a view and httpresponse object that is returned by a view as well as take action when a view raises an exception

21001919
for-loop	loops
in the main for-loop i loops over all the lines in the input file

21001925
submit	submission
my guess is that your app identifier in your info.plist file is not readable somehow unable to process application info.plist validation and then it fails to submit because your distribution profile does not match with that app identifier the bundle at path is not signed using an apple submission certificate.

21001974
width	height
pass in the string you want to draw the font used for drawing the string and the width where the text will wrap and the method will return the height of the wrapped

i have some content that gets centered on the screen pending how large the browser is and then for pages that are too large the maincontent should sit fflush top with the header

21002125

i assume that you don t want to subtract 0.5 from anything but actually multiplying the distance by 0.5 getting halfways from a to b

21002135
scatter	graphing
i am attempting to use the layout function in r but am struggling to get the correct structure as i need a small plot graphing along with a large 3d scatter plot in the same page

google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari
update the above seems to work only in webkit browsers google-chrome opera safari

21002180
width	height
uniformgrid ensures that all items have the same size both width and height

21002180
width	height
in your case you only want to constrain height but since there is only one column all items must have the same width anyway so this is okay

21002203
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i have a form that submits great in google-chrome firefox safari and ie 9 8

21002267
google-chrome	firefox

for our instance - an intranet site pulling an rss feed from another internal page which in-turn resolves to an rfc1918 private address the feed was being blocked by wordpress s url checker for security reasons

21002394
inherited	properties
may i just add as this is a project we re working on together that the aim here is to create many different data builders one per object and each object when defined inherited from a base class as most of the objects have the same properties of createdid createdon modifiedid modifiedon for example

21002419
folder	directory
package1 generates 10 files in each folder in source directory

21002419
folder	directory
package2 generates 1 file in each folder in source directory

21002419
folder	directory
the file system task copy directory copy all the files from source directory folder to destination directory folder

21002430
hash	salt
use ssl and hash them clientside not said you do not hash them again and salt serverside so that the method can be as secret as possible

21002453
hash	md5
i need to hash a string preferably as sha512 although it could be sha256 sha1 md5 or crc32

21002453
hash	md5
to best illustrate the problem i have gone on to an online hash calculator and the md5 hash of myhashtest is ff91e22313f0a41b46719e7ee6f99451 but setting the hash property in my test program to md5 results in ã â ã #ã â fqå¾ ã ã¹â q which is clearly wrong

21002465

21002617
width	height
blockquote the width of each column or height of each row depends on the width or height of the widgets contained within the column or row

21002617
width	height
this means when sketching out your user interface and dividing it into rows and columns you don t need to worry about each column or row being equal width or height presumably . blockquote

21002668
salt	md5
hashing it with sha512 md5 md5 adding a different salt two more sha512 another md5 and another different salt

21002685

this happens with several different short videos and across all browser os combinations i ve tested google-chrome safari firefox ie on windows mac

21002774

21002788
rss	feed
it is getting its rss feed from a wordpress blog

21002788
rss	feed
when a new blog post is made the rss feed changes immediately but it takes a long time before the feedek parser shows the change

21002837
onresume	onpause
scanning drains battery so depending on what you re trying to accomplish best practice would be to stop the scan in your onpause mbluetoothadapter.stoplescan mdevicefoundcallback and if need be restart the scan in your onresume mbluetoothadapter.startlescan mdevicefoundcallback

21002839
children	parent
but it seems so unorganized and i don t know how to take care of the children outside the list problem and when a person has two parent in the list i should add them to the list instead of resetting pvalue parent

21002845
jobs	cron
the important thing to make sure first is that your hosting provider allows you to schedule cron jobs in some way

21002857
post	get
sending a post request is not much different than sending a get

21002857
post	get
we use post instead of get in the xmlhttp.open method

21002873
debian	centos
lua5.1 and lua5.2 from debian lua 5.1 self-compiled on centos 5 and luajit from git master self-compiled on debian all give the proper behaviour and return nan when the result of 0 0 is printed directly

21002877
implements	extends
i know how to implements a dual pane app whereby i extends from fragmentactivity and add two fragments to this

21002877
implements	extends
i have implements a detailfragmentactivity which extends fragmentactivity and includes three tabs using the actionbar to add the tabs this works great say on a device single pane

21002879
width	height
for a more general solution to generate the x string treat width and height as numerator and denominator of a fraction and simplify the fraction by dividing by common prime factors

21002884
int	chars
given that c s chars are really just 8-bit int ignoring the wide chars sets for the moment you can create a 256 byte array holding an alternative set of chars and in the conversion function use the chars in your string as subscripts into the conversion array

21002884
int	chars
instead of a 1-for-1 mapping though give the upper-case array members the byte int values for the lower-case chars

21002889
width	height
secondly this example will only work for two known resolutions i suggest you check the aspect variable instead of the height and width

21002898
hide	show
i would like to hide this button when this element will add in a list and show

21002927
public	protected
it is a compile-time error if the same modifier appears more than once in a field declaration or if a field declaration has more than one of the access modifiers public protected and private

21002986
hide	show
so that when i press the button once the div tag gets the show class and when i press the same button again it gets the hide class

21002992
versioning	upgrade
it is not likely that i can upgrade to later versioning in the near future.

21003110
implements	extends
the + is about inheritance either extends the given class myclass or implements an interface

21003171
arcpy	arcgis
i m hoping to duplicate my techniques for looping through tables in r using python in the arcgis arcpy framework

21003197

21003203
ubuntu	linux
i was using linux ubuntu 64 bit and it uses open office libre calc and this program is only showing 5000 rows

21003216
hash	salt
i have read numerous times that when processing these iterations it is critical to hash not only the result of the previous hashing but also append the original salt each time

21003272
distance	pdist
so the function would be similar to pdist but instead of calculating the euclidean distance it should simply calculate the difference between the cartesian coordinate along one axis the z-axis if we assume that the entries in a are coordinates

21003284
firefox	safari
only ie firefox and safari are officially supported

21003293
mouseover	mouseout
inside b there are 4 divs that should respond to mouseover and mouseout events

21003312
hide	show
i want to show hide a layout but with adding a sliding effect while it s appearing and hiding

21003316
post	get
anyways if you take a look at logcat or post it here probably we can get a clue on the logs around setupmapifneeded

21003326
short	base
short answer yes when you define no constructor in your derived class the abstract base class constructors are used

21003329
post	put
as the http verbs need to match in your ajax had post route had put

21003342
submit	submission
meanwhile attepting to submit the form does implement my setcustomvalidity but won t log the event type however the implication is that this is an input event since that s the only other event the handler is listening for â but and this is where it gets really weird unbinding from change which wasn t working anyway leaving only input as a trigger for my imperative callback doesn t prevent submission at all anymore

21003357
ubuntu	debian
they even have a wiki page targeted at debian based distributions such as ubuntu

21003372
for-loop	loops
should be right after the for-loop outside the curly braces so when loops will be over only the greatest number will be printed out

21003397
google-chrome	firefox
demo here tested in firefox and google-chrome

21003399

in powershell you can put double-quotes inside of single-quotes without having to worry about escaping them

21003456
hide	show
i have a primefaces 3.5 datatable whose columns i want to show hide using selectmenucheckbox smcb - each column is listed in the smcb

21003456
hide	show
can someone suggest a way to do this with a datatable selectmenucheckbox and having the column show hide when each checkbox is changed

21003461
put	get
as far as i can tell i can put xmlbean the string and xmlbean2 into another class my.myotherclass and use to fix this but this is a pervasive problem though the entire deployment and i hope there is a better way of doing this such that i don t have to get rid of all the methods that take more than one simple argument

21003466
equals	gethashcode
if you want remove and contains to determine equality based on property values you will need to override the equals and gethashcode methods on your employee object

21003547

however if i want to fill it correctly by walking through the indices in llvm with a for-loop my code omitting loops structure and where index is a i32 loops counter

21009563
hide	show
from what i can understand you want to hide 5 and show it when mouse is over the bar

21009563
mouseleave	mouseenter	hide	show
you need to write the mouseenter and mouseleave event for the bar wrapper element and then show hide the score element within it when mouseenter leaves

21009621
for-loop	loops
by moving this increment to the outer for-loop the increment of 10 will happen after the inner loops and the newline which is what we want

21009652
mouseover	mouseenter
also generally it would be better to use mouseenter instead of mouseover since mouseover events bubble up in the code just try using mouseover you will see that element just shows up when you move your mouse and even after close and when you are not hovering the text

21009662
fadein	fadeout
the fadeout set the display to none but animate doesn t change that so use fadein

21009662
mouseleave	mouseenter
use mouseenter instead of hover because else the same function will get called on mouseleave also

21009674
ant	maven
i have an ant build invoked my jenkins that creates my .ear .war file but using maven in jenkins to upload archive to nexus for deployment tool to use

21009784
int	double
but this will fail if p is more than 15 digits and n is too small p 10 100 n 2 gives a 50 digit answer which is too big an int for double to represent exactly

21009784
multiplying	add
get 101 digit p into double cut the number string into 10 digit chunks multiplying each by 10 to the appropriate power and add them up

21009821
onmousedown	onmouseup
i ve done this find using onmousedown and onmouseup attributes but this does not work the same

21009952
disk	ram
saving information to a variable and therefore to ram is always faster than direct to disk

21009952
disk	ram
the problem is that if you shove a ton of information into a variable you will fill up your ram and once your ram is full things slow down paging memory to disk starts happening and basically everything stops working including any commands that you currently running robocopy

21009960
put	get
put it all together and you get

21009977
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
php on app engine doesn t yet have imagemagick or graphicsmagick available

21010201
jar	war
if you re using embedded jetty then you can t export a war -- the whole point is that jetty will be launched within your app so you should export a jar

21010230
int	double
if c is an int type c is added to 24 using int arithmetic and the result is converted to double and then assigned to qd1

21010230
int	double
either way the division of qd1 is a double divided by an int constant

21010230
int	double
the int constant is promoted to double and floating point division is performed with a double result assigned to qd1

21010230
integer	fractions
in java integer division truncates any fractions part which might result if the division were instead performed using floating point values and operators

21010230
int	double
once evaluation of the right-hand side has completed the int result is promoted to double before assigning it to qd1 but by then the fractions part of the intended result has already been lost

21010230
integer	fractions
the way to prevent this particular problem in practice is to always provide a fractions part to all integer constants used in floating point calculations

21010238
portrait	landscape
if you have 2 different layouts for portrait and landscape - it is even easier - just place landscape layout file into layout-land folder not layout - and your layout will be applied automatically during orientation change

along with that you can also use the dex2jar system which will output the dex file in the apk to a jar file that can be opened with jd-gui and exported to standard java files

21010468
hash	md5
the way i was thinking of doing it was to create a hash md5 unless somebody else has other recommendations and then check the hash matches a hash of the current content before closing a file

21010730
multiplying	add
its the multiplying that historically was slower than the add

21010741
hide	show
so you may also want to add a condition that hide the show link when cf.object.id is nil

21010743

apache	nginx
you could use a different port and avoid proxying switch to nginx try haproxy or use various other apache module alternatives

21010998
128bit	64bit	16-bit	64bit
the reason people say 128bit 64bit 32-bit 16-bit or 8-bit is because it s a lot easier than trying to remember all the those than those large numbers that each of them represent

21011002
for-loop	loops
this way each loops cycle has it s own variable x not shared so it doesn t get overwritten by the for-loop which was causing the problem i was shared

21011141
nexus	artifactory
i ve no experience with nexus but i ve found artifactory very intuitive and easy to configure at least initially

21011164
getter	setter
you could make getter and setter methods static and then that last call you used would work

21011185
spaces	delimiter
the bit that is unique here is that those other questions solutions did not really address how to split a string when it is delimiter with a combination of spaces and characters and comments

21011219

serializable	deserialization
as a further counter-example of clone implying an object which has the exact same serializable representation consider an object that implements clone using serializable which is perfectly valid and done in some languages since serializable has no such requirement of byte-equality ordering as in the case of hastable.writeobject then the restored order of such serializable deserialization and later serializable is not guaranteed either

21017102
min	max
it is selecting up to 40 records with id greater than or equal to a random number between min id and max id

21017102
min	max
so if bearing all of that in mind you are happy to continue using the second version despite its pitfalls then instead of the starting record being chosen by random id between min id and max id one could choose id between min id and the 40th id from the maximum

21018342
int	double
int 1000 says 1000 is int but d int 1000 says that oh d is double so compiler has to convert both into a common type binary numeric promotions mentioned in another answer to make it work

so int 1000 will be still converted to double by the compiler before applying operation

21018342
int	double
so the result will be of type double not int

21027020
google-chrome	firefox
for this to work in google-chrome firefox

21027031
public	protected
the reason why you don t see it is because fsharpbaz.bar is emitted as public and not protected

21027094
nsfilemanager	nsdocument
if you do not wish to use it you ll have to drop support for nsdocument and use a lower level abstraction like nsfilemanager + nsfileversion

21027097
for-loop	arrays
one way is i make a for-loop and check for all the chatlist arrays for the message sent and then replace its delivery notice but again this is very low performance incase i have 1000+ objects in the list

21027105
google-chrome	firefox
notice that google-chrome just like firefox does helpfully breaks at the hyphenation point and since this is a path i don t get to change hyphens to non breaking hyphens

21027112
for-loop	loops
you would want to put this statement into your for-loop as you iterate through the gps points and if it is the first iteration or the last iteration through loops than add your marker

21027191
udp	tcp	udp	rtp
but to transport rtp packets it s not a good idea to use tcp it lacks realtime feature so you have to stick with udp

21027191
rtp	sip
sip initiates a connection before sending rtp packets

21027191
rtp	sip	rtp	sdp	sip	sdp
to properly use sip and rtp you might have to take help of another protocol called sdp which tells which port to use for transmitting rtp and other various info

from your example i m assuming this is about multiline textbox in web applications a.k.a textarea

21027214

one of the reasons to use accepts_nested_attributes_for is to save children and parent at the same time

21027282

if the prefix will never be empty then you can build a prefix tree it s just a trie and query it for all words that start with that prefix filtering for those that have the requested length and suffix

21027333
width	height
the closest i found was this so question so if someone can just tell me if how to get parent height width i can probably get it from there

21027340
inherited	properties
or alternatively you could change the tintcolor since uitextview inherited from uiview and uses the tintcolor properties to colour links - see

21027394

also don t forget the getter and setter for those variables

21027396
datediff	difference

21027402
filtering	grouping
i ve tried using an approach where i added two category grouping both pointing to the date-time column and applying filtering to them one the cutoff date the other

21027408
folder	directory
if you know all files in the folder should be read you should let the user pick a single file then extract the path from that and read all the files from that directory

error the select statement includes a reserved words or an argument name that is misspelled or missing or the punctuation is incorrect

21027456

just to check that cron daemon is well and running

21027475

21027526
mp3	ogg
i am working in a project where i need to take some mp3 samples and mix them up in an ogg file as output

21027676
folder	directory
my folder is in d xampp not c - im not using sendmail but mail so it should just work from any directory

21027680
getter	setter
it would be great if i could eliminate the boilerplate getter setter noise by using groovy classes for this

21027680
getter	setter
less ideal but still workable can the org.hibernate.tool.ant.hibernatetooltask hbm2java ant task be configured to put all the annotations on the class private attributes instead of the getter setter

21027706
children	parent
ultimately i am trying to find out if .share s parent s sibling s children contain text

this works perfectly in google-chrome and firefox but for some reason not in internet explorer 11 haven t checked earlier versions

21027807

since display none not only makes elements invisible but collapses them width and height are 0 and the element is not part of the layout i think the opacity property is more suitable for you

21027839
helpers	actioncontroller
according to this github issue it is cleaner to use actioncontroller base.asset_host so it would result the helpers

21027844
getter	setter
the documentation says that whenever we keep our properties inside config extjs will generate corresponding getter and setter for the properties

21027844
getter	setter
but the thing is in spite of adding properties under config we can get and set them without using getter and setter

21027865
ready	each
i have a csv file which i need to ready and validate each element in each row and create a collection of a class having valid data

21027884

side note in the example code i added mouseover and mouseout events to simply demonstrate that this wrapper function is a multipurpose completely reusable piece of code that is not exclusive to the click event

21027898
versioning	upgrade
i am trying to upgrade from the free versioning of dnn community edition 7.01.02 to evoq content paid 7.02.00

21027906
versioning	upgrade
this works great and the policy is that everyone has until 14 comes out to get off of 12 so that we don t get an infinite number of versioning going but we don t have to synchronize our upgrade too the nanosecond either

21027914
helpers	actioncontroller
according to the same github issue it is cleaner to use actioncontroller base.asset_host so it would result the helpers

when you use sethttpbody it automatically sets the content-length header of the request but when you use sethttpbodystream it doesn t but rather sets transfer-encoding of chunked

21028584
chunked	transfer-encoding
when using nsurlconnection in conjunction with sethttpbodystream you can manually set content-length and it will prevent the transfer-encoding of chunked assuming you know the length in advance

matlab	simulink
simulink cannot be run as standalone software it requires matlab to be installed

21030275
google-chrome	firefox
the nature of this preflight call is different in ie and google-chrome + firefox

21030275
post	get	google-chrome	firefox
but google-chrome and firefox take much safer approach by making a http options call to check what all things the web server supports as cors which domains are allowed whether supports get post etc and the next call goes with the actual http get request with authentication

21030275
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome + firefox were throwing exception right after the preflight call

21030280
width	text-align	width	height	text-align	height
i have found that applying text-align justify to the containing div display inline to the ul display inline-block to the li and adding a span after the ul with a width 100 display inline-block height 0 will generate the desired effect

21030284
google-chrome	firefox
and it works fine in ie and firefox but not google-chrome

21030284
google-chrome	safari
i found out that i can use media only screen to fix it so it works on google-chrome and safari so i have another entry like

21030307
robocopy	xcopy
so far i have been unsuccessful with xcopy and robocopy as they both tell me access denied

21030311
children	parent
the child and parent have to call each others methods the parent needs to tell its children to do some things move change color etc and the children will signal the parent to do things to its other children

21030328
puts	gets
as people have mentioned you can use gets char which puts all characters until newline into the character array

21030377
allocator	stl
i m trying to use custom allocator with c++ stl containers and it works with vector but fails with map

21030381
pull	push
that matters in this case because in a distributed system you cannot push your changes on others -- instead they decide when to pull changes from you

21030381
pull	push
so the commands you need to know are init add commit remote pull push and clone

21030437
fileinputstream	objectinputstream
i guess that while wrapping the fileinputstream for the creation of an objectinputstream the implementation already parses the complete file and closes it

21030441
put	get
my approach will be to get set data from sqlite during ui usage and use a background process to find new rows and put them on the server flagging them as synced when it happens

21030449
getter	setter
it appears that some library is using reflection to try and find the getter setter for the field insertdate

21030472
int	chars
you should consider that in c a chars is nothing more than an alias of an int so casting a chars to int is a no-op

21030472
int	chars
so the problem is that you are casting the chars 1 or 0 to its int equivalent its ascii code in fact

21030472
int	chars
you should convert the chars to a valid int by subtracting 48 to a chars in the range 48 - 57 you obtain the decimal conversion of the chars or simply checking it against a chars value so

21030496
int	chars
map chars int transitions 200000000

21030500
width	height
my problem is that sometimes if my rectangle2d gets a big width or height its bottom left border splits and no longer makes a continous border and if i even make it wider the border goes smaller and smaller like if there were a limitation of how long a rectangles border can be.

21030520
gmail	hotmail
the code works fine if i send email to hotmail or outlook s account but the code doesnot work when i send email to gmail s account

note that with rack the options for the actual web server webrick thin etc. usually start with an uppercase character

21030651
google-chrome	firefox
mostly in google-chrome firefox on macs

21030651
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
safari doesn t seem to ever have the problem but it s not consistent as i m able to see the form properly in both google-chrome and firefox on my mac

21030687
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
in safari firefox google-chrome this also causes the newly focused item to be scrolled into view just like a natural tab event would do but not ie

21030699
pop-up	dialog
in the future i would recommend looking into jquery dialog as you can make it work exactly as you want it and it is set to pop-up in the middle of the screen and includes the close buttons and all that other fun stuff

21030704
getter	setter
and getter and setter or generate them

21030751

21030823
children	parent
when creating the children connect their somethinghappened signal to the parent s dosomething slot

21030911
innodb	myisam
having many read queries won t affect concurrency in myisam or innodb besides performance issues

21030911
innodb	myisam
inserts to the end of an index with innodb or the end of a table with myisam also don t impact concurrency

21030911
innodb	myisam
however as soon as you have an update query rows get locked in innodb and with myisam it s the entire table that gets write locked

21030922
post	get
i have read the mongo db and meteor js post but can not seem to get the syntax right

21030943
put	get
make sure you put the facebook script after the body tag or you will get a whole bunch of errors and it will not work

21030943
post	put
again you will need to make sure you put the facebook script after your body tag or this will not have any effect on how your page post

21030963

touchesbegan	touchesended
uibutton actions are usually assigned to fire on uicontroleventtouchupinside which should be worked out in the touchesended method and not touchesbegan

21031037
chunked	transfer-encoding
what s interesting is that transfer-encoding is getting set as chunked which is correct in general when the length is unknown

21031042
subclass	abstract-class
it s an abstract-class and this constructor could only ever be called from a subclass mybase.new info context

21031051
put	get
so i need an api controller to get user data and put user data etc

21031180
mouseover	mouseout
if i am understanding correctly i think you want add a mouseout event below the mouseover event and then remove both in the callback function for mouseout

21031211
min	max
when i log out date.getyear i get numbers like 104 an 105 when i would expect to get 2014 and 2015 etc so i m not sure how i can check the year to then go ahead and set the true false values based on the min and max arrays i have created that will hold the months i want to exclude

21031254
debian-based	linux
if using a debian-based linux system you can run the following commands

21031270

from what i can see you technically have not written a for-loop but a while loops with a counter

21031357
put	get
i am trying to add fractions to get a value to put in for my progress bar but am just getting 0

width	height
i ve tried adjusting the margins the background in the xml the width and height of the layout listview and listview rows to no avail

21031516
put	get
another rails-specific workaround for this problem and a neat approach in general is to add the ejs gem to your project s gemfile which allows you to put each template in a separate .jst.ejs file in app assets and have the asset pipleline compile it to a jst object that can be accessed by your view to get the template content

21031522
int	double
basically its a double and a int to represent a number as

21031537
debian	centos
tested on centos 6.5 debian 7 and arch

21031569
submit	submission
in the case of auto submit or simulating a form submission you don t need to worry about the pre-filled url at all

21031569
post	put
what you want is to put together the payload for a post request instead and have a computer bypass the form ui altogether

21031569
submit	submission
submission of form1 by having the machine submit form2 after breaking apart the data from form1

21031602
google-chrome	firefox
everything works as expected in google-chrome and firefox

for-loop	arrays
you declare int i on the first line of main and then again in the for-loop directly beneath it that initializes the t arrays

21031634
google-chrome	firefox
but it is only works on google-chrome no luck on firefox and ie

21031661
hash	salt
when a user creates a password i hash it including a salt and save it in the db

21031661
hash	salt
now when i hash the new password using the same salt and compare it with the old password hash i obviously cannot test whether or not the new and old password are similar

21031724
public	protected
thus you should be able to handle ui events in the observer and cause some delegation to a public or protected visible method within your observable

21031745
tiff	png
jpg png psd tiff jp2 iff wbmp and xbm images

21031755
arp	dhcp
the arp cache seems to never contain anything but the mac if the dhcp host

21031771
hide	show
one option would be to use the javascript to modify the display and visibility css attributes to show and hide the images

21031794
width	height
having 2 images with different width and height

21031851
hide	show
if the layout change you need for special collections isn t too extensive you could achieve it by doing something tricky in the page template which checks what page is currently being displayed and show or hide html or executes javascript based on the result

21031892
rspec	capybara
i think this is not a capybara question so much as it is an rspec question

21031898
int	chars
i m having difficulty finding out a specific way to copy a short int into a chars array

21031898
int	chars
and i want to copy the short int into the respective chars arrays filling the empty digits with 0s

21031945
filtering	grouping
you want to join the tables grouping by the course name and use a having clause to filtering

create a connection in ireport to the database by which your subreports will be filled

21031982
put	get
i am a newbie to php and have managed to get this working by using various bits of code i have put together

21032004
hide	show
but with this code works only the hide function and not the show

21032026
unsigned	short
you might want to make sure that the sizeof unsigned short is actually 2 bytes first

21032026
unsigned	short
if you are certain that your unsigned short values are small enough to store in a char variable then you could try casting them to char instead

21032026
unsigned	short
this has the added advantage of the std string automatically sizing itself according to the number of digits in your unsigned short

21032046
hide	show
then you can hide or show it however you wish if you want to hide it after a certain amount of time you could set a timer then issue the hide command

21032053
hash	md5
compute the md5 hash of the local file

21032130
serializable	deserialization
the default is ignore . this will cause the serializable to throw a jsonserializationexception during deserialization whenever it encounters a json property for which there is no corresponding property in the target class

21032163
post	get
mvc controler are http paths you cannot call a function in the controller you need to call a post or a get method

please note â error messages should be output to stderr not to stdout

21032604
integer	unsigned
basically a 64 bit little-endian unsigned integer containing the number of 100-nanosecond intervals that have passed since 1601-01-01 utc

21032623
hide	show
instead just hide the child rows you don t want to show

21032624
int	double
that is it should work for sci float int as well as for sci double int

21032624
int	double
in fact it only works for sci double int because your helper function fixsci can only work with sci double int

21032646
getter	setter
jpa entities are meant to be pojos simple java beans which do not have dependencies and have getter and setter which contain no complex logic

21032648
uiview	subviews
my goal is to resize uiview with a handle - its subviews

21032648
width	height
the problem is that i am not finding the correct methods or approaches how this handle may resize its superview s bounds width or height so it always sticks to the corner while finger is dragging it around

21032668
cos	sin
glsl s sin and cos take their arguments in radians not degrees

21032723
hash	salt
as long as your db file is inaccessable from http locked by a .htaccess or equivalent and other protocols not sitting in a directory accesable by anonymous ftp the only risk is to inadvertently let the hash salt be collected among a bunch of other user-related data and sent to your clients

21032740
qsort	malloc
malloc and sorting can be done using qsort

21032769
ubuntu	linux
for ubuntu try ubuntu ip and for the amazon linux it s ec2-user ip

21032776
multiplying	multiplication
0 is an integer so multiplying it gives you the result of integer multiplication

21032830
subtraction	addition
the reason why two s complement is used instead of using a separate bit for sign is that it makes subtraction and addition trivial regardless of signs

21032876
filtering	grouping
in myswl only grouping by not all non-aggregated columns has the effect of filtering only the first row encountered for each unique combination of grouping by colums

21032941
cgpoint	cgsize
you can use it to animate cgpoint and cgsize for example

21032949
subscript	superscript
subscript and superscript a string in android

21032951
width	height
once to attain the width and the height with .injustdecodebounds set to true and then again with .insamplesize to get the actual scaled bitmap options.outheight and options.outwidth in your code are probably zero

21032957
mp3	ogg
i need to have a long mp3 ogg audio file playing on my website and i need some way to let a visitor click on links buttons that will move the playhead to certain positions

21032992
explode	implode
i reverted to my idea of adding a marker | after every join and then using this statement fjoin implode array_unique explode | fjoin

21033066
put	get
so i get one of these and i have put it into my code at the bottom of class

21033083
google-chrome	firefox
worked here on firefox google-chrome ie9 without transitions on windows7

21033121

i have purchased an upgrade license for vs2013 pro but when i go thru the installation and put in the key it tells me that it is invalid for this versioning

21033125
haskell	ocaml
fusion is not as easy to implement in ocaml as it is in haskell due to side-effects

21033245
put	get
you would get better results by coding to help the compiler put your variables in registers

21033246
google-chrome	firefox
demo works differently in firefox and google-chrome

21033258
awt	swing
painting in awt and swing

width	height
on the width or height and use this ratio to scale tha layer and then center the layer

21033296
button	checkbox
within the past few months google has updated chrome and i think has broken radio button and checkbox on my website

21033296
firefox	safari
they work correctly in all other browsers i ve tried firefox safari ie9 ie10

21033296
button	checkbox
i m using twitter bootstrap 2.0.2 but when i reference that file by itself the radio button and checkbox are normal

21033304
paperclip	imgkit
before talk about my problem i must say i m using paperclip and imgkit in my project but i think the problem is with paperclip

21033380
integer	unsigned
by the way i always set up an unsigned integer of primary id col

21033428
width	height
for example your image name is image.jpg and it has 100px height and 100px width

21033429
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested this on multiple browsers google-chrome firefox ie 11 and the effect is consistent

21033470
folder	dir
i created a new folder and copy pasted all of the code in the main project dir over to the new folder

21033473
google-chrome	firefox
right now i m using the ugliest hack works on current firefox and google-chrome ie untested yet

21033485
cmusphinx	kaldi
i strongly recommend you to take a look at existing solutions like kaldi or cmusphinx

21033642
stdout	stderr
unless you do something weird like freopen on stdin stdout stderr rare they re just synonyms for fds 0 1 2

21033642
stdout	stderr
if you want to write pretty strings call fprintf with stdin stdout stderr -- they go to the same place

21033662
bower	npm
this problem somehow arose for me on mac when i was trying to run npm install -g bower

21033666
public	protected
well the thing is i m working on a idateeditor interface implementation from jcalendar library and i ve noticed that component.firepropertychange string propertyname object oldvalue object newvalue method is not public but protected

21033696
hide	show
bootstrap 3.0.3 can t show 2 dropdown-menu class with data-toggle dropdown because first click show class dropdown-menu and second click hide first class dropdown-menu and show the second

21033737
folder	directory
suppose at the wt directory that s being deployed on the live server you only want to checkout the build folder in the repository

21033782
min	max
i did a sum for the openings and appointments you could do min max count etc

21033812
post	get
i curl post this params to the url and get this error

21033852
post	get
however this brings up a conflict when trying to separate get from post

21033889
post	get
i ve also learned it s important to use post method instead of get in order to protect the information

21033917
google-chrome	firefox
the answer is to use a tool like curl wget or a browser extension like postman google-chrome or poster firefox

21033931
post	get
i prefer to use post even though this is a get per the rest architecture

21033931
post	get
i would create a separate url object get when i am using post to do a get-like operation to distinguish it from post-like operations which would be post to object

21034010
implements	extends
if you have a custom collection class which extends varien_data_collection you could implements your own sort functions very much like the filesytem class does

21034024
width	height
to do the height override -setframesize on bbview and if the width has changed from the old width call -invalidateintrinsiccontentsize

21034024
width	height
in your -intrinsiccontentsize on bbview you look at your current width and calculate the height based on how your strings lay out inside it

21034053
128bit	64bit
i think you can form the 128bit product in two pieces high 64bit and low 64bit and reduce each piece modulo p

21034102
superclass	subclassing
superclass subclassing check

21034135
subclass	abstract-class
i subclass this abstract-class

21034136
puts	gets
i have a collection which when fetched gets a json and puts into collection

21034144
width	height
if that doensnt work you can shrink the size of the images if being applied by the background property by reducing the width and height values by 90 or whatever you may need and applying background size 90

21034154
servicepoint	webrequest
an alternative might be to set the receivebuffersize on the servicepoint which is exposed on webrequest

21034219
box-sizing	border-box
it s not reading pseudo classes such as before after and box-sizing border-box

21034239
maven	cargo
used cargo to grab and run the war from the it module using the tomcat maven module

21034255
gif	png	tiff	png
for gif pxc png tiff and jpeg the file extension is just whatever follows the image part of the mime type

21034266
cos	sin
also i only ever seem to be able to rotate it vertically unless i m using cos and sin but then triangle spirals out of control when it s supposed to rotate around the hexagon

21034319
width	height
when loading depending on whether the height to width ratio is within or outside of the 4 3 ratio in landscape orientation

21034319
width	height
tried additionally dimensioning with height and width 100 .

21034319
width	height
if you take a landscape image and set the width to 100 instead of height it also centers vertically without issue leaving white space above and below its ratio is wider than 4 3

21034360
inherited	properties
once you inherited from java.lang.object you do not need to implement the handle properties and the dispose method

21034388
libs	buildpath
i ve tried adding the jars to my buildpath both when they re sourced within the project in the libs folder and also externally somewhere else on my file system

21034410
distance	polygons
3 removed from my example code creating a polygons of the resulting aspect-corrected bounding rectangle and rotating it back to the original heading using the polygons s center coordinate this would likely be needed if working with large regions as the next step involves measurement between horizontal vertical bounding distance

21034410
distance	polygons
5 using the larger dimension dimension of the two distance to form the base measurement of a triangle where a minimum coordinate location on axis b maximum coordinate location on axis and c camera location center coordinate of the polygons

21034417
int	chars
i have been looking through your code and the first obvious problem i found was that you are comparing a chars string to an int in your if statements

21034460
filtering	grouping
the trick with this is to use a count aggregate which verifies that the total number of distinct tid per zid grouping is equal to 2 when filtering via an in clause

21034481
width	margin
if the margin trick doesn t work another option is using display table then collapse the one not to be shown with a combination of width 0 and visibility hidden

21034481
width	height
the two items will form cells in a row which has the height of the taller one while the zero width prevents it from otherwise impacting the page layout

21034531
width	height
i tried giving the img a name through name ... and then entering div width name height name though that obviously didn t work

21034567
try-catch	exception-handling
i question is how would i edit my current try-catch exception-handling to catch only letters etc. and allow decimals to be entered and then store them into an array

21034605
width	height
the sizing .heart1 has a width and height of 100 and everything displays fine

21034605
width	margin
the yellow box my basic goal was to make the heart a bit smaller than the width of the yellow box center it horizontally within and give the heart some top margin

21034605
width	height
width and height of .heart2 are set to 75

21034607

further moving on with your code you have set nav to 100px but your nested a is set to 180px which is anyways redundant so instead use 180px for nav and get rid of 180px from a element also you would like to assign height and width to a instead of p as if you don t than user will have only a text as clickable which is bad from ui point of view so i ve tweaked your code ahead in this demo also make sure you turn your a element to display block

21038729
getter	setter
see whenever you declare members in objective-c you should provide getter and setter for those members variables

21038729
accessor	properties
but objective-c supports something called synthesized accessor using the directives properties and synthesize

21038729
getter	setter
now coming back if u haven t used the property and synthesize you should have to write your own setter and getter method to set and get the members firstname and lastname

21038729
getter	setter
since you re using property and synthesize the compiler will write getter and setter methods

21053649
perl	tcl
i am using tcl.pm module to run some scripts in perl using the tcl interpreter

21053845
post	get
to answer your question that is how you execute a php file you simply call it with a regular get -or- post request

21053866
stdout	stderr
this is happening only in unix-like systems linux etc because when you open a file unix use the minor file descriptor so in a process stdin stdout and stderr are always 0 1 and 2

21053866
stdout	stderr
you are closing stdin 0 stdout 1 and stderr 2 so when you open your files in the same order they get 0 1 and 2 as file descriptor

21053888
folder	directory
i m trying to determine which user folder in c users have active users in active directory

21054033
google-chrome	firefox
if you go to this simple fiddle it will also not work for the same reason in firefox but it works in google-chrome because google-chrome handles it explicitly but its not right html

21054092

you don t need recursion and the function settimeout but all what you need is to use the setinterval function on the function you want by 1 interval repeatedly in for-loop

21054119
google-chrome	firefox
the ngchange gets called first in firefox second in google-chrome where as mychange gets called first google-chrome and second in firefox

21054125
profiling	debugging
you can define this in your javascript debugging configuration profiling in the run- edit configurations

21054253
std	ostream
of course the objects also work with other std ostream objects not just std cout

21054307
int	double
you must pass the array not as an int but as a double pointer - or

width	height
it s easy to scale iframe width but to keep height relative i found chunks of javascript jquery and php all pretty esoteric to a beginner at web design

21054426
width	height
i wanted a simple method of scaling an iframe s height to always keep a certain aspect ratio no matter how the width changes

21054427
width	height
the outer div sets the maximum height and width and allows itself to scale while the inner div uses the padding attribute to match its height to the width of the containing div i m pretty sure

21054427
width	height
the value should be set at the ratio of the height to the width

21054434
for-loop	arrays
next i use a for-loop to vary the parameters represent by datasizeparams arrays

21054443
post	get

multiplying	transpose
i have n kx1 sparse vectors and i need to multiplying each of them by their transpose creating n square matrices which i then have to sum over

21054520
inherited	properties
since your selectvideo1 is hereditary class of selectvideo it inherited the variables and properties of the parent class

21055192
qsharedpointer	qscopedpointer
use qscopedpointer or qsharedpointer depending on the scope of foo class instead of foo

21055221
children	parent
if the dom structure can t give 2 elements a clear reference to each other by being children of the same parent element then you usually have to fall back on libraries like less or jquery that let you compute and store values for later comparisons

21055303
width	margin
i m counting up the declared width to 885px with 900px available if the margin is 8px on both sides the form can not fit

21055482
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
the result is works in google-chrome and opera however in both firefox and ie the transition is not applied and the height simply extends without a nice transition effect

21055499

21055541
accessor	properties
if they are properties make them get -only set accessor absent or private

21055557
width	height
as you said the images are downloading just fine but they re not showing up because the value for their width and height returned by your script is 0

21055557
width	height
you could troubleshoot your script to figure out why the values aren t returning the natural dimensions 0.6 it seems to me like your script should work - idk what s happening there or you could just specify a width and set height to auto like this

21055594
textview	imageview
this kind of lint warning is more of a suggestion rather than something that must be done and is detected by just checking for a linear layout with only a textview and an imageview rather than checking what would need to go in the image view

21055597
versioning	upgrade
i found it much easier to upgrade to the master versioning of git than downgrade subversion in cygwin

21055631
for-loop	arrays
the two principal problems are that your for-loop overwrites the arrays each time rather than appending and your diff check is invalid

21055644
rss	feed
however the same page s rss feed is found at format rss20 where 414117051979234 is an id that can be determined by going to https graph .facebook.com tiltedkiltesplanade and looking for the last numeric id listed on the page there are two similar-looking ids at the top of the page but these can be ignored

in my example the parent array is which gets inserted into one table are the children

21056070
children	parent
remove parent - keep children

21056078
stdout	stderr
the most commonly used exaples are stream 1 stdout and stream 2 stderr

21056078
stdout	stderr
a more interesting example redirects the echo command s error output from stderr to stdout combining them into a single stream

int	chars
programs made in c language only receive two things and int variable which is the number of parameters that you have passed and a chars that is the list of parameters that you have passed by console

21056363
put	get
but one thing you can do to get around this issue is put a break in between each site

21056381
folder	directory
then in our config.rb we set the scss directory and target css directory to our etc design folder so this way we could keep our scss where we want our css to compile to

21056381
maven	pom.xml
some other things we ve done are to exclude scss files from our pom.xml so that maven just builds in the compiled css and then remove our compiled css files from our versioning system

21056402
versioning	upgrade
if you did not deactivate the plugins before you upgrade may be one of the plugins is causing the problem as may be is not compatible or needs to be updated to the new versioning so using ftp program rename the plugins folder to say plugins_hold and create a blank plugins folder and try to log in if you can log in then you will notice that all plugins are deactivated

21056424
persistent	transient
if you treat a transient map the same as a persistent map - that is keep the result of assoc

21056454

21056567
post	get
and i m trying to return the body of the post request using this code obviously it s not working only works for get request

21056580
post	put
although the form s submission method is post because of the hidden form input rails understands the desired submission method to be put

21056615
post	get
the rails framework encourages restful design of your applications which means you ll be making a lot of patch and delete requests besides get and post

21056615
post	get
however most browsers don t support methods other than get and post when it comes to submitting forms

21056615
post	put
so it s perfectly ok to have post instead of put

multiplication	modulo	division	multiplication	division	modulo
i did it this way only one division no multiplication no modulo looks like fastest solution

21056683
multiplication	modulo
i was curious what is faster less branching or less multiplication divisions modulo so i compared my solution with runevision s one and in this particular case less divisions is better than less branching

21056713
getter	setter
in that case give them private access and provide getter and setter

21056719
multiplying	add
it might be ok to multiplying by dimensionless numbers but it is unreasonable to add dimensionless numbers to map points

21056764
padding	overlapping
however you will see overlapping and will have to account of the offset of div#content with either margin on div#content or padding on the parent container

21056764

21056847
udp	mtu
ever since i did sockets programming on a pdp 11 it s been the case that ip fragmentation will take care of the case where an ip datagram such as a udp datagram is larger than the mtu for the segment allows

21056847
ethernet	wireless
thus i can send a udp datagram of size 30 kb and it might fragment to 20 segments of 1.5 kb on ethernet and then fragment each into three segments of 576 bytes later on for some particular wireless link and as long as all the fragments make it to the other end the udp datagram makes it to the other end

21056847
udp	mtu
then i came across the documentation for the udp socket in node.js which claims that routers will drop datagrams that do not fit the mtu of the next segment

21056870
x86	64bit
hint the code below is version 2 in part compatible with x86 x64 32 64bit

21056883

cloud storage provides you with a md5 hash after an object is created which you could use to validate that the migration of each file was error-free before deleting the blobstore copy can compute a similar hash while the file is in-transit on migration

21056913
versioning	upgrade
to get the upgrade through i simply created an empty versioning of the missing file create a blank ofc_upload_image.php file in the www admin plugins videoreport lib ofc2 folder

21056916
packets	pcap
you should be able to accomplish this using a pcap packets capture library such as jnetpcap

21057000
put	get
a better solution that i have seen people deploying is get from wikipedia all articles that refer to places put them in a db for text like lucene and then use your text as query to find the most promising location between candidates by measuring some similarity score

gif	png
later on i want to save it to a byte array but the imageio.write method requires me to pick either a gif png or jpg format to write my image as as described in the tutorial here

21057191
gif	png
if the image was originally a gif i don t want the extra overhead of saving it as a png

21057191
gif	png
but if the image was originally a png i don t want to lose translucency and such by saving it as a jpg or gif

21057220
mouseup	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown
i ve been looking through the d3 source code and mouseup never gets called in contrast to mousedown and mousemove which respond to the respective events

21057237
hide	show
ideal behavior is when title is too long back button text should be hide and show only icon

21057251
move	drag
i need them to be able to be overlapping if the user drag them there but on the creation of the control to check and move them if necessary

21057254
pull	push
so we can push these numbers together into a single number as long as we know this length and we can pull them apart later

21057346
floating-point	integer	division	multiplication
a much better solution would be to use repeated division and multiplication by 10 in integer and not use floating-point at all there is a very clean recursive solution similar to yours without requiring that you compute base

21057354
post	get
i need to post json but am unable to get the body and the content type correct

21057378
width	height
you could add minimum widths and height to the labels and that might do what you want width minimum

21057393
free	malloc
also if i remember correctly a double free can actually call malloc twice which results in a buffer overflow thus leaving the system vulnerable

21057519
superclass	subclassing
the other reason is that you re creating an instance of a superclass from within a subclassing and there s never a reason this is necessary

21057549
int	double
if you particularly want to have only an int you can work from the double you are left with which will contain decimal places and do the int value of that

21057555
inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties
his assignment said all methods including properties are inherited by subclassing regardless of whether they are public or private

21057555
inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties
why private properties and method in implementation file can also be inherited by subclassing

21057555
superclass	subclassing
i remember private property and method is invisible in subclassing and subclassing cannot use superclass s private property and method

21057574
hide	show
i want to toggle show hide value to my button tried alot but nothing worked

21057591
folder	directory
using then using 7-zip to look through the executable i find this directory of files and folder

21057623
min	max
you need to add variables for the current min max and total

21057627
coalesce	isnull
the easiest alternative from a delphi code standpoint anyway would be to handle this in your sql statement itself using isnull or coalesce or its equivalent in ms access so you don t have to worry about it in your application code

21057635
jtextfield	jlabel
the jlabel and the jtextfield would go in one jpanel with flowlayout

21057645
loops	if-statement
an easy fix for this would be to wrap that if-statement in another loops

21057650
for-loop	loops
that int because it is declared inside the for-loop only lasts for the lifetime of that loops

21057658
inherited	properties
the granularity of the original data that you offer your processing functions may matter more than the representation the message inherited structure properties whatever

21057702
width	height
#diva has a width of 100 and i want to get the px value of the div and apply it to #divb as it s height css

21057717

21057762
innodb	myisam
try converting myisam ones to innodb eg

21057770
onclick	onchange
in this case what i d do is try to bind a handler to the select onchange event onclick on the select element might work too...

21057797
for-loop	arrays
you have to make the arrays have at least a size value of pari because in the for-loop you are attempting to get elements of each arrays from index 0 to index pari - 1

21057800
integer	unsigned
when this value gets assigned back to the unsigned integer number it would get demoted to become an int and rounded down to 0

21057847
inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties
why private properties and method in implementation file can also be inherited by subclassing

21057847
inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties	superclass	subclassing
if a subclassing only inherited some of its superclass s methods and properties instances of that class wouldn t be complete and valid instances of the superclass

21057850
draggable	droppable
basically you were half way there you need to make an element the blue box with id #menuelement2 droppable to provide a target for a draggable element

21057879

21057903
post	get
get and post add option

21057928
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
my suspicion is that you are using a uinavigationcontroller uitabbarcontroller etc to show the uiviewcontroller

21057928
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
if that is the case then you will need to subclass uinavigationcontroller uitabbarcontroller in order to add the correct status bar style you will need to subclass these controllers to add the preferredstatusbarstyle method to them

21057928
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
since the uinavigationcontroller contains the uiviewcontroller if you set the status bar property in just the uiviewcontroller the uinavigationcontroller does not know about it and keeps its original property

21057945
directx	gdi	bitblt	gdi
gdi bitblt capture or directx getfrontbuffer

21057963
gif	png
while it looks like both jpgs and pngs shared some similar bufferedimage constant types only a png in my test resulted in a type_4byte_bgra and every gif resulted in a type_byte_indexed

21057996
int	chars
you can use to see if there is an int next - generally speaking some sequences of chars could be parsed as different types of variables so you have to use each hasnextdouble etc function in the order you desire

21058028

21058259
put	get
at present the form i have put together updates the database fine etc the issue is when i go to edit the field only the first part of the data is shown for example if the data was sunny day then when i clicked to edit this field all i would get is sunny so then if i then clicked update it would edit the database back to sunny

21058278
superclass	subclassing
so i have a superclass called factorial and two subclassing called fibonacci and arithmetic

i note that the apple-supplied clang version apple llvm version 5.0 clang-500.2.79 based on llvm 3.3svn does not object with the second ignored pragma commented out with -wconversion or with -wsign-conversion and i tried dinking with the code passing a uint32_t parameter and assigning that to result before returning it etc so it isn t simply superior optimization recognizing that 0 is special or that returning an uninitialized variable is undefined behavior etc.

21060088
post	get
i am serializing a form and successfully get the object i want to send but when the post request is made the browser only passes in the playername attribute only that attribute even if i change the input name and pass another attribute in the place of playername it won t pass unless it is the playername attr

beanstalk	amazon-web-services
elastic beanstalk is a service that takes your code and manages the runtime environment for you - once you ve set it up it s very easy to deploy and you don t have to worry about managing servers - amazon-web-services does pretty much everything for you

21067357
width	height
if so the reason for this behavior is that your chart does not provide a height by itself -- indeed you specify fill_parent as its width and height

21067357
width	height
solution might then be to ask yourself better what width and height you want to give to your charts

21067367
stdout	stderr
i would especially be very interested in seeing the stdout and stderr but i don t know why the log file is empty

21067372

21067616
int	double
i have tried changing between double and int for i and n

21067652
width	height
unfortunately it is not possible to simply use the x y width and height attributes of the rectangle after a transformation because they still have the data of before

21067652
width	height
with rectangle.matrix.x x y and rectangle.matrix.y x y i can receive the real x and y coordinates of the top left corner and with rectangle.attrs.scale.x and rectangle.attrs.scale.y i can calculate the changed width and height of the rectangle

21067714

21067748
implements	extends
but if i implements this by extends ds.model

21067760
getter	setter
one solution would be to supply setter and getter that would allow the customerpanel to change set and get the values from this component

21067760
getter	setter
so instead of needing to expose the instance of customerformpanel directly you would simply provide proxy getter setter through the customerpanel

21067760
getter	setter
basically what this means is you would create a object which had the required setter and getter you need to build the required results and pass this into the customerpanel the customerpanel would then set the values if has to this object and would then pass it the other forms which would do the same each setting the values to this object that they are managing

21067801
pop-up	dialog
i have a custom grid control in a dialog that i want to pop-up a listbox to allow the user to select from a set of pre-defined values

since seaside has been ported to pharo squeak gemstone dolphin visualworks va smalltalk gnu smalltalk i think this list has some authority

21067839

21068018
for-loop	arrays
you are trying to initialize your arrays by using an enhanced for-loop which doesn t work

21068023

if you overload it you must also define it as protected or define it as public which is weaker

21068026
rss	feed
to simplify things i have the url of the image i am trying to display in the enclosure part of the rss feed

21068049

an application must use some other software-based or hardware-accelerated rasterization library such as direct2d or direct3d to populate the bitmaps that are to be composed

21068060
filesystems	fat
filesystems like fat don t support security at all so as soon as you copy the file to it the security information is simply lost

mousemove	mousedown
i ve also moved the mousemove binding so it s not rebound in every call to mousedown

21068189
mouseover	mousedown
you seem to be allowing drag when mouseover and mousedown which is the default state behaviour of draggable

21068219

not only the path is thus incorrect but you don t even want to use a file since what you want to read is a resource which is inside the war file or even inside a jar file inside the war file

21068235
put	get
i think you can get the models that you want from the original collection and put them in a temp collection

i need start my application on pcs with .net 4.0 and without .net 4.5 therefore i solved to rewrite client part to use httpwebrequest httpwebresponse or webclient

21068335
.htaccess	httpd.conf
well after thinking a lot about it and reading a bit i believe that the error function simply makes the .htaccess parsing to be cancelled - and the error to be logged - and then throw an 500 error from the apache config that has been parsed before this one for example an .htaccess from another folder over this one or the httpd.conf from apache

21068367
hide	show
and the div i want to show hide

21068426
inherited	properties
in function food name price it inherited the constructor s product s properties with product.call this

21068426

the instances of food that are created by new food will inherited properties including methods from food.prototype which will by that statement inherited properties from product.prototype

21068493
post	get
accordingly to how to switch from post to get in php curl you should use

21068495
pull	push
by having worker actors pull work instead of having a supervisor push work you can gracefully control the amount of work and therefore cpu and memory usage by simply limiting the number of worker actors

21068518
bottle	flask
i would strongly suggest using a light web framework like flask or bottle

21068542
hide	show
so im trying to show a div when one of the multiple checkboxes are clicked and it is working but when you unclick a checkbox it hide the div even when checkboxes are still clicked

fadein	fadeout
when the button #call-to-action is clicked the #landing-page div should fadeout and the #more-info image should fadein

21068882
xdebug	xhprof
xhprof or xdebug might help you understand what s happening to your script

21068882
xdebug	xhprof
i would check your apache and system error logs first and then profile the process with xhprof it doesn t slow down your script nearly as much as xdebug so you ll get the added benefit of knowing approximately how long your process ran for

21068898
put	get
i don t know how to get information after authentication and put it in the managedbean and serve it to he profile jsf page

21068902
width	height
i have an entity class which is a pair of x y coordinates and width and height

21068909

pomolis i and brojac are both int therefore the division will not return a fractions float double but an int again most likely zero in your program

21068910
post	get
i made webservice on jboss-as-7 which works ok with get method but when i tried to add post i m getting 415 unsupported media type

21068927
hide	fadeout
also you probably want to hide the second img to start with and not fade it in until the first img has finished fading - if you pass a function as the second argument to .fadeout it will be called after the fadeout finishes

21068950
hide	show
i d like to hide a series from a dygraphs chart but show the value in the legend

21068963

21069040
folder	directory
this is loading the file with the source as the components jquery folder in the vendor directory

21069070

other advice is to ensure that you have done as much as possible to avoid being flagged as spam such as setup spf record and dkim and also read up on how to create email that are less likely to be treated as spam

21069085
prng	random
in case you need random numbers for simulation or something similar where you need random numbers you should use high quality super fast random and large prng called mersenne twister

21069133
width	height
if you need to create some type of limit to the scale you may need to create a dependency property that calculates the needed sizes of the controls and bind their width and height to your results

21069145
prng	random
just seed the prng with a true random number before the loop then just use the output from that to get pseudo- random numbers

21069237
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
in firefox google-chrome and safari it looks ok but on ie10 and opera it looks like this

in recent browsers firefox 2.0 google-chrome 1 ie 9 opera 9.5 safari 3 this will work

21069438

i also don t want to mess with the dimensions of the jtextfield because the default height is just right for the font and the width is supposed to be defined by the number of columns in the constructor

21069448
put	get
everything works fine when i put the raw query into the yql console but using the provided url in my script i get different results

selects only the direct children of the parent class

21069542
qthread	qobject
in your case you are calling print from a qthread while the emmittingstream qobject resides in the main thread

21069542
stdout	stderr
edit for an example of how to make your emittingstream print calls thread-safe see here redirecting stdout and stderr to a pyqt4 qtextedit from a secondary thread

21069548
submit	submission
i have a file usernames.txt that has every username of my website members when they submit their usernames it will be saved in usernames.txt the problem is that there are a lot of users submission there usernames every day i want a php code or something that will delete the first at the top username every 30 seconds automatically even though more than 20 usernames are submitted every minute the script i need will make the usernames.txt file smaller and that will make my server a bit faster

21069550
button	checkbox
i also plan to add a tool menu that will have sliders button checkbox etc

21069577
int	chars
the string is a unix epoch time in milliseconds so there s an easy fix chop off the last three chars and the result will be a unix epoch time in seconds which will fit into a 32-bit int until 2038

21069582
hide	show
on ajax.success i hide all rows then show the rows from the json response

21069582
google-chrome	firefox

21069601
int	boolean
i have the boolean going up in my render class as well a int x and int y and is set to false

21069603
apache	nginx
than you should use nginx instead of apache and php-5.5 with fpm instead of mod_php

21069603
opcache	apc
opcache instead of apc by the way apc.stat should be turned off

21069632
build.gradle	gradlew
point the distribution url to gradlew 1.9 or your build.gradle should look something like this

21069647
uilabel	nsstring
when the user presses equals what is supposed to happen is the current uilabel gets converted to an nsstring then to nsinteger and multiplied by the previously stored result

21069647
uilabel	nsstring
then that new integer is converted to an nsstring and set to the uilabel

21069647
uilabel	nsstring
now i don t know if the uilabel is simply not going to an nsstring or when setting an nsstring to the contents of a uilabel is not picking up an content from the uilabel

21069697
webclient	webrequest
then i would access this file and get the return string from the c# application by using a webclient or webrequest

21069735
getter	setter
i would also recommend you to read about why you should use private fields getter and setter

21069776

21069832
public	protected
it has to be almost protected public will also work

21069841
width	height
as for the position of the edges of the button i m pretty sure you can calculate those values the left and top edges are probably just the same as the coordinate values you used to define where the image should be drawn and the right bottom are just the left or right edges plus the width or height of the button

21070798
width	height
with no option to manually set the height width

21070798
width	height
looking at their source they are doing their own internal calcs for height width

how can i make it hide and not show at all until my button is clicked

21070940

you never call the function displayheightwidthmeasurement so the method in it set is not called yet so the values of height and width are zero just as you set just as theit said it is not a good way to instantiate an activity you can just define a class that get the width and height of the diplay rather than use an activity

i have a pyqt application and i want to re-route the stdout and stderr streams to a qtextedit that is in my gui without delay

21071448
stdout	stderr
this works perfectly but with one caveat if stdout or stderr are updated multiple times while the cpu is processing a relatively longer method all of the updates show up simultaneously when the main thread returns to the application loop

21071448
stdout	stderr
pyqt widgets cannot be modified from any thread other then the application thread and since the updates to stdout and stderr are coming from the secondary worker thread that i created they are violating this rule

octal	decimal
given that 379 is not an octal escape sequence since the negative lookahead of decimal digit bars both 3 and 37 from being treated as octal escape sequences

21071959
int	double
since you re doing decimal fixed point most of the values you have can t be stored exactly unless the implementation s double type happens to be decimal which it in principle can be unlike int which have to be binary

21071959
int	double
typically a double is 64-bit ieee floating point with roughly 52 bits precision and with range much larger than 64-bit int so magnitude is no problem

21072928
getter	setter
that said if you re not going to add any code to the getter or setter other than that to return the backing field and set the backing field then you should do away with the backing field altogether and just do this

21072928
getter	setter
note there that i have put the getter before the setter which is a universal convention and something that you should do too

21072970

21089787
int	chars
we can preallocate huge byte array to continuously read from network without allocations we can perform same with chars arrays to avoid allocations during conversion with encoding class however there doesn t seem to be a way how to convert to basic types int decimal ... without reinventing wheel means reimplementing what the bcl does in tryparse methods or without creating garbage converting chars to strings which are to be thrown away

21090108
google-chrome	firefox
if that occurs it will still be measured relative to the start of fetching. however setting this attribute immediately before or after calling abort for a xhr which is waiting for data from the server appears to have no effect in firefox 26 or google-chrome 31

the avx addition has a latency of 3 and the multiplication a latency of 5

21090873
addition	multiplication
ivy bridge can do one avx multiplication and one avx addition at the same time using different ports

21090873
addition	multiplication
using the notation m for multiplication a for addition and x for no operation as well as a number to indicate the partial sum m5 means multiplication with the 5th partial sum i can write

21090873
addition	multiplication
so by using 8 partial sums after nine clock cycles four from the load and five from the multiplication i can submit one avx load one avx addition and one avx multiplication every clock cycle

21090873
addition	multiplication
but instead of only multiplication and addition i m looking for one 256-bit load or two 128-bit loads one avx multiplication and one avx addition every clock cycle with ivy bridge or two 256-bit loads and two fma3 instructions per clock cycle

21090898

regarding tuple approach .net tuples are not the most performant when they re meant to be used as keys in sets since its equals and gethashcode implementation causes boxing for value types

21091015
int	chars
i would prefer tuple based approach but you should write one your own tuple with a better implementation and in this one case of chars and int keys i prefer making it a immutable struct

21091037

then we can look at how to query for different types of subclassing superclass relationships from the data

21093154
superclass	subclassing
in general the relationships between classes subclassing and superclass relationships are things that you d use an owl reasoner to determine for you

21093154
rdf	owl
however some are simple enough and present in the rdf encoding of the owl axioms that you can draw the same conclusions using a sparql query

21093195

hide	show
i have mainly been using layers and show hide to animate my pages but now i need to do a rotation of a line

so to crop it it s just a matter of copying the pixels you want to a new byte arrays with some for-loop

21094863
hide	show
the best solution i can come up with is to make a list of links then use the onclick javascript event for each url to make the div tab that it is attached to using the href attribute of the to save the id of the div you are trying to open and in the onclick change the display css property of the divs by changing the classname javascript property to show 1 div and hide the others

int	double	int	chars
chars 1 byte + 3 bytes padding + int 4 bytes + double 8 bytes + void 4 bytes which is equal to 20 bytes plus 4 bytes due to the longest member alignment rule here double is 8 bytes so struct should be aligned on a 8 byte boundary which finally sums to 24 bytes

int	double
the problem is the attribute has 2 overloads one for int and one for double in your attribute definition you have declared int values which means internally the property value is cast to int which will truncate the floating point - so in essence 1.1 will be truncated to 1 so will always be in range

ng-show	ng-hide
basically this just shows how to use the ng-hide ng-show directive they are the same just opposites of each other
