inline elements have no height so you can change the display from inline to inline-block to allow the height or in your case top margin to work

post	get
i ve given my a data-id attribute so i can get it my post by not very sure if it works but there should be a way to pass variables

22561243

22561298
ubuntu	centos
build the program in ubuntu and use the libraries designed to work with centos

22561298
ubuntu	centos
then copy the executable from ubuntu to centos

22561568
ubuntu	centos
it s not a good idea to use on ubuntu the libraries designed to work with centos since at compile time they might dynamically link to your ubuntu system .so files

22561568
ubuntu	centos
your suggestion of installing the centos versions of the libraries in an ubuntu system might work but you need to test it first

22561568
ubuntu	centos
if you can run your ubuntu compiled program on the centos system then you are safe to go

22561621

width	height
i m trying to create an animation that compresses a header along the x-axis until the width and height are 50px then expand along the y-axis to create a sidebar with a width of 50px if the window is scrolled down and the reverse happens when the window is scrolled back to the top

22568465
width	height
the animation goes fine when the user scrolls down from 0 but when the window is scrolled back to the top the second animate method in showheader adds height 100 to the element even though only width 100 is specified so the header fills the page

22568465

i m wondering where the animate method gets the instruction to modify the height when only the width is specified

22573845

22578252
memcmp	strcmp
from your description it is hard to know what you do with memcmp or strcmp but i assume that you want to check the common name or subject alternative names against the hostname

22578252
memcmp	strcmp
there were others which used strcmp instead of memcmp for this which resulted in lots of security reports in 2009 see cve-2009-2408 firefox cve-2009-2702 kde cve-2009-3767 openldap and some more

there is a nascent standards effort to try to come up with a safe way to solve the most common clipboard problems probably requiring a specific user action like the flash solution requires and it looks like it may be partially implemented in the latest versions of firefox and google-chrome but i haven t confirmed that yet

22581859
sorting	filtering
here is a link which talks about viewing errors and sorting filtering them

22581922
hide	show
put all the page content in one page and hide the non active contents then show the contends according to the menu click you can refer jquery tab

22581923

jar	war
i included comet jar into war file it should be used only to

22582057

debian	linux
.eclipse org.eclipse.platform_3.8_155965261 plugins com.aptana.terminal_3.0.0.1306201824 os linux x86_x64 redtty was the path on my debian machine using eclipse 3.8 with the aptana studio plugin

22582140
getter	setter
and to use them you will need some getter and setter in your classes so its better approach if you use beans and a separate package for all of the beans with different bean classes

22582141
clang	llvm
if you want a true cross-platform compiler you can use llvm clang free open source bsd license or the intel compiler commercial but faster

22582141
glfw	sdl
to draw things you can either use native apis pain use a graphical toolkit directx opengl... also pain use a library for 2d and handling of stuff sdl is popular but i like sfml more for 3d you might consider glfw

22582141
vim	geany
i suggest you also look at cmake or any of its alternatives vim or geany if vim is too hardcore and compiling through the command line

22582150
min	max
so for example if min is and max is 60 and cost1 is 5 cost2 is 10 cost3 is 15 cost4 is 20 and cost5 is 25

22582197
for-loop	loops
i want use flush function in for-loop that echo content after each loops

22582213
stdout	stderr
this will send traceback to stderr rather than stdout

22582233
int	chars
i ve been experiencing some very odd behaviour from what should be a very simple function an int is passed to the function and depending on its value will return an unsigned chars specific to that int

22582252
superclass	subclassing
it looks like you are calling letusfinalise from the superclass so it s not possible to call the subclassing method unless you are using a static object to it demonstrated below

22582347
spaces	delimiter
where each number is delimiter by a single spaces you can do this

22582355
width	height
this is confirmed by your python code which suggests that the image width is the fifth from the last uint32 and the height is the fourth from the last uint32

22582383
google-chrome	safari
note that on mouseover of the document a translucent toolbar pops up in google-chrome and safari so long as the dimensions are at least 346 px wide and that toolbar allows one to resize the document inside to fit it within the inframe window

22582390
width	height
alternatively you set a 10px padding on the #parent then you set the #child to 100 width and height

22582425
scrypt	pbkdf2
and make sure you properly escape values inserted into the database and encrypt the password with pbkdf2 or scrypt

22582443
hash	md5
also would it be viable to find exe files from open programs then get the md5 hash from those exe files and compare them to a list of known cheat programs

22582447
min	max
it is the change of direction of the lines where you hit local min or max there is your control point .

22582542
bower	npm
the reason this happens is because pending v3.x will be available through npm and the latest bower packages do not offer the sources only prebuilt versions

22582572
post	get
assuming you have a form with all the data in it you would then use javascript to make a submit button and send all the data for example via get or post to this .php file on your server using a ajax request

22582592
fgets	strtol
so instead of using fgets and then extracting the digits using strtol i am forced to use scanf because the assignment platform does not work properly with strtol

22582598
jtextfield	jtextpane
i have it set up so that it displays in a swing window with a non editable jtextpane and a jtextfield

22582598

put	get
the only difference is that you may add a condition to make sure its here and put your get script after the dynamic creation

22582649
touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchescancelled	touchescancelled	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchescancelled	touchesmoved	touchesended
i use touchesbegan touchesmoved touchesended touchescancelled and not gesture recognizers as often suggested by stackoverflow users because i display larger letter tile image with shadow the bigimage on touchesbegan

22582649
touchescancelled	touchesended
in touchesended or touchescancelled i display smallimage with shadow again and - add the tile to the contentview or leave it in the main view if the tile is at the bottom of the app

22582670
superclass	subclassing
when you access the static fields of a superclass on subclassing reference only the class that declares the field will be loaded and initialized in this case it is a

22582696
post	get
the usual answer is to post the sensitive information rather than use get but i m guessing that s not an option for you

22582708
min	max
just updated the code above to make sure the min max values are defined

22582789
post	get
when i sumbit form post i get this in url but no message for methodnotallowedexception

22582802
try-catch	exception-handling
you need to wrap the line in a try-catch and handle the exception-handling

22582893
hide	show
i would render both partials and use javascript to show hide the correct ones

22582918
stdout	stderr
i figured out the problem that is because opt -print-callgraph foo.bc prints the call graph to stderr and the content of the foo.bc to stdout so i need use to capture the stdout

22582980
width	height
as screen width is reduced the cropped image reduces in width height like a standard responsive image img max-width 100

22583014
width	height
all the parameters for my positive images are set up correctly starting point x y width and height

22583014
width	height
i used createmask h to create a mask and find the minimum coordinates for x and y to be starting point and max-min for each dimension to be the width and height and the negative images as far as i know are just images without any setup needed

22583091
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
if you alreay have an arrays of string s you can just loops over them with a enhanced for-loop

22583106
min	max
algorithm in gaming is the min max algorithm basically a player looks ahead to evaluate the state of the game resulting from every possible sequence of events and chooses the move such as to maximize their chances of winning

22583221
disk	ram
as far as i know the session is stored in ram and thus should be faster than serialize the objects to disk to achieve persistence

22583227
nginx	lighttpd
you can try nginx or lighttpd

22583231
jobs	cron
this is in a codeigniter controller that s only used for cron jobs

22583260
setinterval	settimeout
i m guessing some of your settimeout code might be getting in the way of one of the setinterval loops but that s just a guess

22583260
setinterval	settimeout
if that s the issue try naming the anonymous fn you passed into setinterval and then pass it into settimeout instead with 5000 ms wait and another call recursive to the same function at when the interval expires

22583279
width	height
you can give height and width according to your need

22583288
for-loop	loops
if you don t want to include the last character in your vowel counting then use a for-loop instead of a for each loops and stop 1 character short

22583292
client-side	server-side
you will need to learn about client-side and server-side

22583297
filtering	grouping
....so in last case doesn t follow how to filtering then...because regex grouping capture like

22583320
free	malloc
the glibc diagnostic is related to the fact that str doesn t always point to a memory segment allocated by malloc which is one of the requirements of free

22583320
free	malloc
the valgrind diagnostics are there because of the fact that without your currently malfunctioning usage of free the memory allocated by malloc inside repl is never released and hence

22583328
keydown	keyup
okay figured it out you had the word on in your reference to the keyup and keydown handlers also you need a tabindex on the div so it can receive focus and the events can propagate from it

22583330
free	malloc
you free what you malloc that is all

22583330
free	malloc	free	realloc	realloc	malloc
calling free on memory that was not allocated by malloc or realloc invokes undefined behavior

22583367
post	get
i set up the following query for get 10 post with the relative comments

22583392
qtextedit	qcompleter
making a qtextedit the parent of a qcompleter only affects the ownership hierarchy it does not mean that the qcompleter must start processing text for the qtextedit

22583392
qcombobox	qtextedit	qcombobox	qcompleter	qtextedit	qcompleter
in fact qcompleter does not function as an autocompleter for qtextedit it only works for qlineedit and qcombobox and you use the setcompleter function of those two classes to start the autocompletion

22583426
mouse	keyboard
i tried using a java mouse listener and keyboard listener and faking events

22583428
range	minimum
the user must set the minimum and maximum of the t range as well as a scalar u

22583439
google-chrome	firefox
it seems that when i try to use this function i keep getting segment is not defined in google-chrome canary but neither firefox works

22583450
interpolation	splines
it s important to use the splines option otherwise your data will be interpolation using all the data points rather than only the neighboring ones

22583453
range	minimum
i don t understand why you re using e0 and e1 as the limits of the range where the minimum should be found

22583487
multiplying	multiplication
if you multiplying it s the usual behaviour for matrix-scalar multiplication

22583489
hash	md5
you can calculate the md5 hash for example for the process name using the md5 computehash method like this

22583575
hide	show
i have set up notifications for when the keyboard show hide in a keyboard listener singleton

22583586
ant	maven
i ve never used maven or ant and would like to know if it can be done with these tools

22583644
put	get
for small config files put those in project_dir src main resources and they will get built into your final .jar file

22583644
ant	maven
ant maven are the major java build tools

22583653
portrait	landscape
what i want to happen is when the user clicks the image it full screens to its original size whether that be portrait or landscape

22583653
portrait	landscape
it seems to stretch the image too much and if its a landscape image it will just stretch it portrait anyway

22583674
int	double
the problem is because math.sqrt double a returns a double and you are trying to set the result to be an int

22583683
int	double
you are getting cannot convert from double from int because

22583683
int	double
is producing a double which you are trying to set to an int

22583718
button	checkbox
i have a bunch of checkbox and i m trying to get a de select all button working for them

int	chars
id int name chars 20 gpa dec

22583816
jlabel	jlayeredpane
first i create my imageicons then i add those imageicons to jlabel and then i add that jlabel to the jlayeredpane and then add the jlayeredpane to a jpanel

22583816
jlabel	jlayeredpane
i have tried using the setsize setbounds methods as well as any other method i could find to size my jlabel before adding them to the jlayeredpane and i can never get my images to display let alone be layered on top of each other

22583860
pop-up	dialog
i just want to get rid of the dialog pop-up so users aren t confused

22583884
jndi	jta
i am getting confused about the way to configure spring s jta jndi with weblogic

22583931
width	height
in interface builder you can control drag from a view to itself and you ll get aspect ratio as one of the options width and or height are also options depending on the direction you drag

22583941
udp	tcp
only when packets can be discarded unordered can udp be faster than tcp

22583969
laravel	cakephp
however laravel doesn t seem to like the config it came with or what i used for cakephp and i haven t found a solution yet

22583970
matlab	simulink
i wrote an app to do that on arduino and also i wrote some functions in matlab to read these sensors and to control the output but i want to use simulink to implement a fuzzy logic controller the input is the values of sensors and the output is the speed

22583986
range	min
the built-in excel function min works like this in fact - you can pass in multiple arguments including range or arrays and it looks through all of them to find the smallest individual value

22584016
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome it works as you would expect

22584105
installation	upgrade
the assertion that this developer cannot create anything useable without an upgrade to win7 installation of a special development environment and the like doesn t sit well with me

22584107
setinterval	settimeout
you probably do need to make one drawing loop with settimeout setinterval or with requestanimationframe - i recommend the latter and compute all your next frame logic there

22584140
configure	libtool
in 2.0.11 build system there is an explicit flag to configure --with-libltdl-prefix which i think tells the build system where libtool is installed

22584162
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i see the same problem in google-chrome safari and firefox

22584169
spaces	delimiter
you need to specify files to compile spaces delimiter if multiple

22584173
width	margin
i ve been trying to make a form where the elements are all the same width after padding and margin are factored in

22584197
tiff	png
i found many image processing haskell libraries and juicypixels looks simple enough and supports reading from tiff and saving to many other formats including png

22584197
tiff	png
so my question is how do i stream the image converted with juicypixels from tiff to png directly without saving it into a file first

22584198
post	get
i am able to get the flow execution key without issue but when i post it along with the required fields i get no output at all

22584213
division	modulo
i ve been searching for quite a while for a way to cast the pointer to an int or another way to perform a modulo or division remainder operation on the pointer address stored in a variable

22584230
qlist	qmap
in the code qt i use the data structure in qt like qmap qlist other than those in stl so the swig may not recognize them and neither some other macros in qt

22584237
rar	zip
trying to apply tablecellrenderer to column.i need to have three different icons for folders zip rar files and others

22584244
for-loop	arrays
i know i need to use for-loop to check the arrays but how.

22584245
int	chars
ie id int id int name chars 20 gpa dec would work with the backreference in the sense that id int id int would become part of the same match

22584258
pop-up	dialog
select menu with are converted into either pop-up or dialog depending on screen s height and number of options

22584269
udp	tcp
qemu has to set up this translartion for you so it all looks seamless for tcp udp traffic

22584341
g++	gcc
then when you compile in either gcc or g++ it will report symbols missing in the .c files

22584341
g++	gcc
anyway this solved my problem and the code compiles cleanly under both gcc and g++ now

22584409
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
i ve tried changing the width and the height of all the images no margin padding in the table and the cells

22584455
stdout	stderr
since grep reads from stdin we need to make sure we redirect stderr to stdout

22584458
post	get
when i press the register button on my register page the page refreshes and the submitted parameters appear in the url of the page as if devise is submitting the form using get as opposed to post

22584459
internationalization	localization
i followed the pyramid guide on internationalization and localization

22584466
hide	show
example when i click first r.id.search then show edittext then when i click r.id.search again then edittext hide

22584509
mouseover	mousemove	mouseover	mouseup	mouseover	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown
as documented in the safari web content guide certain changes made to the document in a mouseover or mousemove handler will prevent mousedown mouseup and click events from firing on the element

22584515
width	height
i can remove the scale and force the frame layout width and height to 28dp for example and in this way it works fine but i m not sure if this is the best practice to do

22584515
screens	tablet
for example in this way in a tablet with a big screens maybe the images will be a little big bigger because i m using dp but not of the right size

22584519
children	parent
use clone 2 with clone_vm in flags and a valid child_stack argument instead of using fork 2 so that the children share the same memory space as the parent

22584565
iboutlet	ibaction
i declared 2 ibaction rightbuttonpress and leftbuttonpress i linked them to 2 iboutlet and ran a block of code in the ibaction

22584578
int	chars
you can use format to covert it to a chars string 20080101 then convert that to an int or numeric

22584582
post	get
edit getparameter string is for post request but you perform a get request

22584583
punctuation	words
replace words only if there is a space after it or punctuation

22584588
width	height
you can create an object by passing the height and width into the constructor

22584588
width	height
that works and all because you are using the instance variables for that specific object s height and width to calculate it

22584588
width	height
but if you tried to call the getarea method that doesn t have parameters would give you an error because it wouldn t know what height and width to use because they haven t been defined yet

22584607
interpreted-language	compiled-language
the reason we mention compiled-language is that certain interpreted-language where the code is parsed as it is executed could conceivably incur a modest speed penalty just due to parsing but even in those types of languages the effect would likely be completely negligible compared to whatever else the code itself is doing

22584643
integer	unsigned
it is an unsigned integer type big enough to hold any pointer to data

22584663
google-chrome	firefox
this works as intended in google-chrome and ie but not in firefox

22584682
nsstring	nsdata
to get the nsstring from the nsdata you do

22584684
hide	show
you use methods hide show without

22584689
superclass	subclassing
you should only call private or final methods from constructors otherwise you risk someone possibly you overriding that method in a subclassing and then the subclassing method will be called from the superclass constructor before the subclassing is initialized

22584754
getter	setter
the advantage of this method is that it preserves the normal behavior for all attributes except those that have getter and setter methods and that it doesn t require any modifications of the __getattr__ and __setattr__ functions when you add or remove properties

22584767
apache	nginx
you could stand up an nginx apache server in front of s3 - -

22584787
hide	show
to hide those elements previously show use a class to identify the relevant elements select those with that class and hide them all

22584826
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
everything works as expected in safari google-chrome and opera on mac but on firefox mac the behaviour is as described above

22584832
division	modulo
there is no built-in solution to do this in o 1 time only in o n time by getting the element s index in the uniformgrid s children collection by searching for it and then applying division and modulo operators in combination with the uniformgrid s columns property

22584834
extjs	smartgwt
gwt extjs not-sencha and smartgwt to name a few are both wrappers around js libs and the gwt compiler won t pick the bits from the external js lib that you happen to use

22584835
folder	directory
i ve put my laravel folder in this directory

22584847
post	put
when you showing all post in the href you can put like this

oncreate	ondestroy
i ve read that on orientation change ondestroy is called followed by oncreate

22584873
armadillo	openblas
on ubuntu 12.04 i installed openblas using the package manager and built the armadillo library from the source

22584880
post	get
if possible handling standard http verbs get post ... for that

22584906
int	chars
i figure this number ought to fit within a one-byte int a chars 0-255

22584908
build.gradle	gradlew
i resolved that with some gradlew code in my build.gradle

22584923
folder	directory
i would suggest putting all of those files folder in a public directory and using this code

22584945
int	chars
if you mean your format string is c this is an ascii chars not a one byte int

22584963
matlab	s-function
if you wrote the functions for matlab in c you can put your code in an s-function whether it is for sensor input or actuator output

22584963
s-function	simulink
otherwise either use embedded m file or s-function in your simulink model

22585034
action-filter	onactionexecuting
action-filter allow you to selectively override your controller s onactionexecuting method

22585035
put	get
get your booknames first because you want to know those as you read the usernames - then you can put all the data straight into the final dict with fewer intermediate lists

22585041
superclass	subclassing
the method is in a superclass while it is being called in the subclassing

22585041
superclass	subclassing
also when i copy the decision method from the superclass into the subclassing its starts working but the next time it is called it stops

22585041
put	get
when i put the decision method into the sub class it passes the first two but it fails to get past the first one in the battle method for the same reason

22585044
mouseup	mousedown
i want each mode to subscribe to different mouse events selection is mousedown mouse move mouseup

22585061
getter	setter	public	protected
leave the field private and create a pair of protected getter setter methods instead for the same reasons you wouldn t expose a public field

22585109
virtualenv	setuptools
setuptools pip and virtualenv were installed after that

22585113
spaces	delimiter
using dot and spaces as delimiter the second token will be the sequence-number

22585114
free	malloc
for pod types that don t have destructors you can allocate with malloc instead of new so that the caller can just use free

free	malloc
sometimes you may want to cast a const pointer to a non-const pointer -- to pass the parameter to free if the free call is not in the exact same scope as the malloc one

22585135
int	double
so for example if a user enters a string double or other primitive type other than an int the loop will exit

22585136
int	chars
for function parameters the compiler will generate code that passes chars s as int s otherwise the stack will become unaligned which generates a fault on most platforms and severly slows down the machine on most others

22585136
int	chars
for most arithmetic operations on chars s the compiler will be forced to do int promotion extend chars to int do the operation and truncate the result

my understanding of the following code was that it would pop-up a new file choosing dialog forever until the user clicked cancel or some error occurred

22585596
pop-up	dialog
it appears however that the dialog only pop-up the first time and the code fails second time through the loop

22585602

22585632
box-sizing	border-box
consider box-sizing border-box if that is the case

22585654

22585703
g++	gcc
at that point as pointed out elsewhere gcc g++ will work but it s not actually gcc but clang in disguise

22585718
std	ostream
the reason it doesn t work without that is because that s the header that actually defines std ostream and all those useful functions

22585718
std	ostream
the reason it doesn t freak out and complain about no definition for std ostream or other the operators is because of forward declaration

22585718
std	ostream
those other headers you were including were likely forward declaring std ostream but never giving a full definition for it and all the operators

22585720
getter	setter
a solution is to pass mainform to gameform by reference and use getter and setter in mainform where necessary

22585721

sorting	grouping
sitenote on mssql this will not work mysql will pick the first result in case of an ambigious grouping without defining an aggregation on other columns which is defined by our sorting done prior - mssql will throw an error

22585811
sorting	grouping
finally it will grouping by id and picking the first row due to grouping and the first row of each grouping is what we need - due to sorting 2014-03-23 00 00 00 and newest message as the result

22585811
sorting	grouping
that s because an aggregation on that column is missing and mssql has no implicit sorting on this because both values are matching the grouping by criteria

22585813

22586534
jar	war
these jar can find in local maven path but can t package in the war

22586556
int	double
basically because if you interpret the bits that make up a small int as if they were a double it looks like the double value for 0

22586556
int	double
whereas if you interpret the bits that represent a small double value as an int it looks like something more interesting

22586556

width	height
for example uilabel has a preferred height based on the font and a preferred width based on the font and the text it displays

22599070
width	height
a uiprogressview only has a preferred height based on its artwork but no preferred width

22599070
width	height
a plain uiview has neither a preferred width nor a preferred height

22599074

22599190
width	height
you could use that in conjunction with a limited width height of a div or span and then follow that with your read more link

22599190
width	height
the link would need to do nothing more than change the width height perhaps with an animation if you want

22599194
gridbaglayout	boxlayout
maybe a boxlayout or gridbaglayout

22599203
tablet	galaxy	screens	tablet
on my lg nexus 4 vanilla android this renders the video and the controls correctly play pause full screens etc though when viewing on a samsung galaxy s4 and also a nexus 10 touchwiz tablet the controls are displayed as red boxes as in the screens shot below

22599220
width	height
i basically do as the answers above however i go ahead and set the width and height directly so that i don t have to worry about if it is set correctly or not of course i would also need to check if there were using an iphone4 for a complete solution

22599257
cpu	processors
i can get this value from sysconf _sc_nprocessors_onln but there is also a line for cpu cores and each processors has 2

22599257
processors	hyperthreading
i believe this represents the logical processors or hyperthreading that is accounted for

22599257
range	max	affinity	processors
i m not clear on this because if i go to proc pid status theres the line cpus_allowed_list and that can range from 0-7 8 processors total but i also wrote a script to call taskset -c -p pid for every pid running and this shows every process of having an affinity list of 0-3 max

22599264
apache	nginx
i m contemplating replacing nginx with apache camel to take advantage of its powerful mediation and integration patterns

22599269
lxml	beautifulsoup

put	get
as sirdemon mentioned you can sometimes get away with no background event page at all if you put everything into a browser action s popup

22599411

short variables are normally 16 bits but unfortunately java doesn t have unsigned primitive types so i m using the 15 lower bits instead ignoring the sign bit

22599456
int	chars
i need to read those lines and parse them into three different categories name which is an array of chars mileage int and years int

22599478

22599498
comparator	comparable
using comparator or comparable interfaces

22599546
awt	swing
be forewarned that it may be a long slog though -- awt swing event dispatching can get pretty complex

22599888
post	put
second sorry i asked this a few days ago but was not thinking right at the time and my post was put on hold or something

22599920
affinity	hyperthreading
for another example a core s ram bandwidth might be the bottleneck causing the process to get no benefit from hyperthreading and using affinity to preventing the process from using both logical cpus in each core can improve performance

22599951
icmp	tcp
you d have to open up icmp - blindly trying to open tcp 22 isn t going to do anything

22600011
google-chrome	firefox

22600199
google-chrome	firefox
it works like charm in ie and firefox but the behavior in google-chrome is very weird which makes me think i have done something wrong in the coding part

22600237
width	height
input #field to maintain a constant height and change width to fit the width of div #chat keeping in mind the greater than symbol positioned to its left

22600237
width	height
div #content to be the same width as input #field and take up the remaining height

22600267
implements	extends
i have an abstract class and a class which extends it and implements the methods without adding further methods of its own

22600268
google-chrome	firefox
i know that this is an issue in both google-chrome and firefox on mac not sure about windows

22600337
subclass	abstract-class
jsonfactory is an abstract-class so you need to use the subclass gsonfactory to provide an implementation

22600445
mvp	presenter
in this notion each polymer element is it s own mvp system element properties are the model element methods are the presenter and the dom is the view

22600448

22601229
cout	cin
using std cin and std cout

22601229
cout	cin
using std cin and std cout with std cout.sync_with_stdio false

put	get
if i get a chance to update this with the std istream get and put methods i will but honestly i don t expect any miracles on that

22601265
post	put
the problem is that you are using a http put request instead of a post request to add your data to the sesame repository

22601276
serializable	deserialization
initially the projects that contained the serializable and deserialization shared a project with dtos in it so the deserialization was able to use the same assemblyqualifiedname for the type

22601297
restrict	shared
it will usually survive reboots and could be placed on a distributed file system whereas shared memory is restrict to a single machine

22601319

hide	show
i am also able to hide show other elements during other phases of the application and if i put the same hide show requests into the onload routine then they work fine

22601712
width	height
so the position 1 remains 0 instead of having the value height width

22601712
width	height
but it s true that i should change width and height - since i had only square images it didn t matter so far

22601739
google-chrome	safari
but if you load the browser in safari on iphone or on google-chrome in android it renders eye-bleed small as if desktop client

22601745
ssl	https
of course these numbers depends on many factors such as computer performance connection speed server load qos on path the particular network path taken from browser to the server but it shows the general idea https is slowser then http since it requesres more operations to complete ssl handshake and encoding decoding data

22601748
int	chars
eof is typically an int not a chars and it does not have the same value as any valid chars

22601776
int	chars	getchar	fgetc
the value returned by fgetc and getc and getchar is an int and not a chars

22601776
int	chars
it has to be an int because the set of values that can be returned includes every possible value of a chars and one extra value eof which is negative whereas the chars are all positive

22601783
width	height
like if your button is of 100.0 width and 100.0 height then set cornerradius 50.0

22601867
width	height
make sure that your button s width and height are same and type should be custom

22601910

getc	gets
standard c f gets and f getc are not required to set errno although a conforming library implementation can set errno to a non-zero value pretty much at will

22601986
for-loop	loops
i know the inner for-loop has to complete before the outer-loop can loops again

22602075
oncreate	setcontentview
now you will have to override default super class function i.e oncreate bundle savedinstancestate and simply add setcontentview r.layout.activity_calculator

22602105
google-chrome	firefox
combined quick benchmark on google-chrome and firefox gave a 30-40 increase in speed

22602111

for-loop	loops
inside inner for-loop you increment l++ for each loops which up to 500 while binchar size is only 98

22602712
maven	pom.xml
besides the maven-android-sdk-deployer if you always have android sdk installed with google extras like me you can define a local repository in your projects pom.xml file and let maven download the dependencies from this local one

22602719
pull	push
if you add and push new commits on the initial branch you made a pr from then that pr would be automatically updated as i explain in couple of tips for pull requests

22602768
google-chrome	firefox
unfortunately it s not cross browser in google-chrome raise 2 events for time in firefox don t raise event.

22602771
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
instead of while loops use for-loop in which loops continue till your arrays lenght so syntax is like

22602813
post	get
try this you can use count to get the no of post

i also made sure the binding in my vm is ok and the getter and setter are being called correctly

22603097
width	margin
you first define the width of image description and status...then you give padding or margin then you give float left

22603121
post	get
post int as part of method but get no http resource was found that matches the request uri error

22603130
allocator	stl
note however that std vector manages itself the memory for the contained elements and therefore you ll need to use stl allocator if you want to control where the memory it needs is coming from

22603132
png	ico
or if the ico is in png format you could extract the png bytes out directly from the middle of the ico file and then call the appropriate bitmapfactory.decode method

regression	anova
anova regression and main effects interactions plots are possible by the following code with doe.base and frf2 packages

22603295
factors	mean
the regression coefficients are one-half the corresponding factors effect estimates because a regression coefficient measures the effect of a one-unit change in x on the mean of y and the effect estimate is based on a two-unit change from -1 to +1

22603613
post	get
the steps towards getting secure without knowing your technology stack would be to get an ssl certificate for the origin and destination of your post request if you don t have control of the destination your journey ends here but head over to one of the hundreds of ssl certificate providers available i usually use start ssl because it s free and pretty good

22603615

22603642
width	height
instead of setting the height and width of the chart manually why don t you leave it to set automatically according to the content and set the below

22603642
width	height
as you add the above code do not set the height and width of the chart

22603654
getter	setter
you can use the same code for removealledges as long as it does not depend on the underlying structure the matrix or the list or the functionality is implemented by encapsulated methods that use the underlying graph structure getter setter and other common methods that you may need

when an application is run from the command line output to stderr and stdout probably gets merged into out stream somewhere in the os kernel

22633980
for-loop	arrays
there are other troubles with this kind of check in the for-loop when retrieving an element from an arrays because if an index for which you are returning the element is than the length of the arrays you will get an indexoutofboundsexception

22633987
implements	extends
the basic idea is that in your different platform specific projects you would implements an inputadapter for example desktopcontroller extends inputadapter

22633998

switching	screens
i ve created a fragment for every screens of my activity i want to use one activity and switching screens using fragments

22634283
switching	screens
in most app scenarios only a few fragments should be available at any point for example the first screens the user should get is the login fragment which should not allow switching to the next fragment using a swiping forward

22634305
put	get
hashmap has a put not push and you can get around 1000 to 10000 of these in a mill-second

22634411

versioning	upgrade
the best option is to upgrade to a versioning of nunit that supports async unit tests and change all result wait calls to await

22634526
multiplication	exponent
multiplication with a power of 2 changes the exponent part of the floating point number and leaves the mantissa bits unchanged see also the earlier comment by david hammen

pypdf	reportlab
python using reportlab and pypdf is able to place code39 barcodes into documents

22634754
pypdf	reportlab
you will need python with reportlab and pypdf the last two being python libraries

22634769
rvm	bundler
i say think because it seems to be related with a misconfiguration concerning rvm and bundler

22634769
rvm	bundler
bundler was installing my gems in vendor bundle and not using those from the rvm gemset

22634769
rvm	bundler
what i did was to tell bundler to use those gems from rvm and then since nokogiri was already installed it worked

22634786
ubuntu	linux
tested on linux ubuntu 12.01 with log4cxx 0.9.7

what i didn t realize was that i had a static folder in one of my apps and when i ran collectstatic it copied that screen.css file into the static root directory

22635023
processors	hyperthreading
if hyperthreading enabled for the processors you getting 12 virtual cores

22635024

assuming that the link_url can be larger than the 767 byte limit for an innodb table you didn t say what engine you are using then change the id column to contain a md5 hash of the link_url with a unique index

22635082
put	get
while i m not going to go through and decide which city goes on which side for every comparison which would get crazy the more cities that were added i would like to have control over some of them in order to put the city with the more desirable characteristics on the left side of the page where it will be seen first assuming individuals are reading left to right

22635115
google-chrome	safari
however after a bit of testing i discovered that at least the latest versions of google-chrome and safari ignore both the target and onclick attributes and just open the submit action in a new tab

22635279
width	height
the above computed degree when put in the following code -- shaperenderer.rect x y width height 0 0 abdegree

22635292
hide	show
idea is to hide the text when edit is clicked and show textbox and vice-versa on click of delete

22635354
express	node.js
you will see the term mean stack sometimes here for mongodb db express template engine for node.js angularjs frontend framework and node.js server all programmable in javascript

22635392
hide	show
then you show one view and hide the rest as necessary

22635393
for-loop	loops
that is one of the reason when people generally prefer for-loop over while loops because in while loops some time we forget to modify the counter variable and some time we forget to initialize variables

22635393
for-loop	loops
in for-loop initialization condition test and modification performed in the same place so the error that we generally commit in while will not perform in for-loop else their is no any other advantages of for-loop over while loops

22635394
put	get	post	get	post	put
allows http methods such as get post put delete to be applied to not only an ip address but to a port within an ip address

22635394

allows me to issue get put post del requires to a uri that represents a port

22635429
getter	setter
the my legacy class provides setter getter for this

22635434
children	parent
so first you have to clear that these buttons are not direct children of parent layout

22635434
children	parent
in parent layout only have two children a and b

22635434
children	parent
then multi touch will not work on layout a and layout b but it will work on every button b1 b2 b3 b4 because these are not direct children of parent layout

22635477
hide	show
after clicking a li item i want to check if there is anything show hide it by sliding it to the left and perform another action but only if first function was performed

22635553
woocommerce	shopp
i used the woocommerce for shopp cart

22635558
min	max
i have a table with a min and max field

22635558
range	max	range	min	min	max
the table is filled with 200 records that all contain a range from those min and max values

22635621
min	max
creating an index on both the min and max columns should improve the performance

22635669
config	ini
writing a script to convert winscp ini config file to filezilla xml config file should not be that difficult

22635712
uiview	subviews
the squares are created as subviews on a uiview

22635712
touchesbegan	touchesended
from what i read i have to have touchesbegan touchesended etc calls in my uiview to handle these

a mouse click is not calling the touchesbegan touchesended calls on any view

22635714
hide	show
i want to show hide a panelgroup depending on the option chosen in a selectonemenu

22635717

salt	md5
i would like to convert the old passwords + salt to a single md5

22635758
google-chrome	safari
works fine in safari google-chrome

22635777
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to a compatible jackson versioning 2.3.0 or better

22635789
min	max
my guess is that the performance of this on such a small table is pretty much the same with an index on minmax min or minmax min max

22635792
width	height
it s important to set the corresponding width height to 0dp

22635793
disk	ram
the hardware is intel q6600 2.40ghz 4gb ram and 7200rpm disk so it is normally ok for most testing purposes

22635834
hash	md5
since you don t have the password and a hash is purposefully not reversible you cannot get the single md5 value

22635883
bash	zsh
note that process group will be changed if you are creating process under shell bash zsh etc. in that case more complicated technique should be used

22636017
width	height
the starting idea correct me if it s wrong poorly performance whatever would be to create a picture long in width and whit fixed height and upon the press of for example a or d keys the drawn character moves till a certain x point after that character gets locked in place and if the key is still pressed the background image starts moving

22636101
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in google-chrome and firefox but not ie

22636151
int	double
select.execute 1462 1477 int id std string const person double item1 float item2

22636173
getter	setter
i want to display some name in the select tag but i am not able to do that.i have setter and getter of type string

22636175
sorting	grouping
i had a similar issue and ended up building my own marker grouping class to handle sorting between people places and other objects

22636224
getter	setter
your case is the very reason for using setter and getter

22636247
min	max
just remove typerec from the group by and use min or max

22636290
777	tmp	temp	tmp
i have a website and i have a temp directory tmp with permissions 777

22636321
rspec	capybara
i want to write a spec for it using rspec and capybara

22636323
picasso	universal-image-loader	picasso	android-query	android-query	universal-image-loader
to accomplish a smooth scrolling i ve tried different configurations and options in universal-image-loader did not help except the delay option a bit and i ve tried android-query fast but on scroll images vanished and appeared again even with a placeholder set and urlimageviewhelper fast but i could not set a drawable as a placeholder in case of no network connection so i ended up with picasso the fastest from those four i ve tested hence a smooth scrolling

22636385
google-chrome	firefox
i have my add-on for google-chrome just built.i m not sure of the terminology in firefox development

22636388

22636391
cobertura	jenkins
in jenkins profile there is a build configuration with a cobertura and sonar plugin

22636444
harfbuzz	freetype
on my opinion the best way in yours case build harfbuzz and freetype separately from qt

22636469
width	height
i ve a custom imageview that is changing it s size depending on what is bigger - width or height of layout that contains this view

22636490
width	height
when you open popup window you should remember current window scrollleft scrolltop positions somewhere then apply overflow hidden height width 100 to html and body which will prevent page scrolling

22636490
width	height
create overlay div with position absolute z-index 9999 left top 0 height width 100 overflow auto and append it to body - it will be scrollable container of your popup

22636490
width	height
after you close popup restore overflow height width styles for html body and apply scrollleft scrolltop values that were saved before opening popup

22636543
int	boolean
case class status success boolean code int message string

22636569
button	checkbox
so i am trying to make a userform where if both checkbox are marked the button will be allowed to be clicked

int	chars
in gcc ubuntu 12 .04 following code is the program which i need to understand for the concept of size of int chars and float pointer

22636727
pop-up	dialog
what i want to happen is for the dialog box to pop-up then the user will input x values y values etc and once the user clicks okay the second application will do calculations on these variables and then give an output

22636727
pop-up	dialog
the first thing to pop-up when the combined project runs is simply a dialog box and once the user clicks ok something that looks like this should appear

22636740
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
this works perfectly under safari google-chrome firefox their mobile versions and android s stock browser

22636747
getter	setter
as the title says there has always been quite a discussion about getter and setter in any programming language so also java

22636747
getter	setter
an example of an already existing argument is that getter and setter encapsulate state or that they make it possible to change the implementation without changing the api

22636748
getter	setter
also keep in mind that this answer differs from someone claiming that if an object needs to adhere to a certain interface that then getter and setter must be used

22636790
decoder	encoder
when i am using delimiterbasedframedecoder with stringdecoder and encoder its working fine but if i use rtsprequest response encoder decoder i am getting following warning and no msg will be sent to l555. also same with httpreq resp encoder and decoder

22636798
width	height
i have a function to detect if an image intersects with a rectangle but a line shape doesn t have all the properties i need like width and height etc

22636869
queue	fifo
for instance on a slow connection if you are downloading in a fifo queue then if the user scrolls to the end of your collection view the images added first will hold up the queue and you won t see the images at the end until every other image is downloaded

22636906
setinterval	settimeout
note that i don t support the use of setinterval you better use settimeout

22636930
button	checkbox
i have it set up now as checkbox radio button so when one is chosen it reverts the other options to false

22636961
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
html5 s notification api allows you to display notification on almost any platform through firefox google-chrome or safari

22636961
google-chrome	firefox
also notice that open web apps and google s web app need respectively firefox or google-chrome to be installed

22636975
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

22636983
google-chrome	firefox
this doesn t seem like correct behaviour so i m guessing it may be a firefox bug especially as it is working fine in google-chrome

22637003
getter	setter
i think the easiest and imho most beautiful solution is to implement your cmp.message as getter setter and execute your function in the setter

22637023
hide	show
if i understood the goal of this component correctly the best way will be just to hide show it

22637063
aggregate-functions	sum
it could just as easily be sum avg or any other aggregate-functions

22637075
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i ve created an extension using kango-framework it works ok in google-chrome and opera 20 but when installing it on firefox 27 or 28 i get error aaddon._repositoryaddon is null

22637150
put	get	post	get	post	put
get requests works without problem but post put delete does not work

22637175
width	height	int	boolean
so i use bitmap.createbitmap bitmap b int x int y int width int height matrix m boolean filter to create a scaled bitmap

22637175
width	height
however if the ratio is equal to or greater than 1 the method returns a bitmap with the width and height i desire but without an image is transparent

22637196
gtkmm	glibmm
gtkmm glibmm and other -mm libraries currently still use the gmmproc tool to generate bindings for gobject-based libraries

22637277
google-chrome	safari
i ve tested on multiple different browser safari and google-chrome on the ipad and i have came to a conclusion that it is not a browser issue

22637281
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome this styling for the tag was ignored

22637306
getter	setter
this is the pojo i omited getter and setter

22637317
opera	firefox
i can t reproduce in firefox or opera

22637341
onresume	onpause	oncreate	ondestroy
i defined my ads in the xml layout files and initialized them in oncreate and added entries in onresume onpause and ondestroy

22637357
direct3d	direct2d
the wpf provides basic access to direct3d and direct2d and has 2d and 3d shapes and animations built into the framework and is what wpf is based on

22637428
folder	directory
last point for a make sure you have small.png located under public assets images directory as that s where paperclip would look for this folder structure

22637437
dumpsys	adb
the problem was made clearly apparent using the adb tool with command shell dumpsys meminfo my.package.com which listed my abundant font asset allocations

22637454
post	put
sorry my reputation is not enough to post a picture but the problem is that the program treats integer 11 and 45 as string and put them in different cell

22637464
google-chrome	firefox
the pdf download works in all the desktop browsers as well as the ipad google-chrome mobile and firefox mobile

22637468
int	double
i have a random value of x where x is a double potentially decimal value that is 0 x 20 and an incremental int value of y in a loop that for purposed of this question we will cap at 1000

22637491
jobs	cron
add edit cron jobs

22637547
contourf	imshow	seaborn	matplotlib
a thing i immediately liked about seaborn was that it set the matplotlib default color palette for images imshow pcolormesh contourf ... to a very good one i had not seen before black-blue-green-brown-pink-purple-white

22637547
versioning	upgrade
but when i upgrade the package from versioning 0.21 to 0.3 this default changed to some greyscale

22637585
try-catch	exception-handling
the following logic exists in all my functions do validate if validation fails i throw invalid exception-handling if passes i continue to the next try-catch and throw general-error in case of failure

22637643
many-to-one	one-to-many
the relationships between these are one-to-many and many-to-one respectively

22637654
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i am using google-chrome but it seems to work the same in firefox and safari too

22637678
ggplot2	aesthetics
ggplot2 treats x and y variables as aesthetics mappings between the data and the plot and that mapping almost always needs to be passed via aes or aes_string

22637696
google-chrome	firefox
but it is not reflecting on ie works on firefox and google-chrome

22637696
google-chrome	firefox
when i try to check in my debug in ie it is also not present but present for google-chrome and firefox

22637704
std	ostream
also an overloaded operator for std ostream works with cv mat if you would like just to display image elements

22637713
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox not in ie or google-chrome the throbber spins during the request

22637715
getter	setter
these are my pojos getter ans setter are omitted

22637813
for-loop	loops
try changing foreach loops to for-loop

22637821
aggregate-functions	sum
you cannot use an aggregate-functions sum on a reportitem

22637824
getter	setter
if you are using a localsessionfactorybean it has a hibernateproperties field of type properties with a corresponding getter and setter

22637834
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
if the length of both arrays emaillist nameslist is equal you should use a for-loop instead of a foreach loops

22638047
range	minimum
determine minimum and maximum value of your range it will be 0..81902 according to your example

22638050
post	get
i want to get post by id

22638062

i want to use a filter expression like values | filter value1 to hide or show a div where values and value are both declared on the scope in the containing directive s link function

22638104
getter	setter
with getter setter

22638170
folder	directory
the sites run ok if i just want to run them as dart only implementations but if i want to compile them to javascript i currently copy the sub folder out from my packages example directory and into a new packages folder web directory as i only know how to get dart build to compile the client side code to javascript if its in the web directory

22638182
implements	extends
you could implements memoization through extends the factorial function class overriding rather than delegating to the unmemoized apply

22638205
post	get
but i still get two build events - which also affects the post build event

22638240
getter	setter
if so you might be getting the error because you haven t written a setemail method for it or because you haven t declared the instance variable email as an property in which case the setter and getter methods for it would be synthesized automatically by xcode prior to xcode 4.something i think you need to synthesize your properties explicitly - after that version they re automatic

22638272
put	get	post	get	post	put
on a get put delete this makes sense although delete and get just use the id and not the dto on the request obviously but on the post it doesn t make sense as the new data being added has no id yet

22638429
filtering	grouping
is returning 3 because you re not filtering and grouping by mainhospital

22638442
jobs	cron
the databases are hosted on shared servers and can be restarted at anytime which mean cron jobs won t be persistent according to support at my web hosts

22638477
min	max
note also how the shading is alternated by specifying an actual variable in the data frame and then mapping fill to that variable and the trick of using inf and -inf to avoid the need for the actual max min y values

22638488
profiling	instrumentation
i have deployed a profiling version of the service using a release build and with instrumentation as the profiling method

22638491

junit	mockito
i m writing junit tests using mockito for a code that has been implemented by someone else

22638663
google-chrome	firefox
i m fighting whole day trying to find cause of strange memory leak which only exist in firefox 28 and only on windows 7 - google-chrome linux win 7 is fine as well as that same version of firefox for linux

22638682
hide	show
i m sure there are far better ways of doing the above but what i want to do is have a link preferably on each of the name lines that will show or hide the table that is displayed directly beneath it

22638694
getter	setter
however when i try to do the same thing in groovy the getter and setter are automatically generated

22638755

i am looking for a way to get the width and height of an image on the disk without loading the whole image into memory

22638755
bmp	png
i need to support bmp and png images

i have an interface where i want to define some getter and setter functions

22638890
google-chrome	firefox
i had the same issue in google-chrome and firefox

22638923
width	height
it would seem to be some bizarre quirk in chrome that you have to specify both a width and a height to get it to observe the dimensions set

22638923
width	height
if you only specify a height or a width then that single dimension is ignored

22638937
listview	gridview
if your problem is how to drive the contents of your popup with your view model - you can typically do that using a combination of itemscontrols such as listview gridview or maybe a custom one and contentcontrols with itemtemplateselectors or contenttemplateselectors that implement the logic of determining which view to display based on the view model state

22638940
width	height
i need to resize my images according to width only not height

22638940
width	height
codeigniter solves it automatically thats the problem sometimes i get a black solid as an extra width or height

22639063
width	height
for bmp read in bytes 18 through 21 to get the width and bytes 22 though 25 to get the height

22639063
width	height
bytes 16 through 19 would give the width and bytes 20 through 23 give the height

22639063
width	height
likewise for tga you could read the first 18 bytes with advised notes into a tga header struct and then dereference the struct instance s width and height properties

22639063
fseek	fread
within c++ you can use standard c i o fopen fseek and fread to open move and read bytes from a file pointer

22639114
move	drag
if the user presses and holds the ctrl key while dragging the form by the windows title bar the window is dropped and hidden a special drag token is created a different mini form and the drag token is captured and move with the mouse instead

22639118
accelerometer	gyroscope
i personally would suggest using accelerometer or the gyroscope

22639122
wildfly	jboss
in netbeans you just have to import the wildfly plugin but in eclipse you have to import all jboss tools plugins

22639281
for-loop	arrays
it s fine for the background but when i want to print the player instead of printing a bunch of asterisks in a square it prints them in a long line and then the only way to make it so it appears right is to when printing out the player arrays i have another for-loop below which prints out the rest of the console window s worth of x so in this case 70 characters of blank spaces but that is of course completely wrong and not even a proper solution

22639288
width	height
you can apply a fixed wrapper for the background image with 100 width height

22639334
post	get
recently i ve developed an application able to post to tumblr for the aouth flow implementation i ve used my own webview when i get the response to the token request i open a new activity with an embedded webview in order to enter the credentials in the webpage obtained

22639356
ubuntu	linux
but r studio server was only meant for ubuntu linux kind not windows

subclass	abstract-class
an anonymous inner class aic can be used to create a subclass of an abstract-class or a concrete class

22640485

you should extends this class or make it not abstract by implements interface if you want to instantiate it

22640510
filtering	grouping
i m having trouble with the syntax when it comes to filtering the grouping observable

22640531
folder	directory
for including folder that are up a directory you will want to use the .. directory path to mean parent directory

22640539
portrait	landscape
i ve got a primary viewcontroller which should remain portrait which launches a view that should auto-rotate to landscape left or right but never to portrait or upsidedown

22640568
filtering	grouping
you can use having clause to filtering your grouping

22640601
subclass	abstract-class
you can think of an interface as an abstract-class with only abstract methods where classes that subclass that abstract-class will need to override every method on that supertype this draws parallels to the override annotation on implemented interface methods though many will probably discourage this way of thought

22640618
getter	setter
i don t exactly understand how getter and setter work in c# for instance i have this code for a character in a game i m supposed to make for college

the benefit of having the property is that you can easily swap it out for a more conventional property with a backing field so that you can provide custom logic in the getter and or setter

22641048
move	drag
the drag is an operation that should start when the mouse is move and the left mouse button is down but it should not start right away to prevent accidentally started drag the systemparameters.minimumhorizontaldragdistance and systemparameters.minimumverticaldragdistance static members should be used

22641501
stdout	stderr
when running an external procss that prints anything to stdout stderr you should read what it writes - otherwise it will block once it s buffer fills up

22641501
stdout	stderr
you basically needs a thread to read from stdout and a thread to read from stderr of each process

22641510
for-loop	arrays
not too sure on foreach but for a for-loop if you are placing the results into an arrays you could

22641519

google-chrome	firefox
also if someone knows some common errors that happen when using ie that don t occur on google-chrome firefox that would be much appreciated

22641783
int	chars
so simply printing chars might not be the best way to debug chars values you might want to print the chars value as int

furthermore it is handier than google n-gram as for a given phrase it does not simply output its absolute frequency but it can output its joint probability conditional probability and even the most likely words that follow

22641947
serializable	deserialization
if you re just looking for a way to satisfy legacy serializable requirements without screwing up your locking mechanism i propose that you introduce a dummy non-static member to stand in for the lock object on serializable and deserialization

just for completeness the action of drawing the map should be performed after the page loads that is when the page has actual values for width and height and you can initialize it as follows

22642158
mouseleave	mouseenter
currently i tried with mouseenter and mouseleave functions but its not smooth

22642170
printf	strcmp
you are trying to print them as string s in printf and doing a strcmp too

because java uses the getter and setter pattern you likely won t be assigning a value to a member variable but calling a method which itself assigns the value

22642353
post	get
according to the following link it s a bug in the version of mono being used by unity that forces the struct enumerator to get boxed which seems like a reasonable explanation though i haven t verified through code inspection blog post discussing the boxing bug

filtering	grouping
ergo you cannot filtering the grouping by their count until the source stream is finished and you must consent to cache the results and then process them

there s also the imagecrop function which allows you to pass in an array with x y width and height values

22649686

22660986
hide	show
show hide checkbox what is the if condition to take this decision

22660986
hide	show
with this property and if the value is false then i cant determine whether to hide the checkbox or show it and uncheck the checkbox

22660986
hide	show
for eg for indian standard time i shouldn t show the checkbox for this if i have to rely on the property value then i would get it as false and i can hide it

22660986

draggable	droppable
there are many questions regarding draggable and droppable but the titles are not that self-explanatory and after checking around 20 questions i decided to publish my problem here

22661519
draggable	droppable
one can put multiple draggable .allocation on those droppable

22661519
draggable	droppable
when a draggable is dropped on a droppable the draggable gets appended to the droppable and repositioned to fit the top-left corner

22661525
getter	setter
a way to accomplish this in fairly modern browsers is using property getter setter spec

22661525

the form.aggregate property now has a getter and setter

22661529

post	get
i m creating mongodb records of what i get via these post and i need to record what keys i get storing any new ones i get that aren t already part of the collections keys

22661751
children	parent
so ideally i would end up with a hash of each parent key and its children keys and a separate hash for each of the top level parent

22661751
post	get
ultimately i need to be prepared to get hashes with any level of nesting or value structures because the post data is highly variable

22661759
express	node.js
i have ms sql server 2012 express on one end and a node.js web application on the other

22661774

width	height
to prevent the line being cut off by the edge of the canvas there is a gutter setting which pads the canvas width and height

22662087

to get the positions of the boxes in client coordinates you need to use elem.getboundingclientrect which yields left top width height among other things and i use to find the centre of a box

22662181
width	height
compute quadrangle vertices in the destination image by keeping aspect ratio here you can to take width of card from above quadrangle vertices of source and compute height by multiplying with aspect ratio

22662226
websphere	ibm
i know i made some authentication for ibm websphere but i cant get it working in zabbix

22662236
client-side	server-side
i think i was experiencing the same problem and resolved it through a combination of server-side stuff and client-side stuff

22662246
children	parent
this is because on parent .tabcontent-inner you need to put overflow auto property so that it will cover ups its children s height

22662262

if i use crypt to hash a password

22662264
svnkit	subclipse

22662299
min	max
if we care about just one weight per material and we can assume that all entries are always the same then we can cheat and use min or max eg

doing it chars by chars you can go straight into an int but you better make sure there isn t any non-number chars in your file and that there won t be

22662325
hash	salt
compute a hash on the password when you store it preferably a salt sha256 and then compare hash upon login

22662332

22662339
width	height
the third will scale the image to the largest size such that both its width and its height can fit inside the background area

22662361
post	get
to begin with why you have mentioned both type get and post in your ajax call

22662362
crypt	salt
the standard des-based crypt returns the salt as the first two characters of the output

22662397
hide	show
in order to show hide the checkbox you will need to check to see if the selected timezone supports dst and set its visibility then

22662403
hide	show
this because imagine if i have a menu with 20 items list them all to hide and or show is a bit polluted in the code imo so maybe there s a way to simplify this

22662419
width	height
then i m trying to give the divs width and height using percentages

22662420
libs	buildpath
when built with the latest xcode 5.1 ios sdk 7.1 and llvm 5.1 using libstdc++ for the c++ standard libs this crashes somewhere in the std string implementation on the return line from the buildpath function when run on an ios 5.1 device

22662425
capybara	minitest
however when i run my tests with minitest capybara i get the follow error

22662459
post	put
unlike the post request the put request requires to specify the content-length that you are going to send to the server

22662482
laravel	codeigniter
also routing in laravel is different with routing in codeigniter

22662743
onresume	onpause
i think about some flags on onstop onpause and onresume functions but i think it is not right way

22662808
onresume	onpause
the reccomended way is probably to do it onresume onpause like this

22662808
oncreate	ondestroy
ideally i would do it in oncreate and ondestroy but its stated that the activity is killable after onpause so the activity might get leaked if i interpret this correctly

22662843
rss	feed
parse a list of external rss feed

22662906
ubuntu	linux
i m using ubuntu linux 12.04 with the 3.11 kernel

22662924
google-chrome	safari
safari 7.0.2 9537.74.9 and google-chrome version 33.0.1750.152 make the local redirection when i drop the file on an inputfile field

22663184
nunit	mstest
mstest vs nunit

22663184
nunit	mstest
nunit has testcasesourceattribute which helps you to achieve parametrized test cases but in mstest you ll need datasourceattribute which would be in xml file and will be difficult to manage when you have complex logic in method

22663184
nunit	mstest
nunit is faster as compared to mstest

22663209
popover	tooltip
bootstrap tooltip and popover add extra size in table

22663241
leaflet	rmaps
btw rmaps is just an interface for r and leaflet if you want to create real crazy stuff you should get used to open the html file and add java script code from the leaflet api people created amazing plugins much more that just adding polygons for cool examples see

22663241
rcharts	rmaps
just to add some additional info of how rmaps works that s also true for rcharts

22663241
leaflet	rmaps
all that rmaps does is to create the javascript code the build of the map is done by your web browsr which means that if you will go to the library that rmaps is installed and copy it to another computer without r the html file will run perfectly so that means you can create a rmap and then add any other elements from the leaflet api that are not supported by rmaps manually in the html file just as i explained i showed how to do it for circle

22663247
width	height
and now we can use the id in an iframe adjust width and height per embed options in youtube

free	malloc
but i tried to look from memory corruption scenario and found that your program does have malloc free call which might lead to memory overrun

22663365
cpu	processors
none of them provides you with true low level control over threading but for example tpl if can splits your task among different cores of your cpu and finds in general best possible way of paralleling your task on multi-core modern processors so tends to be faster and more lightweight

for the header and footer you can set the width to 560px then set the left position to 50 then give it a negative left margin equal to half the width -280px

22663567
filtering	grouping
the first route will catch request and route to the getlogin function before the filtering grouping

so i generated a new profile in tilemill using the scale property but when exporting in mapnik xml format the tiles are not rendered with bigger texts like shown in tilemill workspace - seems like the export is writing the font sizes for scale-factor 1

oh also not using maven just straight eclipse ant--i can deal with the ant part it s just the eclipse integration that s being probleematic

22667513
google-chrome	firefox
you can force the file to download instead of opening which will not change the behavior for google-chrome ie but in firefox will stop it from opening in the browser and download it as a file

22667576
width	height
also save the images starting width and height needed for proportional scaling

22667582

width	height
and that will make all of your images responsive which will also fill their containers up to 100 of the original image width and resize the height to maintain the aspect ratio

22667739
width	height
for example one popular sidebar images widget hardcodes the width and height into an inline style a horrendous practice and i hope they stop it

22667747
versioning	upgrade
just upgrade to the latest versioning of unobtrusive library from package manager and it worked

22667760

if height and width are always going to be a percentage i might even replace the percentage values so that your code won t have to convert a string to a number

22667798

and serialization works perfectly on fields no getter and setter

22667964
getter	setter
but i have also one getter without a field and setter which must be camelcase

22667966
hide	show
you have a static object that you want to show or hide based on another object

22667966

rubygems	rvm
with rvm don t use sudo with the gem command since it will use the system rubygems

22668003
int	double
from the above we understand that when we allocate memory to pointer p which is a double pointer it is pointing to an array of int so in this example we see that the 0x1000 is pointer p

22668003
for-loop	arrays
this pointer is pointing to integer pointer p which is arrays of integers when memory is allocated inside the inner for-loop during first iteration the pointer is 0x100 which is pointing to integer value 1 when we assign p j

22668003
int	double
before the next iteration of the outer loop double pointer is incremented inside the next iteration as is seen in this example the pointer is now at 0x1004 and is pointing to int pointer which is an array of int 4 5 6 and similarly for the next iterations in the loop

my first thought is to include all three images and use media min max widths to make two of them invisible at any given size

22668550

cv_16uc1 has unsigned short as an underlying type so you probably need

22668555
folder	directory	google-chrome	firefox
i recently purchased a new macbook pro 10.8 os and installed mamp 3.0 not mamp-pro but i have been searching the web on how to display all files when viewing a folder within the htdocs directory such as htdocs stackoverflow via the browser google-chrome or firefox

22668555
google-chrome	firefox
so just to be clear if i have a directory under htdocs htdocs foobar filled with several .php files i want to be able to view them in the sub-directory of htdocs instead of a blank browser tested within google-chrome and firefox

22668570

body width x height of 600 x 800 pixels

22668792
width	margin
the width of the 3 elements will each be 598 pixels the margin will be 0 pixels and the border will be 1 pixel so that they fit perfectly inside the body

22668811
put	get
my opinion is that if you want to be sure that you get 10 random numbers once you generate one random number put it in a list or something similar and for other ones just check if it is in the list if it isn t insert it there if it is generate another one

22668813

serializable	deserialization
i think you should do this within your json serializable and deserialization

22668897
hash	salt
but a hash will always give you a string of a set length that is also unique so in php for example e-mail addresses also work but you should salt anything remotely personal

this correspondence is broken if such a properties is deleted and then redefined or if the properties is changed into an accessor properties

22668989
strtol	atoi
it s not safe to use atoi use strtol instead

22669006
crypt	salt	crypt	hash	hash	salt
the reason is because the salt is part of the output of the hash that crypt provides

22669006
hash	salt
this results in the nice property of just being able to use the result hash directly as the salt in the verification call

22669009

so far my code can find the palindrome but when i check for a primes it prints out the non-primes as well

22699664
char-pointer	pointers
in theory you could of course cast your char-pointer to an int-pointer they re both pointers

22699682
int	chars
it says you promised to give me the address of an int but that is the address of a chars

22699683
int	chars
in fact since an int is 4 bytes but a chars is only 1 reading from d would produce garbage and writing to it would contaminate the subsequent 3 bytes

22699709
lodash	underscore.js
the template contains some underscore.js lodash template variables in it like which i use in all the ids and names

22699719
children	parent
rejected because it too would allow multiple children per parent and more importantly multiple parent per child

22699732
int	chars
then the type of the expression would be int which is wrong because the pointer is pointing to a chars not an int

22699734
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
i would keep the application simple and just continue to write a ppm file then use an existing converter such as imagemagick convert graphicsmagick gm convert or pnmtopng which are all open source and free to use or any of a number of other free or proprietary converters

22699867
folder	directory
i d imagine that adding the css and js folder to the rewritecond should do the trick or whatever you named those directory

22699884
put	get
a redirect is executed by most browsers as a get which means you d have to put the data in the query string

22699893
multiplying	division
to be safe i multiplying with 1.0 so that the division will always yield a floating point number

22699925
post	get
you should use the blogpostservice inject that into your controller to get the blog post you want

22699932
post	get
basically there are two usual http ways to send some data - get and post

22699932

width	height
i created a container for the image and give it an absolute position width height 100 and top 0

22700437
super	self
the reason your code isnt working is because super is just a special version of self and since your subclass responds to settintcolor it will return yes

22700467
content-length	content-type
response object is always nil url is correct when openned in browser it shows up the image the operation descriptions shows content-length and content-type image jpeg but response object doesn t seem to pick it up

22700474
for-loop	arrays
the first for-loop is clearly wrong at least for two reasons the type of i and j and the index of the last element of the arrays which should be str+n-1

22700477
folder	directory
so my only solution is to create a test-specific fake directory in my test folder pass that path to my scanner and then check it against what i know to be in that fake directory

22700541
int	boolean
a cast of a boolean to int is 0 or 1

then you will be able to define it width and height

22700716
folder	directory
after placing your file in the assets folder you can follow this so post play audio file from assets directory

22700751
width	height
instead of width see note below and height you can try using min-width and min-height to make your box expand according to its content but never below the specified minimum values

22700787
min	max
so i can pass a condition set id to the query and it will return a count of how many respondents meet that criteria as well as the min and max dates from that set

if you need to call a base class foo but the current class implements a foo method then you cannot use self.foo and you need to use super instead

22707101
super	self
your derived class has its own __init__ method so calling self.__init__ would recursively call that same method but super vapix self .__init__ works because super looks at the mro of self finds vapix in that ordering then goes looking for the next class that has an __init__ method

interpolation	splines
for the really nicest splines curve interpolation you can use centripital catmull-rom which in addition to finding a curve to fit all the points will prevent unnecessary loops and self intersections that can sometimes come up during abrupt changes in the data direction

22719204
hide	show
i thought it might be because under the hood fl_tabs is using - hide and - show meaning there might be some overriding of widget properties but this doesn t make sense because if i switch to tab b before the thread which hide box ends at the time of the update tab b is show as is widget box but box fails to hide

int	double
both intel imci supported by knc and avx-512 to be supported by knl are 512-bit simd instruction sets supporting fma and allowing to pack 8 double precision or 16 single precision floating-point numbers or 16 32-bit int two times more than avx or avx2

22719429
sse	avx
while knc is unable to run sse or avx binaries it often doesn t matter because in order to generate your application binary to be able to run on knc - you need to recompile your code using intel c c++ fortran compiler which is known to automatically or semi-automatically generate relatively efficient vector codes for sse avx imci etc and also gives you capability to use imci intrinsics if needed

22719429
sse	avx	sse	avx2
avx-512 isa is compatible with sse avx and avx2

22720132
filtering	grouping
here it s not clear how you want to grouping and filtering the statistics so you may get multiple rows with the same leader and rep

22720132
filtering	grouping
you can add grouping by modifiers within the combinedtours nested query and where filtering or order by modifiers at the appropriate locations to optimise the query and grouping filtering and order the records accordingly

22720200
post	get
so you can have the same form above and post it to the current page and use jrequest to get all the input values

22720206
portrait	landscape
you can easily stop your landscape view controller to rotate from landscape to portrait but when the app is in portrait already then it is difficult to force the deivce to rotate as this contradicts the iphone manufacturers priciple

22720206
portrait	landscape
force controllers to change their orientation in either portrait or landscape

this way you know that for a double you go 8 bytes ahead while for an int you go 4 and so on

22720444
min	max
my personal favorite is collection2 which will automatically validate all data against a schema you define when creating the collection.you can easily define min max lengths type restrictions or use the custom option to define a custom function to validate a field

22720445
textarea	textbox
the situation is i have a html form which includes a textbox that is driven by the jquery datepicker a get data button and 3 other buttons edit save and delete as well as another textbox and textarea

22720445

22720713
google-chrome	firefox
while google-chrome firefox ie 11 and other browsers do have support for testing responsive layouts and settings that you can use for emulation i have found mite to be an excellent tool for testing sites on emulated mobile devices and it is my experience that mite is a far more effective tool than the emulation support that comes with modern browsers

int	double
if real and imag are themselves of types with correct assign semantics for example primitive types like int or double then it is redundant and error-prone to implement your own

22721149
integer	unsigned
note the absence of unsigned integer types

22721149
integer	unsigned
this is due to the fact that there are no native unsigned integer types in many programming languages

22721154
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
the reason i m asking is that in my subclassed qgraphicsscene i have overridden qgraphicsscene mousepressevent and i want to know which view originated the event--i m wondering if it s safe to static cast widget to a qgraphicsview or if it s conceivable that some other widget could have created the event

i came across a post here that said to get the necessary libgs.so i needed to go back and rebuild the source as a shared library with the command make so

22721446
folder	directory
i did so and then i took the libgs.so.9.14 file under sobin directory in the ghostscript folder and copied it to usr lib

22721462
width	height
so i need to sort of constrain width and height to a certain amounts that are divisible by the character sizes witout a remainder

22721518
exponent	modulo
in order to perform asymmetric encryption common s lisp ironclad library requires the key to be initialized with the exponent and modulo

post	get	exponent	modulo
now from there some post say do add the option -strparse 19 others 18 to get the exponent and modulo

22721518
exponent	modulo
so the question is how do i go from generating a key to obtaining the modulo and exponent from the pem certificate

22721528
min	max
assuming you re using 1.0 and not 0.90 then you can do this quite easily using min max and value_count aggregations

22721551
hide	show
then i would listen for routechangesuccess on the scope and based upon the new path you can determine whether to show hide your sidebar based upon the path defined on location

22721563
post	get
while using an fql query to get likes on post of a particular page we use the following code

22721585
min	max
and this could fairly easily be made to be more variable driven - for example have a variable for first letter min length max length last letter and plug them in to the pattern to replace w 3 5 s

22721588
ng-show	ng-hide
it might be worth mentioning that rather than creating and removing a new element you could use ng-show or ng-hide and never have to compile it

22721629
put	get
the latter is not a problem if i can just get sscanf to put everything after the first quote in the pre-allocated buffer i provide i can strip the end off myself

22721645
width	height
you can try setting the height and width of the i element explicitly to make it square there is a trick using after pseudo-element and with that trick you just need to specify the width no need to specify the height this will help you maintain the page better in case you want to change the square size

22721681
system.data.oracleclient	odp.net
i m calling it from c# and i d like to use system.data.oracleclient as opposed to odp.net because that s approach my company is currently taking so please avoid answers utilizing odp.net

22721901
equals	gethashcode
that class will provide the equals and gethashcode methods for s

22721914
width	height
key is to pay attention to the width height parameters this should refer to the original size of your graphic multiplied by your screen scaling

22721914
width	height
when your game comes to creating the svg on a device with dimenions 800x480 your sprite will be saved with width and height of 100x100

22721914
width	height
when creating the textureregion later on make sure you specify a width and height of 100x100 otherwise your sprite will change size based on the resulting svg bitmap

22721925
division	modulo
think about modulo like this - it returns the remainder of division

22721932
ant	maven
this approach uses maven ant tasks to call out to an ant build.xml from within the generate-sources phase of a maven build

22721932
ant	maven
this ensures that properties that would be available within maven are available within the ant task as well

22721944
puts	gets
this is for stuff like puts and gets where you generally don t care who the receiver is when you call them

22722027

22722183
getter	setter
briefly ko.observable returns a getter setter function

22722197
filtering	grouping
in your subquery from where you are getting maxima you need to grouping by section_id field_id using just grouping by field_id is skipping the section id on which you are applying filtering

22722219
post	get
the issue with the url length might be solved using x-http-method-override http header that would allow to convert get request into post request if the service supports it

22722220
dictionary	map
im creating a jax-ws webservice on wildfly 8.0 and consuming it on a vs2013 c# project what i can t figure out is how can i map a hashmap to .net dictionary

rsa	dsa
the allowed values are dsa rsa and ec

22722263
verilog	hdl
i m very new to verilog and hdl in general

22722264
post	get
my thought is to make the ajax call a post and serialize the necessary data a subset of input old or the model data depending whether the page is loaded as the result of validation errors or an update request to send along with the post so that the html fragment i get back has the values set properly

22722273
hide	show
the function opens the uls and show or hide the lis

22722308
free	malloc
so what allocation done using malloc is on heap and the procedure you used will free memory allocated in called function

22722315
free	malloc
-- you ve malloc d a single buffer then you free d that same buffer so no link

22722315
free	malloc
always properly pair a malloc with a free and you ll be in good shape

22722324
free	malloc
the code is mostly correct because malloc puts memory on the heap and free frees it

22722342
free	malloc
in general a caller may not necessarily know that the pointer returned by halfstring points to a chunk that was allocated with malloc and that they need to free it

22722392
free	malloc
system knows how much memmory is associated with pointer and since you can not free part of memory block allocated with malloc it will free all

22722445

22722865
post	get
note that this only works if you do the 2 step procedure first a http post on a function that returns a dataframe followed by retrieving that object in json format with a http get request

22722865
post	get
you can not specify tojson parameters when you do the 1-step shortcut where you fix the post request with json because in post requests the http parameters always get mapped to the function call

22722915
width	height
from what you posted you are setting the radius of the circle and then the width and height of the rectangle

22722917

22722930
getter	setter
but in order to do so effectively i would need to add some getter and setter

22722930
getter	setter
i need the setter so i can check the state of the private variables in the class a kind of state machine design pattern going on here and i need the getter to mock what the private variables in some methods are

22722995
oncreate	ondestroy
with mapview you need to pass all the fragment lifecycle events oncreate ondestroy onresume etc to your mapview

22723022
put	get
the same attributes get repeated inside the xml and if i put inside the loop subelements it each machine would have only one attribute in xml

22723054
filtering	grouping
the having clause will run after all the data is grouping thus you can only filtering on aggregations of grouping data

22723054
filtering	grouping
if you want to filtering out rows before the data is grouping you need to use the where clause

22723063
getter	setter
i prefer having all dependencies passed into the constructor but assuming that would be too difficult to add to your existing system just ensure the getter and setter are package private and clearly label them annotation or javadoc that they are visible purely for testing

22723063
getter	setter
even better if you could add some static analysis tools to ensure the getter and setter are not called from production code only from test

22723081
public	protected
this is typically public methods properties and protected methods by using fakes doubles

since math.random returns a double in as the documentation states casting it to int after will always end up with a 0

22723576
int	chars
nothing wrong with the key but may be a little bit with docs -1 is an int key -1 is a string is an empty chars is an empty string but the key should not be empty

int	chars
you should provide to the listkey attribute a corresponding field type so -1 is for int of numeric types rather than and are for chars and string types

22723578
multiplying	add
but then comes the question what to do when i have to add and multiplying two integers what about the cases when i have overflows on this operations

filtering	grouping
a solution to this is to have all your admin routes inside a route grouping and apply the filtering to the entire grouping

22724534
min	max
it will be easier to simply call max or min methods directly rather than via a function

22724556

however as i made them a list of pairs and pass them to javascript function in the form of json arrays and iterate through that json arrays using for-loop it does not show up even after an hour

22725113
for-loop	arrays
to achieve this you can iterate through the resulting object arrays using a for-loop for the length of the arrays

22725138
for-loop	arrays
then use simple for-loop to add each data from list to 2d arrays

printf	fgetc
i am unsure if the fgetc function s starting point follows the same positioning as printf and scanf

22725450
post	get
if you really don t want to use the delegate-based nsurlconnection then use its sendasynchronousrequest instead which offers the simplicity of datawithcontentsofurl but allows you to use either get or post requests as well as performing it asynchronously

22725450
post	get
so create the nsmutableurlrequest as shown above use the appropriate method code depending upon whether you re get or post eliminate the lines that instantiate the nsmutabledata and the nsurlconnection and replace that with

22725493
for-loop	arrays
i used a for-loop to check and see if the character s in the arrays element prior to the one being processed contains one of the boolean matches if it does then create the sql statement

22725538
int	chars
there are only two int types that could be smaller than int chars and short

22725538
int	chars
that s why compilers tend to make int 32 bits so you can have chars 8 bit short 16 bit int 32 bit long long 64 bit and long 32 bit or 64 bit

22725550
public	protected
anyway when you declare a local class it can t have public protected or private keywords on it so that explains the first error message you re seeing

22725553
sudo	nohup
also i started dd in the background and with nohup so when i ran sudo killall -info dd and got nothing back for output i had to remember to go and look at the nohup.out file because that is where the response was logged to

22725565
getter	setter
as erwin bolwidt points out in comments in general you seem to be confused about the concepts of getter and setter

22725565
getter	setter
in particular your setter aren t really setter - and it doesn t really seem like you actually need them at all to begin with as your intention seems to be to simply calculate all the values in the constructor then retrieve them later you could just have getter and perform the calculations either in the getter or in the constructor

22725580
post	get
i have seen loads and loads of post here about basic mysqli but cannot find a way to get this to work

22725594
screens	tablet
you can see this most dramatically in websites with mobile versions like facebook which uses a different ui on phones and tablet optimized for the smaller screens size

22725611
puts	gets
so for example if you send a keydown message for cmd-s it ll do nothing all the way up until eventually it reaches the save as menu item which then puts savedocument at the start of the responder chain going down the whole thing all over again until it gets to nsdocument which will do the save operation

22725611
keydown	mousedown
it just knows that the application pushed a keydown or mousedown message onto the chain and a millisecond later a scrollpageup message went onto the chain or maybe it doesn t

versioning	upgrade
to answer your question you cannot switch on string s in versioning of java se 7 so you should probably upgrade

22725730
put	get
essentially in order to pass any data from ruby including parameters submitted by the user through forms and the last_fm api request response i need to put that code in the html the view and then use jquery to get that data into javascript

22725734
getter	setter
non-abstract getter and setter

22725783
google-chrome	firefox
interestingly it shows up fine on ie11 but shows up only partially on google-chrome or firefox

google-chrome	safari
the worst part is when i try to access it from an ipad safari and google-chrome nothing shows up at all

22725790
daemon	cron
and there also exists a inotify based cron daemon

22725849
getter	setter
so it expects there to be setter and getter

22725849
getter	setter
and spring uses reflection to achieve this spring does not provide for reversing this process to use reflection to access fields without setter or getter

22725882
decoder	encoder
i ended up making a playbin2 to decoder the file then making a new bin element containing the encoder payloader and udp sink and setting it as the video sink of the playbin

22729715
int	chars
in scala there are types that include both int and chars such as anyval and any which are both supertypes of chars and int

22729715
int	chars
you can create your own union types which describe the concept of either an int or a chars or you could use the built-in either type but there are no implicit conversions in haskell to transparently convert an int into an intorchar

22729805
ng-show	ng-hide
while ng-show ng-hide will render the code on page but will be hidden with the help of css properties

22729869
put	get
if you use your approach of immediately returning the user to the view hibernate will make an additional join from the permissions table because event though the permissions are lazily loaded by default there is no easy way to signal to the jackson serializer or whatever you are using that you don t care about them in this particular occasion so jackson will try to unproxy them if your transaction is still alive by the time your object is put for json serialization otherwise you get a nasty exception

22729924
subtract	add
processors perform mathematical operations such as add subtract and comparison on numbers using twos compliment this means that to know what the numeric value of a binary word is we must know if it is signed can contain negative values or unsigned positive numbers only

free	malloc
i think zmalloc is a pretty simple wrapper of the system malloc free just keeping track of the overall memory allocated

22729967
ssms	ssdt
remember that ssms will only open sql script solutions created in ssms not ssdt database projects

22729967

22730108
lynxos	qnx	vxworks	lynxos	vxworks	qnx
scheduling guarantees are offered by real-time operating systems rtoses such as qnx lynxos or vxworks

22730149
int	chars
i think that the distinction that is being made here is that your algebraic data type intorchar is a tagged union - that is when you have a value of type intorchar you will know if it is an int or a chars

22730149
int	chars
for example this union is one way to efficiently access the individual bytes of a int assuming 8-bit chars and 32-bit int

22730149
int	chars
to define a function on an intorchar value the tagged union i claim you need to supply two functions - one which takes an int in the case that the value is an int and one which takes a chars in case the value is a chars

22730149
int	chars
as for the anonymous union intorchar since a value doesn t encode anything bout its type the only functions which can be applied are those which are valid for both int and chars values

22730149
int	chars
in haskell there is only one function to my knowledge which can be applied to both int and chars namely the identity function

22730149
int	chars
to summarize you can have int and chars in the same list if you create a tagged-union and in that case you have to tag each of the values which will make you list look like

22730149
int	chars
if you don t tag your values then you are creating something akin to an anonymous union but since there aren t any useful functions which can be applied to both int and chars there s not really anything you can do with that kind of union

temp	corrupt
in my form there s a timer that capture the screen as jpeg every 85 ms it captures until the user shutdown the windows or electricity cut off so the last frame image may get corrupt which is okay for me now when the user log in the form run on the start up now on the on load event it ask if there images in temp folder if yes it open ffmpeg to convert all images into one video but that seems to take a lot of time i have +300000 image and that because it capture the screen for at least a 10 hour every day but that will take a lot of time to convert them i wonder if there any other way to directly record at a video and when electricity cut off that video file stay good with no corruption and with that i mean

jboss	glassfish
i have successfully configured jaas s basic and from based authentication on both jboss and glassfish

22734837
versioning	upgrade
i strongly recommend you to upgrade your parsley versioning to latest

22734853
comparator	comparable
for this either your class dice needs to implement the comparable interface or you need to create a separate comparator class to do the sorting based on some logic

22734853
comparator	comparable
i encourage you to go through the javadocs for comparable and comparator

22734862
jar	war
if your file is contained in the jar war of your project i don t believe it can be deleted from inside the web app

22734934
int	chars
where intarray is your array of int values that has the same size as the chars array

22734934
int	chars
when you are working with converting chars to numbers you are better working with them as int as they are easier to do math on

22734934
int	chars
you could do the same without converting it into an int but that mean you need to find out chars - a is bigger than 10

22734934
int	chars
to print this then you would need to cast the chars to an int

22734934
int	chars
this would then work as well but it is a bit hacky and you need to make sure you cast the chars you have to an int all the time

22734952
portrait	landscape
btw you can change portrait to landscape in androidmanifest to display buttons correctly

22734952
width	height
if the aspect ratio is the same which is not the case in this situation as 480 320 1.5 and 800 480 1.66 then you could simply scale up the scene with the one value for both width and height

22734952
width	height
we could stretch your width or height what ever s ratio is larger to fit the whole screen

22734952
width	height
it upscales to the maximal dimension of width or height which fills the screen first leaving whitespaces on other dimension

22735032
for-loop	loops
name for loops index that the cursor for-loop statement implicitly

22735045
int	double
edit afterthought you would also probably do well to use double instead of int for the other values especially pitch and yaw

22735059
multiplying	transpose
this is because in order to apply the homography to a point at coordinates x y you multiplying its matrix h on the right by the column vector x y 1 here i use the apostrophe symbol to denote transpose and then divide the result h x u v w by the third component w

22735099
apache	nginx
hears my apache configuration but again im on nginx now and trying to learn how i could convert it over

22735190
bower	npm
this will install all npm and bower based dependencies for your project

22735225
free	realloc
realloc might free old and return 0

22735263
put	get
a string also is a t for some type t and because the choice forsome applies to only one element at a time you get to say t is string this time instead of int so you can put the string in the array even though it already contains an int

22735267
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	centos	centos	mint
it really comes down to what flavor you like aesthetically i personally use centos 6 mint is very popular and ubuntu has a lot of support behind it

22735306

i will get the href attribute from the a-tag and post this in yes button in the modal window message

22735343
ubuntu	centos
ubuntu centos fedora

22735344
for-loop	loops
you just need to make the program recognize that the for-loop has found a valid name and tell the while loops that it can exit because of that

22735345
for-loop	arrays
notice how i modified your for-loop to start at 0 rather than 1 as this is the start of the arrays

22735410
int	chars
well there s an implicit conversion from chars to int which you can easily print out

22735422
post	get
if you want to post on behalf of the user admin you use the user access token which can be extended by making a get request that you ve explained that already

22735422
implements	extends
if you dont want to use the graph api explorer you can write a small script using js php other language and implements the facebook login- get the access token- and extends that token oh wait

22735437
gitignore	git-add
the file is completely ignored by git even if is not listed in gitignore it is not shown with --ignored and even if i try to git-add it it is not considered

it s actually working on google-chrome but fails to work on safari of iphone wich is my final destination so the solution must work on safari on ios6 +

22735644
hash	md5
i would like to know if there is a way to calculate md5 hash of files contained in a zip archive

22735684
google-chrome	firefox
you can see your response headers with google-chrome developer toolbar or firebug on firefox in network tab

22735701
for-loop	loops
the third for-loop needs to search the whole data set again you re only looping over the single item of the second loops

22735734
hash	md5
i think the simplest solution is to calculate the md5 hash of a zipped file and store it in the zip archive alongside the file

22735757
bash	zsh
bash ksh zsh solution using special shell variable

22735757
bash	zsh
in bash and zsh you get integral seconds advancing by the pulse of the system real-time clock - counting behind the scenes does not truly start at 0

22735757
bash	zsh
that said for rough measurements and timeouts it may still be usable in bash and zsh

22735757
bash	zsh
simply substituting ksh or zsh for bash will make the script run with these shells too

22735757
freebsd	linux
caveat date + s itself specifically the s format is not posix-compliant but it ll work on at least linux freebsd and osx

22735776
for-loop	loops
you have a for-loop and if a condition inside loops body is evaluated as true then you do something and return from the function

22735816
scheme	racket
racket and not scheme why not use struct

22735854
post	get
just wanted to add for anyone that is using qt and trying to show a app indicator in ubuntu 13+ as others have mentioned sni-qt is not working i was able to use the above reply to make a qt app that works still trying to get the icon to change and show popup messages but this is a great start once i get the icon and message to work i might post it out on my site voidrealms.com

22735862
implements	extends
the more correct solution would be to extends an adapter for text2 and implements a filter that would return the correct areas you need

22735866
uiview	subviews
you can create uiview category which can add subviews

22735878

freebsd	linux
you can deploy any out-of-the-box linux distribution including red hat enterprise linux in limited preview now suse and freebsd

22735881
width	height
when i wrote this code my understanding was that v will have correct width and height right after inflating

22735884
awt	swing
much better to draw in a jpanel s paintcomponent graphics g method and gain the benefit of swing rather than awt graphics including automatic double buffering

22735884
jcomponent	bufferedimage
solution draw inside the painting method again better with a jcomponent s paintcomponent method only or with the graphics object from a bufferedimage

22735910
getter	setter
the only thing that i m doing different from the example is the datasource insofar as i m push ing an actual winjs class in there with getter and setter functions for the attributes displayed in the list

22735993
google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome 33+ safari 6 ie11 etc

22736003
folder	directory
the reason this folder exists is because the original mac os implemented the concept of a resource fork - essentially a way of storing structured data about a particular file directory alongside unstructured data so it can easily be accessed by executables- wikipedia article here also referenced in the su question

22736010
width	height
of course there s also the code for width and gfxwidth and the other various codes but i m not going to bother posting those because i can apply what i get for the height to those

22736015
children	parent
now my main problem is forking two processes so that i m not simply left with 1 parent and 1 child but rather 2 parent and 2 children but running through the program as it currently works

22736096
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i have an npapi plugin which works fine for firefox google-chrome and opera windows linux both

22736096
google-chrome	firefox
now since the support for npapi will be dropped sooner or later i created addons for firefox and google-chrome to get the same job done

22736096
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox xpcom and in google-chrome native messaging host allowed me to achieve the same for which i relied on npapi

22736115
width	height
if not it s the regular height width

22736226
mouse	keyboard
hshell_appcommand the user completed an input event for example pressed an application command button on the mouse or an application command key on the keyboard and the application did not handle the wm_appcommand message generated by that input

22736295
udp	tcp
the checksum calculation for tcp udp ip is rather trivial

22736305
width	height
and by adding -wxxx width or -hxxx height or -c crop

22736321
put	get
if you put breakpoints through the program you can see it writes to the console you just don t get an opportunity to see it

22736345
getter	setter
the getter if needed and setter methods of the property that you are

22736355
put	get
when it sees the non-number character it needs to put it back into the stream so the next call to getc will get it

22736359
inherited	properties
i want to group nodes and or edges in the graph into semantic classes with each class having a set of node and or edge properties that cascade or inherited similar to css

hide	show
i m trying to simply hide and show a div by clicking a show map link which would then change to hide map and would ideally like the div to animate using the slide up down effect it simply contains a google map embedded as an iframe using google s basic share map option

22736437
vagrantfile	hosts
you can use port forwarding inside your vagrantfile and map port 80 from your hosts to 80 from your guest

22736439
do.call	lapply
update here s an lapply solution that i recombine with do.call and rbind

22736487
getter	setter
or self.myproperty refers explicitely laugh more or less explicitely but it does to the getter or the setter of the property myproperty while just typing myproperty within a method refers directly to the property without passing the getter

22736494
gif	png
they can be in jpg png or gif

22736499
oncreate	onstart
i suggest not creating camera objects in oncreate but only doing it in onstart or onresume

22736507
onresume	onpause
it s probably best to initialise the camera in onresume and release it in onpause

22736508
int	double
i know you can use this to parse a string into an int there is probably a parse method in double aswell

22736528
switching	screens
can you advise on how to switching screens properly

22736544
hide	show
i would like to show hide a div using a data attribute instead of a value

22736559
children	parent
since i either want the parent if it has no children or the child element which is a span if it exists i figured something like should work so i tried this

22736584
pull	push
to sync the repositories you either do a manual pull on the second repository or use a git hook to pull automatically after each push

22736606
range	min
also consider that you are looking for the min date and if the partition function has range that include more than 1 date value then even if the optimizer narrowed down the specific partition rather quickly it would still need to scan the entire partition because you don t have an index defined on that date field

22736606
min	max
regarding the min b query start with one of these as you will need an index for the sort required by min max operations

22736606
range	min
if you have an easy means of looping through the distinct partition range you can cycle through them doing inserting the min value into a table variable from

22736606
min	max
use the technique described here by itzik ben-gan max and min aggregates against partitioned tables

22736606
min	max
this would not only be super-fast to get your min max values of b but it would be 3 bytes per each of 300 rows for 900 total bytes

22736610
joptionpane	jdialog
you could use a joptionpane or a jdialog to get this input either would work great but just not the new scanner system.in

22736619
xargs	pwd
the output null-delimited to handle funny filenames is piped to xargs which cd s to each repo prints the pwd and short-form git-status without listing untracked files

22736723
uiview	subviews
what i do is subclass uiview and override hittest withevent such that touches are passed through unless a subviews is touched

22736740
subclass	abstract-class
you can t have it that way for fields you need to overload abstract-class s constructor and force subclass to pass parameters during constructor by hiding default constructor and then use those passed parameter for jframe s constructor

22736744
caliburn.micro	mef
i have an application that uses mef and caliburn.micro

to int n 8 or chars b 41

22737021
getter	setter
use getter and setter instead and do the mirroring there

22737022
quicksort	mergesort
if this requirement is invalidated then quicksort and mergesort become non equivalent algorithms

22737069
uninstall	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
finally a setup provides upgrade and patching features for new versioning as well as uninstall and cleanup of the system when the user wants to remove your software

22737189
keydown	keyup
solution to solve this just set a flag whenever a certain key is keydown and unset the flag on keyup

22737205
for-loop	arrays
wrong for-loop for an arrays you should be using a regular for-loop not for-in which is commonly used for objects not arrays

22737216
post	get
however i just get cannot read property post of undefined in the callback

22737224
mouseleave	mouseenter
i am doing a mouseenter and mouseleave on an area

22737226
apache	nginx
however if you want the best performance then you are looking at something that decompresses the zip files when they are uploaded and serves them up using a webserver directly nginx apache or whatever you are using

22737229

put	get	post	get	post	put
for the regular rest actions i use the default http methods get put post and delete

22737429
post	put
this way i can post a form setting the _method to put

22737433
post	get
so to get the post from a public page without logging on the user you can create an app and use the app access token app_id|app_secret that never expires

22737433
post	get
if you still get the empty result that means the post are not public

22737472
hide	show
i want to show specific and hide a target row via controller

ng-show	ng-hide	hide	show
you can use the ng-show and ng-hide directives to hide and show elements

22737483
ng-class	ng-hide
for your example i d change your ng-class to an ng-hide

22737501
min	max
for instance the min and max window functions are used to determine if an email or account number appears on multiple accounts

22737527
folder	directory
otherwise the libraries will not be linked properly and not copied to the libs armeabi folder properly and not installed on the device copied to data data package lib directory properly

22737538
put	get
you may want to use some breakpoints if you re using an ide and check the values of your input variables before they get put into the list or have it spit them back out at you on the command line before putting them in the list

22737568
int	chars
the lambda expressions just parses the age field by splitting the string on the _ chars and converting to int the result of the split s second element

22737614
for-loop	arrays
i know that when dealing with arrays like i have in my for-loop that they re often the source of crashes but i m fairly certain that with the rest of my code that room_array isn t the culprit

22737641
client-side	server-side
so this is not a client-side but a server-side problem

22737650
versioning	upgrade
the proper fix is to upgrade cordova to a versioning that has arm64 versioning of the libraries compiled

22737702
hide	show
from other controller i want to check if user is already logged in to hide login button and show user profile instead

22737704
factors	mean
generate your data frame with columns for year and month then subset for the years you want and use tapply to get the mean by factors

22737783
vbo	vao
im trying to create a circle in lwjgl using vbo s and vao and move it using an offset but it seems one vertex is stuck in the center of the screen

22737809
put	get
but i can t put it dynamically that after success of get method result

22737835
post	get
and i have 2 post submit forms into my page that are re-triggering this get call.

22737839
opencart	vqmod

matlab	simulink
i mainly construct system in matlab simulink but there is one part responsible for encapsulation decapsulation of the stream packet which was designed in linux environment

22737904
children	parent
the panel element parent itself is created in code dynamically and then i use loadoverlay wait for the merged event and then append the panel element s children from the overlayed document

22737908
textview	imageview
so what i have is a list view with a custom adapter which has three controls two textview and a imageview what i want to happen is when you press the last column the image i want to be able to delete that row i could do it using the entire row but i want the user to have to click the imageview column in order to trigger delete

22737910
inherited	subclassing
it just means in between in terms of subclassing instance checks not actual inherited

22737910
inherited	subclassing
abcs introduce virtual subclassing which are classes that donâ t inherited from a class but are still recognized by isinstance and issubclass

22737910
abc	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
note what it says the virtual subclassing don t actually inherited from your abc they just test as if they do

22737910
abc	subclassing
an abc can be subclassing directly and then acts as a mix-in class

22737930
weka	libsvm
anyway another variant to use libsvm is smo weka library

22737970
ssl	https
the tutorials i have found revolve around one-shot https requests all i need is a ssl socket

22737971
debian	linux
platform linux 3.2.0 x86 debian wheezy

22737981
int	chars
you could muck about with strings to extract the chars you want but it s probably easier to remember that int are stored as binary internally so we can get what we want with a bit of math

22737987
stdout	stderr
in this case there must be unconsumed output in stdout which is blocking the process which means it won t finish which means it won t close stderr which means reading stderr will block

22738021
put	get
i was hoping to make it so the user could put in the name of a country say india and get the number of mobile users in that country

22738075
post	get
i converted the add_to_cart request to a post rather than get because you are firing a post request and have defined the route as get

22738097
accessor	properties
kvc will use the properties generated accessor methods or other appropriately named accessor methods if they exist but they aren t required

22738127
realloc	malloc
the size arguments for malloc and realloc need to be multiplied by sizeof wchar_t

i am trying to get a slider to cover the full width and height of the page under the navigation bar

22738234
width	height
i tried setting the width height to 100 but then it overflows despite the overflow hidden property

22738261
post	get	children	parent
to get all the post pages that are children of a given post page you can use the parameter post_parent using the id of the parent post

22738261
post	get
edit according to your comments it seems that you re actually trying to get all those post that have a given value in a custom field of type post object

22738271
for-loop	arrays
i have done a for-loop to check if the a given string is in the arrays and if so i want to assign the next element to an variable

22738345
profiling	instrumentation
i think an approach to solving the problem is to run your program with instrumentation with the profiling option instead of doing a run

22738388
udp	tcp
every tcp or udp socket has a send buffer and a receive buffer

22738451
gam	mgcv
suitable alternatives exist such as in the forms of two functions named gam one in package mgcv which comes with r as a recommended package and the other in package gam which is an r version of the gam software gam in s-plus and the original implementation following hastie tibshirani s mono graph on generalised additive models gam

22738451
gam	mgcv
if you want loess-based smooths in the gam try package gam but mgcv has a wider range of penalised regression splines and has a more modern approach to smoothness selection in the individual splines

22738453
move	drag
at the end of the drag when user releases mouse button or takes his finger off the screen a.k.a dragend event if the one above is closer to middle it gets move to the middle and vice versa

22738453
move	drag
the thing is when dragend event is triggered at 48 when user drag the mouse from down to up which means the one above will get move to middle if the velocity is high enough the one below should get move to middle

22738564
x509	pkcs#1
you did not specify where are your signing certificate and private key stored so let s just assume that you have your pem encoded x509 signing certificate stored in file signer.cer and your pem encoded pkcs#1 private key stored in file signer.key

22738581
folder	directory
save the file appropriately in the same directory that includes the libraries folder

inherited	properties
the instance properties of the base class are inherited at the point where the derived class constructor calls the base class constructor

22742265
inherited	properties
at this point all the instance properties of the base class which need to be inherited privately can be stored as local variables inside the constructor of the derived class and subsequently deleted from the instance of the derived class

22742265
inherited	properties
this technique would obviously not work for properties inherited off the prototype of the base class

22742265
inherited	properties
this approach has the advantage that the child class has the option to choose the properties it wants to inherited from the base class and doesn t need to care about the other properties

22742266
post	get

width	margin
margin doesnt gets calculated as the width of the div no matter what

22742748
width	margin
eg - if you have a div with width 400px and you have its margin say 5px then the total width of the div will become 410px 5px from left margin + 5px from right

22742748
width	margin
for this reason you will have to decrease the width by 10px to make it exact 400px.now your div width will be 390px and after adding up those margin widths the total will be 400px

22742748
width	margin
in you code if you make the .class1 50 your total div width will be 50 + your margin px .hence those will not be truly 50

22742748
width	margin
so no matter what you will have to add up margin width to your div or else don t add the margin at all

primes	modulus
the use of primes isn t about the difficulty of factoring - the most efficient method for factoring large composite numbers like the modulus of an rsa key is the general number field sieve which is much more efficient than simply trying to divide by successive numbers

22745273
exponent	modulo
so far so good however you go on to say that the primes are your private key which isn t really true either - the private key is actually the combination of the modulo which is also part of the public key and the private exponent which is the number d such that where e is the public exponent which is often just 65537 and phi is euler s totient function

22745273
exponent	modulo
since the security of rsa itself relies on the difficulty of factoring large composite numbers it is infeasible to calculate the private exponent if we haven t constructed the modulo directly from its primes factors which is the real reason that you have to use primes rather than composite numbers

also worth noting is the private keyword our special getter and setter don t do much for us if anyone using a transaction can see and change the amount variable directly so private lets us hide it from anything outside the transaction class

addition	multiplication	division	multiplication	division	addition
various transformations involve all elementary operations such as addition multiplication division and addition of a constant

22748777
addition	multiplication	division	multiplication	division	addition
note that addition of a constant and in case of a homography division is impossible to represent with matrix multiplication in 2d

22748777
addition	multiplication	division	multiplication	division	addition
thus two results are achieved all operations multiplication division addition of variables and additions of constants can be represented by matrix multiplication

22748777
multiplying	multiplication
second we can chain multiple operations via multiplying their matrices and still have only a single matrix as the result of matrix multiplication

this works in internet explorer and firefox but shows a strange behavior in google-chrome after initializing in most cases the editor is too tall

22749192
width	height
however as soon as the width of the editorwindow - div is changed by setting it directly in the developer tools the height automatically corrects and auto-updates correctly for the rest of this session

22749195
getter	setter
and because the action bean is placed by the framework on top of the value stack its properties evaluated in jsp by name to corresponding getter setter without any prefixes

22749195
getter	setter
if you have nested beans inside the action bean and you didn t implement a model driven interface then you should provide getter setter for these beans as well and use its name to dot prefix your bean s properties

22750997
raphael	easeljs
the issue is that i offer multiple animation outputs for compatibility one using easeljs and one using raphael however the interface that controls these remains the same these are plain html elements with data stored in attributes that i wish to call functions written in the flash ide by triggering events and passing parameters

22751002
dbcontext	objectcontext
even though not recommended it s still possible to use the older objectcontext templates by selecting ef 6.x entityobject generator as code generation template instead of ef 6.x dbcontext generator

22751002
dbcontext	objectcontext
i still search for a better way than using the old objectcontext template so i can use the newer dbcontext

22751028
equals	compareto
with this rather than needing to implement a comparator all you need to implement is the int compareto class o method in the class which returns a negative integer zero or a positive integer as this object is less than equals to or greater than the specified object.

22751036
portrait	landscape
the views differ on various sizes landscape portrait etc

22751045
google-chrome	firefox
the header values used match what is used in the cited question above but both google-chrome and firefox refuse to honor the cache request

22751051
pull	push
an other way to solve this problem could be to push item5 to the array and pull item4

22751051
pull	push
in the first query you push item5 in the second query you pull item4

22751112
maven	pom.xml
typically this happen if you forget to declare hibernate dependency on your maven pom.xml

the speed int corresponds to the movement of the chars

22751150
range	minimum
create subsets for each criteria minimum extremes maximum extremes and mid range

22751216
base-class	derived-class
also given the calls to base class constructors it may also create problems with diagnostics verifying that base-class constructor calling conventions are compatible with the derived-class calling convention

22751216
clang	llvm
and note that it s possible that such a person doesn t even exist your best bet might be to check with the llvm clang developer community to see if anyone has looked into this problem

22751225
box-sizing	border-box
personally i think box-sizing should always be border-box because the box model feels natural that way

22751237
post	get
request is formed to send data over post method but you tried to read id parameter using get method

22751258
put	get
i m trying to use an ajax call to get a list of items from a json array and put them into a list of checkboxes

22751269
public	protected
another alternative would be to give classb a public or protected member function that allows to modify the vector from classc

22751303
int	chars
the tostring rendering of the list makes it look the same but the two are quite different -- a 1 chars for example has int value 49

22751303
int	chars
which you should use depends on whether you want the digit chars or the int they represent

22751304
public	protected
to get your code to work you want to do either prepend either protected or public infront of classa for your definition of classb like so

22751345
post	get
you get to the post page by using this code which presents the embedded navigationcontroller

22751364
inherited	subclassing
the issue is you did not declare what type of inherited classa is for subclassing classb

22751600
width	height
i m trying to resize the background image of my website to fit whatever width and height the current window is using jquery

22751600
width	height
if i omit one of the 100 it stretches to the width but not the height

22751644
for-loop	arrays
you could put all the ch variables into a list or arrays and iterate through each using a for-loop

22751658
ssl	https
that being said apps are ssl-enabled already and can be accessed simply by using https but you would want to go with the ssl endpoint option when you want to establish the trusted relationship with your clients

my font-awesome icons are working fine in firefox and google-chrome but in safari i just see blank space for some of them but not others

22751778
free	malloc
and like matt mcnabb says in his comment you should add the free at the end to release the memory you ve allocated one malloc one free always

22751805
folder	directory
i also created a build.xml ant file that copies the c header files from the library project to a jni include directory in the dependent jni folder

22751834
getter	setter
the code would look something like this fill in your getter setter

22751864
webkit	blink
they now have a customized version of webkit a branch called blink so even though they show in chrome nowadays you might need to check in another webkit browser to be sure

22751869
mouseleave	mouseenter
try the mouseenter and mouseleave events

22751926
h.264	hevc
for example it may carry video encoded using h.264 hevc vp8 or vp9 codecs

22751975
min	max
select max odometer - min odometer as totalkm from table

22751996
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
by default the width and height properties are measured including only the content but not the border margin or padding

22751996
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
the width and height properties include the padding and border but not the margin

22752052
int	chars
i need to get the numeral into the variable n which i declared as an int and the alphabetic chars into the variable l which i declared as an enum type

22752198
min	max
so i decided to give it a try to see how much difference hotspot could make against doing the comparison directly specially since i ve heard min max can compile to branchless asm

22752240
awt	swing
i have an awt canvas within a jframe i know that swing and awt shouldn t be used simultaneously but it works well on windows so i don t think the problem is caused by this and using a bufferstrategy from the canvas to draw on screen

22752240
awt	swing
i have an ati graphics card which is no longer supported so i m using the open source video drivers but when i run another program which uses opengl it s not slow like swing awt one

22752286
16-bit	64bit
this could be an 8-bit carry if using 8-bit registers al or ah a 16-bit carry if using 16-bit registers ax and 32-bit or 64bit carry when using the corresponding registers eax or rax respectively

22752339
folder	directory
windows shift + right click into the white space of the folder and select open command window here or for mac open terminal and navigate to the directory of the extracted files

22752339
folder	directory
go into the eclipse directory and copy the assets folder and paste it up one directory where gradlew.bat is

22752341
post	get
now in the home endpoint we need to handle the post data that might get redirected from edit_profile

22752350
uilabel	uibutton
so for this example i will prevent that the iboutlets you want to keep not draw over are a uitextfield a uilabel and a uibutton

22752350
uilabel	uibutton
so as you see when you call drawrect it will still blank out your uiview2 completely but it won t matter because drawrect won t delete any of the uilabel uibutton uitextfield or whatever else you want to keep in your uiview1

22752391
try-catch	exception-handling
if you try with a thread and the inviting .abort method you should consider that threadabortexception is a special exception-handling in terms of try-catch and finally blocks

once you ve prepare and execute the query you can easily check how many rows were returned and loop through them

22752446
sqldf	plyr	dplyr	sqldf
i have considered the value of nested if loops along with using sqldf plyr aggregate or even dplyr

22752468
realloc	malloc
the rules are i may only use the library and i can t use malloc realloc

22752485

22752490
elasticsearch	kibana
i recommend you explore the code used for the kibana application hosted on the elasticsearch website

22752496
free	malloc
and while we re listing a long litany of problems there s a vast difference between the variables backedupptr and backedupptr re the capitalisation of the u it s good form to free memory that you allocate and you shouldn t cast the return value of malloc in c it can lead to certain subtle errors

22752496
multiplying	addition
in addition multiplying by sizeof char is unnecessary since it s always one

22752550
int	double	int	chars
i am going to explain this problem taking chars as an example but in reality it could be anything chars int string double object etc

22752553
client-side	server-side
you could do this client-side using javascript or you could look at a server-side javascript option such as rhino or phantomjs

22752565
hebrew	persian
all of them supporting right-to-left languages specifically arabic hebrew and persian

22752565
hebrew	persian

22752685
post	get
i am attempting to get the latest threads that have been posted on in a forum with vars from users threads and the last post

22752711
background-image	background-size
since i want to use background-size cover i am using a div with background-image set instead of the default

22752713
oncreate	setcontentview
move all this inside oncreate after setcontentview

22752720
width	height
and then in your media query for mobile screens make both #left and #right flow none width 100 and height auto

22752757
post	put
so you want to put that cfquery insert statement inside of a cfloop block that loops through the form.tags list so that you re creating a record with the blog post id and the tag id of the current loop iteration

22752759
width	height
i have an absolutely positioned div #home positioned top left 0 of the page and has a width and height of 100 of browser

22752760
put	get
the above setting will cause the type information of widgettypea or widgettypeb to be put over the wire which gives a hint to the client as to the actual type of the object being deserialized...you can try looking at the wire format of the response to get an idea.

22752835
rspec	capybara
below is my code taken from my rspec capybara testing

22752932
minimum	max	min	max
since you didn t specify minimum number of arrays or min max elements per array here s a general purpose function that you can specify min max elements for each array

22752932
min	max
for example if you have 10 elements original and you do min 2 max 4 you could end up with 3 3 3 1 because the min will be enforced up until there s not enough to enforce

22752932
min	max
min and max are both optional and default to 1

22752932
min	max
if only min is specified max will default to min

22752966
free	calloc
also you never free the memory you calloc d

22752981
getter	setter
as far as i know if i use field access type access accesstype.field then hibernate will access the field directly and not use the getter or setter

22752981
getter	setter
in which scenario it is recommended to access the field directly instead of getter or setter

22752987

please use a format like bmp or png if you want to save space

22753019
post	put
if this post is duplicate please put the link to lead me there

22753064
for-loop	loops
after you free the surface in the function add and blit the surface every while loops cycle by adding a sdl_flip model at the end of your while loops this will make your pointer point to nothing which will show nothing aka vanish but if you are literally talking about vanishing you could reduce the alpha by 1 or whatever your jazz is in a for-loop which will make it fade out like it is vanishing

22755224
disk	ram
this scenario occurs only when your ram main memory is utilized to its maximum level most of the os handles this scenario by moving less priority data to hard disk hence you don t get memoryerror in new os but its better to handle this because the legacy os don t have the above mentioned mechanism so the programer needs to handle it

if you define the object to have a top-left corner of 0 0 and a bottom-right corner of 200 200 then the height and width of the object will be 201 201

22756514

objectoutputstream	objectinputstream	fileinputstream	objectoutputstream	fileinputstream	objectinputstream	fileinputstream	fileoutputstream	fileoutputstream	objectoutputstream	fileoutputstream	objectinputstream
you could use an objectoutputstream wrapping a fileoutputstream to write your 2d array to file and then use an objectinputstream wrapping a fileinputstream to read it back in again

22757314
post	get
i m trying to get details about installed applications in my post

22757315
min	max
so group by site and take the min max or avg site count - they should all be the same as the value is stored redundantly

22757339
persistent	transient
which you can do by using transient this annotations will be used to indicate that a field is not to be persistent in the database

22757361
google-chrome	firefox
the reveal model works fine in google-chrome firefox ie +9

22757383
versioning	upgrade
i need to upgrade an existing rather large application from symfony 2.0.15 to symfony 2.4.x replace with current versioning

22757383
versioning	upgrade
upgrade step by step from one major versioning to another 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4

22757396
jobs	cron
there are some cron jobs which i don t want to execute on a qa environment as it unnecessary occupies heap space and slows down the system

22757454
lisp	prolog
i have some very basic knowledge about artifical intelligence i know about inference engine coding in lisp or prolog a bit about neural network but not much

22757524
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
otherwise works fine in google-chrome firefox opera and maxthon

22757527
folder	directory
after i have done this part i have added chm file into folder directory and in vs i have click chm file and choose build action content and copy to output directory copy always

22757527
folder	directory
basically this should work for everyone because while deploying app with one click deploy it will create copy folder structure with chm file plus using method get current directory and concatenate it with that folder and file you provide necessary path to this file.

22757552
post	get
here you can send a get post ajax request to django with your prompt s value

22757561
min	max
so you can make a combination of the max and min functions as follows

22757646
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
both these languages are based on inherited where a subclassing instance is also an instance of its superclass

22757646
super	self
in objective-c super is a keyword while self which references the instance a method was called on is a variable and the equivalent of java s this

22757646
super	self
the super keyword is used to call a method on self but to start the search for the implementation to call in the superclass instead of the current class

22757646
super	implements
i want to add a target with a method implements in super class

22757646
superclass	subclassing
however if your subclassing overrides a superclass method and you wish to set the superclass implementation as the action then you must write a method in your subclassing which invokes the superclass method

22757654
client-side	server-side
the latter is used on the client-side whereas the former is used on the server-side

22757656
children	parent
if your multiple parent objects share common children objects then calling destroy on specific parent object will delete children objects which are shared among other multiple parent

22757668
min	max
you are better going mobile first and using min instead of max on widths and heights

22757700

22757717
google-chrome	firefox
demo issue in firefox and google-chrome

22757725
versioning	upgrade
i shall first recommend to make sure that none of your code uses obsolete functionnalities of symfony 2.0 not sure if there are deprecated parts in this versioning though because these can be removed in ulterior versioning and will not be included in the upgrade file

22757799
box-sizing	border-box
first let me say that it seems internet explorer 8 completely ignores box-sizing border-box

22757799
google-chrome	firefox
it renders just fine in google-chrome and firefox

22757805
submit	submission
just change button type from submit to button and it will prevent auto submission

22757832
int	chars
you must first format the int value in a chars buffer and set this as the text

22757842
post	get
i have tried jsonignore against the branches and this works for the get but it also stops the branches from writing on a post

22757879
sudo	passwd
installing postgresql on gce requires root passwd to run sudo -u postgresql

22757934
int	double
and when you cast this double into an int then the result is obviously 509

22757960
findstr	tasklist
you can see after i start the ie browser the job will wait 5 seconds and then check the ie process by command tasklist | findstr iexplore.exe

22757963
ng-show	ng-hide
does angular evaluates the div that is hidden with ng-show ng-hide

22757978

22758162
width	height
it looks like my application starting to be i fft-bounded it doing a lot of 2d correlations for rectangles with average sizes about 500x200 width and height always even

22758249
xetex	xelatex
i set r_latexcmd to xelatex before that pdflatex was being used which meant that knit would fail since i use xetex packages and that s about the only global variable or additional setting i made

22758253
put	get
but the package i have put in the directory does not seem to get found

22758320
width	height
i want to customise cell origin x origin y width and height

22758347

you would create a basic view which implements the base logic and extends said view with specific logic

22758351
min	max
you need some flag to store current rotation direction and change it when you reach one of min max values look at this pseudo-code

22758359
width	height
you are able to fix this issue if you keep height and increase width by multiply it to ratio

22758360
google-chrome	firefox
this behavior is the same with google-chrome and firefox

22758382
post	get
so far all of the get methods work fine but i m having trouble understanding how to post data as it s not working

22758419
draggable	droppable
imagine this very basic draggable droppable setup

22758419
draggable	droppable
for some reason the droppable reacts to the draggable even the draggable has not even been dragged out of the #itembox

22758419
draggable	droppable
it s simply my misunderstanding of how the draggable droppable seems to behave that lead me to this problem

22758419
draggable	droppable
i need the droppable to react only once the draggable has actually left the #itembox

22758460

i suppose i need a way to put the params basichttpsparams collection and not concatenate them with the plain uri - since they seam not to get recognized that way by httpget

22758466
macports	homebrew
had tried macports and homebrew

22758474
for-loop	arrays
so i got posed with this question and i initially wrote the answer to this returning a new arrays using a nested for-loop comparing the elements of the arrays and adding to the new arrays if they matched

22758558
apache	nginx
if this is the case then i think you need to look at how you configure nginx redirects instead of apache style htaccess directives on this server

22758645
jsf	seam
first of all i ve read many post with related issues or migrate jsf 1.2 seam app to wildfly beta 1 but the proposed solution excluding the weld subsystem doesn t work for me

22759000

you can see that the width and height is correct but instead of going to the second line when it reach to the border of the shape it continues

22759746
width	height
and by looking at your website i see that you are using images in all boxes so what i would do is to set a specific size in the img tag in the css and not worry about the height on the boxes because they will autoscale with the width of the img since it is a square

22759773

the goal is to connect them so that when i move one rectangle the link between that rectangle and his children doesn t fade away or stay static and dynamically make the children follow their parent position

jobs	cron
all gems i have come across so far like whenever rufus sidetiq or simple cron jobs only allow for the job to be hardcoded in a file

jquery fadein fadeout functions not working properly

22761062
children	parent
if your data model relies on children being deleted when parent are that must happen on your server

mdpi	hdpi
i have alternative drawables hdpi ldpi mdpi xhdpi xxhdpi and i have layouts layout layout-small layout-large layout-xlarge

22766325

note how pack causes the bar to adopt the width of the center panel and the preferred height defined by the l f

22766426
int	boolean
but the tester to the class busarrival gives me wrong answers in the methods public boolean before and public int elapsedtime

22766485
implements	extends
ok having looked around a little there didnt seem to be core classes that implements the rememberme functionality for request headers - however reading through the spring security remember me source code it was actually quite simple to extends the above classes to look at the request header

22766553
children	parent
in a tree data structure the root node is a node with no parent but which typically has children

22766558
portrait	landscape
however if the app starts in portrait mode no scroll required and then i rotate to landscape then there is no scrollbar

22766589
put	get	post	get	post	put
if that s true i m going to argue you should be using a get and not a put or a post

22766589
post	get
if i misunderstood and you re executing jobs not whole schedules then you d have post scheduledjobs and get scheduledjobs instead of scheduledexecutions

22766590
width	height
you need to set a viewbox rather than a fixed width and height

22766591
installation	upgrade
major upgrade can t switch context and even if you wrote a setup.exe bootstrapper to clean up before the installation it would have to be run for each user profile that installed the product

22766617
udp	tcp
this works well for udp but with tcp the problem with this approach is that you then have to allow for the fact that multiple recvs could complete at the same time and then you have to ensure that your i o threads work together to keep the tcp data stream in sync see here for the issues

22766625
background-image	background-color
but you will have to use background-image instead of background-color

22766650
width	height
that is - the width of the rectangle is derived from the height of its container by a set ratio

22766650
width	height
the blue rectangle height is set according to the height of the container its width is set as the rest of the available viewport width

22766650
width	height	portrait	landscape
the end result of changing that viewport size browser width and container height via dragging is that the blue container may change aspect ratio from portrait to landscape and vice versa

22766650
portrait	landscape
portrait landscape

22766656
setinterval	settimeout
the better way to do it is via ajax calls using javascript s settimeout function or setinterval make a call to the server periodically and have the server send back a progress report

22767396
ant	emma	emma	jacoco
i have a separate ant task that recompiles the code base stripping out the emma instrumentation and then repackages the application and runs the jacoco coverage tool against my integration tests

22767493
for-loop	loops
also the for-loop you have in the else clause just loops through all you entities making your random selection irrelevant so string will be the last restaurant name in your data

22767510
armadillo	lapack
the delayed evaluation template magic of the multiplication operation in armadillo can easily bring about that the lapack routine for the computation is never called

22767550

the ontology i have contains many words but i fail to retrieve the hierarchy superclass subclassing

22767695
scikit-learn	graphlab
it seems that neither scikit-learn nor nimfa nor graphlab nor mahout propose such an option

22767699
ssl	https
i had the same problem and although i was already using an ssl server simply changing the links to https wasn t working as there was an underlying problem

22767739
google-chrome	firefox
another weird thing is those ids are same as in script when inspected in google-chrome but different in firefox driver browser

22767766
for-loop	loops
do while loops will run once even if the condition in while is false.you can solve this by either using a while loops or for-loop

google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
it works well on on ie8+ opera firefox and google-chrome but not on safari and i canâ t figure out why

22767873
maven	pom.xml
my android project is set up to use maven so i imported into intellij from the pom.xml file

22767889
g++	gcc
g++ gcc has many options used for debugging a program but the most common one is -g

22767902
opencv	emgucv
what i can see is that the emgucv opencv kmeans2 classifier is returning different results given the same surf descriptor input

22767968
int	chars
the second is that the bitwise-not in javascript casts the argument to a 32-bit signed int whereas it appears that you expect it to be treated as an unsigned chars 8-bits

22767987
versioning	upgrade
when i upgrade via nuget this is the dll versioning i see

22767987
versioning	upgrade
after the upgrade i am still seeing references in project files to entityframeworksection versioning 6.0.0.0 in my config files app.config web.config etc

22768013
ilist	icollection
to fix this error either change the json to a json object name value or change the deserialized type to an array or a type that implements a collection interface icollection ilist like list that can be deserialized from a json array

22768049
png	ico
image files such as jpg and png sends successfully however files like pdf and ico can not send

post	get
if you post the networking code of both the client and the server you will be able to get more accurate feedback than just my general and top-level answer

22768150
width	height
of course you can change the height and width of the div to suit your needs

22768150
width	height
with a specified width and height should i think create a scrollable area in your page similar to the output of an iframe but without requiring the browser to load two copies of the contents

22768210
aho-corasick	rabin-karp
i suggest aho-corasick or rabin-karp but a suffix tree may also come in handy

22768210
aho-corasick	rabin-karp
rabin-karp is the easiest to implement of those but aho-corasick does not use hashes and so you don t need to take special care of collisions

22768257
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
i am able to do it with a checkbox don t want to use and i can do it on a dropdownlistfor where the datasource is local json

22768259

22768355
inherited	properties
i just wanted to make sure my understanding of properties inherited was correct

22768355
getter	setter
now when i try and make a subclass and access those properties using my getter and setter i cannot access them from my subclass

22768427
config	ini
this is probably because you have a newer config for supervisor that doesn t include ini files

22768432
onclicklistener	onitemclicklistener
in you onclicklistener this means onitemclicklistener not context

22768471
super	extends

google-chrome	firefox
i tried different browsers ie firefox google-chrome and different computers both in my office and home but couldn t reproduce the problem

22768736
nscoding	nssecurecoding
what is important is that the classes of the objects in the array support the nscoding or nssecurecoding protocol

22768736
nsurl	nsstring
many foundation framework classes support nscoding out of the box nsstring nsurl nsarray nsdictionary etc.

22768764
superclass	subclassing
whenever you will be defining any class without making it a subclassing of any other class object becomes the default superclass of these class s

22768799
cout	cin
in c++ when writing to and taking information from the console using cout cin is it possible to do something like

22768799

ideally i d like to do this using iostream cin cout because those are what i ve used in the past

22768852
interpolation	splines
in finmath lib there is a class called curve which implements some interpolation schemes linear splines akima etc.

22768912
children	parent
because i know that a treenode always has to have a parent except for the root of course the reference counting of shared_ptr seems irrelevant to me as a parent will always outlive the pointer to it its children contain so i might even use raw pointers at this point

22768981
setinterval	settimeout
i had the same problem and solved it with a combination of setinterval and settimeout like this

22768992
filtering	grouping
i use these 2 columns as the two grouping by filtering to users can easily navigate and find their use case

22769007

it is instead using this toggle which show and hide elements

22769007

hide	show
since there is now only one toggle the hide show one that is what you are actually calling even though you are trying to call the old now removed one

22769037
mouse	keyboard
briefly it lets you manipulate input from keyboard or mouse

22769039
codeception	mink
codeception has no method to grab href of the link because it too special case but you can define your own action in webhelper class to grab href using mink api

22769040
children	parent
the parent would contain three fewer digits the siblings would have different last three digits and the children would have the exact same code plus any number of additional digits in the form .xxx.xxx

22769040
children	parent
i need to understand how to extract the first term motor activity f01.145.632 then the siblings f01.145.632 with last three digits different children f01.145.632 with any number of additional digits .xxx.xxx and parent f01.145.632 less last three digits from the hash

22769105
dlsym	dlopen
it is exceptionally helpful when you load pkcs#11 library dynamically with dlopen because you don t need to acquire function pointer for all 60+ functions with dlsym call

22769107
carrierwave	paperclip
if you are uploading files you might want to use paperclip or carrierwave

22769148

22769175
getter	setter
i understand that thy byte code would actually write the getter and setter

22769175
getter	setter
my understanding is that if there is no var or val then there is no getter or setter method generated

22769205
pop-up	dialog
it will make die loop at the while line and never pop-up any alert dialog to show neither success nor fail

22769226

i ve seen a lot of counters using setinterval and settimeout but this is not what i m after

22769251
gruntjs	yeoman
i playing around with yeoman gruntjs bower bootstrap and the yo angular app

22769259
hash	hmac
the cryptographic signature is an hmac hash generated from the timestamp using the secret key

22769263
google-chrome	firefox
however since both the application servers are running on different ports my browser google-chrome and firefox treats the requests as a cors request

22769318

that workaround is to add a missing jar to the demo war which you can do with a couple of shell commands

this works on google-chrome but not on firefox latest version

22772530
screens	tablet
if the majority of your users will be pc tablet based but you also want to support mobiles with the one application then you should take a look at the bootstrap css framework which provides an easy way to create a responsive ui which will look usable on most screens sizes however it won t look like a native mobile app which from my experience is where jquery spring mobile have the advantage they make web apps look like native mobile applications although whilst they can viewed on a pc tablet they won t look great scaled up

22772558
int	double
if you change the type of double to int and change the argument type in the print statement then the code returns the correct numbers but then prints 1073741824 then -2147483648 then 0 until the loop runs out

sugar.js	underscore.js
whant to use sugar.js or underscore.js

int	chars
the unary plus converts the chars a to an int its ascii code 97 which is then converted to a string 97 by the concatenation with an empty string

22772595
put	get
on the other hand when you put + you do an assigment and converting right side to integer sto you get integer 97

22772646
post	get
if anyone reads this post runtimebrowser link given by wduk to get private headers of any framework does this perfectly without any hassle specially the mac version

22772681
int	chars
saying that the conversion to chars from int may alter its value i have a few errors of these in the source code so if i can fix this one then the others will be a piece of cake

int	chars
many c chars functions in fact take and return int s as chars

22772786

. i want to view col 2 and find the minimum value i also have to do this for max but similar idea within that column and return that row that has the minimum number in col 2 for each number in col 1

22772802
int	chars
the warning is generated because tolower returns int which is common for the c runtime library chars manipulation functions

22772802
int	chars
assigning an int to chars can result in truncation of the value since on most machines a chars is one-byte and an int is two or more hence the warning

22772813
int	chars
int are represented using more bytes than chars do

22772813
int	chars
therefore if you try to turn an int to a chars you will have to get rid of the extra bytes potentially altering the int s value

22772829
comparator	comparable
if you are using map.entry it doesn t implement comparable so even comparator would fail

22772860
pow	sqrt
i ran into problems when calculating the larger prime numbers 46349 due to integer overflow but fixed that by using sqrt instead of pow

22772871

elasticsearch	kibana
then i d watch graphite for real time error and health anomaly detection and use kibana and elasticsearch underneath to dig deeper

so my guess is your are calling app2 without ssl no https but inside the app2 there is some https involved certainly some ajax query

22773643
maven	pom.xml
another typical maven gotcha in using snapshots is that you re not sure precisely which versions of dependencies your pom.xml could be consuming during the build so make sure your build calls dependency tree and dependency list preceding your other mvn build arguments

inline	inlining
haskell semantics gives us guarantees about when such inlining transformations do not change the meaning of the program thus the choice the compiler makes about whether or not to inline has no effect on the meaning of the program so long as it doesn t violate the assumptions of those guarantees

22773893
inline	inlining
for instance there s a big debate about whether or not library authors should use inline as it tends to suggest a lack of faith in ghc s own inlining heuristics and thus that we should spend more effort tightening those up rather than littering code with manual inline s

22789037
min	max
in order to get overflow-y to work you need to specify an explicit min max height for the .chat-messages-wrapper element

22789079
post	get
so before beginning developing db what you suggest json vs sqlite or use http methods get post

22789118

22789534
width	height
think of it as just a rectangular form width screen size and height 20px or so

22789535
maven	m2e
m2e on the other hand wants more control over how the maven jvm is kicked off so it does this directly without the wrapper

22789535
maven	m2e
if you want m2e to pass what you already have in maven_opts to the maven jvm in the edit configuration and launch dialog in eclipse

22789540
wildfly	jboss
wildfly and jboss use resteasy jackson as implementation of the jax-rs and there is no problem with mapping

22789540
jboss	glassfish	wildfly	jboss	wildfly	glassfish
you can use resteasy instead of jersey in any java application server wildfly jboss glassfish or tomcat

you should also make a s and possibly b s destructor s either public or protected

22789575

textview	imageview
i d like to change for example bitmap shown in imageview contained within remote view s layout or change text value in a textview

22789595
decoder	encoder
if interchanging the format between languages other than go or reading it as a stream is not important to you just use the gob encoder and decoder

22789595
decoder	encoder
the idea is that you create an encoder around a writer or a decoder around a reader and then just ask them to encode or decoder a struct

22789642
post	get
if you get stuck please post what you tried and i ll get you going in the right direction

22789649
google-chrome	firefox
this is confusing as it works in both google-chrome and firefox

22789651

if min -10.0 max 5.0 and interval 1.0 then it ll show -10 -9 -8.

22789729
ostringstream	std
you hold the mutex while populating std ostringstream out but not while streaming it to std cout

22789729
ostringstream	std
if you care about performance you can make the global std ostringstream out a function-local variable i don t know why you have so many globals in the first place so that each thread has its own copy

22789788
int	double
if you want to pull numbers out separately then the default streamtokenizer configuration is fine although it uses double and provides no int numeric tokens

22789815
rtsp	rtmp
you can use a streaming cdn like scaleengine.com to transcode and supply the necessary bandwidth to have streaming for all devices rtmp for browsers hls for ios devices and rtsp for android

22789856
put	get
you don t have to do such manual validation however for example in spring mvc you can put javax.validation.valid on a bean being passed into a method and it will get validated automatically

22789879
int	double
in short d is for int and f is for floating-point numbers which includes double

22789879
int	double
however i would avoid using numerical fields int float double to store things like zip codes

22789889
chown	sudo	folder	dir
if your normal employees users can use sudo you can chown all the folder so they are owned by root and a new group called programmers by doing chown -r root programmers var www dir this will make dir and everything in it owned by root and the group programmers

22789889
folder	dir
this will make it so that the root user has r w x permissions on dir and all folder in it that is the 7 users in the programmers group would have read only permissions the 4 and all other users would have read only permissions the last 4

22789889
chown	chmod
then for the files that you want him to edit let use say his username is frontdev you could do chown -r frontdev employees var www dir front-end views and then chmod that directory to 774...and you can do the same for individual files

22789988
portrait	landscape
on ipad there are big differences between landscape and portrait mode for example controller that is normally root view controller of my main navigation controller while in portrait in landscape it becomes a container for a new navigation controller that holds all the other controllers so making sure that view controllers get properly notified about rotations is crucial for the app to work

22789992
nsnull	nsstring
it looks like the problem is that some of the objects you are loading from the json have a title that is not an nsstring but an nsnull

22790013
children	parent
but that doesn t cover the odd case of 5 3 2 7 8 4 6 which just kind of skips around but makes sure that a node s parent is supplied before any of its children

versioning	upgrade
wix 2.0.5805 unfortunately i cannot upgrade to a newer versioning of wix at this time

width	height
i would like to restrict my div s width to 200px and make the input boxes 100 width and height inside the div

22790186
lxml	html5lib
use lxml parser instead of html5lib - it is much much and 3 more muches faster

22790186
lxml	beautifulsoup
another solution would be to use lxml for everything from parsing replace beautifulsoup to creating the xml replace xml.etree.elementtree

22790190
voip	sip
it would depend on your voip provider the number of simultaneous calls they allow you to do with one account you can try sip trunk providers such as switch2voip call center voip they allow unlimited concurrent calls with very low rates

22790194

that will produce a builds folder in the curl source directory which will have your curl.exe libcurl.dll and libcurl.lib

22790337
getter	setter
but not because testing setter and getter is good but because it comes from testing if your code does what you expect it to do in terms of external requirements

22790392

on desktop the first has a 60 width and the second 40 and both have variable height

22790416

22790419
inherited	properties
there is no selector to only target the free floating text of an element without affecting the inherited properties of other elements within

22790419
inherited	properties
however in your specific case that checkbox does not have many if any inherited properties in most browsers default stylesheet

22790419
inherited	properties
so a long as you aren t using a reset stylesheet or otherwise normalizing that input to inherited style properties you could get away with styling the label to affect only the text

22790433

int	double
in your cases math operations result could be an int or a double

22790542
min	max
7 dbms_profiler - collects as i understand by default it collects only statistics min max time

22790593
children	parent
my structure object has parent children relationships on it but only the first page of results is actually being associated correctly

22790617
implements	extends
also you have to wrap the close method with a try-catch and any class that extends inputstream must either be declared abstract or implements the method read

this will not happen on google-chrome firefox and ie10

22791256
google-chrome	firefox
i d like to write a google-chrome or firefox extension to capture video being displayed in a window or tab

it s just a matter of having a hover state where you can change the width + height or you can use transform scale

22791326
int	double
you d encounter this error had you tried any of the primitives int long double etc..

22791332
post	get
you can get the current page post id using

22791339
post	get
the get method will append the form variables to the url using the post method

22791339
post	get
post is a little safer than get because the parameters are not stored in browser history or in web server logs. also data is not displayed in the url

22791342
mouseup	mousedown
edit so far i have tried to capture mouseup mousedown events with a simple button control but that only helps with moving the control within the form

22791365
comparator	comparable
my understanding is that requires that whatever type t ends up it must implement comparable and therefore must have a comparator function

22791396
cos	sin
further optimization is obtained by computing both cos and sin values at once so that the powers are only computed once

22791442

you are reactivating your variable i in your nested for-loop under the do while loops which also utilizing i

22791758
apache	nginx
you don t need to use apache or nginx with node.js but in practice its probably a good idea

22791758
apache	nginx
the node http server module is great for firing up quick applications but if you need things like ssl complex mod_rewrites directory security detailed logs etc ie all the stuff you would need in a commercial application you need or at least its easier to use apache or nginx in front of node

the problem is there footer doesn t get down based on sidebar s size it just does this with the post size

22792300
children	parent
the parent process sends his pid to his first child and this one sends his parent s pid plus his own pid to his next brother and it happens until we have created n children

22792300
children	parent
after that the parent process gets the addition of the pid of all his children

22792300
children	parent
let s suppose that the parent process pid is 3400 and we create two children so the ring is made of three processes

22792324
folder	dir
this is how far i have got but can t seem to create folder in the clientmedia_name dir

22792326
webclient	httpwebrequest
webclient is just a wrapper around httpwebrequest

using webclient is potentially slightly on the order of a few milliseconds slower than using httpwebrequest directly

22792330
debian	linux
we use linux debian with python 2.7

22792365

i had to wrap the memmove inside a function because if i left it inline gcc optimized it and performed the exact same as memcpy i assume gcc optimized it to memcpy because it knew the locations didn t overlap

bad news is that the asmlib version of memmove is slower than the glibc version it is now running at the 300ms mark on par with the glibc version of memcpy

22810022

i would advise just using the addclass and removeclass methods in jquery

22810023

22810067
hide	show
i think you are suffering a problem between show editor and hide editor

this happens because show hide really means switch between text editing and wysiwyg html editing and apply some html filtering to try to correct mistakes as you swap between the two modes

22810177
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
i have a problem with the availability of the values of checkbox and dropdownlistfor in my webforms page

22810211

if you can use all your cpus with all cores and all the ram you want with postgresql you will always be faster than some cut-down express or standard version of sql-server with 1 cpu and 1 to a few gb of ram windows limits you to 64gb in 64-bit afaik with linux you can exceed the 4 gb ram per application limit even on a 32 bit processors with the bigmem kernel and can get it to address 64 gb ram on a 32 bit processors not to mention the 64-bit limits no matter how super-over-optimized the query optimizer is on sql-server

22810211
whatsapp	skype
yes actually skype and whatsapp runs its database on postgresql

22810211

and also check css of your element height and width on which you are clicking and yes

22810286
google-chrome	firefox
since google-chrome and firefox display a blank page rather than en error even though they would display a 404 and not a blank page in case i type a wrong url so i m not sure how this works i want to create a custom 405 message so i ve added this line to my .htaccess

22810326
oncreate	onstart
you could do this in the onstart or onresume methods which are called after oncreate but also after stopping or pausing of the activity

22810335

22810404
accelerometer	gyroscope
the pipe is firmly connected whit an unknown position and orientation to a imu equipped with an accelerometer and a gyroscope sample frequency 110 hz

22810427
free	malloc
malloc free keywords are use the heap

22810427
free	malloc
second i see written somewhere that we can t use free after new or use delete after malloc

22810449
google-chrome	firefox
but the major drawback of kango extension is that it builds the extension for open source non-profitable project like google-chrome firefox

22810472
free	malloc
malloc free keywords are use the heap

22810495
free	malloc
additionally free will not call destructors and then c++ classes may provide specialized memory management which will definitely break if you mix it with malloc free

22810512
geocoding	geocode
however you also had errors when defining the actual polyline because geocoding is asynchronous you cant call creation of the polyline after geocode lines instead you need to make separate method or similar callback functionality which is called when geocoding finishes

22810605
width	height
if you create an actor with width 8 and height 5 it will always be half of the screen width and half of the screen height big

22810605
width	height
the other way is by setting the viewport to the same coordinate systems as the pixels on the screen stage.setviewport width height false

22810605
width	height
doing so will always make the actor be exactly one fifth of the screen width and have its height matched so it doesn t get distorted

22810621
free	malloc
although new might be implemented through malloc and delete might be implemented through free there s no guarantee that they are really implemented that way and also the user can overload new and delete at his discretion

22810621
free	malloc
other than that don t forget that when you call malloc you get raw memory - no constructor is invoked - and when you call free no destructor is invoked

22810724

22810767

setvisible to toggle the visibility of jlabel s to display error messages but to be honest i might be tempted to use a full alpha color to hide the text and a full opaque color to show as this won t effect the layout

22828516
vbo	vao
instead each sprite has its own vbo vao of four textured vertices drawn as a triangle strip the vao vbo itself is managed by the texture atlas so identical sprites reuse the same vao vbo which is reference counted and hence deleted when no sprite instances reference it

width	height
if you set either width or height for an image the other property will be calculated automatically according to the aspect ratio

22829019
width	height
in your fiddle all images have same height but they differ in width

22829019
width	height
so if you set it s the width and leave height height will be automatically calculated and since width and aspect ratio of the images are different calculated height will also differ

22829019
width	height
if you set the height of the images then the height will be same regardless of the window size but width will be calculated automatically and will differ with respect to aspect ratio as in this fiddle

22829019
width	height
if you set both height and width explicitly then the aspect ratio will be compromised

22829024
put	get
i know that to get the current child showing in the app i would need to put

22829155
getter	setter
create public getter setter methods inside the inner class for private variables

i m not using hide or show

22830525
hide	show
the problem is that the show-hide or slideup-slidedown is working to show or hide the content but nor animating as it should

22830525
hide	show
intead i found that the more you increase the value or slideup-down show-hide the more delay it has in getting the elements show or hide

22830582
post	get
now i ve worked with post and get requests before

22830582

instead of adding a sleep which as mentioned by markbaker in the comments still holds memory and record locks consider packaging your cron jobs into smaller pieces of work

22830855
apache-poi	jxls
for very complex reports apache-poi is preferred though since performance issues creep up in jxls

22830860
for-loop	arrays
next you are watching the value of scope.field which appears to be an arrays based upon your for-loop

22830902
implements	extends
make a custom class by extends column and implements and make it serializable

22830931
int	double
however the example only covers double as parameters and return values the above uses an int

22830931
clang	llvm
instead of using the llvm api i should use the clang api because clang as a compiler can compile the code into a module

22831300
gruntjs	yeoman
you could also checkout a project like yeoman which provides a pre-packaged front end development environment using gruntjs so you don t have to spend a lot of time getting setup

22831307
min	max
for this solution to work you ll need min and max values for each node

22831307
min	max
it is just a way of creating fictitious min and max values

22831316
min	max
because max or min can only return null if all of the inputs were null

22831316
min	max
similarly if you wanted to check that all of the values where all some specific non- null value you could check that by first confirming the the min and max of that column were equal and then checking either one of them against the sought for value

22831344
width	height
for this code min-height and max-width is not working at all though height and width are working as expected

22831363
screens	tablet
this is okay on mobile phones but on tablet another fragment should be added to the viewpager so that the whole screens is filled

i have a directory full of scanned documents grouped into different folder and subfolders based on year month and date

22831416

22831502
superclass	subclassing
what you have to do is creating a getter in the superclass and using it from the subclassing in order to access these attributes

22831502
superclass	subclassing
well i have been always using protected attributes in an abstract superclass and accessing them from the subclassing directly and i always thought there was nothing wrong with it

22831505
addition	multiplication
matrix multiplication no float arithmetic o log n time complexity assuming integer multiplication addition is done in constant time

22831523

22831726
getter	setter
so as other threads already point out it appears to be so that it s indeed recommended to use getter and setter

22831726
getter	setter
a getter setter allow you to program in a way that you send the getter setter the data you want and they will store it in the proper field for you appending it to the stringbuilder

22831726
getter	setter
however declaring the variable as protected seems pretty weird when you use a getter and a setter as well

22831726
getter	setter
i personally try to avoid getter setter when they are a bit of overkill

22831732
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
just change the getelementbyid to getelementsbytagname

22832505
width	height
vim has a and where n specifies the height width of the split respectively

22832505
width	height
note you can also use resize +n resize -n vertical resize +n and vertical resize -n for changing the height width relative to the present value

22832505
width	height
vim s and resizes the current split to it s maximum size if you omit the so resize will make the window occupy the entire height of the screen and vertical resize will make the window occupy the entire width of the screen

i am looking to use angular eventually but it s a steep learning curve to achieve the same functionality that tablesorter gives me in terms of looks filtering sorting and pagination

22833016

22839661
versioning	upgrade
one more thing with cordova it is always good to have the docs at hand and have a look at them each time you are using a new plugin or when you upgrade to a newer versioning they tend to change the api frequently hence the examples found in google usually show legacy code

22839675
fflush	gets

22839825
post	get
with a form you should still be able to use the form launch option as described in the previous post you might need to use lotusscript -- create a back-end notesdocument object with form whatever then use wksp.editdocument to open it in read mode -- or you can use code to read the design note locate it using notecollection class grab the rich-text body item get the embeddedobject save it to a file and launch it using a shell function

there s no equivalent of a uibuttongroup that you would use with radio button although you can of course graphically group the checkbox in a uipanel

i am having the hardest time figuring out why this will not work on google-chrome or ie but works great in firefox

22844590

to make this work i think the handler methods as well as any fxml-annotated fields need to be directly accessible by the subclass public or protected or default visibility if the subclass is in the same package as the abstract controller

22844591

use google-chrome dev tools or firebug extension firefox and inspect the element

22844602
superclass	subclassing
how can we change the values of instance variable of superclass in subclassing and please also explain how you had this

22844602

22845220
for-loop	loops
removed the for-loop within the while loops

22845221
entities	entitymanager
i could also create an entity and use the setters but a. this is not a generic solution and b. requires manual conversion of properties from strings to the property types something the jpa entitymanager already does and knows how to do for managed entities

but its no good as i might add more children later and afaik you can t access child scope from the parent anyways not sure why

22845426
wan	lan
for example if the destination is a wan address it would be the address of the lan interface because i am behind a nat

width	height
also i haven t found any way of targeting the function with css - the jsmovie plugin overrides any css that targets the png s width or height

22845459
filewriter	printwriter
so you should wrap the filewriter into a printwriter and use println

try using them and if get errors or can t use then contact your docusign account manager or post the issues here.

22845589
mousemove	mouseup
listen for mousemove and mouseup on the stage note you can use pressmove on the target to make this work a little more cleanly but you will not get additional rollovers

22845589
mousemove	mouseup
on mouseup stop the mousemove mouseup and determine what the mouse was released on

22845596

22845627
box-sizing	border-box
try using box-sizing border-box

22845635
onresume	onpause
instead of the onresume and onpause you can override the dismiss to unregister and in the oncreatedialog method you can register the bus

22845643
width	border-box	box-sizing	border-box
the 1px border you put around the inner-divs increases the with of these div s to prevent that and include the border in the css width property you can use box-sizing border-box

22845696
box-sizing	border-box
box-sizing border-box

22845698
getter	setter
you need a synthesize statement in your classb.m file so the compiler will make a getter and a setter for your property

22845743
superclass	subclassing
those methods in superclass which access the old variable still continue to read and write that variable and methods in subclassing access new variable

22845746
maven	pom.xml
for my case i could remove the docx4j from maven pom.xml

22845755
ggplot2	aesthetics
the reason you got that error is that aesthetics mappings are inherited between layers in ggplot2

22845852
loops	if-statement

i have the email portion from sinatra working but every time i post on my local i get

22845962
width	height
you got it all wrong the reqheight and reqwidth parameters should be the image view width and height and not the original image dimension

22845982
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
the importance of instance variables in superclass is that they will be inherited by all the subclassing of that superclass reducing code redundancy

22845982
superclass	subclassing
to alter the value of set the value of a private instance variable from a superclass use the super keyword in the constructor of the subclassing

22845982
mutators	setter
to alter the value of the instance variable after instantiation use a mutators setter method defined in the superclass

22845990
post	get
i ve looked through plenty of examples and tried many different ways and i ve not been able to get my knockout to post to my controller using mvc 4

22845999
free	malloc
i use malloc free because deleting void pointers using delete is unspecified behaviour

22846016
int	double
those are default int promotions and promotion of float to double

22846016
integer	unsigned
default integer promotions every integer type of rank less than int is promoted to int or unsigned int

22846093
disk	ram
as for setprocessworkingsetsize ... -1 -1 that pushes memory out of ram onto disk

22846131

22846262
fflush	gets
code on the main thread has an autoreleasepool set up by the os itself so each time you return to the main event loop everything that s been autoreleased gets fflush out

22846286
background-position	background-size	background-image	background-position	background-image	background-size	background-repeat	background-position	background-repeat	background-image	background-repeat	background-size
you should be able to do this putting the image as the background-image property i would also use background-size cover and background-position center as well as background-repeat no-repeat to make sure that the background image always covers the entire div

22846294
try-catch	exception-handling
finally wrapping a system call in a try-catch block is pointless since it doesn t trow exception-handling

22846333
min	max
the algorithm hinges on that equation as it allows you to use the pow function once to calculate b from the desired min value y 0 0 and max value y k 1 that you want and use an iterative multiply to calculate each sample of the adsr curve as is found in the pseudocode

22846352
coalesce	isnull
you can use a left join and then account for the nulls with coalesce or isnull

22846362
int	chars
won t get you what you want it gets numbers from file in chars format not int

22846376
width	height
sounds like what you want is for the background images to fit these containers without explicitly setting a height and width

22846376
background-position	background-size	background-repeat	background-position	background-repeat	background-size
i would recommend using background-size cover background-position center and background-repeat no-repeat to accomplish this

22846376
width	height
alternatively if you don t want to cover the entire div maybe in the case of the logo you could set the width as a percentage and the height as auto or vice versa

22846449
put	get
i don t think the app is pulling data from the page because when i put the url in the address bar i just get a json object that says

22846461
submit	submission
so what it does it binds to the submit event and if the form is invalid it prevents the form from submission

22846461
ng-style	ng-class
and using ng-style or ng-class you can style your button as expected depending on your form state

22846501
spaces	delimiter
also this assumes that all words are spaces delimiter

22846520
min	max
when i ad 1 to the max argument it works rnd.next min max + 1

22846520
min	max
but why only zeroes when it is left like this rnd.next min max

22846527
width	height
if you don t want content in the divs and don t like setting the height and width in css but do wish to set the image in rthe css and not directly in the html - you could have a play with

22846549
hide	show
we need to hide the content until it should be show so define a rule in the css-sheet for that

22846557
range	max	range	min	min	max
random.next produces a number in the range -- that means min is a possible result but max is not

22846576
sorting	filtering
the pagination between the sites is working the filtering and also the sorting

22846579
equals	gethashcode
also your equals and gethashcode implementations are broken

22846579
multiplying	addition
a better option is to use multiplying by primes and addition to work out the hash codes

22846589
stdout	stderr
which insert stdout and stderr in output.txt

22846684
width	height
the problem is that now i am making responsive websites the image width and height can scale to an unknown size

22846699
portrait	landscape
i m developing a responsive site but i can see well only in portrait when turning to landscape all elements beyond

22846707

width	height
so is there some function like get this image and search for a nose between x and y and x + width and y + height pixels and give me the coordinates of nose

22846817
width	height
your outermost view is a relative layout with width and height set to fill the screen that s what fill parent does

22846817
width	height
now inside that relative layout you have a linearlayout with width and height set to match its parent relativelayout

22846817
width	height
now inside that you have a text view with width and height set to fill it s parent linearlayout and since linearlayout is taking full screen your textview will fill the whole screen

22846817
folder	directory
the best way to support smaller screen is that in your res directory create a layout-small folder and place the same xml layout file in there but change the dimensions of your textview

22846817
width	height
if you want the text to be as large as its size you can do wrap_content for both width and height

width	height
and remove width and height in the img tag

22847080
shim	polyfills
i have all proper shim and polyfills and best practices in place otherwise

22847143
comparator	comparable
if the objects you are putting into your treeset implement comparable then you can override the comparator method to add the special handling for part number

22847194
ienumerable	iqueryable
because iqueryable inherits from ienumerable you can use functions in the seq module such as tolist and toarray

22847220
width	height
just add a link into the slide text and use css to style it to the width and height 100 of the slide box

22847234
ubuntu	linux

disk	ram
so i was thinking about loading only the data from the column that has to be sorted in ram and a pointer to the address into the disk file of the entry

22847312
disk	ram
the restoration will be written directly to disk so no additional ram will be required

22847329
hide	show
i somply don t want to hide show things when i need to copy paste them...i would like excel to do everything silently in background

22847338
width	height
so if it is a wide figure it should use the full width of my screen and the height is then given by the aspect ratio or if it is a very high portrait format figure it should use the full height of the screen and the width is defined by the aspect ratio

22847390
width	height
height and width defines paddle size image is texture for the paddle

22847393
versioning	upgrade
will probably result in a conflict reported by apt if you upgrade to the next versioning

22847413
folder	directory
in a dream world git submodules would have been the way i went but i can t use those in joomla because of they way it s directory is structured there isn t just one folder i can jump into that houses all the component files

22847415
post	get
i m trying to get all the comments for a particular post using the route

22847427
client-side	server-side
charts in the image chart api do send data to google s servers as they generate the images server-side rather than client-side but this api is deprecated anyway so you probably shouldn t be using it

22847449
min	max
cos-all-limited.1.2 an all model group must appear in a particle with min occurs max occurs 1 and that particle must be part of a pair which constitutes the content type of a complex type definition

22847655
min	max
i cannot find any functions that given a min and a max return all the values in that interval for any of the structures in containers

22847674
put	get
you should get rid of listwrapper and simply put your tasks directly into the threadpool

22847725
submit	submission
essentially i have a popup and then i wait for the form to submit and then close it so that the user cannot edit the webpage mid-way through submission

22847733
drawingvisual	rendertargetbitmap
if that s still not good enough you can rasterize your drawingvisual using rendertargetbitmap and then use imagebrush instead of the visualbrush that s good only if the text is static - if you would like to use animations you must use the visualbrush without rasterization

22847742
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i ve tested it with google-chrome phantomjs safari and firefox

if device is currently in landscape immediately rotate to portrait even if user is still holding the device in portrait and remain in portrait until the user rotates the device to portrait and then rotates back to landscape

if i change the requested orientation to unspecified or sensor in onconfigurationchanged the orientation briefly flips to landscape portrait whatever i requested from above and then snaps back to the orientation that matches how the device is held

22848230
charindex	substr
since it has been stated in a comment on the original question that no names will ever have a v suffix you can use charindex to find the position of v space-v-space and then use substr to get both parts

22848282
client-side	server-side
the onclick event you are using is a javascript client-side event and will be executed when the user clicks on the element but since you are outputting the string out from php server-side and you are concatenating the values of the string constants and the updfavourites function php executes the server-side code and then gives the client-side code which is the evaluated php function

22848362
strcpy	strtok
variables as parameters to functions such as strcpy and strtok -- which expect

punctuation	words
you can do this with the default scanner provided there is no punctuation not attached to a words otherwise you can set the characters the scanner skips

22848579
xwpf	hwpf
as per apache poi docs for docx you have to use xwpf not hwpf apis

22848579
xwpf	hwpf
the partner to hwpf for the new word 2007 .docx format is xwpf

22848579
xwpf	hwpf
hwpf and xwpf does not share any common interface methods code

the last uses the http get protocol but switching to post is trivial

22848778
hide	show
i am trying to show and hide divs using the textbox value

22848824
post	get
blejzer answer is an easy and straight forward solution unless you are also working with spring security always recommended in which case you should prefer post instead of get for all modification operations such as delete to protect against csrf attack

22848824
post	get
take a look at quick checklist for choosing http get or post for detailed information

22848840
versioning	upgrade
expiring urls for rackspace only made it into fog somewhat recently -- v1.18.0 -- so if you re using an older versioning you may need to upgrade fog to take advantage of them

22848861
put	get
as of now i can only get it to show me the value that i put in

22848872
namedtuple	dictionary
the class is kind of a dictionary or namedtuple of attributes and executable functions

22848926
post	get
i m trying to get my head around why data annotation validation errors are triggering when the page first loads prior to any submit post

22849032
hide	show
just hide all divs first and then show all you want after

22849056
strcpy	strncpy
just be careful when using either strcpy or strncpy - the former is prone to buffer overflows if the null terminator is omitted and the latter although safer in the sense that it will limit the number of copied characters will omit the null terminator if there is insufficient length remaining

22849106
pysimplesoap	suds
i am going to post this question for both suds and pysimplesoap

22849137
clearinterval	settimeout
you should either cancel the interval using clearinterval or use a one off settimeout

22849138
google-chrome	firefox
animation is working on google-chrome but on firefox i see the following error in console

22849166
implements	extends
for example you can declare a foo bean that extends no classes except object and implements no interfaces

22849166
implements	extends
for whatever reason you can decide that you want to proxy this bean and make it implements the bar interface and extends the somerandomtype class

22849193
comparator	comparable
add a comparator method to implement the interface comparable

22849225
mdpi	hdpi
and four generalized densities low ldpi medium mdpi high hdpi extra high xhdpi

22849225
mdpi	hdpi
this means that if you generate a 200x200 image for xhdpi devices you should generate the same resource in 150x150 for hdpi 100x100 for mdpi and 75x75 for ldpi devices

22849268
many-to-one	one-to-many
let s take the simple example of department and employee where a department has a one-to-many employees relationship and hence the reverse many-to-one department relationship from employee to department

22849277
equals	compareto
here you just want to add the keyword implements followed by the interface you wish to implement on the class declaration then do pretty much exactly what you did with the equals method only with compareto

22849294
folder	directory
if you have access to the command line and have either python or ruby you can just run one of the following commands in the folder directory to start a local server

22849314
children	parent
another table contains the contacts attached to parent i want to add contacts parent to each of their children

22849380

if your height is bigger and width is smaller than container width will be stretch to 100 and height will be trimmed from both side

22849412
crypto++	gpgme
i m also looking at crypto++ and gpgme

22849448
scalaz	combinators
scalaz has an implementation of futures that includes a chooseany combinators that takes a collection of futures and returns a future of a tuple of the first completed element and the rest of the futures

22849448
pull	push
one approach to getting the operations to run as you wish is to pull two completed items off the list push a future of their sum back on the list and recurse see this gist for a complete working example

22849471
for-loop	loops
the do loops don t exist in bat you have to use a for-loop

22849485
g++	gcc
with the rest of the code the same works for gcc with pedantic and -std c99 and with -std c++11 in clang++ and g++

22849513
post	get
a section there specifies the urls you can post get cross-domain

22849526

as you want deserialization to behave differently from serializable i see 2 ways to achieve this

22849583
versioning	upgrade
i have upgrade sitefinity 5.1 to 6.0 on a website which is in production which included going through a couple of steps for the versioning between

22849583
versioning	upgrade
secondly i didn t test the frontend and backend during the different steps sitefinity versioning within upgrade but i tested everything once my solution had reached the last sitefinity versioning

22849583
versioning	upgrade
one more thing i would like to add it takes time to perform upgrade of several versioning

22849583
versioning	upgrade
the first time i upgrade i needed to go through 2 versioning and having to upgrade locally to a development database deploy the website on developement environment then make it again on test

22849598
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
unchecked-exception that are expected more or less same as above some people like to throw subclasses of runtimeexception instead of exception

22849645
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade to psycopg2 versioning 2.5.2 via

22849696
prototypejs	mootools
the live version of the page has prototypejs mootools or something else that defines a function on it instead of jquery

22849696
prototypejs	mootools
solution make sure you re putting jquery on the page and handle any conflicts with prototypejs mootools whatever with noconflict

22849696
prototypejs	mootools
the live version has jquery and prototypejs mootools or similar on it and jquery is loaded first then overwritten by prototypejs mootools or similar

22849697
int	chars
so uint8_t unsigned chars will be a better candidate in comparison to int

22849706
stdout	stderr
try redirecting all file descriptors stdin stdout stderr to dev null

22849717
portrait	landscape	flip	slide
i ve tried adjusting the .ui-page-active height to 70 and that fixes it on portrait but flip the screen to landscape and the issue comes back i m able to slide my finger up and down the main page while the panel is open and make it scroll up and down

22849731
typedef	struct
note how typedef lets you subsequently reference color_t rather than having to write struct color

22849751
hash	md5
i m trying to figure out a way to improve a c++ win32 program i ve made which basically recursively traverses a given folder and for every given file computes an hash let s say md5 but it could be any sort of cpu expensive computation

22849775
prepare	execute
you can also consider using prepare method to execute sql statements

22849776
cpu	processors
the handling of power states in the os is handled by a kernel driver module which will be specific at least to the particular cpu vendor sometimes also to the cpu model the operations is done differently in an 64-bit amd processors than it is in a 32-bit amd processors

22849796
serializable	deserialization
advantage of doing it in db would be transmitting a slimmer packet across the wire lesser serializable deserialization costs whereas doing it in java you can take advantage of the processing power of a jvm

22849809
thin	unicorn	puma	thin	puma	unicorn
i have a very basic ruby example running on thin but i would like to know how to translate this example to use unicorn or puma as the http server instead

22849972
google-chrome	firefox
tested on ie10 and it works but doesn t work on google-chrome neither firefox .

22849981
width	margin
start with the principle that a table-cell with no padding no margin and no border has the same width as the column

22849998
ssl	https
i have gone about the necessary steps to secure an ssl certificate to enable https

22850009
dbcontext	objectcontext
assuming datadb is a dbcontext not an objectcontext you can wrap it and use the method like this

22850018
slideup	slidedown
i have almost finished my code but the slidedown slideup animation is not working smooth

22850070
pivot-table	crosstab
after some sample data was posted it is clear a pivot-table in access excel known as a crosstab is needed here

22850079
min	max
however the code isn t very good and i think it could be improved maybe using a for-loop but i m not sure how - especially since all of the min max mode estimates are different

22850102
button	checkbox
i am getting errors and having trouble retrieving values from the option button checkbox and the text area

22850113
rcharts	dygraphs
i am trying to recreate an rcharts -based interactive dygraphs chart by running the code.r from this timelyportfolio rcharts_dygraphs github repository

22850118
post	get
many web languages support sending receiving url encoded get parameters in post requests

22850133
width	margin
if you re explicitly setting the width at 190 you don t necessarily need margin auto

22850143
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
it seems to be working with latest google-chrome firefox and safari

22850191
uiview	subviews
now in the mainmenu uiview i have created 4 buttons with all their positions and settings two of which are subviews - options and stats - that so appear and disappear when clicked on the current viewcontroller

22850359
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
if there is some piece of code that should run everytime a view appears you should write your code in viewwillappear or viewdidappear

22850361
httpconnection	downloading
i am trying to figure out how to get the default file name of a file i downloading using an httpconnection

22850361
put	get
i use a rest api to download the file so i can t parse the url for the name and the content-disposition header doesn t contain the name either but when i put the link in my browser it will download the file with the right name so i m thinking it must be possible to get the name from the result of the http request somehow

22850361
httpconnection	downloading
i have read the following two posts which addressed this problem without solving it for my particular situation httpconnection downloading file name and

22850411
let	curry
let s say that i have a method goto int finalx finaly int currx int curry and a string that maybe looks like this

22850428
post	get
you have to change it correspondingly since i can t draw from your post how you get the employees

22850457
width	height
my thoughts were to use stage.setviewport width height and set the width and height to a scaled down resolution so the gui elements wouldn t be so big

22850473
hide	show
i want to hide show some navigation buttons with a function

22850522
getter	setter
i do have various getter and setter for each field but i left them out as i thought it would take up too much space

22850538
mongodb	bson
you need to use bson objectid.from_string to convert your id string to the bson objectid that mongodb is expecting

22850538
mongodb	bson
that bson objectid.from_string call is the ruby equivalent to calling objectid in the mongodb shell

22850538
mongoid	mongomapper
if you re also using mongoid mongomapper or some other odm then you can patch to_bson_id into that as well

22850539
folder	directory
i can match the relative output path folder in my files directory but it s error prone because you re in one folder src files artworks when creating the folder of images and another src documents artworks when creating the html file -- typos are far more likely as you can t ever see the folder and the html file side by side .

22850578
post	get
a url identifies a resource and you can perform various actions on that resource including get ting it and post ing data to it

22850578
post	get
having an existing query string and a method of get leads to the browser having to decide exactly how to combine the two but a query-string + post presents no conflict

22850615
folder	directory
if you re using .net framework v4 open command prompt as an administrator and change directory to your .net framework base folder using

22850649
post	get
i m using pymongo but i can t get the right syntax to post the data from the html to my nosql db

22850712
for-loop	loops
in the condition of the for-loop when you call queue.size it returns zero and loops terminates without running the body

22850751
width	height
i was thinking of keeping a separate sprites.css file it would get minified and concatenated for production deploy that simply contained all of the positions and height width values

22850758
hide	show
the show more div should be directly after the content you want to hide and include the show-more class

22850840
post	get
i have tried following suggestions from other post here with similar questions but i can t get it to work

22850920
put	get	post	get	post	put
such as http get post put delete

22850957
versioning	upgrade
this comes on solr 4.0 and later so first check your solr versioning and do an upgrade if you are still using 3.x versioning

22851053
jasmine	sinon
i could add a new testing dependency like jasmine or sinon and test the js page directly but that still leaves me with feature specs that are trying to hit s3

22851058
spaces	delimiter
this is because it uses white spaces as a delimiter and there are blank entries in a row but no way that i can think of to distinguish them

22851081
disk	ram
sql server manages its own memory very carefully with performance in mind using a large part of the ram allocated to its process as a data cache to reduce disk i o

22851081
disk	ram
it does not make sense to page out those data cache pages to the pagefile as the sole purpose of having that data in ram in the first place is to reduce disk i o

22851081
disk	ram
note that the windows os also uses available ram similarly as disk cache to speed up system operation. since sql server already manages its own memory space this memory space should not be considered pageable and not included in a calculation for pagefile size

22851083
minimum	max
i have an existing query that works really well- it takes a set of claims and creates a minimum start and max end date for a given member with a given provider along with a sum of paid- it strings along for hospital stays where there are interim bills

22851100
prepare	execute
the select call is prepare but never execute as far as i can see

22851100
prepare	execute
on the insert command if you prepare a query you should pass all variables on execute or bind them before

22851140
folder	directory
i placed the csv file in that directory folder

22851165
ggplot2	gam
if it behaves like ggplot2 geom_smooth it internally automatically figures out which of the supported smoothers to call loess for 1000 datapoints gam for 1000

22851178
width	height
for emails without offer schema gmail selects an image within an email as small as 100x100 by scanning through the html image width and height attributes

22851178
width	height
in the second scenario when the image is retrieved although the html width and height attributes says its 560x117 the image processor retrieves the image and detects the real image dimension as 560x162

22851189
width	height
for example you might need to add a twitter button or change the size to all of your social buttons by adding one more class to the first one and overriding the height and width

22851217
put	get
if you want to get and put object of type t what you probably need is bunch of interfaces which take only one parameter t

22851236
int	double
now i ve provided implementations for the int float and double operators

width	height
for example i created the scene as 640x960 and it always stays that height and width even when the app starts at different

22851258
interpolation	splines
i want to include splines interpolation of eigen splines into a larger formula and want to determine the derivative of this formula with the help of eigen autodiff

22851268
maven	pom.xml
in my external maven project here are my dependencies in pom.xml

hash	hmac
it seems like hmac authentication relies on a private key which is used to generate a hash on the client side and used to re-create the same hash on the server-side for comparison

22851362
public	protected
each class should have a protected constructor which accepts its own derived parameters type and include a public static factory method which will construct a suitable parameter object and pass it to the constructor within a try-with-resources block something like

ready	each
what is stopping you from simply looping in your main method and passing each iteration to these methods sum lucky even...your variables should usually be initialized at top or at the beginning of a method to have those around the life of a methods execution.below is clearly not compile ready code however this will edge you in the right place to understand this problem more than use brackets

fgets	getline	fgets	strtod	strtod	getline
the correct way to parse something like this is use fgets or getline if you have it to read an entire line manually check for and skip over the leading s then use strtod to parse the number then check whether strtod set to point to a newline

22852258
onclick	onsubmit

22868253
button	checkbox	hide	show
my question is can i show hide this radio button group when author checks unchecks the checkbox because the radio button group is dependent on check box.it will be pleasing when i hide this group when check box is unchecked

22868275

what i want to do instead is get all the the users related to a post of a given id

22868362
post	get
but at the same time i also want to get the comments associated with that post

22868376
uiview	caanimation
when using gesture driven uipercentdriveninteractivetransition with cabasicanimation or any other caanimation upon finishinteractivetransition animation jumps to final position rather then animating smoothly as is the case when using uiview block animation

22868376
uiview	caanimation
there seems to be no mention anywhere about using caanimation with custom vc transitions everyone refers to uiview block based animation

22868429
post	get
this work fine with the get method but it did works with the post json as input

22868462
mapquest	osmdroid
.jpg extension is also mandatory as mobac creates mapquest tiles in the zip with .jpg extension important to notice as standard tile sources in osmdroid are all using .png extension

22868593
post	get
you can use to get an array of post objects of the group

22868610
width	height
then calculate the signature width and height

22868610
width	height
now you know the signature size and the canvas size so you can calculate the scaling factor to apply to both the width and height of your signature

22868613
hide	show
i need to write some js that can take a series of feature properties and show or hide each marker depending on whether any of those properties match a given checkbox s value

22868670
getter	setter
you don t need getter and setter if you re using xcode 4.4

22868691
portrait	landscape
in the sample code it doesn t look like the landscape and portrait views inherit from the view controller so i don t think that making the classes abstract would work

22868724
getter	setter
also you don t need to implement a getter or setter if your only goal at that point is to retrieve var s value

22868724
getter	setter
the property key creates getter setter for you

22868746
folder	directory
folder contains a valid .class file for that path which is showing up in the error and saying is a directory

rss	feed
simple way is you use the website s rss feed

22868810
rss	feed
you can find the rss feed for any website

22868886
hash	salt
because since hash functions process their input sequentially in blocks of 1 to 64 bytes and more it is possible to precompute hash function state for the initial blocks of non-secret data and use it as a starting point for all future permutations â effectively removing almost any additional protection a salt may introduce

22868886
hash	salt
however practically salt + password usually occupy less than a single input block of a cryptographic hash function typically 512 bits or more so this is not considered an issue

22868886
hash	hmac	hash	salt
with the task of â œsalting a passwordâ one road to take is the hash-based message authentication code hmac scheme also known as keyed hash simply use your salt as message and your password as key â and the function will combine the arguments in a proper way relieving you of duty to remember â œwhether to prepend or appendâ

22868886
hmac	pbkdf2
the other possible alternative is a password-based key derivation function like pbkdf2 which is yet another wrapper on hmac or similar function

22868898
implements	extends
so you could use an entity that extends from your parent class and implements the interfaces

22868905
awt	swing
also define your leftkey rightkey upkey and downkey fields as volatile to prevent synchronization issues between the awt swing event thread and your rendering thread since the event thread and your rendering thread may be accessing these fields at the same time

22868938
cublas	cufft
the only case where i d rather settle for cuda is when you want to use the cuda runtime libraries like cufft for fft or cublas for blas matrix vector operations

22868956
int	chars
your first code actually keeps counting up from 13 until it hits 127 if on your system chars are represented as signed int because this is the largest positive int for a chars on such a system

22868961
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
touchesbegan touchesmoved etc

22868979
put	get
the idea is that you can put arbitrary values from 0 to 15 at each input and they get routed to the ouputs by the comparators which inspect the incoming value and decide to route to another wire or keep it on the same wire all 0 values will be routed to the top output 000 all 1 values to the second output 001 etc

22869000
comparator	comparable
check out the official tutorial on comparator see the comparator section towards the bottom not the comparable part at the top

22869024
submit	submission
the issue is with submission the data i hit submit and an error comes back with the email address is required

22869090
post	get

22869107
margin	border-box
removing the default margin and adding border-box to the fieldset addresses these issues

22869107
width	border-box
border-box changes the width attribute to include padding and borders in it s width calculation

22869107
width	border-box	box-sizing	border-box
so where as before #field1 was set to 70 width + 3px of padding on the left and right + 1px border on the left and right by adding box-sizing border-box

int	chars
for example if my id were instead of an int a string with chars that needed escaping directly inserting n would not be the right thing to do

22869739
hide	show
it s good practice to include other system ui flags such as system_ui_flag_layout_hide_navigation and system_ui_flag_layout_stable to keep the content from resizing when the system bars hide and show

22871750
allocator	stl
you can always create an allocator that works with stl

22871750

this solution should support ie google-chrome firefox

22872931
serializable	deserialization
the common factor is that you need to find a way to serializable your custom level into a format that can be sent over game center then write deserialization methods to get the data into the map s format

22872953
children	parent
use a parent view controller as your initial view controller and add the navigation controllers as children then transition between them

22872958
qplaintextedit	qtextdocument
the reason was that setmodified bool does not exist for the qplaintextedit but i realized that each of those objects has a qtextdocument internally which does have that method

clang	llvm
fewer bugs fewer crashes a better ui newer versions of llvm clang objective-c itself the ios sdk.

22873050
folder	directory
the uploaded folder is in same directory so the relative path is ok and i also tried absolute path like

22873073
maven	pom.xml
according to this answer google determines the java version when the application is upoaded not by reading the pom.xml so for now you probably have to run maven with a jdk 7 when developping for app engine

22873175
post	get
ok i figured out how to get it working so i ll post the answer here

22873180
integer	unsigned
last thing i am not sure about the byte 16 i just assumed that because uint16 in objective c is 8 bit unsigned integer

22873219
width	height
now i had this working fine when my images were set widths and height but when i change the width and height to 100 the sorting is weird the images become bigger when they are sorting and this causes all kinds of glitches

22873219
width	height
here is updated fiddle with my max height + width fix

22873243
width	height
the viewmodel tilerect property returns a rect since you cannot bind the width and height properties of a rect object

22873243
width	height
input x 100 y 50 height 222 width 398 numtablestall 2 numtableswide 4

22873267
hide	show
this is the simplest - hide it display your picker select date show the status bar hide the picker

22873267
hide	show
what more if you put show and hide in the same animation block as the date picker show hide it will animate in sync

22873307
int	boolean
in visual basic the boolean data type is stored as a 16 bit signed int

22873324
background-color	transparency
another thing here i want to point is that your li elements have background-color transparency

22873330
put	get
i got to work on the local environment but when i tried to put it on the testing apache server i get an ssi error

22873341
for-loop	loops
before the page++ then tried commenting out the queries i do in the for-loop and i found that inner queries are taking up extra memory per loops that aren t getting reallocated

22873344
public	protected
the question was made a while ago but i d like to add it is possible to load the product in callback function and get any attribute you need and store it in an object s protected member array via a public method

22873356
for-loop	arrays
also i did this in linq because it was asked for i think it would be faster to use a for-loop over the upload and touch arrays

22873444
multiplying	add
i would also like to know how to multiplying this number to add spaces like var.length which would insert say 6 spaces if the length was 6 again here

22873455
min	max
john resig - fast javascript max min

22873473
client-side	server-side
the question i face is whether to use it in the client-side or in the server-side

22873473
client-side	server-side
i do not like to modify the interface from the server-side i rather do it from the client-side thus the 3-tier architecture seems more clear you might differ with this

22873504
implements	extends
in other languages one wouldn t use the very same namespace of the thirdy party library such as devise in this case even when implements interfaces or extends classes provided by it

22873541
imperative	declarative
i implemented it like the following code but i was wondering if there is a better or cleaner way to do it using rx reactive extension operators i feel that creating a second observable inside the subscribe method of the first observable is more imperative than declarative and the same for that if statement

22873552
min	max
or you sort by min r.creationdate or max r.creationdate

22873591
distance	pdist
i am interested in how these probabilities relate to the remaining independent variables in the data.frame perpendicular distance to the ship path pdist sea conditions sea speed avgknots distance to shore shore etc

22873642
isotope	masonry
seems like you want a masonry style layout checkout the isotope plugin by david desandro

the problem started when we tried to deploy the web application on the server debian linux running tomcat 7.0.52

22873717
hash	salt
i was about to roll my own very basic system read obfuscation with wide open backdoors with a text file of users passwords permissions hash and salt until after some searching i found what looks like a

22873754
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome pushes everything down including the body background with a position but firefox doesn t do so

22873754
google-chrome	firefox
example open in google-chrome and firefox to notice the difference

22873762
post	put
to accompany the release i ve put out a blog post linking to a vs extension i wrote for the build conference

22873798
jar	war
i have two projects a war project a and a jar project b

22873798
jar	war
war project is dependent on jar project and

22873832
jar	war	maven	pom.xml
first create a jar of b project install it in maven repository and then add a new dependency in war b project s pom.xml

22873901
implements	extends
the easiest solution would be marking k to extends number and implements

22873920
versioning	upgrade
that package has a reference to bootstrap 3.1.1 so it will upgrade your bootstrap files to versioning 3.1.1

22873977
int	double
however my defaults class deals with only string int double

22873977
int	double
therefore i would like to restrict t to string int double

22873982
gson	jackson
you ve tagged jackson but are using gson in your example

22873991
memcpy	strcpy
use std string data and or memcpy not std string str or strcpy

22874074
for-loop	arrays
conditions 2 and 3 necessitate one for-loop - because you do not need to iterate through the arrays that contains the potentially different-length arrays and the potentially different-length arrays just iterate through the former and check the lengths of the latter

22874113
width	height
also make sure you don t set the canvas size using css but it s width and height attributes or properties if done in js as the bitmap will be scaled to the element size which also affects the mouse position relative to the bitmap

22874124
xsl-fo	xslt
remember the xslt was initially chapter 2 of the xsl-fo specification in fact it still is but by reference not by inclusion

22874131
pull	push
but now i d like to add some more changes to the same demos branch and commit push just simply have it ping everyone who cares about demos as part of that same pull request

22874131
pull	push
but at the pull request level i d like it to look like all the time when anyone has stuff to push through demos it comes via this one pull request.

22874142
entity-relationship	diagram
check my entity-relationship diagram

22874188
width	height
you need to add a style attribute to your video tag with height and width set to 100

22874242
width	height
how do i add the jdesktoppane to jframe using gridbaglayout and set its height and width

22874276
g++	gcc
those are not c++ flags those are flags for a compiler presumably it s g++ from the gcc suite

22874281
google-chrome	firefox
this issue does not seem to affect google-chrome 33.0.1750.154 but it does ie 11 and firefox 24.0 and 28.0

22874303
put	get	post	get	post	put
i m starting with retrofit and i can perform a get request successfully but when i try to perform a post or put request i get a sockettimeout exception

22874303
retrofit	okhttp
all libraries are updated retrofit 1.5.0 and okhttp 1.5.3 and i m using a real device running android 4.4.2

22874303
post	put
unlike the issue reported on github this error always occurs for post or put requests

22874303
put	get
after enabling retrofit full log i noticed that after a put request i can t connect to the server anymore even for get requests

22874303
put	get
in the logs below is possible to see a successful get request what follows is an apparently successful put request that don t hit the server - no logs in the server at all for this request and then another put request that throws a connectexception

22874339
hide	show
i d like to show hide a block of information in my sidebar according to the filter that someone has clicked on

22874339
hide	show
basically clicking on a filter will show hide these div s

22874339

here is where the magic needs to be when the filter link is clicked on above i would like to show hide two div s that i have loaded

22874367

22874512
matplotlib	scipy
here is what worked for me for pip installing matplotlib and scipy inside a virtual environment mac os x 10.9.2 mavericks

22874519
width	height
the initial size of the extent rectangle is based on the extent of the brush object zero width and height by default

22874519
width	height
alternately you could get the width height and top left coordinate from the on-screen extent rectangle which the brush object modifies for you

22874560
free	malloc
the last malloc statement recycled the memory previously free

22874570
width	height
i set the width and height of the buttons to wrap_content which is exactly what i want

22874615
pull	push
is there a better option for sax push pull evented xml parsing in ruby that would ignore errors like these

22874663
int	chars
first it multiplies the length with a space chars which works in python the string is simply repeated but after it tries to evaluate the substraction between an int 20 and the string which breaks with a typeerror

22874671
folder	dir
since wamp does not come with sendmail.exe a folder c wamp sendmail was created and the following files as shown in dir were copied into it

22874672
put	get
i have tried using the given and when prepositions and no matter what i put inside the do block i get the same error

22874723
google-chrome	firefox
now i copy and pasted the code into a much large website project in visual studio and the transition effect just refuses to work in google-chrome and firefox but will work in ie.

22874751
build.gradle	gradlew
now because srcdir for each of them is set to not_valid_value at global level my assumption is this invalid srcdir value will be either overwritten by the actual valid srcdir value when gradlew build system will read sourcesets section ... from each individual project s build.gradle file s sourceset section for main test etc or they will be clubbed together as a list entry main srcdir will become src java not_valid_value --- which when i printed in common.gradle and ran project gradlew build printed valid clubbed value

22874762
minimum	max	min	max
at a bare minimum in .net 4.0 the min max workerthreads and min max iocompletionthreads determine the amount of threads in play

22874781
width	height
it maintains its width but its height squishes in on its self

22874818
jpanel	jdesktoppane
is it possible to add jdesktoppane and jinternalframe to a jpanel if so how could i do it

22874825
hide	show
so every network call is wrapped in an mbprogress show and then hide

22874843
typedef	struct
i ve googled many different typedef and struct examples and mine mirrors that of those examples

22874854
min	max
i corrected your code + i added min max and average values

22874872
width	height
assuming that your content does not have the same aspect ratio as the phone a safe assumption you can either letter box curtain the content or only zoom out until either the height or width of the image would show on the phone before aforementioned letter boxing

22874913
express	node.js
i ve read this link node.js - external js and css files just using node.js not express and comprehended somewhat but still do not know where to plug them in in my case

22874933
width	height
inside the draw function use the window s dimension directly for the canvas element s width and height don t use css as that will stretch the image it s better to redraw the image stretched onto canvas so you can read mouse positions etc

22875005
width	height
you can change width height backgroundcolor layout etc

22875038
nsdata	nsjsonserialization
i don t see any nsjsonserialization in your question anyway converting the dictionary to a nsdata instance seems wrong and it s likely to be causing this encoding issue

22875067
integer	unsigned
the same equivalent code in c pow 2 100 would clearly cause an overflow since in 32-bit architecture the unsigned integer type ranges from 0 to 2 32-1

22875096
put	get
once you get into scalability issues and async support then a thread can actually service multiple requests or rather a request can be put on a queue and the iis worker threads can be reused to process other requests

22875099
pascal	delphi
i m trying to learn javascript coming from delphi pascal and am unclear about the similarities and differences between object properties and array values

22875124
integer	unsigned
stored in an unsigned 32-bit integer type and one set for 15-bit

22875124
unsigned	short
digits with each digit stored in an unsigned short

22875129
int	double	int	chars
once i am able to do that i foresee making a linked list storing chars names and an int double counter for the number of items deposited

22875131
post	get
do the post directly in your c# code and forget about htmlagilitypack unless you need to actually get some dynamic data from the page but that s rarely the case

22875134
put	get
but when i try to put the guestbook to work i get errors when i try to connect to either the local db or the cloud sql with the code given to me

22875135
width	height
if you make the area smaller as you did by width 10 and height 10 you decrease the size but from the bottom left

22875154
chmod	mkdir
the modes you specify with chmod mkdir touch and other tools that create and modify file permissions tend to deal only with the lower-order permission bits and sometimes the sticky and set ug id bits

22875174
uilabel	textkit
unfortunately despite what has been written erroneously on many blogs and apple s own documentation uilabel does not use textkit to render text it uses coretext thus making things a little harder

22875192
ubuntu	linux
on linux ubuntu derivatives at least

22875212
jar	manifest.mf
you can unzip the jar and check the meta-inf manifest.mf file for osgi headers like bundle-manifestversion and bundle-symbolicname

22875212
maven	pom.xml
check the dependencies of weld-osgi-bundle on maven central or in its pom.xml

22875223
implements	extends
for example you could try having the recursivego not implements actionlistener and then extends recursivego and then to still have an actionlistener - you would use a provided default actionlistener if one exists

22875283
post	get
how many get post cookie input variables may be accepted

22875287
children	parent
those transformed children are still rendering into the plane of their parent

22875294
google-chrome	firefox
its weird a fresh install of firefox also has the same problem as google-chrome

22875295
filesystems	fat
it seemed like i couldn t chown anything on a device with filesystems fat so i made a new truecrypt container of the filesystems ext2

22875295
chown	chmod
then i ran the chmod and chown as prescribed in the question and everything ran just fine

22875316
free	malloc
so if you allocate with malloc use free to free the memory not delete

22875328
google-chrome	firefox
it s perfect smooth in google-chrome but it chugs along like a choo choo train in firefox

22875349
for-loop	arrays
i m trying to list out the elements from a json arrays using a for-loop

22875365
octal	decimal
it may also parse a decimal or octal number depending on what the string looks like.

22875452
min	max
hello i am trying to populate an array with random values between 0 and 10000 display each to the screen with their location then calculate max min and average value in addition to thier locations

22875484
int	boolean	min	max
empty required notempty undefined string alpha numeric alphanumeric email url urlish ip ipv4 ipv6 creditcard uuid uuidv3 uuidv4 int int number finite decimal float falsey truthy null notnull boolean array date hexadecimal hexcolor lowercase uppercase after before is regex not notregex equals contains notcontains len in notin max min minlength maxlength

22875492
put	get
although there is room for improvement - like putting the uris and or station names into associative arrays and maybe adding other features - i think you get the idea as an alternative in cases where you don t want to put the function inside your .bashrc maybe because you want it to be available to all users just use a little script and place it at a location which is in each users of course you can add a path to it

22875494
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i have a uiviewcontroller which is my apps root view controller that contains a uinavigationcontroller that i reload using

22875494
uicollectionview	reloaddata
it runs fine and the uicollectionview loads its data before the - void viewwillappear of that view controller runs a - void loadview implementation creates the uicollectionview and does a uicollectionviewinstance reloaddata

22875494
uicollectionview	reloaddata	viewdidappear	viewwillappear
if i select another view controller above and then reselect the initial one which is a new instance -- old instances when moved off of are destroyed the uicollectionview does not load its data even though the loadview routine creates it and calls reloaddata until after both viewwillappear and viewdidappear actually run

22875542
button	checkbox
update 2 i just generalized the cmygroupbox to be cmybutton for using its presubclasswindow method not only in groupboxes but also in checkbox and button

22875542
button	checkbox
in checkbox it works well in button i am not so satisfied with the results

22875542
button	checkbox
update 4 in order to avoid to have to declare all my checkbox groupboxes and button as the class that contains the presubclasswindow method i researched and discovered that it is not needed to do it

22875578
datamapper	activerecord
activerecord which is the db-part of rails or datamapper support connection pooling which is a common solution to overcome the problem you ve mentioned

22875582
redhat	fedora
hence you must install with for the time being as noted on the page you linked to install mongodb on redhat centos fedora

22875595
for-loop	loops
if you are looking to print out all of them remember to also use that for-loop and loops through every single location and print them out

22875596
rtsp	sdp
for context the rtsp stream s sdp contains an attribute sprop-parameter-sets which is a base64-encoded set of bytes

22875601
jpanel	jdesktoppane
is it possible to add jdesktoppane and jinternalframe to a jpanel

22875626
width	height
the site i m working on has several div sections each the width and height of the viewport

22875664
mp4	webm
i managed to convert a .mov video uploaded through a mobile device to webm and ogg but when encoding to mp4 i always get an encoding failed message from the error object in a try catch

22875682
ssl	https
this websites gives you information on the ssl cipher suites your browser supports for securing https connections

22875714
for-loop	arrays
the idea was that i read up online that in order to reverse an arrays i would could use a for-loop and simply print the arrays backwards rather than actually reversing it

22875771
google-chrome	firefox
i have tried firefox and google-chrome to no avail

22875776
ubuntu	linux
repeated tests on different ubuntu x86 linux boxes including x86 vms all confirm 250 second or a 4ms interval when actually using the cpu

22875801
for-loop	loops
setting y x + 1 in my 2nd for-loop makes loops ignore the values that have already been sorted

22875868
int	chars
the overload of string you want takes a chars and int not a string and int

22875885
width	height
i created a div and i want that div expands to all page with 100 width and 100 height but currently i can t do that

22875888
fadein	fadeout
for some time i have been trying to write code to loop through all h4 tags in div and display them one by one by having the first one fadeout and the second one fadein

22876006
free	malloc
malloc can be built on top of brk by calling it with a new higher value every time more memory is needed and maintaining some internal data structure that tracks what s been free and what s still in use

22876006
free	malloc
giving memory back to the system on free was not done in the classic implementation. the internal data structure of some malloc implementation must have been a heap giving the brk segment its nickname the heap

22876082

22876248
post	get
i saw a few related post but couldn t quite get there

22876335
width	height
the percentage unit is relative to your browser window so you will get 20 of the browser window width for the image width and 20 of the browser window height for the image height

22876366
fadein	fadeout
i am trying to run the animation on two text lines which show the first text line for 5s and then other text line for 5s with the fadein and fadeout

google-chrome	firefox
it works on google-chrome firefox but gives the problem in ie10

22876897
rss	feed
but if i am not wrong looking at your example you need a different thing you want to insert in your database the title description and publication date of all items but even of the rss feed the first title description and pubdate you encounter in your xml file i can t understand why you want to do that but anyway this is what i understood about your requirements

22876942
cout	ofstream
you can use a std ofstream in place of std cout

22876966

but when i go to put data in the file i still get the error message above

22877404
stdout	stderr
it isn t clear from the question if you want to redirect stdout only or stdout and stderr

22877404
stdout	stderr
using | will redirect stdout to tee which outputs it to a file and to terminal leaving stderr untouched so it only goes to terminal

22877404
stdout	stderr
using will merge stdout and stderr and tee will redirect both to file and to terminal

later yet you discover that the users of the class use far more often polar than cartesian coordinates for complex numbers and that the conversions have been the bottleneck of a performance problem so you ditch real and imaginary and store rho and theta and change the getter and setter methods for the new -- more efficient -- storage for rho theta re im and so on

lapply	tapply
well the issue is that both lapply and tapply have an optional fun argument

22884589
lapply	tapply	do.call	lapply	do.call	tapply
since this is a do.call on lapply instead of that argument becoming an optional parameter for tapply it now becomes the main call on lapply

22884589
do.call	lapply
calls do.call lapply ... explicitly with named x and fun so that you get the intended

wordpress	joomla
i have a joomla website on root-level and wordpress blog on blog

22886596
width	height
declare the height and width of the pattern as 100 or 1

22886596
width	height
size the content your image so that it has a height and width of 1

22886596
width	height
for images the aspect ratio is calculated from the image s inherent width height ratio for all the others it is calculated from the width height numbers in the viewbox attribute

22886596
width	height
for either type of element if you declare a height or width for the element that doesn t match the aspect ratio the preserveaspectratio property determines whether the content will be stretched to fit none sized to fit one dimension and cropped in the other slice or shrunk to fit both dimensions with extra space meet

22886596
width	height
the middle row has aspect ratio control on the element so the picture is cropped to fit the pattern but the picture is still distorted when the pattern is drawn in the rectangle because the objectboundingbox units that define the coordinate system are different for height versus width

22886669
decoder	encoder
this is all the more intriguing that you cannot obtain an encoder from a decoder and vice versa and none of these two classes seem to share a common ancestor.

22886673
serializable	deserialization
the serializable deserialization works when running in the editor but when i compile and create a build then run it i m getting the following exception on deserialization

22886677
apache	nginx
i decided to try nginx instead of apache 2.2 and with this sites-available configuration it worked

22886677
apache	nginx
so i still do not know if it is possible in apache 2.2 but this worked for me with nginx

22886691
super	extends
you have to extends the class so that you can call the constructor using super method in the sub class constructor

22886737
prepare	execute
alternatively you can prepare the query looping through the list of values and set the place holders and then set values before execute

22886807
superclass	subclassing
i m trying to create multiple subclassing from one superclass in this instance value- fraction- rationalfraction and value- fraction- irrationalfraction but i keep getting this error

22886808
submit	submission
so i suggest you do the following using javascript or jquery keep the button clicks but make sure the form submission is prevented using preventdefault on the form edit you actually won t need this as if the buttons are just buttons no submit inputs the form will not submit anyway and just make sure you append another element every time they click a plus button or something

22886840
versioning	upgrade
when i install the current main package versioning using yum module1 does not get upgrade even though i specified an exact package versioning requirement down to the release tag

22886853
factors	matrix
what i m doing right now is applying the same perspective projection matrix i had before and then divide both x and y by z and then applying the screen size factors like this

22886870
multiplying	subtract
subtract the integer part from total and multiplying by 60

22886965
move	drag
for example i couldn t move from 12 months to 14 months - the drag bar just doesn t respond

22886997
hide	show
can you put the two iframes on the page and hide show them with css

22887009
google-chrome	firefox
this code works on firefox and the console log gives me the right value of position on both firefox and google-chrome

22887011
int	chars
the purpose of the code is to convert the chars 0 ... 9 into the corresponding int values 0...9

22887053
std	ostream
my guess is the std ostream is handing the char like a c-string which expects a sequence of charcters terminated by a 0

22887059
pop-up	dialog
basically when a dialog pop-up if the user presses an accept button i would like to close the socket and start a different activity

22887067
base-class	subclassing
i am not sure what happens in fraction fraction when you instantiate the subclassing in the base-class constructor

22887109
folder	directory
i just create an empty directory called assets with my php lavarel project folder and issue the following command - yo angular then in the terminal i was asked include sass compass bootstrap etc and start installing this generator

22887163
stdout	stderr
if the script is reporting errors they may be going to stderr but you re only redirecting stdout

22887170
post	get
edit i saw the post here unable to get scene from menuitem in javafx but that didn t work for me because it didn t find the getscene method for the menu bar

22887294
post	get
the value of the datatodisplay get or post variable is used as the content of the downloaded file

qlistwidget	qwidget	qlistwidget	qmainwindow	qmainwindow	qwidget
also note that i have used a qlistwidget rather than a qlistview and a qmainwindow rather than a qwidget

22887340
put	get
to get a value from the button to the array i would need to put something like

22887386
config	ini
for hhvm 3.0 you specify it in a ini config file with this

22887420
background-color	transparency	google-chrome	firefox
it looks like the checking for transparency before setting the background-color was the issue as only ie and firefox return the color this way whereas google-chrome returns rgba 0 0 0 0

22887507
post	get
the error in your post however is not the error you should get when you run the code that you have posted above

22887519
put	get
initially i had the connection at the class level so i thought that was the problem but even creating the connection from scratch every call to put and get still causes locking

22887532
octal	decimal
what you re seeing is the decimal representation of the octal number

22887538
octal	binary
kind of it interprets a number starting with 0 as octal so it actually isn t binary in the first place

22887548
width	height
for some reason when i do this the width of myimage stretches across the entire screen but the height only stretches until the height of everything else on the page

22887569
width	height
by default even html and body are only as big as the content they hold but never more than the width height of the windows

22887588
for-loop	arrays
u can generalize the for-loop by finding the size of temps arrays dynamically..maybe

22887596
chown	chmod
chown and chmod your folder so it work with the your user account

22887597
width	height
width and height that you feed to camerapreview.getoptimalpreviewsize should be calculated based on the current screen layout and take into account all the elements navigation bar that the system displays on the screen and the elements button_holder_customized_cam that your app logic decides to display

22887605
post	get
if you want to get away with it you can delete the migration that created the post table but i guess you would need to delete the db

22887671
width	height
this made the height of myimage.jpg 100 of the screen and made the width 640px but it did not center myimage.jpg

22887680
lisp	scheme
great but scheme isn t common lisp so i took a shot at it

22887681
int	chars
i have seen lots of ways to convert a string such as 12345 into an int based on what the chars represent the int 12345 but i need to be able to take a string s binary equivalent and turn that into an int

22887681
int	chars
the only way i now of is to loop until the end of a string and convert individual chars into int then multiply by 2 position_of_charecter

22887725
ienumerable	iqueryable
i don t know about restsharp but it would look more natural for getdefects to return an ienumerable instead of an iqueryable

22887785
integer	unsigned
note that the integer will need to fit within the maximum limit of an unsigned long if to_ulong is used and an unsigned long long if to_ullong is used

22887843
int	chars
a chars is actually an int in different clothing and you want the low byte of the int - which is what this does

22887854
qmainwindow	qwidget
in the main window it s just intancing the class and move it to the right place that it d look like a window title bar and is the same as for qwidget and qmainwindow

22887871
put	get	post	get	post	put
for the rest part you should mainly look at when to use get post put and delete as http method depending on your request type

22887911
winpcap	pcap.net
you could start here pcap.net is a .net wrapper for winpcap written in c++ cli and c#

22887942
put	get
i can put a listener at the top of the dom and as the event bubbles back it will get see it

22887951
post	get
since users can fiddle with get variables in the browser address bar and you ll be using those variables in your sql query it would be better in quiz_name.php to use a form with the post method and radio buttons for jordan and josh instead of links with the variables appended to the url

22888024
for-loop	arrays
if you ve used arrays in javascript before within a for-loop it s kind of similar to but

22888036
for-loop	loops
i know i should do a for-loop or maybe not but i m not sure how to loops through each word in each document and each document in the corpus

22888052
post	get
i am only allowing get and post methods in my spring 3.2 application

22888084
folder	directory
i have a directory with a manifest.txt a lib folder containing the external jar rxtxcomm.jar and a folder named arduino containing my two classes sendvalue.java and serialclass.java

22888120
super	self
using super yourinheritedclass self .__init__ instead of

22888128
int	double
the log base 2 of the first value that fails 38508450670424585 is about 55 but a double has only 53 bits of precision so an int that is larger than 2 53 can t necessarily be represented exactly

22888140
lisp	scheme
the scheme code can easily be made into common lisp

22888140
lisp	scheme
other than that and the use of funcall because of the lisp-2 nature of common lisp it s the identical code to your scheme version

22888218
post	get
this takes advantage of the post interface to the street2coordinates api documented here which returns all the results in 1 request rather than using multiple get requests

22888310
integer	unsigned
so if you ever try evaluating an unsigned integer 0 you get a warning that says

22888313
for-loop	arrays
i was thinking of iterating through each element and having an if statement that tests whether the number pairs from one arrays match both the state_id and product_id at the current element being tested against in the for-loop

22888335
for-loop	arrays
the for-loop iterates over the items in the arrays but at some point it crashes trying to access items further down

22888351
integer	unsigned
takes your unsigned integer and displays it as if it s a signed int

22888402
int	chars
this code reads a chars from keyboard stdin using scanf stores it in byte-sized variable c of type chars and then prints its ascii decimal value as an int to stdout

22888423
mayavi	matplotlib
i have tried a similar syntax in python both with matplotlib and mayavi

22888446
popover	tooltip
it looks like you re loading bootstrap 3 in its entirety then flopping bootstrap 2 s popover and tooltip files on top of that

22888472
x86	64bit
whether you need an x86 32-bit or x64 64bit version of the

22888474
versioning	upgrade
if you ve upgrade lucene-core to versioning 4.7 already you may have an old jar in your classpath that you need to remove

22888486
versioning	upgrade
note that if you re running an old versioning of rvm this may upgrade your setup which may not be what you want

22888515
ubuntu	linux
might be better if you stick to the current main stream linux arches such as ubuntu and fedora

22888517
folder	directory
i had a folder called .git inside the directory js libs testfolder

22888581
quicksort	heapsort
if i remember correctly the implementation uses an algorithm called introsort a hybrid of quicksort heapsort and insertion sort

22888581
quicksort	heapsort
if during the quicksort the recursion depth exceeds a certain limit stop running quicksort and use heapsort instead

22888581
quicksort	heapsort
in the event that the quicksort starts to degenerate it uses heapsort which is o n log n worst-case but slightly slower than quicksort on average to guarantee o n log n worst-case runtimes

22888586
rss	feed
i am creating an rss feed app with a slide out navigation bar as shown here

22888586
rss	feed
the app will load and rss feed will parse and appear on my main screen

22888670
int	chars
i tried converting the int to is ascii chars 81 would be a q

22888763
keystore	jks
odd given that tomcat docs say tomcat currently operates only on jks pkcs11 or pkcs12 format keystore

22888850
rpm	yum
i ve seen in the past some people get confused with the file name of the rpm and actual name of the rpm that yum rpm uses

22888851
subtract	add
add or subtract ï 4 to rotate it by 90ëš

22888865
width	height
i have each image set to a height 240px with the width being automatic in proportion to its height

22888877
inherited	properties
now if you were to set this splitcontainer.backcolor properties the panel1 and panel2 subcontrols would automatically inherited that color value and now they d all be the same causing no visual contrast

22888877
inherited	properties
this probably undesirable properties value inherited only happens when the panel1.backcolor and or the panel2.backcolor properties have not yet been explicitly set by you even though viewing their properties values in the visual studio properties window ahead of time would have revealed control.

22888905
median	percentile
the 50th percentile is by definition the median

22888915
folder	directory
recently just transferred our entire site into a ror app by bringing all directory into the public folder

22888921
width	margin
iterate over the images and when they have loaded get the image width and the parent element width compare the width and if the image is wider than the parent get half of the difference and subtract that from the left margin to center the image horizontally

22888945
google-chrome	safari
here s an example that works fine on google-chrome but on safari it will not load the sticky image when offline

22888945
firefox	safari
this is the same problem described in appcache misbehaving in safari firefox but i think that question doesn t make the problem as clear and i wanted to provide a question with a concrete demo

22888961
int	double
the challenge is that the source code cannot contain the words int float double or any digits 0 - 9

22889001
int	double
both will give a random int between 0 and 99 inclusive because math.random returns a double in the range

22889025
google-chrome	firefox
if you re using google-chrome or firefox you ll want to click inspect element. i m not sure what the command is for other browsers but hopefully you have access to google-chrome or firefox

22889035
int	double
the issue is that the answer cannot contain int float double and digits 0 - 9

22889035
int	chars
there are other things in java which can be represented as an int for example a chars

22889052
post	get
the answer by chowlett is correct for get and post - replace ajax with get post

22889070
put	get
here is my code...it works fine no problem with it..but what confuses me is that when i run this code for the first time caching happens inside method cacheisemptyorfull and it returns false and then i get the collection from the cache itself and put it into a customer object in my main method

22889113
apk	dex
it is meant for system installer which unpacks and unzip the dex file contained in apk

22889137
jtextpane	jeditorpane
you can use a jeditorpane instead of a jtextpane because it is well-suited for the task you want to accomplish

22889137
jtextpane	jeditorpane
there s a document underneath jeditorpane and apparently jtextpane too which you get a hold of with getdocument

22889169
post	get
the page loads but then on post i get this error which makes no sense in this situation based off of what i ve read there is no viewdata item of type ienumerable that has the key userid

22889170
setinterval	settimeout
this is because of somewhere in your page they are calling settimeout setinterval with a string that is not supported in node and it results in that error

22889178
fileinputstream	bytearrayinputstream
is it a fileinputstream or a bytearrayinputstream or even something else

22889270
hash	md5
i guess wherever the pseudo code states hash key one of the following hash functions sha-1 md5 ripemd-128 160 needs to be used

22889277
int	boolean
you can cast types in bigquery using the following functions int string boolean timestamp and float

22889280
prepare	execute
prepare and execute but i looked at the code and found that it does

22889285
udp	tcp
the simplest method would probably be to a look at the tcp protocol and stick all the tcp headers into the start of each of your udp packets

22889314
maven	pom.xml
if your project uses maven you can add this to your pom.xml

22889331
serializable	deserialization
typically the serializable and deserialization code will call a function or macro that adjusts the endianness - reversing it on little endian machines doing nothing on big endian machines - when working with multibyte data types

22889333
decoder	encoder
thus when it decoder your byte array and gets a bad character it assumes you have a broken encoder or bad input which causes a malformedinputexception

22889383
post	put
also should be because it should be a post request instead of put according to your php artisan routes results and by default post is used so you may omit it

22889383
post	get
the getedit method should be used to load the form using get request and the postedit method should be used to update the model by submitting the form to a url like listings edit 10 using post model

22889408
mp3	ogg
what can i use to convert uploaded mp3 files to ogg format in order to have full support of mp3 playing throughout all the web and mobile browsers

22889410
cpu	irq
however before you can react to a button push through an interrupt the button must be connected somehow to an irq interrupt request input in the cpu

22889417
apache	nginx
i looked into apache mod-proxy and nginx but i would rather have something i have more direct control of

22889422
int	chars
sorry if this is hard to understand p i m trying to convert a decimal int value to a chars value so i can write it in binary mode with fstream in c++

22889422
int	chars
my question is how do i convert decimal int to chars hex value like this ps i ve been googling this for about an hour and haven t found an answer

22889424
children	parent
when i run it with prog | cat file i get 6 outputs of i am the parent followed with various amounts of children each

22889432
16-bit	64bit
similarly with 16-bit integers or 64bit integers

22889535
next	except
however each child except the last gets to identify itself as the parent on the next iteration of the loop

22889535
stdout	fflush
you could add fflush 0 or fflush stdout after the print statements or just after the end of the switch before the if and see what a difference it makes

22889544
put	get
i can t just put that code into the action event for various reasons and putting the button objects into the parameters would get too messy with what i m trying to do

22889573
google-chrome	firefox
but this sends me to a blank page firefox and google-chrome

22889607
scheme	racket
the order is not specified in scheme but lets imagine it s from left to right i think racket always do left to right

22889612
firefox	safari
in ie safari and firefox my floated elements are not in the right spots

22889618
gpio	servo
if you really want to experiment with the different gpio output to implement things like servo motor control led light blinking and display a cheap board eg raspberry pi about usd25 is much preferred

22889653
m2e	pom.xml
updating the project might also work since m2e can get out of sync with your pom.xml file quite often

22889655
put	get
so what i m expecting is that when i put example.com 80 into my browser my request should get served up from app1 and when i put example.com 8080 into my browser my request should get served up from app2

22889664
udp	tcp
the best bet is to use tcp instead of udp since tcp has already solved all these problems for you

22889664
udp	tcp
world of warcraft for example started with tcp for chat and udp for gameplay and eventually converted to tcp for everything

22889678
content-length	content-type
adding date content-type server content-length headers

22889679
yacc	bison
and you really don t need lex or yacc or bison

22889693
getter	setter
attr_accessor will provide a getter and a setter method for with_tweet and tweet which should then be accessible to you through the post object

22889721
getter	setter
since jackson 1.6 you can use two annotations to solve the infinite recursion problem without ignoring the getter setter during serialization jsonmanagedreference and jsonbackreference

22889742
google-chrome	safari
i d like to target google-chrome only without targeting safari

22889742
google-chrome	safari
i used the following media query but it targets both google-chrome and safari

22889800
width	height
the width and height of the entire screen that the game would be displayed on is 600 by 600

22889841
int	chars
the default chars is the chars with an int value of 0 zero

22889929
sum	floor
as everyone else pointed out you can just compute sum i 1..c-1 floor c-1 i

22889971
post	put
in the previous post i forgot to put

22889989
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome provides more detailed information about the ajax errors even when firefox doesn t say anything

many-to-many	one-to-many
user is associated with recipe one-to-many and user is many-to-many self referenced cookingbuddies and cookingbuddieswithme

22890032
queue	fifo
if you really want to make sure all workflow instances are used evenly even when your load is so light that you don t need all of the instances you may need to check whether there s a way of reconfiguring websphere mq to distribute messages on a fifo basis rather than a lifo basis or if websphere mq can t be configured that way to switch to a different message queue

22890058
google-chrome	firefox
it has some behavior in google-chrome and firefox

22890069
int	double
- add a try catch phrase because it can not cast literal signs to int or double

22890118
setinterval	settimeout
don t use settimeout setinterval or other kinds of io in songs

22890120
width	height
if you can t set observer correctly trying guessing the height and width of your image

22890162
for-loop	loops
you could run loops within a loops and do this as many times as you wanted what i mean is put the bottom for-loop into another for-loop depending on the number of iterations the process was going to take and the various conditions

22890163
int	chars
cannot convert parameter 1 from int to chars

22890192

22890262
keydown	keyup
i want couple of things happen simultaneously on keypress event i got two pages default.html where there is a input text box and another page.html with another input text box now what i need is that the moment a key is pressed to type a letter in to the input text box on default.html keypress fires i need this on keypress not on keyup or keydown and the letter is captured

22890264
min	max
val w max val w min val v width_between v-w

22890281
int	chars
cast int to chars

mouseover	mouseleave
i manage to pause the slider with mouseover but when it comes to mouseleave the slider function runs several times without stopping causing several animations to run one after the other

22890328
button	checkbox
when the checked selector is used for checkbox or radio button it doesn t require space before the colon but when this used for select options it requires a space before it

22890355
for-loop	loops
it uses a for-loop instead of a while and takes advantage of the fact that doc will only be null if loops is exited normally after three timeouts

22890366
selecteditem	selectedindex
what ever logic i was executing in the selecteditem and selectedindex properties of the listbox i had to move it some where else

22890377
implements	extends
i have a class that extends sprite and implements touchable

22890390
hide	show
this could be done every time there were no results properly removing it when necessary or just a single time using its hidden property to show or hide it instead

22890475
maven	pom.xml
3 open your pom.xml you can find it under the project files folder in your maven web-app and add these dependencies

22890475
put	get
the reason i put that line of code in the getclasses method and not the addrestresourceclasses method is because the addrestresourceclasses method gets modified whenever there s a change to your resource class and if you include the multipartfeature code in there it will get erased

22890494
hide	show
to show or hide divs depending on the current display width

22890618
width	height
but their dimensions will expand once their content will be filled with text hence having the same width height than the scrollview

22890723
subtract	add
and same for when the ball hits the bottom height except instead of subtract you add

22890800
children	parent
it s just not possible to use the same height if you don t know the height of neither the children nor the parent because would imply the full height of the next ancestor with a fixed height

22890800
width	height
fluid width equal height columns

22890819
width	height
for some java homework we were told to create a program that makes collages with one of the methods being that the one of the fragments images of the collage will be scaled by width and height

in practice the size in bytes will depend on the sizes of the integer and floating-point representations

22892371
nsurlconnection	nsurlsession
so for a solution i would suggest the delegate approach of either nsurlconnection or nsurlsession

22893177
int	double
cannot implicitly convert type double to int

22893184
filewriter	bufferedwriter
for creating the text file you can use a combination of filewriter and bufferedwriter like so

22893229

google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
as i stated in the title i can get the onclick calling object only in firefox not in google-chrome not in ie not in safari

22893321
int	double
since there is no implicit conversion from double to int but there is an implicit conversion from int to double the int will be converted to decimal

22893358
int	double
because now 2.0 is a double and calculation is between int + int double and there is no guarantee that the returning number from the calculation is int

22893358

22893742
int	chars
i want to understand how declaring a variable as chars saves memory than declaring int or short

22893742
int	chars
i know the fact that declaring chars reserves 1 byte in memory while 2 or 4 bytes get reserved for int

22893768
strlen	implode
the test strlen implode _post email ensures that the input array has at least one value in it

22893805

for-loop	loops
i have tried reformatting the latter function as a for-loop as an infinity loops etc

22894114
16-bit	64bit
one of the many benefits of c and c++ is that there are compilers to target a vast range of machines from little 8- and 16-bit microcontrollers to large 64bit multi-core processors like the ones in a pc

22894114
x86	64bit	16-bit	64bit	subtraction	addition
in a 32- or 64bit machine memory range is most likely a lot larger so having larger integers isn t that much of a drawback and 32-bit integer operations are the same speed as smaller ones and in some cases better - for example in x86 a 16-bit simple math operation such as addition or subtraction requires an extra prefix byte to say make this 16-bit so math on 16-bit integers would take up more code-space

22894138
getter	setter
removing getter and setter from datacontext class helped

22894164
children	parent
that parent s children may also be roots which you show

a streaming data library like pipes or conduit would allow you to avoid reading the entire file into memory at once though- to my knowledge- parsec doesn t provide a streaming interface to allow this to happen

22894297
attoparsec	conduit
attoparsec on the other hand does include such a streaming interface and both pipes and conduit have attoparsec adapter libraries data.conduit.attoparsec

22894413
put	get
first of all you had a lot of double function calls in there like header in both if and else readfile in both etc. so it is sane to put it outside of the condition since they get executed anyway

22894653
nsdata	nsjsonserialization
and the whole double conversion is nonsense because nsjsonserialization wants nsdata and your original response was nsdata so all you do is take the response and give it nsjsonserialization as it is saving tons of memory tons of cpu time and it completely avoids the double bug that you introduced

22894677
slideup	slidedown
i am looking for something like jquery functions slideup slidedown slidetoggle but such that the content would slide sideways slideleft

getter	setter
it is my understanding that one aspect of the pythonic way is to use direct member variable access of classes until getter setter are needed

22895467
getter	setter
because of the property decorator approach this access to member variable age can be converted to a getter setter interface in the future without rewriting the line that sets it to 42

22896373
for-loop	loops
you cannot change the boundaries of a for-loop for good reasons so youâ ll have to replace for with a manual loops

22896436
int	chars
because you have not included you are assigning int to a chars which is a pointer

22896439

the one of the left varies its height to keep its relation with its width while resizing and i want the one of the right to have the same height that the left one

22897239
int	chars
in this program i have assumed that we want to replace only single chars at line 3.but you can change this operation to replace it with string float or int etc

22897249
for-loop	arrays
if n-d arrays which means we need n-1 for-loop to get each row s size

22897277
for-loop	arrays
having c corecount in your for-loop you try to access element 3 so memory outside the arrays is being corrupted

22897328
getter	setter
better to just use the same technique that you d use if this were not a swing gui public methods including getter and setter methods if need be

22897328
getter	setter
i would have used getter and setter but from the books that i ve read and the forums that i frequent i know that the general consensus is that having getter and setter is even worse than public fields

22897380
awt	swing
fourth you should be using swing and not awt

22897438
post	get
get recent post from any websites or blogs and store this into my db ..

uncaught referenceerror d3.js is not defined in dc.js

22897720
for-loop	loops
in for-each loops you will not be able to know which number of element index of the element in collection you are processing you need to define counter for the same while in simple for-loop i tells you the number of the element you are processing

22897729
ubuntu	debian
if you are running debian ubuntu on terminal do this

22897738
udp	tcp
about 50 incoming and outgoing network connections lbm over tcp ip and udp jms and jmx rmi over tcp ip

22897740
getter	setter
setter and getter are not mandatory

22897740
getter	setter
but again it is good practice to make all your instance fields private and access them through public getter and setter

22897759
octal	decimal
so what you re seeing in the last case is the decimal representation of the octal 10 which is 8 in decimal

22897759
octal	decimal
the print 000 is still printing the decimal representation of the octal 000 but zero in base 8 is the same as 0 in base 10

22897798
google-chrome	safari
for google-chrome it says vote is not defined and safari variable vote is not defined

22897822
for-loop	arrays
the shorter version of the for-loop means for each index in the arrays which quite simply is easier to understand

22897822
for-loop	arrays
the other for-loop is a most commonly used which starts from a assigned starting value and goes on till the end of arrays

22897843
disk	ram
which is a chunk of ram that s is set aside by the operating system to buffer disk data

i want to change the attributes of this layout for each row of listview like different layout width and height of each row

22897942
width	height
i want to set the values of width and height dynamically

22897959
qtimer	qthread
the proper way to handle animation on a qglwidget is to use a qtimer not a qthread

22897993
fadein	hide	fadein	fadeout	hide	fadeout
i d just use fadein fast and fadeout fast for the fading effect and then use a callback to hide the element

22898053
width	height
the height of each column in the vertical parallelogram and the width of each row of the horizontal parallelogram are just the absolute difference between the y-difference of the two points and the x-difference of the two points

22898053
width	height
b and d can be thought of as a special case of c where the parallelogram has a height or width of 0 respectively

22898070
for-loop	arrays
okay so my program is suppose to create an arrays size 8 and then once its printed i m using a for-loop to find the smallest number in the arrays

22898136
getter	setter
afaik if you want implement a watcher of an object you ll need a getter setter pattern aka

22898136
getter	setter
there are multiple ways to implement getter and setter in javascript see the wikipedia page linked above but in general you have three main choices

22898136
getter	setter
to use native javascript property getter and setter introduced in ecmascript 5.1

22898142
min	max
i would first find the min latitude and longitude and the max latitude and longitude using a distance formula see

22898142
min	max
to find those which match in terms of driving distance which will be less than or equal to the min max

22898142
min	max
by finding the min max lat long you reduce the overall number of calculations you will need to do

22898152
google-chrome	firefox
this worked fine for years in ie latest version needs compatability mode enabled and never worked in firefox or google-chrome that i am aware of

22898199
for-loop	loops
you can then loops through using another for-loop or passed whole-sale to your own function that will handle them appropriately

22898215
for-loop	loops
i am running a for-loop and inside my loops i have the following

22898225
lanterna	jline
i ve looked at jline lanterna and others but i m not seeing a simple way to find the current caret position in the terminal with these tools

22898233
macports	homebrew
that usually means making .deb .rpm .msi homebrew or macports packages

22898253
width	height
to scroll just the width but not the height as murplyx requested a year ago use the following

22898266
width	height
to change the width and height of each row you can use something like the following for each row on bind data section

22898322
width	height
where blocksize is the width and height of the block in pixels ex. 64 x 64

22898322
width	height
note blocksize must be a common factor of the original image width and height values

22898335
google-chrome	firefox
i tested this on google-chrome firefox and ie

22898335
google-chrome	firefox
the site on firefox and ie works as expected but google-chrome although it shows a scrollbar when the list of posts is bigger than the container adds a white gap the size of the list of posts under the container

i currently am trying to post a simple get request from a search page and redirect to another page a product page

22898357
unix	bsd	sysv	systemd
in the past there were different lines of unix development berkeley or bsd systemd v or sysv etc. berkeley sockets essentially won in the marketplace and are effectively synonymous with unix sockets today

22898357
udp	tcp
it s just a linguist shorthand to refer to them as a tcp socket to distinguish them from a socket using another protocol udp a routing protocol or whatnot

22898382
bower	npm
take bootstrap for example it uses npm to manage project dependencies and use bower to publish as static content for other web apps

22898382
bower	npm
take a look at bower as reference it s a little heavy because it provides the capability to bundle dependent npm modules as resource for browsers

22898392
put	get
i have a mysql database and i am trying to get the first name and last name of every student i put in the database and dynamically show them as a label in my wpf form here is what i got so far

when constructing a base string to sign your migration requests make sure that the string uses a post method rather than get as it is the case when accessing many google apis and that it contains all relevant migration parameters as per the migration documentation

22898400
client-side	server-side
client-side validation is easy to bypass but server-side validation should not

22898400
client-side	server-side
do the whole client-side validation for human users but repeat the same validation in the server-side so no one will be able to bypass your rules

22898405
getter	setter
in a browser for an object a property has its getter and setter

22898434
versioning	upgrade
it s still relevant except that you must increment file versioning to update file because the upgrade is now at the end and file overwrite rules apply

22898463
width	height
this did not solve the mentioned issue but it allowed me to explicitly set the desired width and height of the button which played a part in solving the actual issue

22898511
mysqlconnection	mysqldatareader
also use using statement to dispose your mysqlconnection mysqlcommand and mysqldatareader

22898537
post	get
if you still don t get it then try reading the entire blog post by loren

22898576
google-chrome	firefox
this piece of code returns null on google-chrome but returns a proper context on firefox

22898577
width	height
i have 1 imageview with layout_width layout_height is match_parent two of them is screen width and height size

22898577
width	height
i need display photo to fill full width and when image is higher than imageview height it can be scroll up and down

22898635
udp	tcp
in the book it is given that received udp and tcp packets are never passed to a raw socket and we cannot read the udp and tcp headers in raw sockets and to read udp and tcp header we should read it at data link layer

22898660
submit	submission
what you re doing is attaching a submit event handler not submission the form via ajax

22898680
typedef	struct
read chapter 5 typedef in this standard which discusses when you should shouldn t use typedef in struct

22898681
listview	gridview	gridview	repeater
then i would have a repeater a gridview or a listview and i would put a textbox in the row template

22898681
post	put
then upon each post back the list of posted values can be read and put back into the database

22898710
width	height
different layout width and height of each row

22898723
typedef	struct
personally i believe using typedef for struct is completely silly since all it does is saving you from writing the struct keyword in a few places--information that should rather not be hidden behind a typedef

22898723
typedef	struct	typedef	typename
i always cringe when i see typedef names for struct that end in just to signify that the typename is an alias for a struct

22898818
quicksort	mergesort
i m beginning a program using heaps in which i must insertsort mergesort and quicksort into the heap

22898822
punctuation	words
removing punctuation non-arabic words and digits except dots and commas

22898853
children	parent
_getmenuitemclasses needs additional checks so that the class parent isn t added to categories whose children are empty

22898900
children	parent
css currently doesn t have a way to check for children or what would essentially be a parent selctor something that often comes up as a wishful thought in discussions about css

22898906
try-catch	exception-handling
wanted to verify this before i start working with try-catch blocks exception-handling

22898906

submit	submission
problem i upload my file and press submit button on submission it moves me to html form page and remove the file i uploaded

22898939
put	get	post	get	post	put
it s the modern approach to http of modern .net framework and it works better with rest-style requests since you ll find direct shortcuts to perform get post put delete head and other verbs resource requests

22898943
hide	show
so when main menu bar show hide frame of your window and content view don t change

22898950
int	double
your array is a double array and you are assigning a field to an int value

int	double
parse the the line to a double instead of int

22898993
versioning	upgrade
you should try to upgrade to java7 or find rebuild a versioning of jersey compatible with java6

22899001
multiplying	subtract
then you can divide this by 3 n to get the cost of a single move and calculate the manhattan distance to the target assuming only left right up and down moves otherwise the calculation will be a little more complex subtract 2 n-1 and multiplying by the cost of a single move as the heuristic

22899014
google-chrome	firefox
i bring it up because google-chrome wouldn t even fire post i have to run it in firefox because of non origin failure despite the same domain locally

22899043
try-catch	exception-handling
try-catch block or a try-with-resources and propagate the exception-handling to its caller

22899053
cpu	processors
the processors are different but not that different osx is intel r core tm i7-2677m cpu 1.80ghz linux is intel r core tm i5-2500k cpu 3.30ghz this seems like a library or kernel problem

22899066
ssl	https
it looks like you are setting up an http server on port 443 e.g on a port usually used for https http wrapped inside a ssl connection

22899093
leiningen	counterclockwise
i tried the above code from both the counterclockwise repl and the leiningen repl

22899122
min	max
like max value - min value

22899124
folder	directory
i dropped the entire directory into the public folder so i wouldn t have to change the application layout

22899147
outputstream	inputstream
i am assuming that your sources sinks are the java objects and that your c++ library needs to read from the java inputstream and write to java outputstream instances and that you need a facade of c++ io streams that you can pass down to your c++ parts that will call back for data into your java objects

22899155
prepare	execute
a connection is build a statement prepare a parameter bound and it s execute all well

22899164

22899233
sorting	filtering
i want the sorting navbar on right side of filtering navbar

22899248
qmainwindow	qwidget
the problem is that qmainwindow already has a layout see the documentation here so the code won t work the same way as for a qwidget you need to use the centralwidget set a layout to centralwidget and add all your widgets to the layout

22899250
submit	submission
however unless you specifically set it in your configuration you can t submit to the form because rails is smart and wants a secure token for each form submission to prevent forgeries and other nasty things

22899329
getter	setter
then in you class you should create a setter and getter method for your count

22899393
listview	gridview
in other words one of the possible listview elements is a gridview

22899393

post	get
i will just post the methods that the edt takes to get to it

22899544
margin	height
now in you activity layout set the top margin for your root view to actionbar height you can do it like this

22899546
post	get
i m trying to upload a file to oboom.com i logged in successfully but when try to post the file i get that error

22899557
cos	sin
now recall what happens when you differentiate a sin or a cos you get the frequency at the front as a coefficient

22899565
x86	mips
you need to choose the version of your executable that matches the platform armeabi or x86 or mips

22899577
post	get
examining the various post one way to get around this as suggested in the post is to configure the aspect in the xml configuration file and use the factory-method aspectof and in the configuration inject the reference to the nameservice bean as a property

22899592
getter	setter
beams is also defined as a variable try removing the readonly and making it a property with a getter and setter

22899600
aggregate-functions	sum
when you use aggregate-functions like sum you have to group by every other field in select

22899618
vpn	lan
it can be done my marking the traffic and queueing the traffic from the server---to----remote site --- qos..quality of service .....the two sites will be connected through vpn methods to reduce the unnecessary hops that will improve the latency plus add the security thus server and remote site will logically act as if they are on the same network lan

22899622
mouse	keyboard
three.js comes with many useful controls which cause camera movement in response to keyboard and mouse input

22899637
int	boolean	tinyint	boolean
verify that post_deleted is of type boolean tinyint smallint or even int will outperform string

22899649
joptionpane	jdialog
obviously joptionpane is small but to do a jdialog i d have to create a window and more stuff

22899649
joptionpane	jdialog
another option is to use the joptionpane constructor and create it without showing it and then convert it to a jdialog as the joptionpane api shows you how to do but you may still have the ok or similar button to deal with

22899657
versioning	upgrade
to a large degree an upgrade from spring framework 3.2 or earlier to 4.0.1 should be as straightforward as a change of versioning numbers in your maven poms

22899657
versioning	upgrade
note that you may have to upgrade specific third-party dependencies to a recent enough versioning hibernate 3.6+ quartz 1.8+ jackson 1.8+ tiles 2.2+

22899679
post	get
you can t have a request body in a get request you have to use a post request for that

22899691
google-chrome	firefox
these are working fine in google-chrome firefox and ie9

22899694
int	chars
int argc contains the number of command-line arguments passed to your program is an array null-pointer terminated even of strings null-byte terminated chars arrays containing these arguments

22899727
getter	setter
about getter and setter

22899727
getter	setter
at the end only keys are required to override equals and hashcode entities should but is not required talking about getter and setter are only required if use property access but remember that fields on entities can not be public so if you don t have getter and setter how you will set or get the properties

22899727
accessor	properties
when properties access is used the properties accessor

22899727
public	protected
methods must be public or protected

22899778
mamp	wamp
if that is the case and you don t have acces to websapce look at wamp windows or mamp mac

22899790
hide	show
i use a button to hide and show a menu but it isn t working

22899828
versioning	upgrade
this update required that i upgrade to gradle versioning 0.9 as apparently the build system has some major changes

22899840
width	height
and so on where window.innerwidth is current window width in pixels and window.innerheight is current window height in pixels

22899845
free	malloc
because malloc has to store some bookkeeping data for free and must guarantee the alignment for bigger requests your implementation in this instance somehow gave you blocks 32 bytes appart

22899857
width	height
i v set the width of the logo div in css but the text div still sits underneath the height of the logo div which is spanning the full width of the page despite me setting a width for it

22899902
hide	show
i need to show hide a cascading menu when the user move the mouse on a certain element

22899902
hide	show
my idea was to use an array of id of element hovering id menu to show hide

22899967
margin	height
in its default stylesheet so will overflow window because those margin is not included in height 100

22899967
margin	height
makes have 80 height of and adds 10px of top margin additional to the height

22899967
box-sizing	margin
or use box-sizing with padding instead of margin

22899973
superclass	subclassing
i would prefer to leave the code in the superclass if possible since this will be duplicated quite in quite a few subclassing otherwise

22900035
put	get
the .so files are usually stripped from .jars on android if you want to get these into your app your need to extract the files yourself and put them inside libs armeabi libs x86 etc for eclipse jnilibs armeabi jnilibs x86 etc for android studio

22900108
google-chrome	firefox
why do all the browsers google-chrome ie 8 firefox handle the file as a pdf although the extion is set .jpggggg and how can i prevent this behavior

22900169
versioning	upgrade
as suggested by tonio either upgrade your runtime jre or compile for a lower java versioning using

22900205
superclass	subclassing
i want to put the subclassing of the objects i have created into folders in the default package to organize them so i don t have dozens of objects jumbled together but when i create a new folder in the package explorer and drop them in they no longer connect to the superclass

22900226
dictionary	map
if the array is going to be sparse the a only looks in a small region of the map you could represent it as a map dictionary in c# of index to value

22900242
implements	extends
you may use an object using for example and an array using but in this case you may use both syntax because laravel s eloquent model implements arrayaccess along with others interface so every model that extends eloquent could be used using both array and object syntax to access properties

22900262
put	get
i am new to js and trying to get it so when someone enters a ssn number in a field it gives them an alert telling them to not put a ssn number in there

22900264
stdout	fflush
by the way if you never see the first printf it s because by default stdout is line-buffered meaning that sometimes it takes a newline or an explicit fflush to force buffered output to actually be displayed

22900267
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i tried it in safari google-chrome and firefox on mac os x and they all worked

22900345
maven	m2e
finally i can confirm the latest m2e 1.5 or above supports maven 3

22900345
maven	m2e
set m2_home was not needed in my case thus to get m2e working in eclipse or interact maven though command line m2_home is not needed

22900349
ansible	puppet
by do it right i mean using something like chef or puppet or ansible to build your server

22900349
versioning	upgrade
and you can quickly upgrade the os or server software by launching a 2nd instance to play with. if you have an ebs root drive you ll have to pay to store backup your os and you ll never know if your server config is checked into versioning control or not

22900363
filtering	grouping
i have two category grouping within ee one is to determine what users are able to see that file and the other filtering the file in to different grouping

22900363
filtering	grouping
what i need to do is select every file which is in category 19 this is to determine the user grouping and then i need the check it is in one of the filtering categories

22900402
dictionary	map
if you need to enumerate the objects in sorted order a more efficient approach would be to maintain a sorted linked list of objects by name and use a dictionary to map names to liked list entries for o 1 amortized lookup

22900456
getter	setter
something i learned over that internship is the beauty of c# properties aka setter and getter

22900456
getter	setter
you can see the getter which is in the form of a print statement and the setter which is in the form of .setcoor ..

22900475
width	margin
i had to leave the right margin alone to maintain the width of the button and the positioning of the next level subnav

22900509
int	chars
also chars value can never be equal to of of is of type int

22900510
put	get
this works perfectly fine in app.js but if i try and put this in lib routes.js i get a forbidden error

22900524
ionic	angular
i realized after posting this question that ionic already ships with angular and i should just use that

22900528
getter	setter
the difference is that if you ever wanted to have some special behavior happen when xcoor got set it would be impossible to do in java unless you ensured that people always accessed this field through a getter and setter method

22900528
put	get
another way to put it is that c# properties are just syntax sugar for getxxx and setxxx methods which allow you to avoid having to type get and set so often

22900528
getter	setter
are just syntax sugar to avoid having to create your own custom implementation for those getter and setter methods

22900603
freebsd	linux
it should work on linux and at least freebsd but might fail on other unices

22900628
getter	setter
think of the java s getter and setter as the c# s equivalent

22900628
getter	setter
of the property s getter and setter

22900628
getter	setter
same via a property x s getter and setter

22900629
for-loop	arrays
assuming your for-loop breaks the 1000s of points correctly into chunks of 10 which i don t see in the example to create an arrays within an arrays you need to make maxrss a list and then append things to it

22900632
getter	setter
in java you can not set a private field from another class if there is no public getter and setter methods

22900632
getter	setter
private fields without getter and setter methods can only be set and viewed within the same class

22900660
folder	directory
im trying to create a folder inside www directory using php script

22900686
width	height
you should be able to able to adjust the height and the width of your search container

22900767
subtraction	add
so having the root at 0 rather than at 1 costs you an extra add to find the left child and an extra subtraction to find the parent

22900791
hash	salt
i assume there is some sort of built in function that takes the parameters of the salt hash and the encryption method and returns a boolean

22900846
width	height
if i use functions like width height the bindings are successful but when i use the properties without the the bindings are not successful

22900853
for-loop	arrays
the first for-loop demonstrates how to input values in the arrays

22900853
for-loop	arrays
the second for-loop demonstrates how to sum the values of each arrays

22900855
width	height
remove height and width of .metro

22900871
public	protected
private and package functions are never virtual whereas protected and public functions are always virtual unless the compiler is able to determine that they don t need to be which at this point can pretty much only happen when the function is final and doesn t override a function in a base class

22900874
versioning	upgrade
to upgrade you can use a ppa that provides later versioning of php for the versioning of ubuntu you are using

22900886
apache	nginx
i haven t ever done it with apache but nginx 1.3 added support for websockets

22900900
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
the first thing that came to mind was the basic java serialization with the use of an objectinputstream and objectoutputstream

22900927
post	get
what i am trying to achieve is to get a categoryid and a total number of topics in this category as well as the total number of post

22900940
getter	setter
people tend to consider getter and setter un-pythonic prefering to use property instead

22900940
getter	setter
of course i could create some helper classes to deal with this but it seems like just writing setter getter functions that take a key and value would be much simpler

22900962
octal	decimal
456 in octal is the same as 302 in decimal but the valid range is 0-256 so we have to apply modulo to see what value it really becomes 46 .

22900988
width	height
that value defines the width and height of your multi-dimensional array your matrix

22900988
width	height
there you have it n and m here should be storing the height and width of the matrix you should have respectively

22900990
hash	salt
having the salt doesn t allow you to reverse the hash as the process isn t reversible anyway

22900990
hash	salt
then when you want to check a password you look up the user get their salt use it to apply the hash and then check what you end up with against their stored hash

22901019
getter	setter
with regard to getter setter what you re doing is not a typical getter setter

22901024
multiplying	multiplication
what you need to do is define a proper matrix multiplication method that can multiplying two arbitrary matrices

22901033
comparator	comparable
and your software class should implements implements comparable and override its comparator method

22901060
width	margin
no padding or margin stuff there nor anything defining width by static pixel values

22901080
width	height
you can instead store a byte array of the writeablebitmap s data - here s how you can convert a writeablebitmap to a byte and back again note that you ll have to store the width and height separately

22901095
freebsd	linux
some grep implementations gnu grep linux and freebsd grep osx have option -r alias -r which searches the specified input directories recursively use and to filter by filename pattern

22901116
mouseleave	mouseenter
i tried to use mouseenter mouseleave but it doesn t work

22901168
hash	salt
i am implementing a sha256 hash with a salt that can not be decrypted

22901168
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
my idea was creating a salt by taking the first 4 letters of the username the first 3 letters of the first name and the first 3 letters of the last name and converting it into a md5 hash and then using that as the salt without storing in the database

22901203
google-chrome	firefox
distance from the full-width causing erroneous visuals varies between browsers tested in google-chrome 33 firefox 25 and internet explorer 11

22901220
int	chars
if you look at chars element 10 and 18 both have same chars but different int value

22901227
hide	show
this works only i need to copy paste the param definition for each one of the open close hide and show functions

22901250
free	malloc
malloc stores some special information in the allocated block that lets free run

22901265
hash	salt
the purpose of the salt is simply to prevent pre-computation of hash not obfuscate or encrypt in any way

22901265
hash	md5
you can actually see how simple it is by googling md5 hash and often in the search results you ll find the original input

22901265
hash	salt
by using a salt the attacker must compute unique hash for every possible password instead of just a generalized list

22901304
post	put
from reading other post i thought that s all i had to do was put the elements in the uitableviewcell s contentview which they are

22901378
dns	spf
spf records are held in your dns records

22901384
hash	salt
figuring out how you created the salt would be a piece of cake compared to forcing the hash

22901415
width	height
this example will change the height of the label though you can use it to change width too etc

22901416
width	height
on the pages that have no full height there is no scrollbar like on this one there is no scrollbar so layout is moved right for same width

22901450
post	get
the sql select date from post is not going to be useful to you disclaimer i don t know your specific sql variety so this is a dumbed down untested example provided to get you thinking

22901477
inherited	properties
i think copying is required because we need to inherited only methods not properties

22901530
getter	setter
finally since ember getter setter supports paths you can set properties like this

22901556
put	get
let s say you create a jframe and there you could put a textfield for every value so for every t or constants and then it would be much more simple to get those values

22901568
metaphone	soundex
in postgresql i m not very experienced but as far as i know gist and gin have some special functionality such as allowing you to use soundex metaphone and custom functions to make fuzzy searches and it also works on some of the positional information between word i think...

22901568
metaphone	soundex
they also allow you to configure multiple indexes with different priorities the highest priority would be the original text index another would be the stemmed index a third could be a synonym index the fourth and fifth could be soundex or metaphone indexes

22901571
put	get
if i put it inside of the loop an error can occur on that directory before i even get a chance to catch it

22901589
opera	google-chrome
as said it does not work in google-chrome 33 nor does it work in opera 20

22901623
hide	show
can t i just use an expression on the row visibility show or hide base on an expression to say something like

22901631
uilabel	uitextview
you may want to use nsattributedtext to create your own uitextview or uilabel that does that basically randomly assigning uicolors with decreasing alpha to different letters

22901644
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
if there current sitecore installation is upgrade from 6.4 or prior versioning to your current versioning

22901698
width	height
for a rect to stay in the list and grow in height the next scanline would have to have the same left width occurrence otherwise the rect is finished if its height meets my desired minimum height or discarded or ignored as too short in height

22901698
width	height
your list of found rects stores the starting scanline leftmost pixel width and height for each rect found

22901698
width	height
if the group of black pixels on the current scanline has the same leftmost pixel and width as a group on the previous scanline you ll know they re vertically contiguous because the starting scanline of the rect in the list plus its height will equal the current scanline then rememberrect bumps the height of the found and remembered rect by 1

22901716
fiddler	charles
or proxy through fiddler charles

22901724
post	put
because there are several resources in the api i wanted to create a base class inheriting from the resourcetestcase and just override on post or put methods but the test suite tries to execute the base class as a test which is an error

22901738
put	get
or better temporarily put debugger line inside your test code you will need get debugger gem installed if don t have it already

22901808
put	get
i am trying to get the device token and then put that device token into a global variable or access it from another view

22901829
width	border-box	box-sizing	border-box
if you want to change the box model so that width refers to the width of content+padding rather than just the width of the content you can use box-sizing border-box

22901860
jar	war
if generating from the three wsdls into the same client project jar war etc should result in overwriting the common bits of code twice

22901870
superclass	subclassing
the best way to preserve a prototype chain in javascript is to set the prototype of the subclassing to an instance of the superclass

22901870
inherited	properties
that way when javascript is looking for a matching properties it will properly follow the prototype chain through the inherited hierarchy

22901922
heapsort	clrs
i m reading clrs and it says heapsort is

22901941
rspec	capybara
i m writing my integration tests in rspec with capybara

22901977
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i entered a bookmark for a chapter title introduction on page 2 and when i try to open the pdf file in a browser to this bookmark it appears correctly in google-chrome on page 2 but safari and firefox always open the file on page 1

22901982
hash	salt
just generate a random salt use it to create your hash prepend the salt to the hash encode everything to base64 and store it

22901982
hash	salt
to verify the hash you decode to binary extract the salt use it to hash your input data and compare with the decoded hash

22901983
crypt	md5	crypt	hash	hash	md5
a few hashing algorithms are md5 sha1 etc- in php you can use the crypt function to hash a password

22901983
hash	md5
i should note that md5 and sha1 are not as secure anymore as they are very fast which means that they can be brute forced fairly quickly there are also databases where you can reverse engineer the hash fairly quickly

22901986
textblock	itemscontrol
given an itemscontrol with an itemtemplate as shown below access the actual textblock within the datatemplate generated for each item in the control

22902009
post	get
it uses methods other than get head or post

22902030
rubber	capistrano
looks like the user you are using to connect with to the instance using rubber capistrano doesn t have passwordless sudo access

22902082
put	get
accessing www.example.com mypage.html works fine but when the site is put behind a cloak www.what-the-user-sees.com -- www.example.com mypage.html it cannot get the user s system details and just presents the desktop-size page to all devices

22902085
stdout	fflush
the answer to this is that fflush stream is only formally defined for output streams so fflush stdout is ok but fflush stdin is not

22902085
stdout	fflush
adding an fflush stdout after the printf solves the problem

22902089
integer	unsigned
all options require that a positive signed integer value has the same representation as the equivalent unsigned integer value

22902089
integer	unsigned
in two s complement a negative signed integer is represented the same as the unsigned integer generated by adding uint_max+1 etc

22902116
integer	unsigned
then to get a standard 8bit image you should use an unsigned 8-bit integer dtype

22902153
post	get
when the post is grey the link should direct the user to the post itself which means it will have to somehow get the id of the post

22902175
hash	md5
md5 and sha are not suitable for this anymore as computers are faster and faster they can hash dictionary words and common passwords at a rate of 60+ billion per second to try to get your passwords

22902175
hash	salt
and this for an explanation as for why secure hash and salt for php passwords

22902190
int	chars
each loop u must verify if it is chars or int if int then check if it is than the max value if so set the new max value

22902192
min	median
so if the above statement is true why using the median of median as the pivot to partition the array to find the kth min elem s time complexity worst case is o n

22902211
int	double
use double instead of int or just carefully convert your int into a double before doing any division

22902213
debian	linux
kali linux - debian wheezy

22902239
getter	setter
for a property such as firstname and lastname you do not need to create the setter and getter this is done automatically

22902239
getter	setter
for custom setter and getter you will need to create them such as for the fullname property

22902244
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
it does not show up on desktops tested google-chrome firefox safari and ie

22902292
int	double
how to differentiate the int and double

22902295
folder	directory
if so navigate to the folder of your virtual env and into the bin directory cd virtual_env bin add a file called postactivate and save this line in it

22902296
lambdify	sympy
for instance for lambdify x sin x numpy sin x is converted to sin x the string form here is the same as the regular string form but they can differ because of function name differences between sympy and numpy

22902324
put	get
i work in program freemind which allows to create trees and import them as html files and i need to get every path of this tree and put them into list for example to work with each path separately after

22902356
qmainwindow	qapplication
you can fix this either by moving the quit exit call so that it s in the event loop by moving your mainwindow start code to the qmainwindow showevent slot or by changing your mainwindow start to return a value inspect that value in main and exit without calling qapplication exec if it s a value that indicates your process should exit early

22902380
leaflet	proj
for example i just added leaflet marker cluster to my proj and this gem has 3 files that are needed in the assets folder but after running bundle they are no where to be found

22902389
getter	setter
here s my main class the referenced classes are just basic templates that don t do anything special aside from having getter and setter so i won t bother posting them here

22902396
submit	submission
this will negate the need for javascript and will preserve default browser behavior for a submit button like automatically submission the form when pressing the enter key

22902418
hide	show
a toggle or show hide function will only work for 1 select field

22902440
onmouseover	onclick
all i could find about that is that it should be after the page is loaded by physically placing it after the content or using window.onload i have tried various combinations of that and then that with nameless functions named functions functions triggered by onclick or onmouseover but still nothing happens

22902509
cos	sin
you have to calculate the positions of the textboxes using cos and sin

22902561
width	height
my fill function is supposed to fill a 2d array of width by height solely with zeros

22902636
for-loop	arrays
instead use a for-loop in viewdidload adding the images to an nsmutablearray then use that arrays as your data source

22902676
g++	gcc
gcc 4.7.3 g++ -wall -wextra main.cpp

22902697
inherited	properties
and finally as fbinarytree inherited some of the properties of the cont monad or the yoneda lemma type we can define a functor instance for fbinarytree

22902736
width	height
by default width and height is 100

22902745
ng-show	ng-hide
i know i can ng-hide ng-show these links cient side with angular but i d prefer to not even output the markup if the user shouldn t have the authorization to use them they are protected server-side as well.

22902751
inherited	properties
the static inherited in typescript is a bit different from static inherited in c# -- each class in the hierarchy gets its own copy of the static properties

22902813
udp	tcp
you can t - if you ve registered your protocol dissector for a specific tcp or udp port then packets for that udp tcp port are your protocol

22902821
put	get
but once the xhr finishes the changes in the address var doesn t get cascaded to the controller - lest i put an implicit watch on it

22902845
for-loop	loops
it imports class a for-loop and write some log data for each loops

22902867
listview	gridview
i m not sure this d be an optimal solution with gridview but it works fine with listview

22902880
filewriter	printwriter
so i passed a file into filewriter and then passed to printwriter

22902883
getter	setter
if you truly do you must define a setter for the variable like the getter that you already have but my guess is that really you should be rethinking your strategy sorting objects generally should not involve altering the objects themselves

filtering	grouping
i m looking to do several grouping filtering to cut the data down

22902980
width	height
the issue is that if you position the .test div absolute inside another div with an absolute position without any dimension specified height and width you can t expect .test div to work with percentages because its parent element .overview is positioned absolute as well with no dimensions specified

22902980
width	height
so currently if you set .test to absolute position its width will be 0 zero while .overview its parent has zero width and zero height

revmob	marmalade
revmob neither revmob sdk marmalade or cocos2d-x allows for banner positioning the default banner stretches to take up 1 4 of a landscape screen or callbacks

22904701
revmob	marmalade
this one is more promising than revmob because banner positioning and event callbacks appear to be possible but due to marmalade and cocos2d-x s gl conflicts this might turn out to be just as bad a solution as iwgameads

22904743
versioning	upgrade
so here how i could handle this situation when this user upgrade my application from versioning 1 to versioning 1.2 where versioning 1.1 is missed and attribute which i added is also missed that can create problems

22905082
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is when i run it on google-chrome firefox or ie the smooth transition effect doesn t work

22905133
hide	show
that is because there is no enough space to show all text and vbox will resize its children to their preferred size where the labels just hide their overflowed texts

22905269
int	chars
so if you are converting signed chars to signed int or unsigned chars to unsigned int there is no problem

22905269
int	chars
see for example the following code with 8-bit chars and 32-bit int types

22905269
int	chars
it actually takes the signed chars -50 bit value treats that as an unsigned chars and widens that to an unsigned int preserving correctly its unsigned value of 206

22905269
int	chars
the second case does the same thing since a signed int is more than capable of holding the full range of unsigned chars values in this implementation

22905353
uiview	subviews

here my problem is how can i call getter and setter in for-loop

22905431
min	max
if we use newd1 newd2 to denote the new datarange min and max values that we re trying to compute

22905431

the only other code i ve written is the css class for the background of each page s div simple 100 width 683px height box class wrap

22906112
for-loop	arrays
after for-loop the arrays should got no folder and no files

22906125
integer	fractions
the |0 cuts off the fractions value so we end up with an integer value which we need for the next step

change the width to 100 and set text-align left

22906207

my function uses rsa dsa .

22906213
sorting	filtering
having 5000 records this means the server has to hold about 20k of data assuming 32-bit integers for each user doing a search query not using filtering like sorting all records by the time last changed

22906244
opencv	emgucv
as far as i am concerned emgucv is a dot-net port of famous library named opencv with good reliability that you can count on it and do your project.what s more thanks to its nature which is a library dll you could easily use it in your project and run wherever clr is running including windows 8 os

22906254
gson	jackson
you most probably would not be able to make use of automatic json parsing libraries like gson jackson or the integrated in the adnroid sdk androidobject

22906293
versioning	upgrade
when you re done and you want to get back to the latest versioning again you can either run your existing upgrade process on your database to get it back to the latest versioning

22906346
versioning	upgrade
for instance this one matches 2.0.2 versioning of signalr if you upgrade signalr via package then you ll have to manually edit this line

22906355
post	get
the application needs to get the last 300 post from a single user aggregate them and display the result

22906355
disk	ram
if there s a lot of users and posts it may occur that all 300 posts from this user are in different places of disk there s not enough ram to cache the database files and to serve one request mysql needs to do 300 io ops so with a hdd able to do 150 iops that request would require 2 seconds and a second concurrent user will need to wait a lot

22906500
width	height
your uielemet height and width values will be 0 when you create them using code

22906500
width	height
if you want the image in a particular resolution try to assign the same height and width to the uielement as well

22906513
for-loop	loops
you should set hit to 0 at the start of your while loops so it ll check hit seperately for every iteration of the for-loop p

22906537
google-chrome	firefox
p.s. actually firefox seems to be the only browser which handle correctly multiline base64 even in src attribute at least on my pc internet explorer and google-chrome fail to set the src attribute too so it is advisable to remove line feeds even for base64 data in src attribute

22906587
post	put
use form method post and also put value for each radio

22906588
hash	md5
some things compared with md5-hashes in php and java the md5 hash are equally

22906591
serializable	deserialization
the serializable and deserialization of the of various arraylists should work what ever the size

22906643
width	height
to minimize resizing in microsoft word go to page layout and choose size more pagesizes and set width and height to max 55 87 cm 55 87 cm

22906697
hide	show
you can hide all sub menu .menuleveltwo when your list item is clicked and only show the sub menu under clicked list item

22906705
hash	md5
obviously we cant use md5 to hash the password because we need to send the password to external system

22906728
google-chrome	firefox
my problem is the following code works google-chrome but not in firefox

22906729
hash	md5
if you explicitly specify the same encoding in both your .net and java code you ll end up with the same md5 hash as well

22906781
hash	md5
its not the problem of md5 hash generator

22906781
hash	md5
md5 hash for bb27aee4 46d5acfcd281bca9f1df7c9e38d50576

22906781
hash	md5
md5 hash for bb27aee4 b767fe33172ec6cbea569810ee6cfc05

22906781
hash	md5
so basically in .net you are generating md5 hash for bb27aee4 instead of bb27aee4

22906821
mouseleave	mouseenter
added to this group is an mouseenter and mouseleave event

22906899
lisp	scheme	haskell	scheme
i m guessing that in lisp scheme it d be done using macros and in haskell using templates

22906908
int	chars
for signed chars the range of an int is always equal to or larger than the range of a signed chars and conversion from signed chars to an int is always safe

22906908
int	chars
and it s possible for conversion from unsigned chars to an int to be unsafe

22906908
int	chars
because chars can be either signed or unsigned conversion from chars to int is only almost always safe and not guaranteed to be safe in theory

22906908
int	chars
typically if you re using chars you only use values from 0 to 127 to avoid portability problems and if you need to store negative values or larger positive values you use different data type to begin with signed chars uint8_t int etc

22906908
int	chars
if a chars is only used to store values from 0 to 127 then converting chars to an int is always safe regardless of what values char_min and char_max have

22906954
int	double
if you convert the double to floats you get a completely different set of values which are wrong but for example int 4.2f-0.2f gives the wrong result

22906977
post	get
first add any method attribute to your form tag like get or post

22906988
hide	show
in addition i am also able to hide show based on other element values like this

22907154
min	max
you can set it html5 min and max attr

22907158
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
this code work fine in ie11 but not in other browsers like firefox safari google-chrome

22907261
next	except
in the case of your code all the objects created inside the loop except the last one become unreferenced as soon as the next one is created because the prior reference in the same stack slot is overwritten

if i however put the content of onlyids that i get printed from line 5 which looks like

22907503
sorting	filtering
my application already handles deciding which tables and fields are required as well as filtering and sorting and this information is available at run time

22907517
width	height
it is not a very good idea to try modifying the uialertview s height width or add a uiimageview to it as this might result in your app getting rejected by the app store

22907520
width	height
just you can shorten the animating view size in height wise as well as the width so you will be able to replicate the exact behavior what you want

22907590
showwindow	cdialog
as in scottmcp-mvp comment in your code you have not called cdialog create method before showwindow

22907641

add super form1 self .__init__ in __init__ method of form1 class

22907656
post	get
when sending a post request i get this in my log

22907763

this removes the datepicker when the dialog is closed so that next time one is created it contains the correct min and max dates

22907772

i tried crypto++ and openssl both gave me immense lists of errors at build time

22907893

22911534
accessor	properties
you should be using the accessor you created when you declared the properties

22911534
accessor	ivar	accessor	properties
if you don t need the accessor then you shouldn t be creating a properties but instead simply an ivar

22911534

with that said assuming you didn t write custom accessor accessing the ivar directly is virtually the same as going through the accessor

22912691
width	height
qrectf s documentation shows that it takes x y width height

22912698
children	parent
the parent should keep a shared_ptr to retain its children and the children will keep a weak_ptr to the parent

22912698
children	parent
then the child creates a shared_ptr with this in the ctor and puts that into the parent s vector of children

22912698
children	parent
when the ctor returns the raw pointer to the factory function the factory function uses shared_from_this to get a shared_ptr that is hooked up to sharing a reference count with the shared_ptr that s in the parent s vector of children

22912830
post	get
the get and post in front of the method name is the request type this prevents you having to do something like this

22912830
post	get
it also gives you more control over authorisation if you do it at the routing layer because you can easily allow a user to send a get request to the controller but deny them access to sending a post request

22912832
width	height
what this code does it creates a hidden img on the page stores it s width and height as variables works out which is bigger width or height then returns a cropped img

22913366
accessor	properties
to get the same result i could however use accessor properties with this code

22913380
post	get

22927081
google-chrome	firefox
in one particular case i have placed a div inside a and i am lost as to why the google-chrome cannot render it properly irrespective of the fact that firefox is happy and does not complain

22927084
width	height
you ll need to remove the inline percentage width and height on the images

22927108
ready	each
btw i thought about counting number of request required for each page and on every fetch event to do smth like window.late.yetanotheroneready so when we have all elements ready it would do

22927139

22927150
google-chrome	firefox
if you develop in google-chrome it normally works in firefox and via verse

22927150
google-chrome	firefox
i normally create my webpage and focus on firefox and google-chrome once i like the results i open ie and debug

22927171
ready	each
ie internet explorer and little effort doesn t match to each other you have to invest more of your time and effort only for ie illuminate ie and be happy as a suggestion use twitter bootstrap if possible it s a ready and tested css framework maybe framework is not perfect name

22927171
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome has it s built in debugger inspector ctrl + shift + i and on firefox you may use firebug extension and these browsers are not dumb like ie and there are lots of debugging extensions available for these browsers for free not worried about these good guys

22927174
width	height
cause your header is just the textview with wrap_content as width and height

22927226
google-chrome	firefox
i know i can edit html elements in google-chrome firefox inspector

22927229
implements	extends
i have a menu and toolbar that are defined in plugin.xml and a class that implements a source provider by extends abstractsourceprovider

22927262
maven	pom.xml
maven configuration in pom.xml is given bellow

22927263
width	height
if it is to keep height to match to 1 line you will need to set width of and to few s or s and fix these with table-layout fixed

22927293
width	height
set the height and width of the canvas element directly

22927302
sorting	grouping
don t do the grouping or sorting or anything

22927386
width	height
as i tested i realized that the height was always correct and my problem was the width

postgresql	mysql
postgresql is stricter about conversions than mysql is and generally will throw an error rather than try to convert a string to an integer if it doesn t look like one

22927614
for-loop	loops
and it s still true right after loops combined with false for-loop condition

22927632
lodash	underscore.js
highly recommend to use well known and performant utility libraries like lodash or underscore.js

22927632
lodash	underscore.js
ps if you use the well known restangular library the decision becomes even easier as it depends on lodash or underscore.js already

22927654
min	max
when testing this code with max 70 and min 59 it returns 1.0 instead of 0.5

22927654

if max min return 0.0. so idk if relevant to the problem

22927660
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
in all major browsers like google-chrome firefox safari on focus of the input field cursor appears at the beginning on top of content but in internet explorer the cursor appears after content

22927679
hash	salt
the salt should then be stored in the clear in your database alongside the password hash and iteration count so you can change it and probably a version code too so you can change it again your current calculated salt method is version 1 and the random salt is version 2

22927679
pbkdf2	salt	pbkdf2	hash	hash	salt
spending 20 000 iterations of pbkdf2 on the salt rather than spending it on the actual password hash

22927679
scrypt	pbkdf2
if you aren t using rfc2898derivebytes another pbkdf2 implementation bcrypt or scrypt to do the actual password hashing then that s what you re doing wrong

22927685
min	max
your issue is that max + min 2 is an integer division which means it gets truncated to the integer below

22927694
factors	mean
however mean can t take the mean of a factors and when i convert the factors to a numeric the na s become 3 s

22927698

22927734
width	height
there s a note in the jquery documentation about overflow and height width

22927737

22927739
plot	heatmap
i am developing an application that should have multiple highcharts on the same page with export to pdf button.on the left navigation there would be links to go to any high chart and a text area to enter user comments.suppose we have three high charts that is bar chart heatmap and scatter plot on th esame page.if user wants to navigate to any of this chart then he must click on the links on the left navigation.the left navigation part will be available to each of the chart so that user can navigate to any chart

one more note consider extending classes that are more specific than runtimeexception illegalargumentexception illegalstateexecption etc

22927891
public	protected
defined by using one of the keywords public protected or private followed by a normal variable declaration

22927899
oncreate	setcontentview
setcontentview should be in oncreate method within first few lines

22927899
oncreate	setcontentview
check the saved item in shared preferences before and then use setcontentview method in oncreate

22927903
oncreate	onstart
difference is onrestoreinstancestate is called after onstart and oncreate is called before onstart

22927903
oncreate	recreate
activity state is saved before orientation is changed and oncreate will recreate your activity with previous saved state

22927930

if you want the images included within the jar then you will need to move the images folder into the src directory

22928430
folder	directory
if you want the images to remain external to your program jars and remain open to the file system then you need to ensure that the execution context for the program is within the context of the project folder at the same level as the src and images directory

the first client gets from this url and waits for 20 seconds to see if the second client has posted some data for the first client within the 20 second timeout period or not.if the second client did post before the timeout then that value is returned to the get request else a default value is returned for the get request

22929099
post	get
another approach in my mind was to use 2 separate urls - one for get request serverrequest and the other for post request postdata

22929099
post	get
i need to implement a longpoll where a client sends a get request and waits for a timeout period the data might not be immediately available to consume so it waits for 20 seconds for some other client to post some data for the first client to consume

22929105
int	chars
you are treating an array of int like an array of chars

22929721
post	get
now when i try to call the post action on every controller that inherits from the generic base controller i get the error mentioned in the title

22929721
post	put
the thing is with other http methods no error occur for instance the put and when i change the name of the post action on the generic base controller to add for instance the error remains

22929755

22929904
serializable	deserialization
the generated message and builder classes provide serializable and deserialization methods that work directly with byte arrays and also streams in java and sending and receiving a byte array over the udp is arguably more natural then converting something to string and then converting that string to byte array and back

debugger will only reach a s equals implementation breakpoint if a s gethashcode implementation returns

22930763
int	double
since your second invocation has two arguments and an int can be converted to a double without loss of precision see jls section 5.1.2 the compiler elects to call your two-argument method

22930943
equals	gethashcode
tapping into other implmentations that call equals and gethashcode like the base and operators and linq extensions and generic collection constructors where you don t supply an alternative

22930943
equals	gethashcode
this implementation of a correctly overrides equals and gethashcode this change is sufficient to ensure that after calling the linq extension

22930943
equals	gethashcode
this overload of distinct ingnores a s overridden equals and gethashcode and uses acomparerinsensitive to perform the comparison

22930949

i think it is best if you post the error message you get from the sas log

22939502

i ve been installing multiple versions of ubuntu over years and now i better understand why i faced always problems with wifi configuration on these different baselines debian root of course

22939739
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
the nice part of using an arrays versus using an object is that you can loops through them in order with a simple for-loop whereas using a for...in on an object does not guarantee the order

22939751
put	get
i was wondering if i can get the new emails data and put it in a spreadsheet

22939785
int	double
note - using touint32 is a more sensible approach than converting to signed int and taking the absolute value it also double the number of values you can generate since -123 and 123 will result in a different string output which they won t if you use math.abs .

22939850

why not change the allowed file type array to array image jpg image jpeg image png image gif

22939971
inherited	properties
you can add all of them into array and then deserialise based on type you will have to add type properties manually or you could create object ihavetype and then inherited from it in objects that are being used but that s a horrible way to do this

22940001
ubuntu	debian
in a posix-only shell sh on debian and ubuntu where sh is dash use the stty -echo approach which is suboptimal because it prints nothing because the read builtin will not support the -s and -n options

i give the code which i use to rotate a node bellow and inside the rotation procedure if i check the nodes by their value and the childre value the node 20 has 10 and 50 as his children so the rotation itself works the problem seems to be that the procedure does not give me back the node with 20 as the parent one

22940331
int	chars
i wonder if this because int s storage in memory is 4 and it can hold 1 memory storage as chars

as the browser size changes it will load as necessary into the other divs and i use media queries to hide or show those divs based on my desired screen sizes for the html i ll serve

22940384
int	chars
chars are simply small int so of course the smaller value fits in the larger int variable there s nothing to warn about

22940384
int	chars
many standard c functions use int to transport single chars since they then also get the possibility to express eof which is not a chars

22940390
int	chars
when you convert each value in an array of int to a corresponding value in an array of chars you just have an array of chars

22940390
int	chars
the int values of each chars representation of the int 0 1 2 with the null chars 0 in the last position to mark the end of string.

22940402

width	height
so when grid2 is getting initialized the coords object gets created first at which point the width and height of grid1 get used

22940622
children	parent
also as currently structured your parent could end before reaping all the children

22940622
children	parent
add a counter for the children so that you wait on all of them before the parent exits

22940623
put	get
i found that the best way around this is to either scan the entire drawingtexts collection in the drawingview and apply a unique name or you create the drawing text from the script and you can more easily get a handle on the drawingtext object to put whatever value you want in there

22940690
google-chrome	firefox
i m interested in a google-chrome solution only ie firefox are not supported

22940695

22942068
nsstring	nsobject
i saw that whenever you include a class you can access to it s methods for example if i create a new class that is a subclass of nsobject i can still access to nsstring and its methods just by including nsstring.h

inherited	subclassing
subclassing is an object-oriented programming technique for creating a subtype of an existing type that inherited the supertype s behavior

22942375
int	chars
for historical reasons chars constants are actually int s so the line

22942375
int	chars
furthermore the c format specifier in printf actually expects to receive an int argument not a chars

22942375
int	chars
this is because the default argument promotions are applied to variadic arguments and therefore any chars in a call to printf is promoted to an int before the function is called

22942431
button	checkbox
i want a div with checkbox to be displayed when mouse is hovered over button

22942466

22942698
sudo	passwd
if i add sudo in front of the lines that need root it throws an error stating a passwd is needed

22942707

just shuffle down the ones above the element you are deleting using memmove then realloc to shrink the allocated memory

22942816
for-loop	loops
your loops increments i twice once in the for-loop and once in the else clause

22942837

i made this because firefox and google-chrome have different api implementations of html5 dnd

22942877
boost	armadillo
boost and armadillo

22942911
int	chars
i know you are asking about chars but i am giving you example on int

22942911
int	chars
either int or chars you should avoid declaring it directly in your class

22942986
min	max
i used min and max but this way just show one big mark merging all the marks of the day

22942987
post	get
if your goal is to filter the categories that get populated on the post you can do

22942993
free	malloc	free	strcpy	strcpy	malloc
i want to create my own strcpy function without .i have read that whenever we call malloc function to allocate memory we must freeing the memory that we have allocate using free function but why this program give me a strange error i never seen this type of error before and why this program doesn t give me the exact destination string

22942995
post	get
now to get the latest post for a topic i am doing something like the following

22943020
squash	merge	squash	branch
if you re going to just squash the dev branch instead of merging it normally it s not a good idea to then merge that squashed commit back into the dev branch because then you ll get a ton of confusing conflicts because git thinks you re applying new code when in fact it s actually the same code

22943024
subtract	add
my reasoning is if i subtract add 30days to user s input and search for it

22943043
inherited	properties
i want allow the final user inherited from cmsdbcontext in order to create custom extra tables entities by adding mapping dbset properties and custom poco s

google-chrome	safari
i cannot figure out why animations of background-position aren t working on my version of google-chrome of safari webkit browsers

22943095
aggregate-functions	sum
the sum is a standard aggregate-functions

22943130
put	get
however the fortran standard defines a subroutine random_seed with three optional arguments named save put and get

22943130
put	get
put and get are for setting and getting the random seed

22943186
width	height
most of the elements on the canvas are also set based on the width and height of the canvas so that they scale down in size and are positioned based on the size of the canvas

22943265
width	height
i ve found that extjs and sencha touch alike sometimes need the height and or width of some components set to display properly in ie

22943265
width	height
usually it s good enough to set both height and width to 100 rather than using a specific pixel value

22943279
nsapplication	nsrunloop
what are the limitations on a cocoa program that doesn t explicitly start nsapplication or nsrunloop

22943279
nsapplication	nsrunloop
i put breakpoints on + nsapplication alloc and + nsrunloop alloc and they were not triggered

22943285
put	get
once the combinations are put together then it is a simple matter to query them and get specific lengths like 60 minutes or 120 minutes

22943329
for-loop	arrays
i keep typing a for-loop to display my area but i cannot get my program to read the input from the arrays this is what i have so far

22943337
width	height
i am not sure if i completely understand what you up to but you may try to decide proportions of your items regarding to screen size so you can create function that will take dimensions of device s screen size using windowmanager class and then let s say you want 1 of width and height so divide both dimensions and apply values to your item

22943395
google-chrome	firefox
i am trying to create a simple lightbox and it works perfectly fine on firefox and google-chrome but does not work on ie8

22943395
google-chrome	firefox
have a look at this in firefox or google-chrome and then on ie.

22943439
integer	radix
scanner.nextbyte will read the 1 and try to evaluate it as an integer regular expression of radix 10 and give you 1

22943439
integer	radix
scanner.nextbyte will read the a and try to evaluate it as an integer regular expression of radix 10 and throw a java.util.inputmismatchexception

22943485
integer	radix
if the next token matches the integer regular expression defined above then the token is converted into a byte value as if by removing all locale specific prefixes group separators and locale specific suffixes then mapping non-ascii digits into ascii digits via character.digit prepending a negative sign - if the locale specific negative prefixes and suffixes were present and passing the resulting string to byte.parsebyte with the specified radix

22943522
google-chrome	firefox
2.1.0 adds support for non-traditional web environments like node.js and browser plugins for google-chrome and firefox

22943552

this has taken me on a fun route between apache to nginx to apache to nginx and now finally back to apache

22943552
elasticsearch	kibana
i use elasticsearch-head to make sure it wasn t anything else but it seems like elasticsearch is still being blocked even though i can reach the kibana webpage

22943609
width	height
whenever putting things in a viewbox - you should specify their sizes explicitly so you should set the width and height of your grid or at least the scrollviewer

22943631
try-catch	exception-handling
its taking the exception-handling path in this try-catch and displaying

22943645

i have changed nginx s public directory from usr share nginx html to www var public_html since i have mounted the var folder

22943647
nunit	moq
for these unit tests i ve grabbed useful tools such as nunit fluentassertions moq autofixture etc

22943647
folder	directory
therefore i ve created a lib folder in my project s directory to add 3rd party libraries such as these tools for unit tests

22943672
mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave
after looking at some other sources online and this link jquery mouseenter mouseleave image swap i found that i need to call the .hover function instead of individually calling mouseover and mouseleave

22943691
glassfish	weblogic	jboss	weblogic	jboss	glassfish
it might also be that the container your re deploying to jboss glassfish weblogic ... already has a copy of the axis libraries and you need to figure out how to make it only whichever copy is the version you want

i added the min and max fields but still no luck

22943807
min	max
right now validations for min and max fields are not working

22943810
fadein	fadeout
also taking into consideration josh s suggestion you wouldn t need to make the fadein a callback to the fadeout you could initiate them at the same time to have a crossfade

22943813
folder	directory
all the tables and images are saved on the same directory inside the figure folder

22943934
ant	maven
then to add the files in the jar this will depend on your workflow and how your build your project using eclipse ant maven etc

22943939
sorting	filtering
my solution will require a pure-css version due to sorting and filtering functionality that will not work across tables

22943973
getter	setter
i know it won t be the same as you can t make any whole-program assumptions but shouldn t it be possible to do some basic things like inlining setter getter that aren t defined in the header

22944075
range	max	range	min	min	max
min max range all inclusive between n m n-or-more exactly n

22944075

dfa versus nfa

22944076
serializable	deserialization
when another type that isn t annotated is used i don t get an exception on serializable but on deserialization - that is to late

22944095
csv	tsv
in a program which uses the mobile service sdk you d read the lines from the csv or tsv file convert it to the appropriate structure either directly to json via the jobject type or a typed class and call the insertasync method in the client to insert the data to the server

22944100
min	max
the min max validation is only available for this type of input field

22944159
uicollectionview	uitableview
on second thoughts in your case uicollectionview is surely a better candidate than uitableview

22944252
selecteditem	selectedindex
however with my current code if i select an option leave the page then go back the selectedindex setting has been saved but the selecteditem isn t

22944252
selecteditem	selectedindex
if i use the same code for selecteditem as i do for the selectedindex i get errors

22944275
public	protected
create a probabilityvector class which wraps around an and implement the data validation there with the protected constructor + public static method above

22944275
public	protected
2 gets around this problem but i m not sure if the protected constructor + static public approach is elegant because it involves raw pointers

22944284
button	right-align
even if i use it the placeholder text becomes right-align after clearing the field via the clear x button

22944285
google-chrome	firefox
i m testing on a genymotion simulator with android default browser google-chrome and firefox and only google-chrome is loading the url correctly

22944320
put	get
this obviously doesn t work since there is nothing i can put in the get because the tuple hasn t been constructed yet

22944382
sorting	filtering
the count and page parameters bind perfectly fine and the filtering and sorting binds as an instance of a dictionary but its count is 0

22944385
mp3	wav
check that it s one of the supported types wav mp3 is actually in your res raw directory and build clean if needed

22944409
width	height
3.all i can set is only text width and height

22944425
ant	maven
build framework such as ant maven or gradle it is important to make

22944452
accessor	properties
__proto__ properties is actually accessor to prototype of the object

22944467
google-chrome	firefox
the error occures in firefox and google-chrome edit nope just firefox

22944478
folder	dir
this command installs the framework for me leaving me with a few folder in the root of my dir

22944497
git-rebase	amend
assuming that the amended content is not also sensitive then this might work checkout a new branch at the commit that you want to amend amend the file then use a non-interactive git-rebase that preserves merges of everything after the previously un-amended commit back onto the new amended commit

22944522
hide	show
in addition to numeric values each property can take the strings show hide and toggle

22944551
int	chars
essentially taking the chars to the left of the delimiter converting to an int multiplying by 60 and adding it to the numbers to the right of but before .

22944556
serializable	deserialization
i read a bunch of the answers on this site - lots of discussion about custom gson serializable deserialization

22944574
put	get	post	get	post	put
as a rest based application i am making use of several http verbs get post put delete etc

22944629
hide	show
i have the following code that is supposed to be a list of facilities and i made a div acting as a popup that contain information that should change depending on the lab i click info i already made the popup appear and dissapear playing with adding a hide and show class to it using js

22944649
hide	show
in addition to numeric values each property can take the strings show hide and toggle

22944666
free	malloc
so i am working on a project in c where we need to implement malloc and free meaning we cannot use any c memory management functions such as malloc or free

22944740
associativity	operator-precedence
to understand what is going on refer to the operator-precedence and associativity chart

22944756
dbcontext	objectcontext
it s database-first and because of huge overhead migration to dbcontext will result in i m still dancing with objectcontext

22944771
circuit	nor
since you re not looking for a specific value or subset of the information in the data collection nor have a way to short circuit the iterations i try to accomplish that task with a nested for cycle when you say

22944787
qtableview	qtablewidget
edit the closest i ve found anywhere is this but it s dealing with qtablewidget and the functions used aren t available for qtableview

22944836
implements	extends
reading through various posts etc one of the recommendations was to extends realmbase instead of just implements realm and overriding all required methods so i have done that

22944845
getter	setter
look at this example let s say you have a class person and a subclass employee with an extra field called salary and its respective getter setter

22944857
lme4	nlme
that means you have to use lme4 lmer not nlme lme to fit your model

22944897
folder	directory
bin is not a library it s a directory or some people call them folder and it has nothing to do with the argument -lm

22944921
inherited	properties
you will probably save yourself a lot of headache by making inherited an object passing the object around and when you need to display it show the object properties

22944943
getter	setter
i want if i need to create in animal getter setter to this values or put this values protected

22944960
skype	hangout
i would like the branches lines to kind of grow from each category voice video chat to following nodes hangout skype etc

google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
this problem occurs on safari 7.0.2 9537.74.9 on mac os x 10.9 and on the iphone simulator but does not occur on firefox google-chrome or on and ios 6 ipad 2

22945043
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception	nullpointerexception	runtimeexception
catching exception is dangerous because it also catches all runtimeexception s therefore unchecked-exception and that include niceties such as nullpointerexception etc which are clear programmer errors

22945084
width	height
i also have a uiview outside of the uiscrollview which takes up the entire width of the screen and 85 pixels of the height located at the very top of the interface

22945092
csv	tsv
q - run sql directly on csv or tsv files

22945126
getter	setter
put the values in the animal class and create public getter and setter

22945153
getter	setter
use getter and setter it s the standard java approach eliminates confusion as to where the variable is coming from and allows parent classes to do whatever pre post processing they need to do on the values such as validation on setting or lazy initializing on getting

22945153
getter	setter
also in a lot of aspect oriented programming important if you use or plan on using spring relies on method call interception using getter and setter will help with that as well

22945207
put	get
however if i put another inner join with table kills as k2 and add count k2.killid as deaths i get an odd result that i think is the sum of all player kills all player deaths instead of player specific kills deaths

22945252
feedback	review
pretty muche code review is a good way to fix what you just mentioned code standards variable naming code placement and give performance structure feedback

22945264
des	rsa
i did some research and i found out about the command keytool but it creates the key for you using either rsa or des and i do not know how to use it to store my own keys

22945269
implements	extends
as entity override are not possible you have to just implements a concrete entity class by extends the abstract class defined in your shared bundle

22945379
post	get
i post the code as normal post to get a better presentation of multiple lines of code

22945395
google-chrome	firefox
have not validated touch behavior though but firefox google-chrome seems to be ok w this

chown	sudo	chown	chmod
sudo chown -r bitnami daemon opt bitnami apps wordpress your plugin directory sudo chmod -r g+w opt bitnami apps wordpress your plugin directory

22945432
postgresql	mysql
for that many features you should probably load your shapefile data into a database like mysql or postgresql with the postgis extension

22945438
pull	push
another approach that may work for you is to use pull and push

22945443
ubuntu	debian
for example to install on debian ubuntu

22945446
google-chrome	firefox
if in fact all you are trying to do is open a browser page from inside some java code and navigate to a url you can use a processbuilder or the runtime.exec to open a browser to the url you are thinking of eg ie google-chrome firefox etc

22945465
post	get
i ll run this by heroku support as well and post an update but wanted to get thoughts from the community

22945517
getter	setter
using getter and setter is always problematic especially in a situation like this

22945518
packets	multicast
once all of this happens a multicast packets is received on pc1 via eth

22945538
setinterval	settimeout
you still need to use setinterval or settimeout for scheduling in a well-implemented sequencer

22945538
setinterval	settimeout
the problem is the accuracy of setinterval settimeout particularly in the main thread can be quite low when you say settimeout 600 you might be called back in 600ms

22945580
google-chrome	firefox
fiddle - tested in google-chrome 33 firefox 28 ie 10

22945591
onresume	onpause
simply reset the seek bar in onpause or onresume of your seekbaractivity

22945639
versioning	upgrade
what solve this issue for me actually was salt-master package upgrade seems that their api got somehow icompatible between versioning so newer salt-minion installed wasn t syncing file_roots properly

22945793
width	height
i am moving image above another images the image goes at correct positions if not applying any type of scaling but if i apply scaling it will never goes at correct position.possibly width and height is changed

without modifying the cookbooks which is bad how can i get around this or scope to only apache or nginx

22945827
google-chrome	firefox
what i don t understand if how we can execute or run that project in my local browser such as google-chrome or firefox etc.

22945833
arraylist	treeset
if the problem is running time you should make sure that idspercorridos is a treeset or hashset as these allow for efficient contains calls as opposed to arraylist or linkedlist which don t

22945837
mdpi	hdpi
considering this scale it means manually resize all my icons and buttons on photoshop and then load them into the respective folders mdpi hdpi and xdpi

22945845
int	chars
the first is the int the second is the chars

22945845
int	chars
the second chars is not an int so it is left in the buffer

22945875
post	put
even though it doesn t have to do with focus change the principles are the same and i figured it would be more beneficial to post actual working code than to put together an example that may not work exactly as i intended

22945881
maven	pom.xml
so far my bust guess is that this is the location of the swizzle-confluence but the maven pom.xml is not configured to look there

22945889
post	get
as mentioned above that you do not get any exception related to heap corruption does not mean that it did not happen.there would be problem in your code and not in vs or compiler.my previous post on the similar article would be useful here as well

22945906
width	height
it keeps it s normal width height and position

22945906
width	height
if the hover states on those elements did actually change the real width and height instead of transform scale

22945906
width	height
the solution is to just change the width and height of your image

22945916
button	checkbox
and the button will automatically enable disable based on whether or not the checkbox is checked

22945924
versioning	upgrade
osx mavericks trying to upgrade from rails 4.0.4 to either 4.1.0.beta1 or 4.1.0.rc2 with ruby versioning ruby 2.1.1p76 2014-02-24 revision 45161 x86_64-darwin12.0

filesystems	fat
here comes a straight-forward question about random access when it comes to filesystems using fat

22946055
int	chars
at the end of the method when you read the value of a you re pulling an int from the scanner but you re not pulling out the newline chars that follows the int

22946061
width	height
width of the popup is fixed but height can be different but not more then some maximum value

22946083
width	height
transition width 0.3s height 0.6s

22946138
stdout	fflush
t get stdout data from process unless its manually fflush

22946138
stdout	fflush
and tried fflush stdout in my native executable directly after every printf call like the page suggested but it didn t work

22946208
client-side	server-side
best practices would be to validate both client-side before ajax and server-side just in case

22946216
rspec	capybara
i am using capybara and rspec to test my rails app

22946269
hide	show
to help me i developed a category for uiview able to hide show autolayout view

22946290
folder	directory
i actually recommend that you store your spring configuration files in the classpath src main resources if following maven s directory layout and then reference them in the classpath as you have done above but without storing them in a folder named web-inf in the classpath

22946299
width	height
the default layout for a listactivity is just a listview with match_parent for height and width

ienumerable	iqueryable
iqueryable implements the ienumerable interface and allows for queried results to the database to be enumerated

22946477
ienumerable	ilist
basically the methods will range from a base of ienumerable all the way up to ilist which has a larger selection available

22946477
ilist	icollection	ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	icollection
in general you can use ienumerable for a set of data which needs to be iterated and used icollection for a set of data which is going to be iterated and modified and ilist for a set of data which is going to be iterated modified and sorted

22946507
google-chrome	firefox
it can be helpful to inspect this topic in order to understand how to set google-chrome browser instead of firefox if you are using selenium web-driver

hash	salt
the aspect you should instead worry about is how hard it is to brute force the password given the salt and the hash the scenario of a database breach

22948911
hash	salt
that effectively means hashing all likely passwords with the saved salt and comparing it against the stored reference hash

22948911
hash	salt
the salt protects against rainbow table attacks where huge precomputed databases can be queried to look up the original hash

22948911

i know that i can go into the preferences for an individual project and add libs to the buildpath but i can t figure out how to easily do this for all of my projects at once and i feel like i m just trying things until they work so it would be good to have a more defined procedure for dealing with these sorts of problems

22949206

you can put everything into a single double -quoted string so as to be able to embed variable references directly but distinguishing between what the shell will interpret up front and what sed will interpret can get confusing quickly

22949267

the problem is that you are converting a chars to an int and not taking into account the ascii offsets in the ascii table

22949276

22949768
octal	hex
i ve seen some c functions in the past that parse numbers from strings and behave with the digit furthest to left being interpreted as the base if the leading digit is 0 the function interprets the value as octal or if the leading chars are 0x it interprets it as hex

22949772
for-loop	loops
list sentence gets each individual character in the sentence which we loops over with a for-loop

22949799

i just tried to put together a short piece of self running code but realized that i probably do not fully understand how arrays are handled if handed over to a function which could be part of the reason why i get error messages calling my program

in java a properties is created by having a private instance variable used through accessor methods setter and or getter

22962833
min	max
i need to find max and min values from this array

22962842
goto	break
in fact break is a special kind of approved goto and because c is a minimal language you have to use an explicit goto in complex cases

22962927
cpu	processors
any other programs as well as the os itself use the processors which may not permit your program to fully utilize the available cpu power

22962927

the goto method is also a valid one but it is always advised not to use goto just because it break the control flow and can cause hours of debugging if the code is large enough

22963010
folder	directory
i am trying to rename files on specific folder it works on local system but not on another directory

22963126

in that function i have a switch that in case of the datatype of the array is d double c chars s string i int or f float

22963908
width	height
i suppose that this would fail if the image was tall instead of wide - but i guess you could decide how to calculate the size correctly based on which dimension of the viewbox was larger - the width or the height

22963985
hide	show
in your case use show and hide functionality this avoid jerky

22963993
min	max
one of them have periodic variation of whom the max and min are different in each period

22963993

what is strange though is that the splitter is working so when i move the mouse where it should be the cursor switches it s shape and i can drag the splitter but the splitter bar itself is invisible

22964114
int	boolean
when you compare an array to int you get a boolean array

22964152
mouseup	mousedown
there is no mouseclick event on ellipses however there is the mousedown and mouseup events

22964183
width	height
if you want first-line a bit wider than other you may use an absolute tag or pseudo of 0.25in width and average 1.2em height

22964323
uiview	subviews
uiview main view adding uiimageview as subviews and with this uiimageview adding the uiview as subviews onto which i draw the triangle

22964323
uiview	subviews
the easy fix would be to flip the uiview vertically again but i would like to know why adding the uiview as subviews of uiimageview would cause this flip

22964361
uiview	subviews
thus the new uiview has got all the new subviews objects created

22964369
post	get
the string get or post

22964411

you could use the left charindex and substr functions to accomplish this

22964477
hide	show
i have found many questions where people are asking how to hide scrollbars in vaadin layouts but my problem is that vaadin don t show me any scrollbars

22964498
getter	setter
the code as it is now makes use of â œgodâ objects where the database queries business logic database row all getter and setter are implemented into a single object

22964498
getter	setter
a database object do with just getter setter containing no logic what so ever

22964498
getter	setter
so far so good but now a requirement comes in where i donâ t want end users to use any of the do getter setter

22964498
getter	setter
so i made them package protected and added getter and setter to my management layer

22964498
getter	setter
the management class getter setter will add the business logic side of things and then call the doâ s setter getter

filtering	grouping
how can you make a filtering in linq where a query grouping only two subsequent rows if their level column is ascended by one

22964690
min	max
when the flag f is not set you assign the second column to max and min variables and start incrementing your flag

22964690
min	max
once the flag reaches 9 print the period number min and max variables

22964697

22964809
post	put
i wrote up a blog post and put the code on github if you are interested

22964814
implements	extends
way you say and implements is correct you have make model class extends with nsobject class here you create named singleton class that is fine with model class

22964891
google-chrome	firefox
but when i run the .swf through an html page on a local server the browser firefox google-chrome doesn t read write the lso correctly instead of localhost folder it creates a #localhost and at the end of the path no .sol file is generated

you could use a list and a custom icomparer object as well and simply call list.sort with the custom comparator

22965094
ubuntu	debian
currently there isn t any deb file for debian ubuntu as far as i know

22965139
width	margin
the above makes use of a div s natural habit of filling up space and the natural habit of margin to eat into this auto width calculation

22965144
getter	setter
the only case in which this rule is sort of broken is with properties where the default for a getter or setter is the same as the overall property declaration and you can only specify a more restrictive modifier on a getter setter

22965175
google-chrome	firefox
update it seems to be working correctly in google-chrome but it s a known and old 2001 bug in firefox

22965225

put	get
other options are to seek to the end as you put in your answer or get the concrete reader out of the interface

22965230
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
the best practice for removing items from an arrays you are looping is to use a for-loop and loops in reverse

22965239
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
edit this has been tested in ie11-9 firefox google-chrome safari and works cross platform at least in regards to windows mac pc s

gulp-useref	gulp-rev
i ve just written a gulp plugin to do this it works especially well with gulp-rev and gulp-useref

22965800
inherited	properties
originally your usage had an inherited datacontext which presumably had an isbuttonenable properties which you were seeing work

22965801
ilist	icollection
but i was told to not return but ilist or icollection

22965815
min	max
note that these operators are usually used only after a sort phase to get min max

22965833
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i can reproduce the problem only by calling the script within the same browser no mater which one in particular opera firefox google-chrome etc

22965899
udp	tcp
i have an application that uses boost.asio for tcp and udp socket communications

22965969
google-chrome	firefox
while it worked well for firefox and google-chrome

22965994
concave	convex
this might be easier and faster if you first split each polygon into a set of convex polygons the convex polygons can simply inherit the color of the original concave polygon

22966143
textview	imageview
so i created a linearlayout with a imageview and a textview and made it act like a button

22966183

i want to introduce a button which will check all the checkbox

22966302
hid	keyboard
in my older version of the code i hid the keyboard when switching tabs the following way

22966366
folder	directory
one way to do this is to change directory and run make for each folder but it s not very elegant and can be error prone if additional folder and files are added

22966375
width	height
simple check the width and height of the movieclip

22966375
width	height
meaning if you set the width and height to zero the corresponding scalex and scaley will also be set to zero

22966386
nstableview	nswindowcontroller
then in the enclosing nswindowcontroller when i add the predicate editor view i also add a constraint on the proportions of the nstableview with respect to the predicate view

22966460
min	max
simply group by jpnum and take what description you like best with min max or group_concat

22966484
width	height
creating initial high res images width and height as a multiple of 16 is wise since they will scale down properly as illustrate in this table

22966499
setinterval	clearinterval
the setinterval method will continue calling the function until clearinterval is called or the window is closed

22966499
setinterval	settimeout
use settimeout instead of setinterval and reload widget with new settimeout call every time

22966505
getter	setter
if your class mydate has getter and setter for day month and year then your constructor can also do as following

22966539
hide	show
on a side note if you re going to show hide stuff i d advise using .show and hide which are less expensive on the browser as it doesn t alter the dom nodes

22966540
pivot-table	crosstab
it would also be helpful to have some kind of query that easily shows who is assigned to what projects preferably in a crosstab format similar to a pivot-table

22966549
hash	salt
never ever store a password in your db instead store the hash and unique salt i will explain why later

22966549
hash	salt
passwords should always be salt before hash

22966549
hash	salt
when you create a salt make sure it is unique to the password it is salting then store both the completed hash and salt in your db

22966549
hash	salt
what this will do is make it so that an attacker will have to individually crack each salt and hash before they can gain access

22966549
hash	salt
here is a php class that creates a hash and salt for a password easily

22966637
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox are dramatically faster using this method which will destroy attached jquery data

22966637
google-chrome	firefox
in a distant second for firefox and google-chrome and fastest in ie

22966670
gif	png
the cool thing is that you can also define which type of image you want it to be returned jpg png gif

22966750
width	height
just create a high res version of your image with width and height as multiple of 16

22966783
rss	feed
perhaps you can use the search data to get the original rss feed and then access the podcast directly from the source rather than from itunes

22966785
button	checkbox
what i want to disable the confirm button untill the checkbox above is ticked how can i do this and then if it is ticked and unticked then it goes back to being disabled

22966856

i have come across countless examples of express mongoose applications with a one-to-many mapping of models but it d really help me to read example with many-to-many mapping

22966931
width	height
the body of the document is scrollable and has height width 100 so i dont understand why it is not working

22966932
copying	overwrite
also since the length of frame is passed as an argument you might want to be checking the total length you are copying to frame to make sure there s no illegal overwrite in that case

22966934
post	get
you can get the same route with the get and post methods

22966976
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
this applet works fine on many browsers and operating sytems ie google-chrome firefox safari windows xp macos etc.

22967017

google-chrome	firefox
this is not a problem for google-chrome or firefox

22967121
superclass	subclassing
i ve not found anything that would copy the members of a superclass to a subclassing

22967143
integer	unsigned
assuming that the integer is always in the last four bytes of the message and is always ordered in a big-endian fashion you can convert it back to an int regardless of your platform s endianess using something like this you may need to adjust the signed unsigned characteristic depending on if what is sent it signed or unsigned

22967159
google-chrome	firefox
this happens only in google-chrome not in firefox

22967177
integer	unsigned
if you want a number larger than the largest 64-bit unsigned integer 18 446 744 073 709 551 615 then you will need to store it as a string or other textual field and hope that you don t need to do much mathematical manipulation on it

22967208
post	get
if you can t get it working with that post the code you are using

22967262
x86	mips
ps the renderscript library won t run on armv6 armeabi so make sure that build.cpu_abi is either armeabi-v7a mips or x86

22967284
google-chrome	firefox
now i noticed there quite a big performance difference between google-chrome and firefox

22967284
google-chrome	firefox
the animation in google-chrome is smooth at least smooth enough but the animation in firefox is choppy every second or so this happens when the framerate is very high or low

22967286
inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties
if you have a subclassing amx_observationdto that inherited from amx_observation you could copy the properties like this

22967334
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
the accept attribute is supported in internet explorer 10 firefox opera google-chrome and safari 6

22969716
google-chrome	firefox
from the inspect element feature of firefox and google-chrome i figure that in both cases the span element obeys the standard of using vertical-align baseline the default

22969716
google-chrome	firefox
so google-chrome must be using a different definition of baseline for the span element than firefox when vertical-align top is used for the parent element otherwise i do not know how to explain the difference in the output between google-chrome and firefox

22969720
width	height
but i would interpret handles.h as a height handles.wid as a width and handles.r as the starting y coordinate of the corner of the box and handles.col as the starting x coordinate of the box

22969729
width	height
the first createbitmap is run with width height on a bitmap that got rotated instead of height width

22969961
super	self
where self is the instance reference so super type myinstance myinstance .method1 would achieve the same thing from outside the method

22969990
min	max
then select out of the table which was the min key and max key and with that information you can select all rows that have the same key or left value in sorted order and print those informations to an outfile if the database is not a good output for you

22969998
mouseup	mousedown
actually it doesn t work because the first fires is an event at the button.click and when it works it conflicts with the events like mouseleftbuttondown mouseup mousedown and for routed events e.handled property is false by default

22970289
libpcap	wireshark	winpcap	wireshark	winpcap	libpcap
there are a very small number of protocols whose names can directly be used in filters in tcpdump and capture filters in wireshark - they use the same libpcap winpcap library for capturing and thus for capture filters and radius isn t one of them

22970289
udp	tcp
tcpdump filters can t easily check anything above the transport layer headers so you have to identify protocols running atop tcp or udp by the port number

then dynamically i can show hide the top toolbar

22970311
google-chrome	safari
for safari and google-chrome add -webkit-column-gap 40px

22970567
fgets	strtod
reading a line of numbers spaced with white-space except n and then finally terminated with n is possible with scanf and ungetc but not worthy of coding except as an exercise as using fgets and sscanf strtod is far better

22970574
google-chrome	firefox
this is working in google-chrome and firefox

22970595
uiview	subviews
my solution would be to create a uiimage uiview that contains the shadow and add that as a subviews not very good with shadows but an easy way of getting it kindof done is this

22970647
google-chrome	safari
wow64 applewebkit 537.36 khtml like gecko google-chrome 33.0.1750.154 safari 537.36

then in your second for-loop where you split the arrays into the left and right side your condition for loops says that but since you re starting at you don t make the arrays large enough

22970871
hide	show
a more appropriate way to solve this issue is to use and overlay image div and bind a click touchstart event on it to show the video tag and hide the overlay

22970871
hide	show
when the ended event has fired just hide the video tag and show the overlay image

22970897
width	height
be sure that your svg has a width and height specified

22970897

22971393

some like strdup get_current_dir_name and getcwd under some circumstances expect the caller to free

22972096
implements	modifiers
my idea then is that i dont have a heap type as such only the nodes and then a modifiers type of some sort that will implements all the tree operations

after reading css 2.1 specification w3c recommendation 07 june 2011 it seems to me that both google-chrome and firefox are correct and they are free to choose different baselines

22973252
google-chrome	firefox
as a result google-chrome and firefox are free to choose different baselines and align the baseline of the second inline level-box span baz with these differently chosen baselines thereby producing different outputs

22973265
google-chrome	firefox
to be honest i used this approach once when i had to port a firefox extension to google-chrome

however if we print this value as a chars using c as the format specifier what gets printed is the chars whose int code is 49

width	height	minimum	max	min	max
assuming width and height are both positive numbers the only way to get a negative output value from the scale is if you input a number that is less than the minimum domain value for the x scale or more than the maximum domain value on the y scale -- which implies that the max min functions aren t doing what you expect

22991334
min	max
the solution as boxuan discovered see the comments is simply to make sure that all your numbers are stored as such before passing them to the max and min functions

you need to convert the string value from the uitextfield to a number int double or nsnumber

22993361

22993902
width	height	portrait	landscape
i check to see if the window s width is greater than its height in order to determine if the user is holding the device in landscape or portrait mode and i translate the data that the accelerometer provides based on that fact

22993902
width	height
the problem is that when i move to an android device whose orientation is landscape by default the device s hardware is arranged in such a way that it is clear it is intended to be used mainly in landscape orientation the x and y coordinates are reversed and the fact that the window s height is greater than its width can t be used to determine whether the user is holding the device with it s top up and its bottom down

22993934
gridview	sqldatasource
i m using a detailview to insert data into a gridview via an sqldatasource

22993964

22993964
portrait	landscape
it also seems that this bug is triggered in both portrait and landscape modes

beanstalk	amazon-web-services
if you are referring to the amazon-web-services elastic beanstalk actions | swap environment urls feature my experience is that this feature has nothing to do with dns and nothing to do with route 53

22994120
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
from what i can see amazon-web-services eb swap url s simply swaps the public-facing url s of your beanstalk environments.

post	get
you can do this simply with a web server acting as a webservice which will get for instance the requests from the clients with a http post request and process act consequently

22994620
client-side	server-side
you must have code in the client-side that will receive the response from this server-side code that is - you must return it and then you could use console.log and other options - in the client-side - to print the values to the console in your browser or logcat or other tools.

22994760
put	get
in particular the locks are only held by producers for unbounded queues during the brief interval that items are being added to or removed from the queue it s highly improbable for this to take more than a tiny fraction of a second for each put get

google-chrome	firefox
note the following appears to be true only for google-chrome but it doesn t work in firefox or ie.

22995186
width	height
after much twiddling around my conclusion is that there s a fundamental difference in the way that height and width are treated in general and that it affects calculations here

22995186
width	height
it s bound to be related to the flow of things like how reducing the width of a will have the content flow down expanding the height but how reducing the height of a won t make it wider

22995195
pop-up	dialog
that will pop-up the view detail dialog

22995225
ilist	icollection
they may implement icollection ilist etc but you can play around with that

spaces	delimiter
removing or adding x or y changes how the parser interprets the line and as there is a spaces an internal delimiter added if is able to find and handle the replaceable parameter

22995790
width	height
so as an example if the height 300px the width 200px

22995790
width	height
the width needs to be percentage based 100 of div and the height calculated as a percentage of the generated width

22995790

nullpointerexception	runtimeexception
however sometimes it is possible to have exceptions that occur based on the unique runtime state of an application where you could not declare that a certain checked exception could be thrown and that is where runtimeexception shine like nullpointerexception

22996554
int	double
i think such concerns would go away if you cast the address of the double variable to a 64bit int pointer and use shifts masks exclusively

also it looks like you re trying to implement a look up in your class which means perhaps qmap or qhash would be a more appropriate container

22998824

if you can spare the disk io and ram i don t know how huge you mean when you say huge it would probably be vastly easier to simply load the entire file into an array or list of string find the line representing the person seek a few lines below that for the field you want you said culture change that field in the array or list and then just resave the entire array or list back to a text file

22998824

note that spring again uses reflection to invoke these getter setter

22999625
put	get
i ve put changes in angular brackets and i m not sure which property within an adwordcampaign marks the id of the adword for the relationship from a glance at your model but i m sure you get the idea - go direct to capaigns table via the context using the adword as an addiitonal where clause rather than via the adword s campaigns collection

jar	war
currently the project i am working on has all of the code for the web service in a single and is creating a war and a jar file

23022728

the idea is that when changing from a jar to a war replaces the need for a main method but requires you to configure a different signal for the servlet container on how to launch the application

23022737
min	max
this tells d3 to get for every element in testdata and return the min and max values in an array

23022748

public	protected
basically to summarize it i was doing the replace of the principal in the event public void windowsauthentication_onauthenticate object sender windowsauthenticateeventargs args and i was supposed to do it in protected void application_authorizerequest object sender eventargs e which is not the same as in forms authentication application_authenticaterequest

you can implement this using ant groovy or if you do want to benefit from gradle s dependency resolution caching features by pretending it s an ivy repository with a custom artifact url

23023540
qtablewidget	qgraphicsscene
if you can use qtablewidget instead then you can create a qgraphicsscene and add it to that

23023549

what i realized is that when the soft keyboard comes up it uses the device height as the viewport height and pushes the rest of the site upwards - which makes me assume that it s getting it s height from the width device-width option

23023551
portrait	landscape
for example the iphone should only support portrait operation while the ipad should support both portrait and landscape operation

jquery s .show and hide methods appear to inspect the display value of the element and tries to restore it but does so as an inline style that can adversely affect less-specific styles for example a responsive stylesheet that alters the layout of elements which you d also want to show or hide with jquery

23023949
int	chars
the types i have come across so far are int float str str with ascii chars datetime.datetime

23023984
salt	md5
you could always combine an md5 and sha1 values with a randomized salt and also include your original salt value

23023990
cpu	affinity
threads have an affinity to the cpu of their creation because of the high overhead involved with cache coherency if the thread were to start on a different cpu

23023992
salt	md5
if we look at what the first code intended to do and i guess the md5 step was meant to concatenate the two strings then that is better because it uses the string in the md5 step as salt

23023993
webkit	blink
first thing to mention is that the problem only happens in webkit blink browsers

23024010
fgets	getchar
you probably also want to use fgets instead of getchar which will let you prevent overruns of your input buffer

23024019
cube	skybox
i am trying to create a skybox for a simple opengl application that i m working on the cube i am drawing for the skybox does exist in the 3d space but it isn t drawn around the camera and moves one unit to the direction the camera is moving while i move the camera and stops doing this when i stop moving the camera

23024054
dlsym	dlopen
you can also use the dlopen and dlsym functions to map your libcmn functions to function pointers at runtime

23024055
hide	show
the problem is that show and hide are fairly assertive statements

23024055
hide	show
as a personal preference i tend to use show and hide pretty sparingly since the side effects of removing an element can cause undesired layout issues as you ve identified

23024075
chown	chmod
my fix was to do a chown and a chmod on the entire structure then run grunt without sudo.

23024097
button	checkbox

kivy	buildozer
see so answer to buildozer compiles simple android kivy application but fails while packaging

23024258
verilog	vhdl
the process of translating that to vhdl will teach you some things but you also won t learn to properly leverage vhdl features that verilog lacks

23024293
width	text-align
since both the paragraph and the table has relative width set 60 and 70 it won t fill the whole div so setting text-align center wont help

i dont know how to work with mouse or keyboard outside the frame

23024524
setinterval	settimeout

23024525
mouse	keyboard
the task involves heavy use of both mouse and keyboard inputs

23024564
hide	show
i have the code working for it to show the popover and then hide it if the user clicks off the popover

23024565
int	double
since they are not specifying if the very large number has a primitive type or not you can assume that the number acts as int double long etc.

23024636
rtsp	rtmp
since you don t want to use wowza and by your intonation seemingly don t want to use any server that you didn t write you probably should read up on rtmp and rtsp as you write your own

23024660

i don t usually like to post such open questions on here but i m not super experienced in programming and am having trouble wrapping my head around a good way to get this done

23024902
division	multiplication
the calculations in your particular use case don t take much time just simple multiplication and division after all but could definitely increase page load times if this were a webapp

23024914
awt	swing
okay so basically i ve been trying to make an interactive map using swing awt etc

23024924
int	double

any excess width and height will be scrolled if the table contents are longer than the size

width	height
even better get rid of the width and height variables since you can get them directly from gameboard if you need them and they re guaranteed to represent the actual values

23028380
width	height
when you initialise width and height gameboard will be null

23028380
width	height
if you were to initialise the gameboard when it is declared then when width and height are read they will be 0 as gameboard will not have been added to the parent container nor will it have been laid out

if you need to know the width or height of the gameboard you should just ask it when you need to know

versioning	upgrade
if you want to make an upgrade proof system i guess it s better to stick with the webservices which didn t change since versioning 2.x or go with cmis

23029723
put	get
so you have to put .pdb file along with .dll file to get more debugging information

23029781

23029917
width	height
you are setting the max height width of your images to 100 which means that the biggest an image can possibly be is the full viewport area

23029917
width	height
adding a percentage width and height to auto means that your images will scale to fit a row of four on a line

23029941

23030561
spaces	delimiter
3 copy from the start of the line up to but not including the first delimiter to the hold spaces

23030561
spaces	delimiter
8 if it s a known token append the token s expansion to the hold spaces and remove the delimiter from the line

23030561
spaces	delimiter
if the token is unknown append the delimiter removed at #4 and the token text to the hold spaces but leave the non-token s trailing delimiter at the start of the line -- this is to allow name domain and multiple runs with different variable definition files . expstuff -v user.vars template.in | . expstuff -v global.vars outputfile but will need changing for your requirement

23030562
width	height
that s because you ve set it s height to 100 explicitly so it s width is auto and it ll always have a sufficient width to keep the aspect ratio but since you also have set max-width 2.5 it can t grow beyond that either which is the size you are looking at.

23030563
post	put
alternatively you could put your text area in a razor form and just submit the page on submit which would post it to a regular mvc action like you would regularly

23030582

maybe use udp tcp but why the processes are on the same machine

23030582

hide	show
you can see the pretty much good progress animation from here and add the show progress code and hide progress code on the relevant method

23030632
width	height

i have used double in this example but i m equally interested in int

23032503
prng	random
if you re just generating a few keys and similar small amounts of material or if you need to generate a lot of random numbers but the speed of dev urandom isn t a bottleneck or if this is a school exercise and implementing a prng is not the point of the exercise then just reading from dev urandom is fine

i have an activity whose layout i need to change after a rotation and part of the layout is a graph that is drawn using the width and height of the view that it will be placed into

23032605
width	height
the first time my code runs the graph is drawn correctly however after the rotation the width and height of the container view are not correct in fact they appear to be the view as if it was not rotated

23032605
width	height	portrait	landscape
my understanding was that the listener would only have been triggered once graph_container was completed and landscape or portrait and so when calling layoutgraph the width and height of maingraph_layout a child a graph_container widths and height set to match_parent would be good to go

23032605
width	height
it appears that the width and height i am getting are as if the phone is still portrait and worth noting it appears that the removal of the action bar has also been taken into account

int	chars
you are trying to compare it to a chars literal 0 which has no interpretation as an enumeration literal in the context of int

23033433
int	chars
there is no operator defined to compare an int to a type represented by a chars literal in the code context which you haven t display in your example not having any context clauses visible nor other declarations

what you are trying to do is not performing a post request but performing a get request

23034456
post	get
if you used the post parameters instead of the get ones you could use your current code as-is which sets the post body of the request which is probably the right thing to do -- so you don t have to change your client code you only have to change the server code.
