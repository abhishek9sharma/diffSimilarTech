i found a half-fix that makes this problem a bit more palatable you can set the simulated metrics of the navigation controller to be master which is 320 points wide portrait or landscape height or form sheet which is 540 x 620

20176029
int	boolean
but if user has override the getcolumnclass int c function in abstracttablemodel see here tabledemo.java then the second answer will cause the lose of default renderer the default render will print boolean type as a checkbox after using the second answer the table will print true false instead

i have a background image with height 1400 and width 1000 if i use any full screen background jquery plugin or code it crops from top or bottom and make it fit the whole screen but what i want is a plugin or code which will make sure the background image is responsive based on width of browser yet the full height of background image should be visible with scroll bar

20176318
decoder	encoder
but you can write a encoder decoder for encoding for silverlight i think will be very easy

20176326

20176539
mathml	mathjax
i then decided to use mathjax with mathml to render my equations instead so this became

20176570
width	height
-- your first fgets reads then discards the magic number line followed by reading the width and height and then discarding the maxval line

20176570
ppm	tga
the above routine works mostly for ppm images but it will fail on tga because its header is organized differently

20176570
fgetc	fread
then you can use fgetc or fread to read one or more bytes

20176570
width	height
fread reads multiple bytes in the order in which they are stored into the file and so you would think it may read an item such as width and height -- each a 2-byte integer value -- in one read operation

20176570
int	chars
eof cannot be stored into a chars because it is an int value 0xffffffff more accurately int -1

20176587
put	get
to put it all together you get each byte of lng starting from the most significant byte in each iteration

int	chars
chars are just int

20176827
int	chars
in ascii the chars 0 is the int 48

20176849
range	infinity
if you want to continue to use range but allow for one value to be anything greater than some number you can use float infinity to accomplish this

20176849
range	infinity
of course this probably means you ll need to conditionally set the 2nd value to float infinity when building up the array of range

20176925
puts	gets
the script gets executed but the the markup any element before a doctype string puts some browses to quirks mode which means a large number of poorly documented quirks and oddities and mess too

20176930
apk	dex
section 4d.0 is not possible by the nature of android apks the apk is compiled to dex and signed as a whole containing referenced libraries and hence swapping out libraries cannot be done without the original source code the keystore and keystore password

multiplying	add
single precision floating point add multiplying operations probably yes

20177007
move	drag
basicly this map is so big so you need to be able to pan it like click and drag inside the box to move the map

20177007
move	drag
whenever i try to click and drag on a picture on any website my cursor changes to a no sign it means that i can t drop it there and if i d move it into lets say photoshop it ll change to this drop pic here cursor

20177011
rss	feed
after disabling the maintenance mode my site s rss feed is still in maintenance mode

20177092
try-catch	exception-handling
therefore any code that throws checked exception-handling must wrap them in try-catch or throwables.propagate

20177101
super	self
remember that self is just an alias for this and not super

20177101
super	self
additionally since a is a self type it s not a super type of b so you can t call super.print

20177162
client-side	server-side
the simple reason being javascript is client-side and php is server-side

20177165
min	max
two row_numbers with different order by will result in two step for calculation when you rewrite it with max min it s only a single step

20177176
width	height

20177194
istream	getline
i would rather us unformatted input operations one of the std istream get members or std getline

20177204
javassist	cglib
if u is not interface javassist cglib or something similar would help but only if invoked method is not static or final

20177222

20177595
jobs	cron
i have set up cron jobs before using exec so i should have permission to change the date as well

20177601
integer	unsigned
in fact it s slightly too large to fit in a uint64_t since it is exactly 2 64 and the largest number that can fit in a k -bit unsigned integer is 2 k -1. so you end up with signed integer overflow

20177651
post	get
apart from the option you have to set the access-control-allow-origin header also for other methods post get etc

if you want to put the effort into this you can create custom mouse event handlers on the chart s svg vml code

20177804
svg	vml
be aware that any solution involving the chart s svg vml code could break at any time as the internal structure of the charts is not guaranteed to be stable from version to version

20177818
getchar	getline
in the code when the program is run and the getline function is called it does 1000 iterations and the getchar is called each time to get input from the terminal in order to increment the counter if it s not end of file or newline

20177952
post	get
when i get that answer i will try to post it here..

20177964
integer	unsigned
i set it to u because gcc told me it was an unsigned integer

20177978
submit	submission
if you want to prevent the form from submission when clicking the submit button you have to return false in the event handler

20177978
submit	submission
the event handler can also be told to prevent form submission by calling e.preventdefault on the event object that is being passed to the submit handler

20178033
post	get
also you might want to consider this post which covers a good strategy to get the user location when there is one available or request a new one otherwise

20179270
128bit	64bit
i hope you can see from these examples why it s similarly not possible to natively run a theoretical 128bit os on top of 64bit processor architecture - the underlying system wouldn t be able to understand the instructions

20179270
128bit	64bit
if you have a 64bit processor you can write use a 64bit os that basically emulates or pretends to be 128bit hardware for another os to run on

20179300
hide	show
or at its most basic level something like this could be used to check whether any of the text fields should shouldn t be show and either hide them or adjusts their frame accordingly

20179356
cos	sin
nb if you are doing many many of these in performance-critical code you can gain a bit of speed by noting and computing the matrix yourself with these known values of sin theta and cos theta

20179356
cos	sin
the glm routine will take your angle arcsin |c| and proceed immediately to compute its sin and cos a small waste since you already knew these and the operations are relatively expensive

20179365
feedback	review
mind you this is long and has no comments review it test it and give me feedback if you find an error

i ll post the code from there but there are about 4 of these errors across 4 different .as files but it d be too much code to put in here so i ll just add from one other file i think would be important

20179816
width	height
the only workaround i m aware of is just as you said to change the xtype to dialog set height and width properties on the dialog node and then add a tabpanel node as a child node of your dialog

20179842
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
and all i want is to separate titlebar width height margin background etc

20179842
titlebar	window
no missunderstandings titlebar is not control in my window it does not exist as a whole thing its just content part of the window and all i want is to create namespace separated dps from which titlebar components will bind from for example

20179928
width	height
for a generic solution you have to change this test to something that checks whether the 1x1 square transformed by the overlaps the character box transformed by the with fixed width and height and

20179954
width	height
no floating left and right have 300px width center fills the rest all have the same height

20180165
children	parent
in doing so the parent no longer has defined dimensions as the children aren t technically occupying space

20180165
children	parent
in this instance we can fix it by adding overflow hidden to the parent element thus forcing it to contain the children elements

20181296
getter	setter
you can allow read-only access to external classes by providing a getter but not a setter

20181342

monocross	mvvmcross
i don t know of anyone who s done this recently but i originally ported several of the monocross samples over when i first created mvvmcross

20182410
monocross	mvvmcross
monocross isn t really very interface ioc based - so you may find that your resulting mvvmcross migration would also not be interface based either

20182410
monocross	mvvmcross
monocross apps tend to use file-linking and #define s rather than pcls - so you may find it easier to not use pcls in mvvmcross

20182532
width	height
i know i could simply set the height of the images and do a manual setting for the height of the iframe but i want the images height to change with their width

20182580
for-loop	arrays
now i want to read each line from my table one by one and store the result into a arrays and i am trying to use a for-loop to be more professional rather then using repetition

20182588

not easy to provide a short answer on this as there are hundreds of lines of code involved you will need to intercept start of dragging action usually on onlongclick hide the view that initiated the action show an overlay that can be moved around while the user is still in touch down action and finally do the changes on touch up

20182647
google-chrome	firefox
forms has different behavior for this widget in google-chrome vs firefox i much prefer the google-chrome behavior

20182872
apache	nginx
the steps for enabling cors depends on your specific web server apache node nginx iis etc. dr

20182887

i ve read there are two keys in the info.plist file of the project where height and width are customisable

20182921
postorder	inorder
an inorder traversal won t expose that but a pre-order or postorder traversal will

20182946
inherited	subclassing
since static members are not properly inherited this is the closest you can get to maintaining a list of values without doing it in the subclassing

20182946
superclass	subclassing
the other problem is that you can call values on the superclass before the instances of the subclassing are instantiated

20183033

it s probably best to keep the key as an unsigned integer as you use integer operations on it

20183145
children	parent
typical structure with each node having parent members and children vectors

20183145
children	parent
parent is a raw pointer-to-class and children are vector s of shared_ptr s

20183145
children	parent

children	parent
with mongodb and mongoose how can i mark objects as dependent on their relations so that if the parent object is deleted all of the children objects dependent on it will be deleted as well

20183407

i ve finally been able to complete the script for an multiple image resizer currently it s resizing the original image into 3 other sizes but i am unable to figure out how to set the original height and width

20183539
width	height
i have done the following to set each of the images height and width i d like them to resize into

20183539

since they are declared and initialized at class scope they are initialized before oncreate and thus setcontentview is called

20183824
implements	extends
you won t be extends the bladecompiler class in a traditional sense but you can implements your own set of compile functions to run

20183841
repo	egit
when you shared your root project egit moved all of your project s files out of the eclipse workspace into the local git repo and then updated eclipse s metadata for the root project to reflect the new location of the files good but since it is clueless about nested projects that means it treated all the files in your child modules as though they were part of your root project and hence moved them into the git repo that s ok but didn t update the eclipse project metadata for those child modules that s bad

20183841
repo	egit
but if you ignore eclipse and look directly in the working directory of the git repo they re all sitting there happily egit copied the directory structure and all the files including the child modules and from git s perspective they are all currently untracked

20183841
m2e	pom.xml

20183877
rspec	capybara
i m using rspec capybara and launchy to test my web application

20183877

20184270
realloc	calloc
you ve done this with the initial calloc call because you have to provide a size for that but not in the subsequent realloc ones

20184270
memset	calloc
fourth using calloc and memset here is almost certainly a waste since your code knows where the stack end is based on size

20184280
google-chrome	firefox
this initiative started with firefox and google-chrome followed him probably the solution for this case is creating an google-chrome extension and that only works for google-chrome but it seems a madness

20184298

after much research turns out what i really wanted to do was use netty or vert.x

20205020
width	height
in the jsfiddle or code below the background of the container should be green and the background of the image should be gray with the gray portion being a square that circumscribes all four corners of the blue polygon because the blue polygon is the same height and width as the square viewbox

20205020
width	height
in other words if the container s height width i want to see green above and below the gray blue svg image and if the container s width height i want to see green on each side of the gray blue svg image

20205020
width	height
when i referenced the svg via an tag ie wouldn t preserve the aspect ratio of the image unless i used width and height attributes of 100 in the element but in that case chrome would only show the green background if the container s height width not if the container s width height

you may be able to speed things up by starting the server independently at the beginning and by switching off screens updates in word but i think you ll need to run some performance tests

if you try to override comparator in bravo you must provide a parameter of type alpha because alpha is the type that satisfies t in the class declaration where implements comparable is included

20205858
width	height
i have set the image to position fixed and width to 200 and height

20205893
implements	extends
to the best of my knowledge the best way to do this is by implements a baseactivity with this view and have all your activities extends this activity instead of the standard activity

20205931
post	get
so what you can do is make a post request or even a get request with data encoded in the url but this is not safe sending your php datas treat this data in the control_data method and then sending back some json

you put the eggs on to boil and set an alarm for when they re cooked to get them out peel them cut them up and add them to your sandwich

20206057
int	boolean
i could do boolean i guess but i was also planning to convert every multidimensional array into a single dimension since i have heard java treats 2d arrays as arrays of arrays unlike c++ then mod out each value which would work with int

20206057
int	boolean
if the above is possible would it be more efficient to have a multidimensional array storing boolean or more efficient to have a single array length n 2 or n 3 with int

20206115
hash	salt
because the public salt is individually generated for each hash password one cannot simply generate a rainbow table and brute-force all your hash passwords at once

20206115
hash	salt
for each hash password the attacker would have to generate an own unique rainbow table because of the unique public salt

20206115
hash	salt
to make your stored hash passwords even more secure you can furthermore add a private salt that should be stored anywhere else - as long as not in the database

20206115
hash	salt
by using a private salt you could protect the hash passwords against a brute-force rainbow-table attack because the attacker does not know the private salt and cannot gain the private salt from the database entries

20206116
.htaccess	httpd.conf
if talking about common apache servers the webserver has a file called .htaccess or another one httpd.conf capable of using apache s built-in mod_rewrite module for url rewriting

put	get
but i m worried that search engines might see this as being too similar to the system where crazy people put the same keyword many times in invisible elements in an attempt to get higher rankings

20206235
int	boolean
you can use bit shifting operators or to store multiple boolean flags in an int

20206235
int	boolean	bitwise-or	bitwise-and
you can also use bitwise-and not or bitwise-or | not || to parse or store boolean flags in an int

20206243
implements	extends
he does implements the idendity monad but the code looks as if he wants to extends it to other monads by overwriting the bind method which might not work easily for all monads

or you can declare public setter and getter properties as below

public	protected
normally this is unintentional and the normal approach to deal with overloaded virtual functions is to make the virtual functions protected delegating to them from a public forwarding and probably inline function

20206749
pull	push
one reasonable way to achieve this would have been to use pull and push like this

20206749
pull	push
but this would end up with field name duplication not allowed with modifiers error message which is basically tells you that you can not use pull and push at the same time

20206752
stdout	stderr
when i open it with cat file i want the output of it to show in stderr not stdout

20206889
onclick	onmousedown	onclick	onmouseup	onmousedown	onmouseup
if i add an alert to the onclick event onmousedown event or onmouseup event they do fire

20206889
google-chrome	firefox
i could not find this option in the google-chrome or firefox inspector

20206904
superclass	subclassing
if your subclassing vary only in the parameters passed to the superclass you might be looking for the builder pattern

20206904
superclass	subclassing
a builder for the superclass lets you pass in whatever parameters you need without cluttering your constructor and if you want subclassing for readability you can just wrap a call to the builder and return its result from the subclassing constructors

ok if i understood it well then you want your svg tag of exact height and width in which its child resides

20212129
width	height
then you need to use getbbox to get its height and width

20212129
width	height
now we need to determine exact width and height for our svg

20212151
implements	extends
this means that if you want to have your logic as part of a class which needs for some reason to extends a different class then you can still implements runnable and use the second way

when i put that code into onitemclicklistener it works but when i put it into onitemlongclicklistener it does not work because list.getcheckeditempositions return an empty array

20212361
post	get
if you just want to refresh the page to see the contents of an updated table or list or to get the latest status after the post then you could provide a button or link on the page that the user can click that preforms a ajax get for the information that you requires and then just update the part of the screen that you need to redisplay

20212382
post	get
other users get s sign out when doing post back actions

20212399
implements	extends
implements runnable is always preferable over extends a thread

20212399
implements	extends

20213086
ssl	https
ssl termination - the web server will be optimized to handle https requests with only a little configuration

20213086
apache	nginx
nginx apache are much more efficient at handling static files like images css javascript files and will only pass dynamic requests those where the content is often read from a database or the content changes to be handled by the python code

20213091
apache	nginx
you don t need to change port number for your application just configure your www server nginx or apache to proxy queries to flask port

20213100
lodash	underscore.js
but the easiest way to do what you want is to adopt some helpful library like underscore.js or lodash

20213117

you said that you only want to delete the cache but you are getting the cache directory backing up to the app s directory deleting all of the folder in that directory and then deleting that directory

20213155

you can find an explanation of differences between strcpy and strdup here

20213155

while reencoding flv file speex to mp3 if you get sample rate error try this

20213358
int	double
although you will receive a warning about possible loss of data when converting from double to int

20213363
int	double
since you have a ctor that takes an int it does an implicit conversion from double to int then uses your ctor to convert from int to employee

20213363
int	double
right now you ve defined the employee s salary member as a double but only allowed the user to specify an int to initialize it

20213416
width	height
i ve also tried playing with the width and height as you would do on chrome for instance but this is causing the box to visually stretch

20213441
hash	salt
for me i prepend the salt to the users provided password then i hash it

20213441
hash	salt
i then check to see if the password provided by the user along with the salt and hash matches the password in the database return true or false

20213521
int	chars
however you cannot force that binary value into the unicode string directly because any unicode chars is actually an abstract int and the int can be represented in many ways as a sequence of bytes

20213555
children	parent
.find is designed to work from parent s on down to their children but the .children method will return a list of separate elements broken away from their parent relationship

20213620
width	height
as i can see the body width and height is every time the same in js code

20213712
stdout	stderr
i initially thought this was as simple as closing reopening the stdin stdout stderr streams and indeed this worked absolutely beautifully on a number of servers - i was getting user response out in milliseconds even when there was a couple of seconds of disc writes queued up

20213742
button	checkbox
as it stands you can create a subroutine which will execute nonquery to mysql then call that sub twice on any trigger button checkbox etc.

20213760
button	checkbox
whenever delete button is clicked without selecting any checkbox it gives validation -thats proper

20213760

20213920
mouseover	mouseout
i need to bind mouseover mouseout and click events for the all the elements but except a certain div and it s child elements

20213997
sorting	filtering
introducing local filtering sorting as a layer on top of this is thus not appropriate due to the fact it would be applied to only the current chunk so when the next chunk of records was fetched they would not subscribe to the filtering sort indicated by the gui that the user expects

20213997
sorting	filtering
use a paginated grid - with local filtering sorting on each page still produces less than ideal ux but at least in some way it is semi-logical

20213997
sorting	filtering
use no pagination buffering and simply load all your records and then do local filtering sorting this isnt really a scalable solution and is more trying to escape doing work to put in solid foundations for your app

20213997
sorting	filtering
use a buffered grid store and implement server-side filtering sorting given your requirement this is clearly the recommendation- and shouldnt be too hard to implement

20213997
sorting	filtering
so the short answer is no- the recommendation being to use a buffered grid store with remote filtering sorting

20214082
versioning	upgrade
if you doesn t have this versioning or can t upgrade you ll need to do it the old way with some css

20214142
for-loop	loops
the first problem is hard to explain in a single answer but i will try to give you some insights since the function that is printing the value of the variables to the console is defined inside the for-loop that function will always keep the value of i that was there when loops ended and in your situation this is 1000

20214148
maven	pom.xml
i m usning maven 3.0 when i ran the dal test class getting follow exception.if i removed some of entity dependency from pom.xml it s working fine.how to solve this

20214556
post	get
i m trying to send a json array to an api via http post get a response and print it

20214557
getter	setter
in c++ it is a good idea to make attributes private and provide getter and setter methods because c++ provides const correctness - and setter cannot be called on a const object

20214557
getter	setter
once you realise that a setter can be denied use at compile time in a const correct language and that a getter setter or get set depending on language can do more than simply assign or return they can be very powerful

20214584
cdr	cons
a minimal set of runtime library functions provided by java should contain car cdr cons listp nullp symbol to string and string to symbol conversions string concatenation and an access to the java reflection for implementing everything else from the lisp side

20214616
for-loop	arrays
plus you should check the js arrays objects + using some for-loop

versioning	upgrade
best option would be to upgrade your php versioning or change webhosting

20214782
width	margin
simply set the width of the child elements to be 100 of the viewport width by using vw percentage viewport units and then set their left margin to a negative calculated value based on this minus the width of the wrapper

20214782
children	parent
you can dynamically change the width of the parent container and the children will automatically resize and align as needed without being positioned

20214871
folder	directory
i cannot understand where this zip directory folder will be contained in latest version agile toolkit 4.2.4

20214875
trie	tree
this will be a trie or a self balancing tree

20214875
trie	tree
getting the top 10 can be done on the 2nd data structure in o logn and inserting each element requires looking by string - you can use a trie to get o |s| here - and than modifying the second tree - which is o logn

20214894
pull	push
if the commit you want to fix is very recent and the chance is low that anyone else has done much based on it do the interactive rebase git push --force to the server and tell the other contributors to git pull --force if they can do without their local changes

20214906
listview	gridview
the best way to go is to extend the standard gridview control as you will be able to integrate it with other standard code such as that used for adapters or data structures also common to listview etc

20214906
move	drag
you would need to identify the item you need to drag perhaps on a long click then hide the source view and draw an overlay bitmap copy that would move on the screen as the user keeps the finger down

20214906
move	drag
on touch up you see where your drag source has been dropped and either you move it there either you delete the either if dropped over a delete zone like in the android homescreen gridview

20214949
for-loop	loops
i am passing a big object in a for-loop to a function and in that function accessing attributes of the object in another loops since this seemed the best way

screens	tablet
i am calculating the screens size of device programmatically for tablet nexus7 its giving 6.7 .but nexus7 have screens size 7

20215451
cos	sin
the problem is naturally rotation because you typically start with an angle and use trigonometric functions sin and cos to compute the rotation matrix

20215451
cos	sin
you need to compute an approximation of alpha such that sin alpha and cos alpha are rational numbers and thus can be represented by numbers of the aforementioned exact type

either you need to also group by id or wrap id in an aggregate function like min or max

20224565
post	put
for whatever reason i can post data using http and that works fine but if i use put no data is received by laravel

20224582

you ll need to use the traditional for-loop syntax or else put the boolean test inside loops and break out of it

20224615
median	minimum
ideally i only want to show the median the maximum and minimum values as in the report

20224615

20225216
google-chrome	firefox
the code generated in each platform works perfectly in both google-chrome and firefox of course

20225232
integer	radix
the main idea behind this radix select is that is scans through 32 bit integer starting from its msb to lsb

20225235
post	get
-in code you should first get customer_mail from post

20225274

for databases that you upgrade from earlier versioning you need to enable rebalancing manualy from admin interface

20225537
vorbis	webm
formats supported by chrome are h-264 vp8 webm video part theora for video and mp3 aac vorbis for audio

20225579
versioning	upgrade
if you re using the older versioning of itextsharp then the using statements might not work simple turn them into dim statements and remove the end using or upgrade to the most recent versioning

20225588
width	height
you can use the html border width and height attribute of the table

20225667
svg	vml
ie 8 doesn t support svg so vml is used

20225733
min	max
otherwise we would have to store all companies in heap use max heap instead min heap implement inckey and perform this operation for all trades and keep back-references to heap in hashmap and everything is far more complicated

20225741
width	height
use this and the view s height and width to determine the size and position of the circle

20225800
hide	show
this highlights a box so just edit the css to hide show position it

20225815
postgresql	mysql

it works a treat in google-chrome and safari but not on iphones and ipads

20225917
folder	directory
the folder thing that you see is not different directory

20225929
for-loop	arrays
the enhanced for-loop returns the values in the arrays not the indices

20225972
int	boolean
one remaining question now is why the code above does not produce a compilation error due to the fact that the list is of type and the apply method of set has type signature apply a boolean thus expects an int in our case

20225989
maven	pom.xml
second you can create a maven project which will allow you to add the spring dependencies in a pom.xml file

20225996
kerberos	ldap
the other upside besides better security not perfect security is that if the enterprise uses ldap active directory tivoli kerberos shibboleth okta then whatever crazy 2 or 4 or 6 factor authentication hoops the user has to go through your application doesn t need to know how to jump those hoops

20226006
for-loop	arrays
when using the enhanced for-loop there is no need to use an index to iterate through the items in the arrays

20226051
postgresql	mysql
if i run the same in postgresql or mysql it works fine

20226082
apache	nginx
you can use nginx or apache mod_proxy to make forwarding to your node.js apps

20226128
maven	m2e
but as recommended and suggested try downloading maven there is an integration also if you go and install from the eclipse market m2e

20226138
put	get
initially i was expecting to have put meaningful names to the columns in the business logic in php but if i could just get sql to handle that before our program even sees this result set that d be awesome

20226142

20226253
spaces	linefeed
s is the same as so it includes tab cr linefeed and spaces

20226255
submit	submission
you don t need to disable the submit button you just need to show an error message and stop the form from submission

20226272
mouse	keyboard
i ve tried googling around for an answer but i can only seem to find articles explaining how to connect an android device to a usb accessory like a usb mouse or keyboard not how to treat an android device as the usb accessory itself

20226276
int	chars
void mymalloc int size unsigned chars meta

20226301
folder	directory
primary directory is masterfolder which includes multiple sub directory which are child folder fol1 fol2 fol3 fol4 the sub directory may vary folder to folder

20226301
folder	directory
i checked multiple articles but everything specifies deleting a specific file or a directory using shutil.rmtree under one folder but i am looking for something which will do the find and delete recursively i believe

20226308
implements	extends
when you want to create task you would need to extends implements the plugabletask and need to specify the class name in the plugabletaskparameter table with proper category type for eg if you want to create payment task category type is 6

20226310
post	get
i have no issues using spring s resttemplate to make post or get calls to an endpoint

20226319
for-loop	loops
the first for-loop is in fact mostly similar to a while loops

20226343
versioning	upgrade
we already have rtm versioning of web api available publicly now and you should plan to upgrade to it

20226353
int	chars
mystruct currentperiodcharges chars a int b float c

20226465
hide	show
i d like to show or hide this div based on the contents of my session state

20226471
floor	sqrt
it looks like if i take p floor sqrt n 102663 then i can try to find a q using n p q by checking if n mod p 0

20226474
int	boolean
i m currently doing this by making the boolean variables int which are then set using expressions of the form

20226474
int	boolean
as above i m currently doing this by using int instead of boolean and setting each one with an ite of the form

20226495
portrait	landscape	screens	tablet
this is slightly different to the sliders in the sense that this code needs to be instantly responsive if the screens size changes for example a tablet user changing from portrait to landscape

20226570
scipy	sympy
of course while searching for the answer i came across a bit about using scipy instead of sympy for this

20226581
put	get
when they have paid through paypal you have an option to put in a link when the payment is successful and i could have a form so when they are on that link it adds there bonuses but it also means anyone could just go to that link and get the bonuses for free

20226612
for-loop	loops
you don t want your return in the for-loop it makes loops useless as it will return in the first iteration

20226626
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i ve seen this problem on ubuntu 10.04 and linux mint nadia with cinnamon

20226655
int	double
you need to put a return type such as string int double etc. probably stringbuffer in this case between the public and encode

20226668
wildfly	jboss
we re in the process of moving our project to java ee 7 targeting jboss wildfly

20226668
jar	war
however i don t understand why this simple test works with a jar and not a war

20226712
getter	setter
kvo observing provides a framework for automatically listening on property changes without requiring modifications of getter and setter

20226725
for-loop	loops
the for-loop is doing 1 iteration too few in your code e.g if number is 5 j will be decremented to 0 but then loops will exit so rorder 0 won t be assigned the value 4

20226759
min	max
only some spinnermodel s have the concept of min max values

20226788
median	max	min	median	min	max
instead of using boxplot i suggest just drawing lines from the min to the max and making a mark at the median

20226791
hide	show
the problem is i need to be able to hide the link if there isn t any text to show

20226817

20227031
int	chars
bytebuffer has methods for getting bytes chars java chars as in unicode chars shorts int and longs from a bytebuffer

20227034
hide	show
since .py and .txt are both known extensions and you have explorer configured to hide known extensions which i believe is the default in all versions of windows it doesn t show them to you

20227069
next	except
we use zipwith to pair every element in the list except the last with its next element and return a list of the distances

20227074
int	double
if this were not so addresses relative to the stack pointer would have to be specified in bytes and this would mean that almost any stack access would have two bits that are irrelevant most of the time as the majority of arguments will be words int float or reference or double words long double

20227074
int	boolean
you can still store 32 boolean in an int if you feel that you should save on memory

20227099
google-chrome	firefox
i observed this behavior in firefox internet exploder and google-chrome

20227115
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
this appears to work on firefox and safari but not on google-chrome

20227226

20227242
peer	p2p
as it d be a peer in the p2p connection

20227245
filesystems	ntfs
for windows i can say for certain that a close enough version of the ntfs filesystems driver has been written for linux

20227245
filesystems	fat
documentation on the fat filesystems has been made public a long time ago with the intent that it would provide ample information for developers and engineers working on flash drives and things like that

20227245
filesystems	fat
for example the fat filesystems there are tables for each directory and each directory stores metadata about the files it contains

20227245
filesystems	fat
but it also has a fat table that holds the fragment locations for each file contained in the filesystems

20227245
filesystems	ntfs
the ntfs filesystems has a big table called the master file table that holds a record of metadata for each file contained by the filesystems including the table itself

20227271
java.util.date	simpledateformat
these classes supplant the troublesome old legacy date-time classes such as java.util.date calendar simpledateformat

20227289
range	minimum
other minor things are the value you give to a is not used because a later only appears as a parameter range is a misnomer since it s actually the intial value of a0 for fminunc to find the minimum and eq is actually a function

20227366
put	get
not sure if this is the best place for this question but following this article i put this function putclip in my vimrc however it doesnt seem to get triggered

20227369
openssl	gnutls
judging from the api of the openssl and gnutls library stacking a sslsocket onto a sslsocket is actually not straightforwardly possible as they provide special read write functions to implement the encryption which they are not able to use themselves when wrapping a pre-existing sslsocket

20227386
getter	setter
you can specify a regex that matches the method names of your getter and setter in the entity classes such as

20227398
min	max
if you want to adjust the scale so that the max and min is the max and min of your values it is a little bet more complicated

20227442
put	get
but when i put that in my preference on click i get this error

20227508
width	height
i suspect that the width and height of the popup are not yet known

20227600
free	malloc
you should not use malloc free in c++ program especially for creating c++ object unless you know what you are doing

20227619
comparator	comparable
see comparable or comparator for a precise definition of consistent with equals. this is so because the set interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a treeset instance performs all element comparisons using its comparator or compare method so two elements that are deemed equals by this method are from the standpoint of the set equals

20227655
hide	show
that section should be rendering a button to show hide the menu when in xs mode i believe

20227715
min	max
this function returns the min and max indices of the array

20227715
min	max
this function creates an array from a min max pair for the bounds and a list of associations

20227731

20227769
children	parent
i could live with the need to trust children to render outside their parent

20227794
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
java supports two kinds of exceptions checked exceptions statically checked and unchecked-exception runtimeexception and its subtypes

20227803
cos	sin
if you want to provide angle in degrees then use cosd and sind and if angle is in radians then use cos and sin

20227804
runtimeexception	filenotfoundexception
filenotfoundexception is a checked exception not a runtimeexception so any code that throws it must declare it

20227810
versioning	upgrade
so as others have said this is all due to the screwy way microsoft released 4.5 which basically is an upgrade to and overwrite of versioning 4.0

20227811
put	get	min	max
i think the easiest way to get two phone numbers per user is to put them on one row and use min and max

20227824
128bit	64bit
i have 2 64bit integers and i would like to concatenate it into a single 128bit integer

20227829
for-loop	arrays
the array.apply 0 arrays 9 .map is a trick see here and here used to avoid an explicit for-loop to produce the first 9 numbers

20227845
strlen	strcpy
it was not at all uncommon to see strlen used as a return value for length or strcpy used in the copy constructor

20227961
post	get
i m trying to add getbyname to get the ip address of a hostname and use it in my post command

20228167
inherited	properties
i inherited a button and now trying to shadow backcolor properties to hide it from the view and then provide another one called backcolorenabled

20228230
getter	setter
the properties should be private and you should implemente getter and setter for the objects properties like this

20228295
x86	64bit
if it is available try to set your build configuration from x86 to 64bit or vice versa

20228403
mp3	wav
mp3 files are probably most easily processed by converting to wav first although round-tripping the segments back to mp3 may degrade quality

20228428

this class extends sprite and implements an interface

20228436
post	get
i am trying to get my app ios android to allow users to post a screenshot to facebook with a link and a description

viewdidload	viewdidappear
which means if we recreate the navigation controllersâ stack in viewdidload using setviewcontrollers when we get to viewdidappear we will have the current item added to the barsâ â itemsâ stack and therefore the uinavcontroller viewcontroller stack will not be in sync with the uinavbar items stack

20228459
folder	directory	folder	dir
dir returns a string representing the name of a file directory or folder that matches a specified pattern or file attribute or the volume label of a drive

20228488
ggplot2	lattice
if you want to have many species not just two on the same figure multiple plots like their example then i would suggest switching to lattice or ggplot2 to do the plotting but you d need to massage the data a bit first

20228547
hide	show
the way i used to make it work again is to use the old embed code with the parameters to hide the controls when you click the video they show up but if you roll out they hide again here s the code

20228607
post	get
the below code is part from working code to execute get and post requests

20228659

you could use picture boxes and simply use paint paint.net photoshop gimp to make the days grid

20229136
google-chrome	firefox
to piggy back off of bradley priest s answer this may seem obvious to seasoned programmers but for newb s you can run app.router.router.recognizer.names command in the debug console in the browser ie firebug in firefox google-chrome developer tools etc... after you load your ember app in the browser

20229163

hide	show
but my primary concern is that the client-side javascript such as angularjs would actually decrease the performance when it needs to do ajax-requests and then show hide create elements dynamically compared to creating a traditional http request to get page and its contents and showing that directly

you need to store whether or not each node is currently active which you can use to determine whether or not you should hide show the node s neighbors

20251369
dictionary	map	hide	show
the main points to highlight are that first i create a dictionary to map node names to the names of their neighbors which makes determining which links to show hide easy

20252369
hide	show
assuming that you want to show #mydivhide1 and #mydivhide2 when the form is submitted and then hide them when the iframe finishes loading i came up with a fiddle that should do what you want

20252406
folder	directory
by default app models is provided in to autoload section of the composer.json file and laravel will load models from this location and if you want to use any namespace in your model then create directory according to namespace and put your model in that directory under app model so if your namespace for a model is project entity then your model should be in app models project entity folder and when you use your model you may use it like

for an individual user i wanted to use the identical jlabel object so that any changes to that jlabel would propagate through all views of them in the same jtextpane

20252779
jlabel	jtextpane
the first way around this would be to have individual jlabel for each and every username but this could eventually lead to the creation of thousands of jlabel in the jtextpane

20252835
width	height
the is based on the width of the element not the height

20252845
concave	angle
while the algorithm s i ve used to calculate the angle technically output the correct angle i have no way of telling whether or not the program spits out an interior angle or an exterior angle since the arbitrary shape the user inputs could have concave vertices

20252845
concave	angle
for example if i have a shape that has coordinates 30 50 35 47 40 50 37 43 35 35 33 43 which ends up looking sort of like an upside-down spire with a concave base i can easily calculate the angle between the lines but which angle i am calculating is a mystery

more sophisticated swing components such as jtree jtable jlist or jcombobox work with the concept of model

20253320
apache	nginx
you can use separate sub domains if you prefer this approach and you will need to set up the sub domains to point to the same location and have your web server apache nginx automatically set some environment variables ie website name store name based on the sub domain check the index.php to see what these are so that magento knows which store to display

20253325
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
consider for example what would happen if both client and server tried to construct an objectinputstream from a socket s input stream prior to either constructing the corresponding objectoutputstream

20253325
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
because of this you should always make it a practice in your code to open the objectoutputstream and flush it first before you open the objectinputstream

20253327

see what s going on in the constructor then see get post methods

20253350

20253478
int	chars
so i think i need to select the first two chars then cast them into an int

20253501
children	parent
keeping a list of children in the parent makes more sense from this aspect

20253526
put	get
the problem is that we get multiple rows for each server so what we want instead is to have 1 row for each server but have the list of software displayed across the top and then put an in the software column if it is installed on a particular server

20253547
width	height
that if the screen has a different ratio relation between width and height this solution is not accurated because it will adapt to the width but not to the height.

keydown	keyup
unfortunately keypress and keyup events do not detect the next key event so you need to bind it on keydown

20253602
concave	convex	concave	vertex
anyway you could use this algorithm to check if a vertex is concave or convex by checking it against the polygon without the test vertex

20253602
concave	convex
so if you had a quadrilateral with vertexes a b c d and you wanted to see if b is convex or concave you can test if b is inside triangle a c d

20253602
concave	convex	concave	vertex
if it is inside it s convex if not concave and if neither not a vertex at all

20253602
concave	angle	concave	convex
with the knowledge of weather it is convex or concave you should be able to parse out which is the interior angle and which is the exterior

20253619
width	height
each div has a fixed height and width and i need the data to be passed to the first then if that is filled overflow to another etc

20257352
getter	setter
if it s a plain ruby object then you could check if it responds to the setter and getter

20257352

range	max	trie	tree
the strings are typically 40-600 bytes utf-8 and i believe this should reduce everything after the filepath prefix the first 40 characters which are compressed by the trie into at max 12 bytes the deepest point on the tree is about 12 nodes deep and each node is at worst 1 char to represent for the structure and 12 bytes for the indexes variable byte encoding with very few elements containing indexes above 256 producing strings that are usually in the range 40-64 bytes

20265860
dbcontext	objectcontext
since we cannot call dbcontext directly which would be distinguishable and we have to call objectcontext and the internal dictionary for the metamodel uses the type without namespace as key always objecttype there is no way around it

20265905
ng-show	ng-hide
ng-show ng-hide accepts only boolean values

20265926

g++	gcc
first make sure your mingw s bin directory is in your environment path so gcc and g++ is callable from your command prompt

20266835

int	boolean
i have class appengine where are some data static boolean int and instances of my classes configuration etc.

20267158
cos	sin
if you are using ie 8 or below you will need to use the progid dximagetransform.microsoft.matrix method which can be buggy as you have to use sin and cos mathematical values

20267165
width	height
i am using this technique shown below because i have to wait before the view is created before i can get the width and height

20267165
width	height
so i used example 1 below and it works perfectly by posting a runnable to a framelayout so that after framelayout is created it will get the width and height

20267271
pull	push
i only know git pull commit push

20267335
width	height
if you need to wait for a layout to get width and height of a view i wouldn t use a runnable but a globallayoutlistener check this question for details

also make sure you do it first in a browser where you can get good feedback on javascript errors in the console eg google-chrome or firefox with firebug

20267660
width	height
set the contentsize property of your uiscrollview properly basically the width height of the content that can be displayed in the scroll view without scrolling set the pagingenabled property of the scroll view to yes and then add your view that you want to scroll as a subview of the uiscrollview

20267737
min	max
notice that it is important to put a value for min and max properties to display multiple lines

20267762

here is a blog post explaining serializable and deserialization with sitecore powershell extensions

20268453
int	chars	unsigned	short
i am trying to convert a self-defined chars constant using #define in a header file holding a port number to an unsigned short int in order to be able to handle it using htons to get the network byte-order

20268453
unsigned	short
i thought that this might be caused by the fact that char uses 1 byte of storage while unsigned short uses 2 bytes of storage that this might represent some sort of conflict.

20268471
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
after upgrading to os x mavericks it looks like safari or google-chrome or firefox

20269001
hide	show
in this case i would just need to show hide the hint depending on whether the validation error is visible or not

20269004

20269167
folder	directory
in this scenario the resulting location of your file is the iis process startup directory not a folder inside you web site

20269320

i ve tried using this type of detection to see if the user has blocked geolocation based on this post but when i test it on a browser where i did block it i get the notification of supported

20269570
int	chars
this also means that the reason why python would complain about 123abc being invalid syntax isn t the tokenizer error the chars a isn t valid in an int literal but the parser error the identifier abc cannot directly follow the int literal 123

20269570
int	chars
the reason why the tokenizer can t recognize the 1 as an int literal is that the chars that makes it leave the float -or- int state determines what it just read

so you need to make sure your rectangle s size is not empty i.e height and width not equal to zero

20269943
folder	directory
though often used for different purposes the index document was originally intended conceptually to be the index directory listing or other content summary of all of the files within each folder so this configuration parameter specifies the index document to return for each folder in the entire bucket if such a document exists within the folder .

20269943
folder	directory
you ll note that sub-bucket isn t an actual term for what you are describing which is an object with delimiters in its key path which gives the appearance of being nested under a directory or folder

20269943
folder	directory
for clarity i have used the words folder and directory very casually all throughout this answer with the conventional meaning.

20269952
for-loop	arrays
it is better to use array.length instead of hard coding the length of arrays in for-loop

20269963
range	minimum
now i have the problem that when i set start to 11 28 2012 and end also to 11 28 2012 and i scroll minimum range is 1 day the user is able to scroll out of the selected range which i am trying to prohibit

you need to add a nested for-loop inside do-while loops and then compare the entered value with all the arrays values inside that for-loop

20270457
for-loop	loops	do-while	break
you can break out of the inner for-loop on successful comparison but before you break out you set a which you need to monitor in the outer do-while loops to break out of it

20270700
getter	setter
it s look like you simply want to make a generic setter and a generic getter

20270745
stdout	stderr
the job itself automatically redirects stdout and stderr to the build log console but if you want it to be accessed from an external source the actual file descriptor used is needed

20270745
stdout	stderr
on linux once you know the process id of the process that is running the job you can simply go write to that process s stdout or stderr

ffmpeg	libav
i have cross compiled ffmpeg and libav from linux to windows mingw32

getter	setter
most methods are getter setter methods to set up your structure

20270870

std rand may return rather small values 0..32767 is the minimum range and does so on some popular 32-bit platforms msvc among them

20271300
boost	allocator
as a counter-example things like std map and std vector which use the heap need an explicit allocator to use them in interprocess memory but boost optional i was fairly sure does not use the heap and is equivalent to writing

20271323
tunnel	vpn
that s something of an ambiguous question because the vpn has an incoming and outgoing stream and should implement an incoming and outgoing tunnel stream

20271323
tunnel	vpn
on one hand setting up a tunnel connection to a vpn server and writing the input stream of the vpnservice s interface into the tunnel output stream and on the other hand writing the tunnel response back into the interface output stream

20271323

how can i loop through each directory recursively and whenever it finds a folder called video_ts let genisoimage convert that folder to an iso image the name of the iso would be the parent folder s name

20271478
portrait	landscape
this does not happen while viewing on landscape or on iphone either portrait or landscape

int	chars
to cast a pointer to your int variable to an unrelated type like unsigned chars you will need to use reinterpret_cast

20271621
getter	setter
if you use jsonbackreference on your getter setter method in your project more than twice you should distinguish them with a specific reference name.maybe only one defaultreference is allowed in the latest version

20271641

filewriter	bufferedwriter
i have used filewriter and bufferedwriter

20271873
filewriter	bufferedwriter
my question here is why does the filewriter variable need to be wrapped in a bufferedwriter

20271873
filewriter	bufferedwriter
this makes sense to me here but what does wrapping the filewriter in a bufferedwriter gain

20271873
filewriter	bufferedwriter
what really is the purpose of wrapping the filewriter into the bufferedwriter

20271927
filewriter	bufferedwriter
my question here is why does the filewriter variable need to be wrapped in a bufferedwriter

20271927
fileoutputstream	filewriter
one thing i would suggest is that you use a fileoutputstream wrapped in an outputstreamwriter rather than using filewriter directly - that way you can specify which encoding you should use rather than just using the platform default encoding

20271947
range	max	range	min	min	max
now i want to limit p so that vp is within range min and max

20271947
min	max
light gray is within min max

20271947
range	max	range	min	min	max
my trouble is that i need the line equations for min max so i can choose a new position for p when vp is out of range

20271947
min	max
the new position for p is the point closest to p on the min or max line

20271947
min	max
min and max are also values

20271947
min	max
the two line equations i need will give me xy coordinates for which the values determined by the triangle are min or max

memcpy	strcpy	memcpy	strncpy	strcpy	strncpy
use strcpy strncpy memcpy etc

20272273

all screens just care about the dimensions of image width x height as the screen resolution is 72dpi and also 1x1px in the image 1px on the display regarding resolution

20272273
screens	tablet
higher density of the screens more pixels - so on the same size 7 tablet with low res 1280x800 it will be bigger than on high res 7 tablet 2540x1600

try-catch	exception-handling
from what i ve read the try-catch block is performance-heavy only when an exception-handling is thrown if not then it has no serious performance drop

20272559
try-catch	exception-handling
for the message receiving i have a dispatchertimer with time interval 100ms it has about 50-60 lines of code inside a try-catch block but the receive is in the second line and there s where the exception-handling is thrown so it moves to the catch part of the code where there s a simple if block which checks if the exception-handling is not a wsaewouldblock exception-handling and prints it

20272646
profiling	debugging
use a profiling in debugging mode to identify questionable parts of your code

20272646
profiling	debugging
for cpu the reason for profiling in debugging mode is because if your tried profiling in release mode the compiler is going to reduce math vectorize loops and inline functions which tends to glob your code into an un-mappable mess when it s assembled

20272684
integer	unsigned
i wonder if there are studies and attempts in designing a float-like ieee754 type where the decimal part and the integer part are handled by an int or an unsigned int each or any other kind of design that can lead to a float-like implemented with integers

20272721

postgresql	mysql
also keep in mind that if you have postgresql or mysql and you go to use sqlite some things won t be exactly the same

20273045
for-loop	arrays
however i wanted to put the elements in a 2-d arrays that is the reason i tried to use the for-loop instead

20273137
int	double
you should use either ld for a long int or lf for a long double

20273144
hide	show
just make sure you hide and show the element properly and not just slide it up and you ll avoid the issue completely

20273270
g++	gcc
after installing mingw you still need install gcc and g++ compilers in mingw

20273312
for-loop	loops
note that a variable used in a for-loop automatically gets assigned to the last value after the end of loops but only in normal loops in python 2.x this used to happen with list comprehensions as well .

20273350
width	height
each of the stream properties returned will have attributes like width height and color depth - select one that is appropriate for your use case

20273360
getter	setter
if so then it should not hold arraylists but rather individual fields for a single house with getter and setter methods for each field a constructor that accepts the field parameters and perhaps a default constructor that accepts no parameters if desired

20273495
for-loop	loops
for-loop do while loops

20273656
width	height
it has a fixed height but can be any width

20273656
width	height
the subclasses on construction set their preferred size using setpreferredsize which means i have to provide a width in addition to the height

20273656
jlist	jtree
other views such as the jlist jtree and scroll views seem to resize automatically to fill the available space in a boxlayout so i feel like there must be something i can do in my jpanel subclass that i haven t thought of

move	drag
alternately you could use a pan gesture recognizer as the other poster suggested and move the container view as the user drag

20274500
getter	setter
now i have modified that object with new fields provided setter and getter for them

20274569
stdout	stdio	stdout	fflush	stdio	fflush
the reason is because stdio does not fflush stdout until it sees a newline

20274569
stdout	fflush
without it the program could crash the stdout buffer would not have been fflush and would not see the printf

20274599
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
i m using node express for my server and am trying to save photos from the client mobile app to the server and am deployed using amazon-web-services elastic beanstalk

20274600
hide	show
or maybe you can hide show as show here

20274606
width	height
now i have a parent element that is fixed in the centre of the page has width and height 0 top and bottom 50 and my idea was to position its child elements with generating top and left margins somehow like this

20274632
pull	push
for example i will have a project in google drive project files and pull push to my github repo from that folder

20274632
pull	push
should i be able to pull push commit this way or should i only be able to do it after initializing it through git git pull url

20274689
range	minimum
normalizing will be improved by finding minimum and maximum pixel values and stretch min-max range to 0-255

20274698
folder	directory
note that these folder must be placed in the res animator directory in your project structure

20274708
width	height
height 1500px and width 3400px

20274735
packets	multicast
each thread will receive udp packets from different multicast streams of say around 60 mbps then processes udp packets and queues in shared blockingqueue

20274735
packets	multicast
i want order of processed udp packets in queue which is same as how packets reached to nic of machine even if receiving packets from different threads different multicast streams

20274735
packets	multicast
basically threads will receive multicast from different multicast streams and packets order in queue will depend on order how receiving threads executed to take packets from nic but i want order to be same as how packets reached to nic

20274746
children	parent
then you just need to set the children to a parent object

20274759
subtract	add
so when i enter a number in the textbox .3567 and then click add subtract etc.

20274781
width	height
then you can color the pixels and transform back into the form width x height x color channels x frames

20274813
width	height
width of the banner will be same as the activity screen height will be as tall as it needs to be

20274843
folder	dir
for example i have such loop that calls dir on a folder whose name contains percent signs so interpreter tries to resolve characters between these as a variable

20274859
width	height
i d also recommend using scrollheight and scrollwidth as opposed to using jquery s width and height because it is more inclusive thus giving a more accurate top value

20274878
google-chrome	safari
when i load the map it s slow to load there s a lag for displaying the map in google-chrome and safari

20274902
google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari
besides this works like a charm for google-chrome opera and safari

20274906
children	parent
it exposes all the standard tree structure relations parent root children ancestors...

20274953
min	max
i have tried setting min and max heights but it doesn t seem to work

20274990
width	height
i change also the width height

20275043
gif	bmp	gif	png	bmp	png
image i o has built-in support for gif png jpeg bmp and wbmp

20275056
std	ostream
at least in headers your are much better off using full qualification std ostream

20275056
cout	cin
this one isn t quite a problem but a bit nitpicking you shouldn t include in headers unless you use std cout std cin std cerr or std clog

20275058
post	get
anyway post request didn t work so i send get request

20275061
google-chrome	firefox
this works perfectly fine on google-chrome and firefox

20275109
versioning	upgrade
the only caveat is you need to be using the same versioning of those databases since the file format is only identical amongst same versioning and can only be used amongst the same versioning 2012 - or it can be upgrade to the next newer versioning you could move a database from localdb 2012 to a sql server 2014 express once it s released - but you can never go back down to an earlier versioning you cannot take a localdb 2012 .mdf database file and attach it to a sql server 2008 versioning

20275165
post	get
note you won t be able to send json object as a get param so consider using post request

20275177
jar	war
i am keeping of same version of jar inside war lib and ear lib

20275180
qtcore	qtgui
if you just do from pyqt4 import qtgui qtcore instead of importing from them the names in those modules are available but only as qualified names

20275191
width	height
centered and fill the width or height of the webview depending on it s

20275198

20275207
folder	directory
i am trying to make an app that creates a folder not in an external directory a.k.a the sdcard but in the device s memory

20275220
int	chars
the code below is used to extract an int and a long from a vector of chars

20275251
getter	setter
you could try creating a class that extends ccanimate and creating a public setter getter functions to set that index to desired one before starting the animation

20275254
folder	directory
folder is the actual folder name of the directory not the name in the text file obviously the link won t work otherwise

20275365
packets	multicast
i have more than one udp multicast streams on different ports to receive and i want order of receiving packets between different streams to be same order packets reached to nic

20275365
packets	multicast
if i capture packets from multiple multicast in order they reached to nic i can get accurate order with very few going out of order due to intermediate jitters from source to my application

20275365
packets	multicast
but when multicast streams are very high rate say more than 50 mbps some receiver thread may be idle due to cpu even if it has packets to take from udp

20275380
post	get
then you can just call the method to get post

20275380
post	get
one to get the category all and then one for the post of each category .

20275401
int	double
i need to convert it to double or int and then round it to 2 decimal places and if its an int round to 1 digit

20275401
int	double
i also do not know if the value is double or int should be something that works with both

20275403
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
the thing is it looks great in google-chrome and safari but in firefox 25.0.1 looks awful

20275409
int	chars
each class has a void add function but numbers have void add int v chars - void add chars c etc

20275410
folder	directory
i am trying to make an app that creates a folder not in an external directory a.k.a the sdcard but in the device s memory

20275426
width	height
but that removed the width and height and alt attributes

20275490
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
i have a user form with checkbox dropdownlistfor and text fields

20275498
box-sizing	border-box
use css style box-sizing border-box

20275507
textarea	textbox
it s better to use textarea instead of textbox becasue they keep whitespaces

20275529
width	height
but sometimes i need to adjust more proprties for example increase the width or the height of the icon font etc

20275552
button	checkbox
it s probably worth mentioning that when expecting a user to choose exactly one item from a list of many items you should use radio button not checkbox

20275575
min	max
in the code you have found this is removed an replaced with saving the old min and max values to start with in the method

20275575
min	max
the code will expand the min and max values to infinity just adding on and on and on

20275603
put	get
i don t really get what u r trying to say but from what i understood u need a list when clicked it goes to another page with title the text on item of the list clicked in that case u would want to create a listener on the list and on the click event u set a new intent where u put the name of the item clicked

20275695
width	height
one issue i m having is getting the div#canvas to be 100 via width and height

20275703
pull	push
i did a git push and pull to get it onto my live server and when doing a composer update it doesn t download this library

20275705
margin	text-align
if you want the 3 boxes to distribute evenly you are probably better off removing the floats make them dispay inline-block set the parent element to text-align center then use the margin on the div s to decide the spacing between them

20275786
fseek	fread
at the moment i fseek and fread every line in a loop

20275812
clang	llvm
i m not sure you can get what you want directly because const is a c c++ semantic that s useful for clang but much less so for llvm

20275828
clang	llvm
one thing you can do with clang and llvm is emit the code with debug information and then look for malloc calls

20275909
hash	md5
by the way with a base convert you could make a md5 hash shorter too

20275939
vb.net	vb6
i have some vb6 code that i need to port to vb.net or c# or f#

20275946
ord	chr
to find out if the ascii value of a one-character string is less than 48 you need to either use ord to convert the string to its 8-bit or unicode codepoint or use chr or unichr to convert 48 into a one-character string

20275976
for-loop	arrays
im trying to fill an arrays with a vector in a for-loop as the size of the vector will change over time

20275994
put	get	post	get	post	put
it s the principle of an api rest such as the soundclound api which let you retrieve a lot of information just by making http requests get post put etc. on defined urls

20276017
openni	kinect
note that the current version of openni 2 does not have kinect support

20276046
int	chars
the string reads perfectly into the unsigned int but when i try to place it in the array or in the unsigned chars ch it gives me gibbrish

20276050
gzipinputstream	gzipoutputstream
remove both the gzipinputstream and the gzipoutputstream from your code if you really want to save the zipped version because that is what you are currently doing

20276073
hide	show
i would like to hide the div and show another one if the form is submitted successfully i guess i have to use jquery s hide and .show classes but i don t know how

20276082
opera	safari
according to mdn info font-feature-settings is not supported in safari and opera

20276155
for-loop	arrays
i can use a for-loop if i want to evaluate the function for each x element and it gives me the answer that i want but i think there may be an easiest way like when we can use simply f x and get an arrays with each element evaluated in the function

20276202
int	chars
simply output the chars as int

20276248
udp	tcp
on top of this classic bsd raw sockets can t even receive udp or tcp packets

20276248
udp	tcp
unless you build a packet filter to reroute them they re always handled by the kernel and delivered to a udp or tcp socket or to the firewall if there is none

20276248
libpcap	wireshark	scapy	libpcap
or even easier use something like scapy which has python wrappers around libpcap and everything else necessary or wireshark a separate program which you can automate from python

20276263
put	get
if you are looking for a way to get existing instances create a dictionary and put the references you need to be able to look up in there

20276280
ostringstream	std
you should use str to get std string from ostringstream

20276301
portrait	landscape
when i shoot an image in portrait mode on the camera using the imagepickercontroller and pass that image to the mfmailcomposeviewcontroller and e-mail it it arrives at the destination e-mail address and is displayed there incorrectly in landscape mode

20276301
portrait	landscape
the key to unlocking this problem is to realize that when you shoot an image in either portrait of landscape the iphone always stores the uiimage the same way as 3264 wide and 2448 high

20276301
width	height
if we shoot portrait gimage arrives with uiimageorientationright and width 3264 and height 2448

20276301
width	height
if we shoot landscape gimage arrives with uiimageorientationup and width 3264 and height 2448

20276301
width	height
when we look at the debugging data for the new uiimage tmp we get uiimageorientationup and width 3264 and height 2448

20276313
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
if you combine triflejs ie phantomjs webkit google-chrome + safari and slimerjs firefox you can run headless tests in all common browser environments using the same test scripts and api

i m trying write read inputstream outputstream to socket but i get error.

20276348

20276361
submit	submission
however on the dialog when i click update it doesn t submit the form and the alert prints submitted undefined could anyone please help me submission this form through jquery load and dialog

20276369
int	chars
the problem i am having is that i don t know how to turn that next chars into its corresponding int so that i can use it on the for-loop

20276370
min	max
i have set the min and max value of the rangevalidator in the code-behind and it works as intended

20276378
pull	push
then push and pull that change to wherever you need it and there only composer install - because you probably want the exact same library versions that you tested with not anything slightly newer with possibly broken commits

20276385
addclass	removeclass
you could probably just use javascript element.scrolltop along with jquery addclass and removeclass

20276455
implements	extends
i m writing a class which extends jframe and implements actionlistener

20276463
mouseup	mousedown
i guess i could use mousedown and mouseup event instead but iâ d like to know why this is happening... i have the same problem when i use click event

20276488
folder	directory
now the directory structure inside multicore make a folder named your_core_name

20276653
versioning	upgrade
note that this value will be null at first when the user upgrade from 1.0 to 1.1 since it won t have been set by versioning 1.0 of the app

20276700
implements	extends
add a custom method to performs a rawquery in a class dedicated to sql management maybe a one extends sqliteopenhelper that will return your custom class implements cursor and in which you will set the sql statement

20276722
width	height
as all images loaded in the browser are converted to uncompressed rgba the memory usage will be minimum width x height x 4

20276741
google-chrome	firefox
this code works well in firefox and google-chrome

20276762
post	get
originally the page s get and post urls were the same so i tried having the request post elsewhere

20276762
post	get
also in diagnosing this problem i used a basic ajax request to post errors back to the server and get better reporting on what was going on

20276793
int	double
what i want is the double output to be similar to the int one

20276821
subtract	add
most of it works and i am able to display a balance as well as add and subtract money from a account but what i also want to do is when money is withdrawn beyond the initial balance to remove a balance echo message and replace it with a i.e echo no more money

20276834
src	attr
building on your example above in order to get to the actual iframe src you can use the attr method of jquery

var ssrc #pp_full_res attr src

20276840
awt	swing
also see painting in awt and swing

20276844

20276860
post	get
also if this also relevant my get mapping is also the same url as the post

20276872
post	get
it s a classical get user for this post case that would be solved with a join in rdbms

20276879
width	height
total size after decompression must equal width height of jpeg image

20276945
spaces	delimiter
copy a1 to c1 because b1 might be in the way then apply text to columns on c1 with spaces as the delimiter

20276965
post	get
if that isn t it would help if you could post the detailed error message you get from hitting this locally if you can -- that will help narrow down the cause

20276974
width	height
scale so the width and height of your viewport match the pixel width and height

20276974
width	height
add half the pixel width and height to the s t coords

20276974
width	height
that way the centre of the viewport 0 0 maps to the centre of the screen width 2 height 2

20276974
cos	sin
x cos dec cos azp - azc cos dep + sin dec sin dep

20276974

20277236
phpoffice	phpword
phpoffice phpword i m not sure how far the word branch of the project has developed

20277378
submit	submission
my advice remove any tabindex attribute from your code except for very special cases like a comment form in a forum where you want to type text into a textarea then 1 or 2 tab enter and you re submission your message regardless of buttons for inserting bbcode that could be placed between the textarea and the submit button

20277500
atexit	main
if i take out the line atexit final in my main everything works properly

20277523
vbscript	vba
i m not exactly a noob to vba vbscript but i ve never really ventured further than if and for functions

20277524
pop-up	dialog
but like this the image inside the dialog pop-up is not rotating

20277602
width	height	oncreate	setcontentview
this code is used to show the width and height of the contentview and the code is run after the setcontentview method is called in the oncreate method but it results of a width of zero and height of zero

20277602
width	height
however the contentview opens up on the screen and it is not 0 for either width or height

20277612
min	max
it has a lot of options such as sum average max min first non-null value cumulative sum all rows option only

20277703
typedef	struct
you re attempting to refer to your struct recursively which doesn t play nice with typedef

20277712
post	get
in order to remember what their topic was so i can redirect after the login i send the topic in the form topic to the login class where it s received as a parameter by the get and post methods

20277712
post	get
if a user just comes to the site and logs in normally they are redirected to the home page but in this case because the topic has been received by get and post and is not none i use the line below to send them on to their original destination

20277739
inherited	subclassing
the usual rule is prefer composition to inherited that is give your class a member instead of subclassing it

20277786
neo4j	datomic
datomic in particular as well as neo4j

what s the fastest implementation in scipy numpy scikit-learn that i can use to do this given that it has to scale to situations where the 1d array has 10k values

20277987
fgets	getchar
also it is recommended to not use getchar and instead use fgets

20277992
integer	unsigned
note i cannot read the data into anything but an unsigned int as i am processing the data as if it were an unsigned integer for encryption purposes

rss	feed
i am building a tool to allow users to extract their google plus stream as rss feed

20278068
amd	umd
i realize i m years late to this but thought i d add this example--requirejs sets a property called amd on the define function which is quite handy as the umd pattern uses it to detect that the define function that s in scope is in fact an amd define function

20278137
min	max
with x and y vectors min the inclusive starting index max the exclusive ending index n the step size

20278178

20278215
width	height
...where the 1.28 value is the ratio between the width and height of my image height divided by width

20278215
width	height
so image gets added to the webview view gets laid out then this code kicks in and shrinks the width until it s small enough to fit in the available height using the appropriate ratio

20278675
bimap	hashmap
consider using a guava bimap instead of a hashmap

20278745
versioning	upgrade
first off i recommend you upgrade to a newer versioning of the plugin - i can tell its not the latest because the groupid should be org.eclipse.jetty not org.mortbay.jetty

20278867

selenium	appium
this is possible in selenium webdriver but doesn t seem to be working for me in appium

20286278

google-chrome	firefox
the problem is that your if statement says that the browser needs to equal firefox or the string google-chrome must be truthy

20287237
google-chrome	firefox
there is also a second issue - browser.name will never be firefox or google-chrome

20287237
google-chrome	firefox
you need to be matching browser.name against the respective symbols - firefox and google-chrome

20288022
children	parent
i m emulating the way of owl for creating child controls in the mfc when a user create an instance of control class in the constructor then there is no need to go to the dodataexchange to call the ddx_control that is done in the base dialog it iterates over a list of children to call this for them and after the window had got a handle then we will call it s setupwindow method it is like the onload on the .net c# also a nice thing is that i check first to see if the parent has an item with that id using getdlgitem if there is a control on the dialog with this item then it is a resource control and need ddx_control else if it wasn t on the dialog then it is a dynamic control and i call createwindowex with it s previously saved attributes in attr member

20288036
hide	show
so pretty much i have two counters every 10 seconds the div is displayed and the rest are hidden now it does swap but the two div ids with title beside them i cant get them to swap along with there respective counters so say for example â 0000 budget1 displays for 10 seconds then swaps to â 11111 budget2 and it should run in a loop so far the 4 divs listed keep swapping one by one every setinterval but i need to show and hide 2 divs at a time rather than one by one

20288045
google-chrome	safari
i use google-chrome devtools constantly but safari is new to me

20288059
equals	gethashcode
when you override equals and gethashcode you are changing the way the object will determine if it is equals to another

20288061
equals	gethashcode
you should implement the interface and its equals and gethashcode methods

20288061
dictionary	map
your calculation of a hash should not depend on opc or type properties though the hashcode of an object must remain the same while it s being stored in a hash map dictionary

20288216

width	margin
the sidebar overlaps with main content is because the element .logo has fixed width 150px and fixed left right margin both 40px so the the whole width of the .logo element is 230px which is larger than width of #sidebar element when the page is narrow enough so #sidebar element is expanded

20289918
move	drag
i know there are blue arrows with lines connecting them that you can drag to adjust but they won t move up any more

20289933

20290356
int	double
if by int you mean int then all possible int values fit into a double since int is defined to be a 32-bit signed int quantity and a double has a mantissa size of 53 bits into which an int value fits comfortably

public	protected
the only thing i m not sure is whether your person.name and person.age field can be left as protected or should be promoted to public

int	chars
since you know that there is always 48 chars before the part of int and dots you can use this pattern too

20292555
int	chars
the idea is to read the file line by line and since the length before the content is always the same 16 3 chars - 48 chars extract the substring with the int and concatenate it into the temporary variable

when the user wishes to hide the textblock i would like to have the listbox show only the stackpanel items as uniform squares for the images hopefully that made sense

20292781
post	get
i ve tried doing this with redirects but that doesn t work since they force a get request and the post data is lost in the process

20292783
for-loop	loops
i could then do a loops count when building the form pass the count as a hidden field and then use a for-loop where x count and do my insert that way

20292794

20292829
free	malloc
if you do a malloc inside function you can then use the string print it or do whatever you want at the and of the program you call free

20292856
put	get	post	get	post	put
every get call fails with a 404 even though the put and post calls on the same resources work correctly

20292856
post	put
not shown in this example are the put and post calls which work correctly so i m confident the route definitions are working

20292864
serializable	deserialization
but the following small hack works fine - you could specify serializable and deserialization functions separately not using default template and -operator

factors	matrix
tmpl1 correlation off-diagonal elements of variance-covariance matrix off-diagonal elements of the cholesky factors of the correlation matrix

20293101
for-loop	arrays
see your for-loop doesn t work as you expected you re looping through the arrays and when the condition matches you re splicing the element on that index but the for-loop goes on incrementing so only the next index is checked but the splice method has reduced the arrays by one index so that a element is now in the index that you already looped over

20293123
portrait	landscape
you can use reflection to force the tabs to appear on two-lines in both portrait and landscape mode

20293125
getter	setter
in my task class i have a private variable of type long called id as well as a setter and getter for that variable

20293159

move all files folder from public assets directory one level higher so for an instance instead public assets bootstrap it should be public bootstrap

20293369
debian	linux
i download an image from the web under linux debian without problems using the code snippet below

20293402
post	get
should i create varibles within the function to get all the post data and take it from there or should i pass those in the actual function as parameters

20293424
children	parent
also the second and subsequent children cannot write to the parent because the parent has closed the write end of the pipe

20293499

20293683
awt	swing
take a look at performing custom painting and painting in awt and swing for more details

20293699
cout	cin
the stream std cout is tied to std cin by default the stream pointed to by stream.tie is flushed prior to every properly implement input operation

20293699
cout	cin
unless you changed the stream tied to std cin there is no need to flush std cout before using std cin as it will be done implicitly

20293719
lxml	beautifulsoup
edit replacing soup beautifulsoup url with and importing the lxml library resolved the issue

20293728

devise	cancan
i m not using devise cancan or anything else at this point as this is the only functionality i need right now.

20293885
listview	gridview
a good option to replace the gallery is a viewpager works as a listview or gridview you have to made your own adapter that extends pageradater and a layout item

20293936
std	ostream
assuming you want to leverage the output operators provide by std ostream you should not try to overload the output operator

20293936
std	ostream
your logger would then derive from std ostream and initialize its base class to use your custom stream buffer

20293954
prepare	execute
the reason you re not seeing the data is you prepare the statement but never execute it

20293989
uiview	subviews
i have created a class of type uiview and added it as the custom class for the subviews

20294010
std	ostream
one option is to make your logger be an std ostream inheritance and then things would kind of work out of the box

20294010
std	ostream
the alternative is to maintain a logger that is unrelated no inheritance to std ostream but then you need to provide for any and all types t you want to log

20294010
ostringstream	std
well if you start down this path it might make more sense not to create the std ostringstream in each function but create a single one as a member then dump all data into that stream and use some manipulator to extract the string and write it for example on std flush or std ends ...

20294013
folder	directory
but i need to be able to commit and download the project the project in question is linked too in the above link and see that the folder aisisajax is not a reference to a github repo and that it is jus a regular directory of files that i can traverse through

20294070
google-chrome	safari
only way the mobile version of google-chrome and safari would get me latitude and longitude was to call the function in body onload

20294076

in theory the container should be 60 the width of the page and the height must match that

20294076
width	height
the question how do i maintain the same width and height on a responsive page

google-chrome	firefox
so the problem is the following.in the firefox it works fine but in webkit browsers for instance google-chrome there is some issue which i cannot understand

20294377
width	height
this may not be the optimal way but here is an example using jquery to set the width to the height of the div on window resize

20294421
maven	pom.xml
the problem only started occuring after i wrote a pom.xml for the project so i m assuming it has something to do with maven

20294480
min	max
sql show average and min max within standard deviations

20294508
google-chrome	firefox
you can probably use propertychanged on ie but domattrmodified should work on google-chrome firefox etc

20294527
epl	zpl
while you could hypothetically send the raw zpl epl commands to the printer device you might be better off not doing that if you don t already know zpl epl and if you can already generate images in your environment

20294527
portrait	landscape
set up the printer in cups then shell out to usr bin lp with the -d flag set to the printer name and a value to set the dpi of the printer and possibly other things to force alignment or portrait landscape mode

20294527
epl	zpl
you should probably only do it that way if you are comfortable and familiar with epl or zpl

20294529
post	get
this of course does not work well for post requests so you get the formdataroutingredirect exception

20294585
google-chrome	safari
initially i tried it on an ipad using safari or google-chrome

20294585
onkeyup	onkeydown
i have tried onkeydown onkeyup and onkeypress - all exhibit the same behavior

20294642
folder	directory
i have saved many files in a folder in the documents directory

to find min and max

20294741
min	max
loop through the array and compare current element with min and max and set them appropriately

20294776
getter	setter
â getter and setter for both the name and distance instance variables

20294788
int	double
dx and dy are int s but your format specifier f requires a double or a float

20294805
google-chrome	firefox
this isn t really a solution but a workaround that eliminated the problem for me was switching from using a google-chrome driver to the firefox one

20294867
button	checkbox
i have a disabled button which is enabled after checking i accept terms and conditions checkbox

20294928

20294984
awt	swing
painting in awt and swing

20295003

20295021
children	parent
you can control how child poms inherit configuration from parent poms by adding attributes to the children of the configuration element

20295021
maven	pom.xml
use these attributes in a child pom.xml to control how maven combines plugin configuration from the parent with the explicit configuration in the child.

20295032
width	height
when the button is disabled the div has the width and height of the button so clicking the button triggers the div

20295032
width	height
when the button is enabled the div is shrunk to 0 width 0 height so the click event registers with the button instead of the div

20295079
pthreads	fork
pthreads says that some functions that fail will set errno and fork is one of those functions but does not say that functions that succeed will not set errno

in wordpress i ve put postcards from... in the title of the post

20295295
width	height
in bullet in addition to x y width height speed you also need to store the direction this particular bullet is going

20295310
post	get
one thing that might help is making your filter form use a get method instead of post

20295310
post	get
browsers usually prevent post input from being automatically resubmitted which is something they don t do when get input is used

20295342
sqlcommandbuilder	sqldataadapter	oledbcommand	sqlcommand
so you need to change all the classes sqlcommand sqlcommandbuilder sqldataadapter sqlconnectionstringbuilder with the corresponding classes oledbcommand oledbcommandbuilder oledbdataadapter oledbconnectionstringbuilder

when i remove the script part from the query all together the sorting and filtering works just fine

i am going to try the only thing i haven t tried yet and that was a post from someone to get the latest opensll and regen the keys.

20295411
insertion-sort	bubble-sort
as someone suggested here i could have a define or a function to access each value using a 1-d index and employ a insertion-sort or a bubble-sort

20295423
children	parent
if you re looking for a container to be hovered as opposed to a sibling you can use the children selectors and apply the hover to the parent

20295424

show hide it and it will layer over the rows before it due to simple child order

i haven t looked into changing ie or google-chrome but here s what i found for firefox

put	get
just put all required parameters into params as an array youâ ll get it as a key of argv which is an array too and here you are

20295516
hash	md5
however the password for the main account is hash in md5

20295524
hide	show
you simply connect the currentindexchanged int index signal of your qcomboxbox to a slot in your class and hide show the qlineedit s depending on the the value of index

20295534
min	max
i see that the other posts have already answered how to calculate average min and max in an array so i will only be tackling the error with your code

20295534
min	max
in the last part of your code where the errors arise you have confused count min and max as arrays whereas they are actually just integers

20295542
ssdp	upnp
239.255.255.250 1900 crlf st upnp rootdevice crlf man ssdp discover crlf mx 10 crlf crlf

20295620
min	max
the inner query for allitems does both a min and max of the last update on a per-item number sku basis although i believe they would be one-in-the-same record

20295620
min	max
so now join that results back to the history data by item sku and only those that match either the min or max date

20295620
minimum	max	min	max
so since there would be 2 possible records one for the min one for the max i am applying a max iif for each respective matching the minimum and maximum dates respectively and must retain the group by clause

20295620
min	max
if your history table has an auto-incrementing id column and the respective transactions have the lastupdate sequentially stamped such as when they are added and not modified by any other operation then you could just apply similar but min max of the id column then join back twice on the id and just each row once such as.

20295648
for-loop	arrays
because your arrays length is always 5000 i had to use the second for-loop to calculate the minimum number

20295653
width	height
it would make sense to me if the text size i set to it is higher than the screen height in landscape mode this is actually screen width - 1080 but this isn t the case

i m new to lighttpd and i m having problems with the .htaccess i know that it s not the same as apache and you have to do the changes in lighttpd.conf so i m trying to do my rewrite rules but they are not working for some reason.

20295690
apache	lighttpd
this is my .htaccess file in apache and i would like if you can convert it for lighttpd so it works on my server for index.php to open as index i tried but it wasn t working so please if you can convert at least the following and if you have time for the other ones convert them as well

20295692
superclass	subclassing
the objects themselves are still a subclassing but when you get them out of the collection it only knows about the superclass so it can t tell you which is which it has to pick the common denominator

20295699
post	get
this post really helped me to finally get what i want

20295746
superclass	subclassing
when you have some arraylist and you fill it with things that extend superclass you have to check instanceof and cast to get to the methods specific to those subclassing

20295831
puts	gets
so the action routine that fires when the button or the enter key is clicked pressed goes and gets those values as they are at that time and puts them into variables or writes them to a database or instantiates another object with them or whatever it is supposed to do

20295831
pop-up	dialog
this routine also might do validation -- if for instance one of the text fields holds a value that is required and the user didn t fill it out then this listener routine could detect that and instead of allowing the program to continue could pop-up a message dialog for the user telling him her what is wrong

20295832
locationmanager	clgeocoder	cllocationmanager	clgeocoder
you basically need to get the current location using the cllocationmanager then use a clgeocoder to get the address from the location you retrieved with the locationmanager

20295832
mkplacemark	clgeocoder
the clgeocoder gets you a clplacemark that you can make into a mkplacemark

int	double
i d prefer that i would be able to pass through each row and assign the data int strings double to variables of the object in a specific element of the arraylist then as i went on to the next row begin entering the associated data into a new element of the list

20296150
width	height
also is there a more accurate way to get the spirte size x and y dimensions besides dividing the width and height by the number of columns and rows respectively

20296174
division	addition
using simple addition and division of the center of your circle.getcenter and radius you can quickly find south-west and north-east coordinates and make latlongbounds object that you can use to find wither user location is within the circle using latlongbounder.contains userlocation

20297598
free	malloc
heap memory lives from when you malloc it to when you free it

hash	md5
it looks like you will need to rethink your entire approach to whatever it is you are actually trying to accomplish because what you appear to be attempting to do is fundamentally impossible due to the nature of md5 or any cryptographic hash function

20298066
salt	md5
of course the fact that there s a salt in here somewhere suggests that the password may not even be what s represented in the md5 value you think is the password

20298066
salt	md5
the point of a salt is that you store an md5 of thing you want to secure + salt so that if you have a security breach then the thing you stored isn t easily looked up in a table like the one this site has

20298066
salt	md5
passwords stored as md5 without a salt are much more easily cracked

i captured beacon file in linux ubuntu c monitor mode by using libpcap filter like below

20302725

this is not thread-safe because even though it has a memory barrier and reads atomically and writes atomically it is not guaranteed that you won t get a thread switch in the middle and processors registers are local to a cpu core think of them as like local variables inside the cpu core

20302779
implements	extends
you can either implements this or you extends from the defaulttablemodel

now i m trying to making post requests but i m running into the same issue i did with the get s

20303195

20303208
int	chars
i and j are both two digit int before this runs and chars has been assigned a value if it was found in either of them when they re parsed to strings

20304284
erlang	elixir
there isn t a mechanism today for you to inline erlang in elixir

20304284
erlang	elixir
if you think about it even simple list comprehensions would get tricky rather quickly because a variable in elixir follows different casing conventions than erlang

20304284
erlang	elixir
i agree some mechanisms in elixir are slightly more verbose than erlang function definitions being my personal pet peeve and vice-versa

20304318
put	get
but i donâ t get where to put link it

20304384
inherited	properties
the reason removing inherited breaks your code is there is no context for accessing the private members you don t have an instance of testwidget with which to access the instance properties members

20304392
for-loop	loops
so essentially your for-loop is only working up the first half of loops

20304461

20304572
packets	pcap
first if you re writing to a pcap file which i m assuming you re doing as you mentioned pcap_dump do not use the pcap_t you got when you opened the wi-fi adapter as the argument to pcap_dump_open as you will not be writing packets with radiotap headers to the pcap file and passing the pcap_t you got when you opened the wi-fi adapter as the argument to pcap_dump_open will mean that the file s link-layer header type will be dlt_ieee802_11_radio which means the file will be interpreted by other programs as having packets with radiotap headers

20304572
x86	64bit
note that it s little-endian not big-endian so you don t need to byte-swap it on little-endian processors such as 32-bit and 64bit x86 processors and you do need to byte-swap it on big-endian processors such as powerpc when running linux

20304591
scheme	racket

ps -- i m really only interested in firefox google-chrome

20305022
put	get
if you are continuously querying for timestampss to get the latest unhandled records you can just store your timestamp in the hbase timestamp each put can also include a timestamp and then add that to the scan it accepts start end timestamps in addition to the key - this would work quite fast for latest data as it is likely it is still in the memstores

20305043
post	get
in other words you can t get your app to post a notification in the top right corner where the globe is

think if the server had to push updates to each and every client when ready how would the server know that client is still online or client has enough bandwidth to receive data or the client is not busy and many other concerns

20305573
google-chrome	firefox
even if you monitor you network activity in google-chrome browser or firefox you ll see that facebook actively dispatches ajax request and brings back online offline statues of your friends chat message feed entries etc

subtract	add
the problem arises when i try to either add one or subtract one i get the traceback

20306091
switching	screens
what i liked about this approach is that because the application uses an actionbar it stays intact and does not move with the screens switching animation which is what happens with activity switching

post	get
to get the array output that you re looking for post an array

20306107
setinterval	settimeout
if you want an operation to keep running while the tab is out of focus use settimeout or setinterval

i think a subclassing also inherited the superclass s constraints

20306155
post	get
you can use bodyparser method to get the data from a post request

20306187
integer	unsigned
as luu vinh phuc suggested you can use the read int syscall to get an unsigned 16-bit integer

20306187
integer	unsigned
the syscall will actually read in a 32-bit signed integer but for the entire range of 16-bit unsigned integers the low 16 bits will be the same

20306187
integer	unsigned
this will leave you with an unsigned 16 bit integer in register v0

20306205

i know about storing passwords as salt hash and i know it is even safe enough for linux

20306391
objectoutputstream	printwriter
i assume your out object which is a printwriter wraps the outobject object which is the objectoutputstream

children	parent
i am doing this for 10m+ parent items that on average have 15-20 children items with a 0 100 range

20307075
nsurl	nsstring
your self.imgurlstring is actually already an nsurl not an nsstring

20307075
nsurl	nsstring
you are assigning the asset url an nsurl to your nsstring property

20307114

any time you push to remote from the clone the primary repo pull from the hub repo and updates the site

20307281
folder	directory
i ve tried creating a symbolic link from the flask-app.git build folder to another directory outside the project but it inherits the git metadata from flask-app.git

20307310
getter	setter
i also added getter and setter methods for cats and dogs along with a method for populating cats and dogs as subsets of pets as follows

20307335
subclass	abstract-class
in each subclass of my abstract-class i want to create a custom getter for this property to instantiate the fetchedresultscontroller lazily and initialise the fetch request etc

20307335
ivar	subclassing
to every single subclassing to have an ivar to make the getter

20307351
width	height
if you want the origin to be the center of your screen that is an object that is right on top of the camera should appear in the center of your screen you must add half the width and half the height of your screen to your final screen coords

20307382
post	get
i wrote a blog post myself on how to get started with kartograph

20307389
division	subtraction
in the query below the where condition impose the ids to be equal so the result of division is always 1 result of subtraction is 0 and finally result of sum is id 2 none of which would be float

20307390
ivar	subclassing
now there is no need for the subclassing to access the private ivar of the parent class

20307390
super	self
if your subclass also overrides the setter you may want to call self instead of super on the call to setfetchedresultscontroller

20307424
hide	show
to show something it has to be hidden so you have to hide your text div

20307431
google-chrome	firefox
on google-chrome it follows you while in firefox it makes all the boxes follow you which doesn t let you scroll down the page

20307431
google-chrome	firefox
if you test on firefox all the boxes goes down 10 px while in google-chrome only the assigned box hi goes down

20307495
oncreate	setcontentview
you have to call requestwindowfeature before the setcontentview in the activity s oncreate method

20307499
for-loop	arrays
you need a for-loop to iterate over the arrays and then use d to print out the integers

20307519
quicksort	clrs
however this is guaranteed to take twice the space although i would say it better fits the mental model of the mistaken coder here and in general is easier to figure out than a really intricate algorithm that wastes no space at all see the clrs illustration of quicksort

20307557
width	height
i found out that i could in fact just use the original effect s projection 0 0 width height and set the effect s world matrix to correspond the camera s projection matrix and everything started magically working

20307558
put	get
if you assume that you gona get data bigger than buffer therefore you put read into while condition you need to define timeout select etc for read or define special symbol r n r n for example to determine this is end of the data

20307573
min	max
also if you want to do aggregation min max avg select queries will be much easier

20307580
ivar	subclassing
as other answers have said your subclassing cannot access the private ivar of their parent and you should be thankful for that

20307664
getter	setter
to access these objects you would normally create getter and setter

20307699
put	get
then you can just use the put get and remove methods

debian	linux
linux kernel is from linux-source package that comes with debian 7.2 stable which is at version 3.2+46

20307744

in this case we can replace with fabsf fabs abs for float double int at least but let s assume there isn t always a good built-in replacement and the macro will stay a macro

20307760
base	fractions
the d of the d format stands for decimal as in base 10 not as in number with a fractions part

20307761
persistent	transient
you should consider your activity as fairly transient it can and will be destroyed and recreated frequently whereas a cache can persistent

20307861
nullpointerexception	indexoutofboundsexception
it still crashes because you re trying to catch an indexoutofboundsexception meanwhile the nullpointerexception is not a subclass of it

20307885
ubuntu	linux
what i am hoping for is a simple command line or makefile example that would allow me to cross-compile on my ubuntu system and create an executable that will run in a linux shell on the pandaboard linaro android build 13.04

20307933
express	node.js
i ve ensured i have the latest versions of node.js socket.io and express installed on my server

when i drag and drop either of the two obviously they will move to the same coordinate

20308113

20308116
x86	64bit
i know that i am using a 64bit computer when i go to program files x86 though i do not see a java folder

20308160
margin	height
i belive it is something to do with the css offsets margin padding as the css element height does not include those but have still had no luck

20308175
multiplying	add
add all the elements and multiplying them by 2.54

20308197
x86	64bit
64bit java isn t in program files x86 because program files x86 is for 32 bit programs

20308200
jar	.war
it is packaged in a jar file with other ejbs outside of any .war

20308245
crypt	hash
lets assume your client and your server share a secret your writing it so they can though being software it wont be very secret. lets also assume you have ahandy crypt or hashing library for things like a sha-1 hash then

20308263
post	get
an alternative is that you can implement the rest web service as a regular servlet which serves requests through its standard get post methods then it can be deployed in a war

20308335
post	get
if the request is sent to http it is redirected to https and in the process the post becomes a get hence the error message

20308338
spaces	delimiter
in this case i used one or more spaces as a delimiter s+

20308435
children	parent
so pretty much this will get the parent and iterate all the children and assign each 1 to the flat array

20308463
aggregate-functions	sum
if you want to keep it in detail using sql is a challenge you can t use the aggregate-functions sum and also update values

20308498
range	max
you just need to iterate from 1 to max and you can do that directly with the range created by 1..max

20308498

20313986
transfuse	dagger
here s some little differences in the di engine in transfuse and dagger

20313986
transfuse	dagger
transfuse supports as well as it can cyclic dependencies dagger purposefully throws an exception in this case

20313986
transfuse	dagger
transfuse satisfies jsr330 dagger specifically does not

20313986
transfuse	dagger
singletons in dagger are per-object-graph where singletons in transfuse are global to the application

20313986
transfuse	dagger
the big difference between dagger and transfuse is that dagger focused on being a simple dependency injection library while transfuse s focus is to make android a better api using performance sensitive techniques

20317267
addition	multiplication
hence string multiplication wouldn t be distributive over integer addition unless is the identity value of string addition

20317267
addition	multiplication
of course there s no requirement that just because we call two operators multiplication and addition then they must be distributive

20317315
udp	mtu
the largest payload i can reliably send is 506 bytes 576 mtu - 60 ip header - 8 udp header

20317490
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
if you are changing width height padding or margin of a relatively positioned block element you are basically changing the properties of the box which will inevitably result in repositioning of other elements in the flow

20317554
scrollable	panels
normally a component is set as a scroll panels view when you want to provide scrollable support for example instead of.

20317561
division	multiplication
note that division by a constant is actually pretty efficient since it is typically implemented by a fast multiplication rather than a dynamic division.

20317582
stdout	stderr
when you use runtime.getruntime .exec you have to read from the stdout stderr streams anyway since otherwise the other program could hang

20317582
stdout	stderr
as you want to do this synchronously you just need to join the 2 threads you are going to create to read from stdout and stderr

20317582
stdout	stderr
actually it might be even easier to just redirect stderr to stdout then you wouldn t need multiple threads at all and you could just read from the process stdout in the current thread

20317598
min	max
i have a code that needs user input of 3 floating numbers and calculate the sum multiplication min max and average

20317621
post	get

20317921
int	chars
one is an int and the other is inside a chars array

20317923

the issue i am running into is on ios using safari or google-chrome when i scroll the animation only happens after the finger is released making an ugly user experience

20318012
feof	fgetc
the very final fgetc file reads eof then your code writes a byte for it into the new file and only then it tests for feof in the while

20318047
width	height
for example if the x position is 10 and y is 10 but height and width is only 10 10 you are painting at position 10x10 which would be beyond the viewable space of the component instead you should try something like.

20318057
width	height
you can t set width and height for body

20318076
width	height
then you can easily convert coordinates into percentages of the image height width

20318076
width	height
the image width is 1000px and the image height is 1000px

20318232
google-chrome	firefox

20318242
mouse	keyboard
to form the seed for the random number generator a calling application supplies bits it might haveâ for instance mouse or keyboard timing inputâ that are then combined with both the stored seed and various system data and user data such as the process id and thread id the system clock the system time the system counter memory status free disk clusters the hashed user environment block

20318245
portrait	landscape
everything works completely fine when the app starts in portrait and switches to landscape

20318245
portrait	landscape
when the app starts in landscape however and then switches to portrait i lose response only on the bottom quarter of the screen

20318245

i ve gotten that similar problem before when i setup the tab view controller away in viewdidload as opposed to viewdidappear

20318248
post	get
whenever i try a post and attempt to get a response i get a 401 unauthorized access exception

20318258
int	chars
thus when matlab gets to the statement sym c it first converts the chars c to its ascii int representation this just happens to be the number 67 then it tries to calculate sym 67 which is impossible as sym only has 2 elements

20318287

shadowing	named
instance variable named except in the constructor as you can end up shadowing the field meaning you have to access the field as this.name and the variable as named

20318486
gif	png
for photographs you are mostly better of using jpegs for text or other images that need to be lossless use png or gif

20318486
width	height
if the image is placed using an img tag the make sure to set the width and the height of the image in the css or using the img width and height attributes

20318496
inherited	subclassing
the annotation xmlrootelement is however not declared as inherited such that this annotation will not be present for this proxy subclassing even though it is for genericobject

to run the code below requires the packages rcurl and rjsonio to be loaded

20318578
google-chrome	firefox
the following code is used to open dynamic content in an iframe and it functions correctly in google-chrome and firefox

20318585
free	malloc
the painful part about this is that c doesn t have dynamic arrays so you must emulate that malloc free unless you know the maximum length of your lines and their maximum number beforehand

20318605
sbt-assembly	sbt-buildinfo
for sbt-buildinfo i ve opted to use just use a val prefix approach for the sake of simplicity but for any other plugins i ve gone for use a nested object approach including sbt-assembly

20318605

20318690
superclass	subclassing
chuchu and link are subclassing of the same superclass

20318714
folder	directory
you need the full path to the directory in the file system to your wp-content folder

mouse	keyboard
functions that generate random numbers usually make a call to the system kernel which gets random numbers from physical sources of entropy the network keyboard mouse etc.

20318748
subtraction	add
my objective is read in the double carry out a subtraction on it and then redisplay it back to the user once the submit buttons pressed...action listener is working fine and to make it look more simple i didn t add it in...if it helps i can add it

20318780
portrait	landscape
in fact when you start your app in landscape mode it should starts in portrait and then your viewcontroller need to rotate this

20318788
idictionary	ilist
use ilist iset idictionary

20318807
background-image	background-color
i think i would use a background-image in the header row that is overwritten by a background-color of the text

20318821
getchar	getline
replace getchar with getline digittoint with read and with show i

20318853
joystick	keyboard
the value will be in the range -1...1 for keyboard and joystick input

20318892
superclass	subclassing
it creates a subclassing object with a superclass variable pointing to it

20318892
superclass	subclassing
the variable does not change it is still the variable of the superclass but it is pointing to the object of subclassing

20318892
superclass	subclassing
so you can create an object of subclassing and point it to a superclass refrence but you cannot ask the superclass reference to do all the functions of a subclassing object in our example machine1.snap wont compile

20319014
folder	directory
if you create a folder called images or whatever name you prefer in your source directory and then place the banner.png file in that folder you can then use the following code

20319052
rss	feed
the client sees news as soon as the first rss feed returns

20319052
rss	feed
you don t have to edit update any code when you add new rss news feed

20319073
pbkdf2	salt	scrypt	salt	scrypt	pbkdf2
so you are much better off using a pbkdf such as pbkdf2 bcrypt or scrypt with a high iteration count and at least 64 bits of random salt

20319115
division	modulo
well you could do the division and modulo operations separately

20319141
post	put
well i know this is an old post but i ve found that some people are still going to view it so i wanted to put a easy way to allow both email and username on the same input

20319176
google-chrome	firefox
i need this to work in google-chrome and firefox

20319198
ready	each
then you could have each client run some code when they receive their ready message to let the server know that they re synced

20319226
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
this only happens using google-chrome or safari it does not seem to happen in firefox

20319233
width	height
to revert the map back to its original width and height you could first check if the width and height are set to 100 then resize but a more elegant solution would be to use a class instead of inline styles which could resemble the following

20319271
postgresql	mysql
things work differently in postgresql than mysql

20319376
portrait	landscape
the real find was that it goes through onresume and onwindowfocuschanged twice - once for the portrait mode then for the landscape mode

20319407
equals	gethashcode
provide your own gethashcode and equals methods for the type

20319433
width	height
or if you can live with it just set the width and height explicitly

20319453
rsa	aes
you typically generate a random number and use that as key to encrypt the file using a block cipher like aes then encrypt the key a single number with rsa

20319453
int	chars
however you can also use rsa to encrypt small sequences of chars by treating the entire sequence as a large binary number for example 4 8-bit chars as a single 32 bit int

20319471
integer	fractions
my problem is that i cant understand how to store the whole number part of each value in the amounts array in the corresponding element of dollars and the fractions part of the amount as a two-digit integer in cents like if i input 2.75 - store 2 in dollars array and 75 in cents array .any suggestions on how to do this would be appreciated

20319489
super	implements
i need to implements a universal c function which will invoke super s implementation and return the value

20319489
super	implements
i implements a c function as following but i don t know how to invoke the super s implementation with the variable argument list

20319547

20319578
lsp	principles
a good design will also bear the lsp liskov substitution principles in mind

20319578
width	height
it s a rectangle whose width and height are always the same value

20319578
lsp	principles
the lsp is one of the five solid principles - i recommend reading more about the other 4

20319588
width	height
these values are 1 width and 1 height of the target image respectively

20319623
folder	directory
for your problem you can use this filenamefilter updated andrew pointed out the directory name structure for dcim folder

20319684
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
and this seems to work fine in safari but in ie and firefox if option3 is already selected as soon as you click on the select element to open the options you are redirected to the redirect page and in google-chrome it does not appear to work at all

20319712
ubuntu	linux
i know how to install ubuntu or linux but i want to know how to install unix and where i get installing programs from

20319744
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade to 3.3 versioning and now its working

20319767
put	get
add the to your form element to get the button and field onto the same line and i guess you could us a to make the message appear below it though i would probably set up the input group in a row with columns to center it rather than the align tag you are using and then put the messages into a new below it in the same column

20319772
for-loop	loops
inside of the for-loop in feddy.php have it return a completed value to index.php so it doesn t return until loops is done

20319804
super	self
so if you tap on the top-left corner of your subview the locationinview self you get back will be 0 0 and setting that to be your subview s center will position it in the top left of the super view

20319940
children	parent
your other big problem is you need to keep in mind that children get a separate address space than the parent

20319940
children	parent
it is not only a good practice but keeps your parent from exiting before all the children do

20319940
children	parent
which is ok but the use of getppid in the printf shows us that the parent is ending before some of the children and they are getting inherited by the init process pid 1 after becoming orphaned

20319940
children	parent
we need to prevent the race condition where the parent ends before the children and prevent making the children zombies

20319942
gif	png
i m wanted to do something like web page that only allowed user to view only jpeg png and gif file types from imagepickercontroller

20319946
int	chars
int chars float etc

20319963
rss	feed
i currently have a rss feed loading into a navigation controller but i just recently added images onto the cells i am using nsdata to store the image data but it is very laggy so this means i need a better way to store that data

20319972
hide	show
edit since you don t want the user to see them loading you could hide the element using or show a loading panel in the mean time

20319980
many-to-one	one-to-many
i m running into a problem to persist association one-to-many many-to-one

20319995
codeigniter	kohana
codeigniter kohana style systems feature dumb views which take variables from the controller action and do a simple template replacement on them

20319995
post	get
the idea here is irrespective of what happens in the controller action the mage_adminhtml_block_catalog_product_attribute_set_main_formset block will always grab the latest eav entity_attribute_set model information when it renders accessing the request object to get the request post data as you mentioned above

20319995
getter	setter
this combined with the power of magic getter and setter lets you do something like this

20320043
comparator	comparable
do not modify comparator to allow a null argument as others have suggested because the contract of comparable dictates that your implementation should throw nullpointerexception

20320083
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
it may be important to note that navigation is a standalone uinavigationbar i did not use a uinavigationcontroller for this

20320098
mouse	keyboard
this happens even when i don t cause any sdl_events to be fired via keyboard mouse etc

20320163
pbkdf2	salt	pbkdf2	hash	hash	salt
the simplest way to come up with a more secure password hash is to generate a salt for the database and then come up with an implementation of pbkdf2 using the php manual page for it

20320221
pascal	delphi
you can find documentation for the specifier in system.write - it s delphi documentation but delphi had its roots long ago in turbo pascal and write writeln are legacy pascal functions and haven t changed

20320231
soa	osb
i could not understand what value add does an http server bring to a soa or osb setup as we do not host a website which would have some static content like images html pages etc

20320273
for-loop	arrays
in case you actively zeroed the rest of the arrays in a for-loop or by memset for example or if you declared it as global variable which are guaranteed to be zeroed by the compiler you can do something similar to what you were trying to do

20320273
int	chars
coincidentally thanks to some implicit conversions chars to int you should also be able to compare it to int so

20320295
google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	webkit	blink
at the time of this writing only webkit and blink google-chrome ium opera safari et all are capable of the css filter sorcery you seek

have tried different versions of compiler gcc-4.1 gcc-4.7 with without -m32 x86 and different versions of libcrypto libssl 32 and 64bit in x86

20320484
width	height
now what i want is when animation begins again and again it should decrease the size of the element suppose the default size is 200 pixels width and 200 pixels height so the decreasing vlaue equals minus 10 pixels and when the animated element becomes 0 pixels width and height it should again increase the size of that element so the increasing value equals plus 10 pixels

20320486
width	height
this prevents all stretching and simply places a black bar on the right hand side when the width is greater than height

20320555
.htaccess	httpd.conf
you can use a custom error document by adding the appropriate directives to httpd.conf or .htaccess

20320571

20320627
put	get
when i write it gives me the last number of the b list and accordingly when i put it gives me the first element sorry if this seems obvious i m trying to explain in detail what i am trying to do and what i understand of the code so i can get better help

20320633
width	height
preserving the height and width of the images

20320689
free	calloc	free	malloc	calloc	malloc
keep in mind that you should not mix memory management functions from c malloc calloc free with c++ memory management new delete

20320689
free	malloc
this is bound to cause problems later since you may mix them up at some point and free memory that was allocated with new or use delete on memory that was allocated with malloc etc

20321125
hide	show
on clicking the button the button hide and then the form is show in that order e.g

20321125
hide	show
i have also tried putting the form showing function inside the return function so that the show function only loads after the hide function has complete - but this has no effect

google-chrome	firefox
you can not use the home page to open multiple windows in google-chrome as in firefox firefox can open multiple homepages

20321282
lodash	underscore.js
using underscore.js lodash you can do something like this where newarr is the data from your db query

20321282
lodash	underscore.js
the solution from charliefl is approximately 100x faster than underscore.js depending on browser in this case and lodash being up to 2x faster than underscore.js

20321282
lodash	underscore.js
here s a jsperf comparing underscore.js lodash and the purely js solutions

20321282
lodash	underscore.js
i kept this as a purely lodash underscore.js solution just to show one endpoint and compare performance results with charlie s pure js solution

20321404
firefox	safari
actually it focused in firefox without border using tab key but not in safari

20321433
width	height
assuming that the screen has constant width ws and height hs l strictly corresponds with fov field of view

20321454
width	height
to support browsers where vh is not available you can use javascript to calculate the height and width and update the style accordingly

20321458
range	max	range	min	min	max
since y1 s range is automatically adjusted by zoom if there is a way to get y1 s current range i can get its min and max and set y2 s range based on them

in other words i need way to declare a variable so that it contains the profs hash and can be compared by strcmp or memcmp i m not picky to the output i get from gcry_md_hash_buffer

20322116
onresume	onpause
you need to make your class a subclass of activity class so that you can get the onpause and onresume of the activity class

20322116
onresume	onpause
currently your class is a subclass of object class which does not have onresume and onpause method this is why when you are calling super.onpause and super.onresume you are getting the exception

20322187
int	double
i had prepared two sample code for showing thread having int variable calculation is faster than thread having double variable

20322187

serializable	deserialization
basically an object cannot survive a round trip through the serializable deserialization process because although the writejson method will be called for the converter when serializeobject is called when you subsequently pass the json string to deserializeobject it fails to call the converter s readjson method and instead constructs an new instance and uses the basic member population routines

20324519
pkcs#5	cryptojs
regarding the padding itâ s more tricky as cryptojs does not list pkcs#5 as supported and java does not list pkcs7 in fact it lists very little so it might be implementation depended which padding algorithms the aes provider supports but at least nopadding is supported by both java and cryptojs

20324522

20325695
hash	md5
since you are sending the username and the encrypted username which is username + aes username + md5 hash password

20325752
for-loop	arrays
since you have a static arrays there s no need for a for-loop

20326367
memcmp	strcmp
first you should use memcmp which assumes fixed-sized array instead of strcmp which assumes zero-terminated strings since your hash may contain zeros

20326367
hash	md5
second i don t know where answerstring comes from but if you re doing a brute force search you re not sure to recover the original string just a string which has the same md5 hash

20326367
printf	strlen
that means that every function accepting a string such as printf or strlen excepts its input to be terminated by a 0

getter	setter
the bean for the detail view has the params defined with getter and setter and the page has the f viewparam defined too

20326794
put	get
when you use asynchronous socket io operation the asynchronous read write operation returns immediately since the asynchronous operation does not guaranty dealing all the data ie put all the required data to tcp socket buffer or get all the required data from it successfully with one invocation the partial data must outlive through mutiple operations

20326864
getter	setter
this will create the correct getter setter for the property in your example the property is readonly so only a getter

20326907
width	height
an image is retrieved as an surface in pygame the method get_size will return the tuple width height

20326910

20327053
hl7	fhir
so i just wanted to figure out whether there is any simpler approach to do this hl7 v2 to fhir resource conversion as a one step process rather than the two steps that i just spoke about

20327064
prepare	execute
may be you can check the session for particular values so that to confirm that the request is an authorized one you can even check for some values in the request you can use hidden fields in jsp for this purpose.the value checking can be done in the method prepare in the action which will be execute every time when action is called so before rendering the jsp you can easily redirect to any page by writing logic in the prepare method.to use the prepare method you want to implement the preparable interface

20327078

the aho-corasick algorithm is an extension of a trie tree not far from the basic idea

20332284
trie	tree
aho-corasick algorithm adds a failed pointer to each node on a trie tree

20332284
trie	tree
when fails a trie tree will restart from the root add the start index on l by 1 but aho-corasick algorithm will restart from the node d pointed by the failed pointer add the start index on l by the depth of the node d

passenger	thin
if you are creating a web application that conforms to the rack api for hosting in apache passenger or thin or other server that supports rack it is common to use rack_env environment variable to control the choice of named environment and which part of config to then use - sinatra config will use this for example and rails will fall back to it

uicollectionview	uitableview
my ipad and iphone interfaces use a uicollectionview and a uitableview respectively

20332818
uicollectionview	uitableview
each can respond to certain notifications in the same way when new data is received refresh the data source but with custom parts also reload the uitableview vs reload the uicollectionview

20332818
uicollectionview	uitableview
each will present the same controllers via cell selection though the uitableview will push the new controller and the uicollectionview will use a popover

20332818
uicollectionview	uitableview
i use two subclasses to present the data - one with a uitableview and the other uicollectionview

20332818
uicollectionview	uitableview
what i want uitableview and uicollectionview should use the same uiview subclass as the header for section

20332832
punctuation	words
my 2nd suggestion is use two functions piglatinizephrase and piglatinizeword where your piglatinizephrase method parses a phrase into words and punctuation and calls piglatinizeword for each words excluding any punctuation

20332847
cos	sin
since sin and cos are the projections of r on oy and ox axes all the points inside the circle have the property that and all the points outside the circle have the property

20332847
cos	sin
in your example you row col are the equivalent of sin cos

20332851
portrait	landscape
so as you transition from landscape to portrait you still have the landscape button constraints which are unsatisfiable in portrait but are asking the main view to update its portrait constraints

20332893
width	height
i want jquery to capture the width and height of each div when it is clicked on it does this

20332893
width	height
i am storing the information in two variables called width and height and then use as the base for the animate function to set it s width and height to the original+200px this also works fine

20332893
width	height
however once that animation has run i want the original width and height variables to stay the same as they were before the animation so that i can revert the div height and width to the original for that particular div

20332913
post	get
can you also post what you want to get as a result if possible

20332972
put	get
if i had to hazard a guess i d say that you ve put some configuration junk maybe something like eval opam config env in a configuration file such as .bashrc that arranges for this to work in the shell but emacs doesn t get to see it because .bashrc is not consulted by the desktop environment in which you start emacs

20332978
put	get
then go 3 tabs if the first five letters are wpa2 or wpa- then go another tab and get the last string on the line and put it in a variable etc

super	implements
in the class c s implementation it invokes its super s implementation but class b did not implements it so forward it to class a

20333044
filtering	grouping
if you do not want to use grouping to persist the rest of the query you can add a row_number column and filtering it where it is 1

20333056
width	height
you can use get_rect on image screen or other surface to have all - x y width height centerx centery center bottom right bottomright etc

width	height	ready	each
you can for example keep the original width and height on 2 variable outside of the ready function and they will stay the same between each call

20333111
prop	each
it would be best if you fix your data first otherwise just do a select and as you rifle through the records instantiate a class that loads each property if prop is null make it whatever value..save class object to hashtable and use set of records as you like

i can do it for a button with onclick but onchange doesn t seem to work

20333704
hide	show
what i want to happen is when all options are set to no value is n then the error message will show otherwise it will hide

20333709
viewmodel	caliburn.micro
while i tagged the question properly i forgot to write that i m using caliburn.micro and this means that i must have both views and viewmodel in the same project and this forces me to have a separate library project for the model as the background agent can t depend on the app s project

20333713
apache	nginx
this would require the additional overhead of invoking php to serve these sorts of requests something much more optimized with the basic web server like apache nginx etc

20333719

you will be able to use favorite versioning control system make database releases in form of dacpac and bacpac packages easily create upgrade scripts do schema compare and so on

20333893
button	checkbox
some example of such components are checkbox check menu items toggle button and combo boxes including radio button as mentioned above

20333981
onmouseover	onclick	hide	show
if i understood correctly i would make that a onclick show hide type div and have that div with li use onmouseover show hide additional panels

20334016
hide	show
what you re currently doing is checking that only distanceselling is yes whereas you should be checking that all values are no and running your show hide based on that since you want to show the message if any of the values are yes

20334019
post	get
when i click through to show a post i get the following error

20334105

i m trying to add a very basic little jquery script to a wordpress site which adds the fa-invert font awesome class to an icon on event mouseenter and then removes the class on mouseleave

20334327
super	self
a message to super is sent to self

20334327

inherited	properties
the object cody inherited its properties from is it s internal prototype properties which is inaccessible by normal means

20334476
cout	cin
under ms c++ the iostream header provides linkages to the cout cin clog and cerr functions and the equivelant wide character stream functions wcout wcin wclog and wcerr wide character support is broadly a way to accomodate character representations that are outside the common ascii or ebcdic universe

20334504
hide	show
how do i hide that thread thread_1 which has no messages to show in the template whose messages are all hidden

20334538
margin	height
so the margin you got here is on the font itself because t character s height is not equal to 1em

20334540
int	boolean	int	chars
the int promotions are covered in section 6.3.1.1 boolean chars and int says emphasis mine

20334540
int	chars
in this case int can represent all the values of chars

20334542
hide	show
i then flip the hide and show where the caution message is only hidden when all check boxes are check

20334549
put	get
but i could not get the simple way because i put the check box and also drop down list

20334559
put	get
to get round this instead of putting something like 1e-4 put 0.0001 instead

20334564
portrait	landscape
this can also be done without checking on the orientation by using both the multiplier and constant values of the constraint to create a single constraint for each direction that works for both portrait and landscape if you make the view in the storyboard you need to remove any constraints you made there before adding these -- you can have that done automatically by checking the placeholder - remove at build time box in the attributes inspector for each of the constraints you want removed

20334574
cos	sin
i am now re-doing an assignment where we had to approximate sin and cos

20334599
put	get
i created a custom messagewindow in order to get rid of the old one and put my own style on it.

20334612
multiplying	add
if it s bigger you multiplying a by m add to the total then multiplying m by -1 add 2 to d and repeat so you get the next term add again and so on

20334644

20334678
put	get
whatever code you put inside the run function will get run inside a thread

20334708
getter	setter
the properties rarely live directly on the instance usually they are hidden to discourage accessing the properties without using the getter setter

20334708
getter	setter
if you use ember.controller.extend then it won t proxy getter setter down to the model it will store retrieve properties from the controller itself

20334744
floating-point	integer
well i use a solution based on the fact that if you multiply a floating-point number by the right power of 10 you get an integer

20334749
public	protected
don t declare it as protected make it public instead

20334749
getter	setter
write a couple of functions to get and set the value getter and setter

20334749
getter	setter
and add your getter setter there

20334755
textarea	textbox
generally speaking you can clear a textbox textarea whatnot by seleniums clear function like this

versioning	upgrade
you can upgrade the current openx source 2.8.x versioning to revive ad server

20334842
width	height	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract	subtract	add
you ll need to add subtract the offset top bottom and multiplying divide the offset height width of your elements

20334921
put	get	post	get	post	put
what you need to do is preserve your session across more than one http request whether the requests are post get head delete put update etc

20334938
padrino	ruby-on-rails
but this does not work in padrino nor do any of the regular controller calls because padrino uses different controller methods than ruby-on-rails

20334985
oncreate	ondestroy
what is meant by the service running in the same thread as the ui is the callback entry points for the service oncreate ondestroy onbind etc. these are always run in the main thread of your app

20334998
min	max
on a general note you could use d3.extent instead of min and max separately

20335008
implements	extends
you issue is mainactivity is not extends fragmentactivity and supportpackage an activity must inherit from fragmentactivity to get methods like getsupportedfragmentmanager .activity is inheriting from another class you implements one of classes and kind of merge them

20335037
put	get
right click on the project get the properties menu and find the c c++ preprocessor definitions and put it thre

20335187
webkit	gecko
but it still works well in webkit and gecko

20335191
width	height
to do this you actually add -1 width +1 height

20335191
width	height
and use 1f width 1f height as your halfpixel value

20335193
hide	show
how to make hide not disable all child folders and .tmp files below and show only .pdf files to user

when user confirms that dialog open a new web page in new window this way you ll also get around pop-up blockers

20335224
requestfactory	gwt-rpc
i m wondering what server communication method is a best fit for this gwt-rpc or requestfactory

20335224
requestfactory	gwt-rpc
my understanding is the requestfactory is more efficient and recommended over gwt-rpc but it s more of a data entity persistence framework than a request-response framework like rpc

20335224
requestfactory	gwt	requestfactory	gwt-rpc
so although many gwt afficionados recommend using requestfactory over gwt-rpc i don t think requestfactory can be used for this scenario

20335295
free	malloc
the way to avoid allocating on the stack is to have a pointer and allocate on the heap using malloc this is the the c version of calling new but this increases code complexity by requiring a matching call to free

20335324
spaces	delimiter
in this example i have an array of power ball numbers and want to be able to paste in the spaces delimiter winning numbers you might copy off of the power ball site

google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
everything works fine on google-chrome or opera but when i try out firefox or ie the iframes doesn t appear

20335461
width	height
because when i delete width and height it does display but of course doesn t resize anymore

20335463
put	get
95 of the time the re-size works once put into the ajax script however the 5 of the time the secondary ajax call would get done first causing the page not to re-size the gradient correctly

20335485
width	height
apart from that if you want to store the numbers in row-major order then you should declare your matrix 2d-array as height first then width

20335506
int	double
looks like what you are looking for is a double dimesion array of int

20335525
requestfactory	gwt-rpc
in your case is better to use gwt-rpc because in order to only send the credentials server side and eventually retrieve the authentication result you don t need the requestfactory surplus delta transmission entity management

20335532
rcharts	nvd3.js
i cannot remember why nvd3.js with rcharts does this but we have discovered this in this issue

20335538
namedtuple	dictionary
possibly depending on how you use your dictionary namedtuple could also be a solution

20335538
namedtuple	dictionary
of course if namedtuple fit the bill you can skip the intermediate dictionary entirely

20335577
spaces	delimiter
if as in the sample lines you posted the delimiter is a spaces your code should work

20335577
spaces	delimiter
alternatively you can make sure it s using a spaces delimiter format by doing the following

20335604
mousemove	mousedown
right now i am handling the mousedown and mousemove events to draw a little half-transparent circle on every change of the mouse s coordinates over the image

20335606
freebsd	linux
on linux freebsd and macos this script works for me

20335660
ostringstream	std
instead i would format the line into a std ostringstream and once completed write the line start information followed by the firmatted line obtained from the std ostringstream using str

20335712
requestfactory	gwt
related with auth filters for rf you can take a look to this gwt requestfactory authentication functions

20335740
typedef	struct
as an aside you don t need the cumbersone typedef syntax and you need struct instead of strut

20335790
width	height
your problem is that your div#entry does not have any fixed width height so i added some

20335791
google-chrome	firefox
so to target other browsers like google-chrome and firefox you need to put your comments like below

20335808
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i ve tested in ie11 firefox 24 google-chrome 31 and safari 5.1.7 and they all exhibit the same behavior

20335810
pull	push
with a push pull behaviour rather than publish subscribe

20335810
pull	push
following raffian s advice i simplified my code removing the push pull extra socket it does make sense now that you say it

20335814
awt	swing
i know that there are equivalents in swing and awt called paint and paintcomponent

20335847
switching	screens
as soon as i switching the scroll view to my subclass in the nib file some strange things happen the scroll view will expand vertically and cover other views when scrolled upward and the bottom edge stops short of the full screens and leaves a big gap...but when i change it back to a regular uiscrollview it s fine

20335857
cdr	cons
a cons cell whose car is the first element of a list and whose cdr is the rest of the list

20335857
cdr	cons
and to assume since you ve required a list that anything that doesn t match that case is a cons cell on which you can call cdr and cdr

20335866
put	get
i ll see if we can get a couple pointers to that webhooks documentation put into the relevant places on the rest of the docs

20335873
portrait	landscape
i m trying to dynamically scale down variable portrait and landscape images to fit proportionally within a browser window

20335903
system.in	system.out
however when i use system.out and system.in i get the following error see screenshot below

20335911
post	put	google-chrome	firefox
so i took a post off the client page and put this into the embedded post plugin and it displayed correctly so there are public post in firefox again no display at all in google-chrome for me not even with the facebook example

20335911
google-chrome	firefox
i am not logged into facebook in the firefox browser but am in google-chrome using the facebook plugin site in a google-chrome incognito window does give the same results as firefox displays example data but not posts for client page

20335925
hide	show
i have a loading div that i can show and hide at will

20335925
hide	show
normally this show hide operation works very quickly but if i attempt to do so in the same call chain as my long running function the browser does not get chance to reflow and show the loading div before it is locked up by the long running function

20335986
qstring	qdate
if you need to construct a qdate you can use qdate fromstring with the yyyy-mm-dd format or if you want just the integer values you can use what guid already mentioned qstring split

20336004
uiapplication	uiwindow	uiview	uiwindow	uiview	subviews
uiapplication uiwindow and uiview implement responder methods to pass touch events along to the view under the touch -- presumably uiview calls its own hittest withevent method to find the subviews under the touch and forward the event to it

20336004
implements	extends
sprite kit extends the responder pattern into its node-tree model so skview likely implements uiresponder methods by calling its scene s convertpointfromview and nodeatpoint methods to find the node under a touch before passing the event to that node

20336004
implements	extends
if you implements your own uiview or glkview or whatever kind of view subclass you can extends the responder pattern to include your custom objects as well

20336004
uiview	subviews
just doing that won t magically forward touch events to those objects though -- just like uiview does hit testing to forward events to subviews and skview does hit testing to forward events to nodes your view will need to do hit testing to determine which of your custom objects should receive a touch event and then call the appropriate responder method on that object

20336004
glkbaseeffect	glreadpixels
re-render your scene to an offscreen framebuffer using a special fragment shader or reconfigured glkbaseeffect that outputs object ids instead of pixel colors then use glreadpixels to find the pixel under the touch

udp	tcp	sctp	tcp	sctp	udp
i m wondering what is the minimum required overhead in terms of the number of listening ports server sockets required for accepting say n different connections each using a different transport protocol that runs on top of ip tcp sctp dccp udp etc

20336114
udp	tcp
for simplicity you can assume n 2 one connection is tcp and the other one is dccp or udp please don t make assumptions on connectionless communication since dccp is connection-oriented .

it would behave exactly the same as if you placed your typedef declaration before the struct

20336572
google-chrome	firefox
with code below in firefox native function can be redefined in google-chrome you could just do or just the same thing as below but without injectind code injecting can be allright for small new functions but if it is needed to communicate with other functions or variables in the userscript it would be necesarry to inject the whole code of userscript

20336577
return-value-optimization	nrvo
you could also return by value and avoid the copy if your compiler supports nrvo named return-value-optimization

20336608

int long chars float double struct s and arrays of them - you might be better of with a nsdata

20337233
lxml	beautifulsoup
this code uses lxml s fast html parser to parse the document works just fine for the snippet you provided but beautifulsoup s encoding detection to first guess the appropriate character set and decode the document

20337233
lxml	beautifulsoup
for more information on how to use lxml with the beautifulsoup parser see the lxml docs on beautifulsoup

use an instance of bufferedwriter to write into the file instead of printwriter

20337877
hide	show
i am doing this trying to reduce the show hide logic noise in the html for error messages spans and it should be reusable

20337922

if by re-inflate you mean that your gridview and listview are in different activites or fragments all you need to do is maintain the arraylist myelements when navigating between them

20337950
put	get
i put my email address under settings however when i create a new ticket in the log file i get .

20337970
datalist	repeater	gridview	repeater	gridview	datalist
as others have mentioned in the comments you need a datalist gridview or repeater on your page to bind to this data

20338037
versioning	upgrade
for example when there are new versioning of the jdk you will need to apply your updates to the new versioning as well when you upgrade

i have an std ostringstream

20338247
ostringstream	std
i would like to iterate for each line of this std ostringstream

20338274

in xpath 2.0 you could also use a b c id number to get a sequence of number double values or a b c id xs int . to get a sequence of int values

20338292
width	height	converter	multibinding
the converter takes in the width and height of the border using a multibinding and converts them into a point around its edge dependant on the converterparameter

20338303
filesystems	fat
but mind that untaring your archive on some filesystems like fat won t preserve permissions as they don t support it

20338327
stdout	stderr
if you think the lock file might be stdin stdout stderr themselves you can use nohup to redirect them to something else

20338349
google-chrome	firefox
using google-chrome and firefox works correctly

20338414
google-chrome	firefox
the client tests will fire up a headless browser but it would also be good if it could fire up real browsers like google-chrome and firefox

20338436
put	get
i used the put methode then i get a 405 error after publish my project

20338484
folder	directory
edit for linking reports folder from each user directory to one central report directory you d do something like this

20338494
memcpy	strcpy
i am still confused as to how i can even do that since functions like memcpy and strcpy have not been working with the static array

20338530
int	chars
the program terminates because it takes the newline chars the end-user added after the last int as the end of the nextline

20338603
uiview	subviews
from a bit of experimenting it seems that the is returning the main uiview and not your subviews hence the problem with the if statement not working i added the uiimageview in a storyboard xib

20338616
uipangesturerecognizer	uigesturerecognizer
these days it s simpler more usual to use a uigesturerecognizer for this kind of thing in this case a uipangesturerecognizer

20338660
min	max
here you need to take the min not the max

20338685
build.gradle	gradlew
if you export the build.gradle from eclipse it includes .apt_generated in the gradlew file and it shouldn t

20338698
keydown	keyup
remove the keydown and replace it with keyup event

20338699
put	get
as a conclusion here is a similar approach to get the final result just put an empty pair of brackets at the end of the queue

20338709
post	put
i will put the whole code in jsbin here i post only the piece that is not working

20338807
hash	md5
why don t you simply hash your cookie using md5

20338832
min	max
to get the latest date you will need to get the biggest largest in number date and you will need to use max function instead of min min will return the oldest smallest date in your column

20338836
daemons	launchd
it will make your code more portable making it possible to launchd in linux for example or under a different launchd daemons to use program arguments that configure the behavior rather than relying on the program invocation chain

20338867
min	max
just to add something to the answers which are correct essentially before this one in order to find the latest date you ll have to use max instead of min

20338897
google-chrome	firefox
using extjs 4.0 framework running browsers ie7 8 9 firefox google-chrome i have some reports that my system is running

20338990
slug	permalinks
i am trying to select all rows from a table and update a column s values within the same table basically an automatic slug permalinks rewrite of a title column

20338990
slug	permalinks
however when i do that it just inserts the same slug permalinks rewrite from the very first id in all of the rows instead of rewriting and inserting the title for each row individually

20338998
int	double
when you do a division between an int and a double or float the int is first converted to a double or float and then floating point division is done returning a double or float

20338998
int	double
in your code the conversion to double is done as part of the assignment to the variables because all of the values in the arithmetic expression are int

20338998
division	multiplication
the division has a quotient of 0 since which means the multiplication is just

20338998
int	double
as zouzou says you can change the division to be floating point by changing the 100 to 100.0 which means the compiler will treat them as double instead of int making the division convert onea to a double first

20339049
rss	feed
i am using a view to display a set of rss feed specifically a list of events imported from a calendar

20339080
pull	push
dealer is push and pull combined so use dealer only your code will be simpler

20339152
next	except
after which means match any character except new line 0 or more times until satisfying the next token added also

20339187
aggregate-functions	datepart
when i give datepart in the aggregate-functions it is not giving me actual values

20339238
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
this code does exactly what i want in firefox and ie but not in google-chrome or safari

20339238
google-chrome	safari
i have tried debugging in google-chrome 31.0.1650.57 and safari 5.1.7 for windows i get cannot read property _ e3 of undefined of the main.js and also unexpected token

20339260
cpu	processors
if your cpu can access its cache in 1 ns steps but your memory takes 60 ns to deliver a random memory word at some point your processors is going to read memory at 60x slow rate than the cache

20339268
children	parent
the children components also have the position property which is set to match the parent when the preinitialize event occurs

20339268
children	parent
according to the component lifecyle the preinitialize event occurs in parent components first then goes down the line of children

20339289
filtering	grouping
i then grouping this second list by subgroup i then filtering and i get the result for this subgroupsize

20339367
free	malloc
where n is the size of your input using strlen string would probably make sense or dynamically allocated via malloc which you would need to free at the end of your function

20339383
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
the code i have written works in firefox ie opera but not in google-chrome

20339386
decoder	encoder
you didn t say how you were generating the underlying identifiers so i can t make any assumptions about how you should handle the raw bytes that come out of the decoder nor about the content of the raw bytes being passed into the encoder

20339396
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
now when i am trying to deploy on amazon-web-services using elastic beanstalk and found out they only support python 2.7

20339415
pop-up	dialog
i would like to see my alert dialog box pop-up instead

20339418
cpython	pypy
for example if you just import pickle the implementation classes will be built in c what you used to get from cpickle in 2.7 in cpython while they ll be pure-python versions in pypy but either way pickle itself is pure python

20339429
prepare	execute
prepare and execute returns false on errors

20339431
carrierwave	paperclip
in this scenario i would use either paperclip or carrierwave and depending on the specific use case would add the image directly to the post model or create a separate model blogattachment if you need a one to many relationship

20339448
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
everything is perfect on firefox google-chrome opera ie ios but windows safari has huge problems with the continuous slider

20339505
pull	push
if i pull the files down to my local dotfiles repo first filecmp.cmp will still say the files are different and the script will overwrite the pulled down file with the local one then push because it thinks there was a change

20339534
folder	dir
seems as though the swing application framework is saving the app s window size in a subfolder within your home dir for windows the application data folder for linux in your home folder

20339537
children	parent
a parent easily can have children for that you need a relationship table

20339538
children	parent
i would break children out into a separate table for the simple reason that a parent may have many children if not now maybe in the future

20339539
children	parent
you have described three different entities in your question -- parent children and exams

20339556
superclass	subclassing
is the only way to either copy the superclass instance s desired properties to the newly instantiated subclassing object like.

20339556
superclass	subclassing
or add swizzle at runtime the subclassing additional property methods in this case setaprop and aprop to the superclass instance and also cast it upwards .

20339561
width	height
for example to detect the browser zoom level and then multiply the width and height of your iframe with the inverse value so in the end they visually stay the same

20339575
children	parent
just because parent and children both have similar properties names ages etc. does not mean they will always have the same relationships with other entities in your database

20339586
implements	extends
at the moment i have a class that extends activity with an inner class gameview extends surfaceview and implements runnable

20339628
filtering	grouping
then if you need to filtering the grouping you can use the having clause

20339640
hex	binary
the given hex constants are just representing special values that helps you to extract or mask out the bits that you want try to convert those constant in binary and apply the operator

20339680
superclass	subclassing
you can t swizzle onto an instance you swizzle onto the class definition so if you do that you won t be adding the subclassing methods onto an instance of the superclass you will be adding them onto all instances of the superclass

20339680
superclass	subclassing
you can have a factory method in the superclass that returns a subclassing and encapsulate all the the copying in there so that returns

20339680
superclass	subclassing
that is actually relatively common and is how many of the class clusters are implemented though they return private subclassing that conform to the implementation of the superclass

20339726
asort	usort
i ve tried usort and asort but haven t gotten it to work with either method

20339734
viewdidappear	viewwillappear

i would like to get the output to sequentially number each record where the count column is starting with 1 at each new group and put a total at the bottom of the group but i m not sure how to do that

20339739
cpython	pypy
however the first thing you might want to try is to just run your code in pypy instead of cpython

20339784
super	extends
we link this object s to the rmi system by extends from this class unicastremoteobjec so when a class extends from unicastremoteobject it must provide a constructor declaring this constructor calls super it activates code in unicastremoteobject which performs the rmi linking and remote object initialization

20339857
popover	tooltip
i am trying to create tooltip popover for dynamically created div elements containing images

20339910

canopy	chaco
i am trying to get the enthought canopy package chaco 4.3.0-3 up and running for 2d interactive plotting

20340047
next	except
they re essentially the same except for how the next iteration of the loop is chosen - dijkstra s is breadth first - allowing you to find the closest target and a is heuristic depth first allowing you to find one target with the least iterations shortest amount of wall-clock time

20340048
jsf	jspx
and in your jspx or jsf change the styleclass of the table to stylestable and don t input anything in the one that you don t want to style

20340092
hide	show
so when the user click the first radio button labelled show first paragraph i want my page to display the first paragraph with the text this is my 1st paragraph. and hide the second paragraph with the text this is my 2nd paragraph and vice versa

20340113
filesystems	ntfs

and finally the testimage.php where i want to get the width height

20340179
width	height
and obviously my last file don t know who width or height are .

20340184
post	put
default method for form open is post but if you need to change it to put for example you will have to

20340197
client-side	server-side
you can also use frameworks that can both help make the server-side python code simpler and also automatically generate the client-side html js automatically for you so you only have to worry about the python code

20340208
javassist	cglib
another way is to use a byte-code engineering library such as asm cglib javassist - these intercept the classloader to provide a new sub-class at runtime

20340218
int	double
hi guys i m trying to input all the comma separated text into a struct vector but for some reason the double and int values from the cdv file won t get transferred to the struct

20340224
put	get
you could lookup the reverse foreign key and get all the users for a particular thread without having to manually put it in thread

20340274
public	protected
the way you have to make a method visible or not is to declare it as public or private protected

20340323
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
this works great in safari google-chrome though i admit somewhat quirky with all the settimeout s but while the slider was technically working in firefox there were no transition visible there

20340323
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
following jim jeffers answer to a similar problem i was able to get it working smooth in both safari google-chrome and firefox and it also substantially cleaned up my javascript

20340354

according to my research i guess what i need to do is to use cmmotionmanager instead of uiaccelerometer but as i said before i m totally new to ios development and have no idea how to replace it

20340425
cout	cin
they work the same as file streams and the default i o streams like cin and cout

20340446
min	max
i m trying to write the minimax algorithm in python with one for-loop yes i know wikipedia says the min and max players are often treated separately and i m using the variable turn to keep track of whether the min or max player is currently exploring options

20340467
post	put
as a test i switched to using post instead of put adjusted type post on js side and httppost on web api server side

20340475
getter	setter
in your student class add a getter and a setter for it and then modify your constructor so that setstudentnumber number

20340562
clang	llvm
the gcc command in the latest xcode suite is no longer the gcc frontend to llvm based on the very old gcc 4.2.1 but rather a symlink to clang

20340562
macports	homebrew
you have to install separately another version of gcc by following this tutorial or by using any of the available software package management systems like macports and homebrew

pull	push
but then four of thoseâ the functions for git push fetch pull and remote â delegate to __git_complete_remote_or_refspec which starts like this

20340633
queue	fifo
but as it says in the documentation this class provides an efficient and scalable basis for synchronization in part by specializing its range of use to synchronizers that can rely on int state acquire and release parameters and an internal fifo wait queue

if the directory tree is not very difficult to recreate you can just try wa until you have recreated all the missing folder

20340686
fadein	fadeout
but i would like to make it look better transitions maybe by adding jquery fadein fadeout

20340759
inherited	properties

this is the code that i see everywhere for a simple static web server using node.js and express

20340766
webmock	vcr
just had the same issue the fakeweb gem is now deprecated in vcr use webmock instead

20340815
textmate	sublimetext
background for those not familiar with it sublimetext and textmate provides syntax highlighting and other features through scopes which are defined by .tmlanguage language definition files basically a bunch of regexes to identify various constructs in a given language such as function definitions various types of strings reserved words etc

hide	show
when rendering our web app we check is the user has the token for certain feature this is used to show hide features for different plans

20340848
nsurlconnection	nsurlsession
my understanding is that while not deprecated yet we should be moving away from anything related to nsurlconnection and instead rely on nsurlsession

20340885
getter	setter
make it private and create a getter with no setter

20340887
post	get
i have been trying to write a bucket policy that will allow x-http-method-override because my research shows that facebook loads https hosted iframe apps via http post instead of http get which causes s3 and cloudfront errors

20340889
comparator	comparable
comparable objects have a method comparator which as described in the javadoc

20340914
ubuntu	linux
you don t need remove the .cmake extension you will need compile the freerdp project under linux environment mac or ubuntu etc then generate the .so files that you can use it by jni

20340916
getter	setter
you d need to create a getter function but not a setter

20340916
getter	setter	public	protected
although it would be nice to have a public getter and a protected private setter that causes compilation errors

20340919
post	get
but this seems to complicate things i have to get the count of records all the time and besides it is not guaranteed that i will always get 15 records for example if one of the post has been deleted and ids are not in straight sequence anymore

20340960
for-loop	loops
but you can loops through the sheet objects yourself with a traditional for-loop

the confirmation dialog pop-up as expected

20341038
addition	multiplication
multiplication using only bitwise arithmetic is masochism as is addition

20341038
integer	radix
if you have an integer type twice as wide as your operands then just perform regular multiplication and use a right shift to align the radix point to the correct bit

20341038
fractions	radix
if you multiply two 8-bit fractions in the range 0 1 then the result should be shifted right by 8 bits to take the radix point from the 2 16 s place back to the 2 8 s place

20341046
children	parent
for example if there is a key that needs to be unique across parent and children combined or there is another table that needs to reference all of them etc.

20341046
children	parent
person_id is unique across all parent and children

20341051
fgets	fgetc
fgets reads until it reaches eof or a newline as if by calling fgetc for each byte

20341051
fgets	fgetc
fgets will then read all bytes transmitted and not seeing either eof or a newline will act as if it calls fgetc again once again blocking in read

20341065
hex	binary
note that the same trick can be applied to numeric representations other than decimal by substituting 10 with the base of the number 2 for binary numbers 16 for hex numbers and so on

20341074
versioning	upgrade
the problem i am facing is that when i want to upgrade the third-party code i want to keep the previous versioning this will cause same interfaces with same names i don t want to modify the third-party libraries and they don t contain namespaces for me to use

listview	gridview
i am searching in gridview and listview varieties but not able to find

20341181
temporary	tablespace
drop the tablespace after creating it with selinux temporary off

20341181
temporary	tablespace
if creation fails with selinux temporary disabled you must either exempt postgresql from your selinux policy create the tablespace at a location that the selinux policy permits or set appropriate selinux attributes on the tablespace directory so that postgresql can manipulate it

20341225
uilabel	nsstring
just a personal preference not necessarily related to the topic on discussion i would call your uilabel titlelabel instead of title because objectinstance title looks like it would return an nsstring to someone who does not know that title is a uilabel

20341228
disk	ram
addresses schemes are fairly specific their system there are hundreds or thousands or tens of thousands of arm based systems all of which have different address schemes and that address could point to nothing with nobody to answer that request dies and possibly hangs the processor or it could be some ram or it could be a register in a usb controller or video controller or disk drive controller

20341240
width	height
the second answer in this question shows how to add the button and add params to it such as height and width

20341261

then you will need an opera specific method an ie specific method a firefox specific method and so on.

20341346
width	height
make your header a div that fits 100 width x whatever height you require

20341355
try-catch	exception-handling
this function throws so i set up a try-catch to catch the exception-handling

20341397
range	max
so if the word unsigned is found by the string function locate then the max value is the full range of 4294967295 so bit-shift it by 0 bits

20341459
integer	unsigned
if the column type is an unsigned integer for example it will shift 1 position which essentially squares the number and if it is a regular signed integer it will not shift at all

20341459
integer	unsigned
an unsigned integer uses that bit as part of the value so it can hold a much higher max value but cannot hold negative values at all

20341478
multiplying	add	multiplying	multiplication	multiplication	exponent
exponent have to match before you can add for example multiplication they dont but you add the exponent as well as multiplying the number portion.

20341492
postgresql	mysql
it supports postgresql mysql and sqlite

20341495
hide	show
and stack them on top of each other z-index hide ones that are not needed to be show once you want to show any layer with the html and attach the css use .show and append the css file to your current html file using i think this will work very smoothly

20341514
for-loop	loops
i know i need a for-loop of 10 and inside it another loops with dashes going to the percent

20341542
width	height
if i correctly understand what you want you may leave the width and height attributes off the image to maintain aspect ratio and use flexbox to do the centering for you

20341542
opera	google-chrome
i tested this successfully in ie9 google-chrome 31 and opera 18

20341566
width	height
running nm on the quicklook framework binary revealed some undocumented kqlpreviewproperty-- constants as well as the aforementioned width and height keys

20341572
implements	extends
so then i tried implements these in a category for uialertview+motionresponder.h to try to extends uialertview but the motionended is not getting called even though canbecomefirstresponder is correctly returning yes

20341580
google-chrome	safari
linux x86_64 applewebkit 537.36 khtml like gecko google-chrome 31.0.1650.57 safari 537.36

20341580
google-chrome	safari
as you can see this tells me nothing since there is mention of mozzila safari google-chrome etc

20341602
for-loop	loops
we should use a for-loop instead and loops in the reverse order

20341652
width	height
might fix it for the now but it might also mean breaking something else in the long run it s a type of clearfix hack but with fixed width and height will mean problems if your container gets taller and you have no idea why stuff is getting clipped off.

20341659
opera	firefox
for some of the not-so-new browsers firefox 4 opera this would likely work

20341676
fadein	fadeout
these are parameters you are seeing on the fadein and fadeout lines

20341715
int	boolean	equals	compareto
compareto returns an int that expresses how the values relate to one another rather than a boolean saying whether they re equals

20341721
google-chrome	firefox
only firefox and google-chrome are known to support it yet

20341721
opera	safari
if you are trying it in ie safari or opera then you are out of luck

20341776
post	get
you can t change post to get - that s the way facebook loads app page because it also sends data about the current user as post body see signed_request for more details

20341801
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
firefox safari and google-chrome all see each character when entered by itself and they see the case where alt is held down while d is pressed

20341812
disk	ram
typically linux embedded system is not operate directly in disk based filesystem but use a mechanism to load the os from a persistent storage hard drive flash card or memory etc. to volatile memory space ram

20341812
filesystems	btrfs	btrfs	ramdisk	disk	ram
in general these os s file commonly called as firmware are kernel image file and a initrd initial ramdisk file the initrd file contains root filesystems s files and any system s related files upon boot the initrd will be uncompressed and deployed into a ram based filesystems such as tmpfs once completed the system will use the tmpfs filesystems just like any disk based filesystems ext3 btrfs for example to run init program or script to do system initialization

20341832
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
set the after width height and background size to the size icon you want and then set the margin left and top to negative one half the height and width to keep it centered

20341846
folder	dir
either try the vs-based runner which should work as long as it s installed and xunit.dll is getting to your output dir or look at the docs for your version of td.net for detailed troubleshooting notes exec summary is if the .tdnet file was in your out dir or you undo and redo the xunit.installer from the folder containing the packages it should just work esp if you are on latest

20341895
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome firefox and ie alt-d is processed by the browser to move the focus to the url bar

20341896
sorting	grouping
here s my script of sorting males and females one after another into the variable grouping

20341917
ssl	https
it seems you need to set up the ssl context for being able to send soap over https in the java code

20341939
google-chrome	safari
mozzila safari google-chrome etc

20341951
put	get	post	get	post	put
further is it possible to run python bottle or use its nice put get post handler syntax within said python

20341966

mozzila safari google-chrome etc

20341966
google-chrome	safari
the post below explains why mozilla and safari exist in google-chrome s ua

20341967
hide	show
i am having difficulties as when the function returns a true boolean the application does its job and show the other two forms and hide itself

20341972
min	max
i have read reports where this showenabled false breaks if both min and max are also set

20342012
spaces	delimiter
there is no spaces delimiter between the text

20342020
google-chrome	firefox
i tested it on local desktop browser google-chrome and firefox

20342022
width	height
the accepted answer appropriately handles the case where width and height are both supposed to be 100 which is what was asked for but which also will change the aspect ratio of the canvas

20342022
width	height
the window will have some aspect ratio width height and so will the canvas object

20342022
width	height
most important thing you have to be clear about the html canvas object has a width attribute and a height attribute

20342022
width	height
and then the css of the same object also has a width and a height attribute

20342022
width	height
changing the width and height attributes is one method with which you can always change the size of your canvas but then you ll have to repaint everything which will take time and is not always necessary because some amount of size change you can accomplish via the css attributes in which case you do not redraw the canvas

20342022
width	height
2 you want width and height to both stay 100 and you want the resulting change in aspect ratio to have the effect of a stretched-out image

20342022
width	height
3 you want width and height to both stay 100 but the answer to the change in aspect ratio is something different from stretching the image

20342022
width	height
4 you want the width and height to be 100 on page load but stay constant thereafter no reaction to window resize

20342032
folder	dir
either try the vs-based runner which should work as long as it s installed and xunit.dll is getting to your output dir or look at the docs for your version of td.net for detailed troubleshooting notes exec summary is if the .tdnet file was in your out dir or you undo and redo the xunit.installer from the folder containing the packages it should just work esp if you are on latest

20342034
memcached	apc
make sure you have apc and memcached installed

20342034
memcached	apc
apc memcached php using ngix will only provide about a 10 improvement vs just using magento cache full page cache and varnish

20342053
post	get
i know this has been covered indepth in other post but i can t get my var_dump of post to print out more than the last checkbox that is checked

20342057
post	get
just to complete my task i will post what its need to get the values selected

20342079
post	get
you might want to post it to the repo-discuss mailing list to get some traction or get an explanation why it s a bad idea

20342150
hide	show
after a form is submitted to an target on the page and after the finishes loading there is 1 that is suppose to hide 2 that need to show and 2 css changes that are all suppose to trigger but they are not

20342184
hash	md5
if you have some data that you need to or can hash to generate a uuid from then you can use either v3 which relies on md5 or v5 which relies on sha1

20342198
mouseup	mousedown
alternatively you can subscribe to mousedown or mouseup

20342213
width	height
if so you can just set the height and width of the image component in your item renderer it should scale the image for you

20342216
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox submit without this bit of code fine and handle inputs with the required attribute as usual stopping the submit and showing a pop-up message if any one required input is empty

20342216
google-chrome	firefox
try it both in ie10 and google-chrome firefox

20342219
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
i wrote separately for google-chrome firefox safari and opera

20342286
sorting	grouping
create 3 exact same reports but with different sorting within report design on grouping you can sort the underlying items and have a form trigger button with a drop down or list menu for user to select specific report ordering and then call the particular report

20342354
for-loop	loops
it is very easy to do with a for-loop but it s of no use here the dataframe is massive several millions of row and a loops would take forever

20342372
post	get
change get to post

20342376
int	double
the second by using the wrong format specifier in printf you should be using f since the result of 1 0.0 is a double not an int

20342403
try-catch	exception-handling
i know there is no exception-handling handling in c but just curious if i can write dangerous codes safely inside something like try-catch block

20342410
express	geddy
or have some type of an application level router that would forward to geddy or express based on incoming request path

20342413
hash	md5
version 3 this generates a unique id from an md5 hash of a namespace and name

20342427
width	height
although ng-show caused the wrong map width height problem you could enforce map refresh by dispatching resize event when initialize the map

20342428
filesystems	fat
for ease of development it would usually be more convenient for you to store your binary on the sd card with a fat filesystems

20342432
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
basically i have a div that i set to 100 width and height inside i have like a tabs section like on a broswer i added a margin and padding to the main area and when i set the tabs div to full width it sticks out some pixels whats the correct way to deal with child divs sticking out of parents divs when playing with s and margins padding

20342437
google-chrome	firefox
only latest google-chrome and firefox supports webrtc

20342469
post	get
according to this post it is not possible to include programfiles in the path varaible because windows environment variables get resolved in alphabetical order

20342480
jobs	cron
what you re doing is typically accomplished in php using cron jobs

20342482
box-sizing	border-box
for your padding and border use box-sizing border-box

20342489
put	get
if i right-click a file i get a put option to send the file but if i right-click a folder the option is not there

20342491
folder	directory
i think image you are trying to show is not in web application folder virtual directory

20342520
google-chrome	safari
the user is not prompted with a save dialog nor does the file begin automatically downloading google-chrome or safari

20342588
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
compare the results produced by the latest versions of firefox or ie 11 and google-chrome or safari

20342588
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome always reports 250 for both widths as expected but firefox always reports a larger number though the exact number may depend on the os and or version of firefox and or phase of the moon

20342591
ienumerable	iqueryable
the iqueryable interface inherits the ienumerable interface so that if it represents a query the results of that query can be enumerated

20342599
strstr	strtok	strstr	substr
you can use functions like strstr to get substr strtok split using some token

20342605
fast-forward	merge
probably because it is a fast-forward merge

20342609
getter	setter
next you need to give sphere getter and setter methods that make sense

20342609
getter	setter
get rid of it and create true getter and setter the getter taking no parameters but returning a value and the setter taking a parameter and declared to return void

20342677
dictionary	map
if these two methods do not properly work together then using the object in any sort of dictionary or set basically any sort of hash map then things won t work properly

20342731
folder	directory
if not take a backup of .metadata folder just in case you need to revert back and delete the following directory

20342732
rss	feed
i m using simplepie to fetch rss feed from a db table

20342732
rss	feed
my question is is it ok for me to instantiate as many instances of simplepie objects as there are rss feed in the db see proof of concept code below

20342746
touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchesended
i have a subclassed uiview that implements touchesbegan touchesmoved touchesended

20342746
uiview	subviews
then i added a uiscrollview as subviews to this uiview

20342746
move	drag
this actually seems to work as intended on the iphone which would be if the user drag his finger across the scrollview it scrolls but if he places it on the view and does not move it the parent view s touchesbegan method fires but it does not work on the ipad

20342799
uialertview	uiwindow
the internal view hierarchy of uialertview is much more complicated than it appears and starting from ios 7 it is not even added to any uiwindow so it s no big surprise that it doesn t participate to the responder chain as you expect

20342801
min	max
if i want to add min 10 and max 16 .

20342801
range	max	range	min	min	max
i was trying to validate each by each index from the list min and max between the range but i want to know if there is another way to do this with linq or something similar

20342811
google-chrome	firefox
browsers are designed to render partially downloaded images so they don t complain about this although you can see the corruption on the road that touches the very bottom of the image there is a pattern of vertical lines firefox or horizontal lines google-chrome that shouldn t be there

20342811
gif	png
png compression is always superior to gif compression except in the case when the images are extremely tiny -- around 100 bytes

20342811
gif	png
then the headers of the more complex png format put it at a disadvantage so there is no reason to prefer gif in this case

20342862
apache	nginx
i have recently started using apache rather than nginx but my .htaccess will not work

20342935
rtsp	rtmp
i just want to convert my rtmp protocol stream to rtsp and http protocol stream

20343013
children	parent
you can use it on a parent element to have it affect all children links

20343055
integer	fractions
so convert that de50 to an integer divide by 16 truncating fractions and subtract 0xde50

20343072
plot	heatmap
something more like a heatmap is probably what you want or maybe a contour plot or just a scatter plot where you set the color of each disk to the wind velocity

20343082
post	get
when i search for something like asp.net ajax post web service i get lots of stuff on the server-side control scriptmanager

20343089
hex	binary
you can code in hex or in binary like this

20343102
setcontentview	findviewbyid
i read somewhere that this makes sense because this lazyadapter is calling findviewbyid before setcontentview or something

20343104
subtract	add
when i am running my second rivision server with first revision client instead of calling add it is calling subtract method

20343159
int	boolean
by definition of the int boolean interactions thus the false branch is entered

20343177

20343432
superclass	subclassing
only subclassing object created.and only constructor of superclass calls

20343432
superclass	subclassing
so you can come to a conclusion like when class subclassing extends superclass then methods variables are copied to class subclassing

20343449
folder	dir
open cmd window and change dir to appropriate folder

20343460
innodb	myisam
you are most likely using myisam which does not support foreign key references - in order to use these you will need to change the engine on all of your tables to innodb

20343465
superclass	subclassing
- you don t create superclass object because the only created object is a subclassing object

20343465
superclass	subclassing
- in another perspective yes you do create a superclass object because a subclassing object is a superclass object

20343465
superclass	subclassing
in other words superclass obj new subclassing

20343828
hide	show
why don t you take a static variable for the status of check box to show or to hide

20343837
int	double
i think your error is in the convert function by multiplying a int with a decimal you are automatically converting it to a double

20343837
int	double
so either return a double or cast it to a int

20343854
maven	pom.xml

20343870
superclass	subclassing
so in that sense the answer is no because the object s runtime class is subclassing not superclass

20343870
superclass	subclassing
however the new subclassing object is also considered to be an instance of superclass

20343870
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
in oop inherited extends in java denotes an is-a relationship and in that sense a subclassing is a superclass and therefore sub also is a superclass

20343870
superclass	subclassing
now the constructor creates an object of subclassing and a separate object of superclass

20343870
superclass	subclassing
the subclassing object contains the member fields declared for superclass plus the member fields declared for the subclassing

20343870
superclass	subclassing
the subclassing constructor calls a superclass constructor which probably initializes the fields declared for superclass

20343870
superclass	subclassing
if new member fields are declared in the subclassing then yes a subclassing presumably uses more memory since it has all the fields declared in the superclass plus all the fields declared in the subclassing

20343877
int	double
however since you are converting temperatures from celsius to fahrenheit it is better to use double or float values instead of int to yield more accurate and meaningful output

20343892
int	double
you are getting a compiler warning informing you of a loss of precision by specifying that convert returns an int while the expression returns a double as 1.8 is of type double

20343892

screens	tablet
the problem is that many users still user desktops with a screens that have the width of 1024px and tablet width is also 1024px

20350535

the fact the both screens have the same width is conflicting the whole system as when the website is visited from a desktop of a screens with width 1024px it applies the tablet version

width	height
components like textarea which reflow their contents to fit the available width or height may use this property to stabilize their measured size

20356362

if it wasn t i would store it off to the side but not before adding a listener to its show and hide event

20356415
jtextfield	jslider

what i do to manage a case similar to yours is checking beforehand my local state to know whether the user has already bought the non-consumable item and then show hide the purchase option

20356464
return-value-optimization	nrvo
let s analyse #1 returns the name of an argument not a local variable so neither return-value-optimization nor nrvo applies here

20356464
return-value-optimization	nrvo
as above there s no return-value-optimization neither nrvo here because you re returning the name of an argument

20356466

the usual approach will be you will have some sort of manager class which will have reference to both the cop and the bankrobber reading their values via getter and setting new values via setter

20356612
unsigned	short
but i was unable to exchange the texture s type or the texture itself while maintaining the old state being able to handle unsigned char and unsigned short at the same time

20356616

memcpy	realloc
you can mimic the behavior of realloc manually using new delete and memcpy

20356770
free	malloc	free	realloc	realloc	malloc
by the way you should always use the same family of methods either malloc realloc free or new delete and not mix realloc with new delete

20356771
mousemove	mouseenter
here working fine if write mouseenter event in mousemove but it getting much slower

20356828
realloc	malloc
the closest you can come in standard c++ without resorting to the c holdovers malloc and realloc is to use

20356838
submit	submission	pop-up	dialog
some of my forms require a custom submit handler which conditionally pop-up a confirmation dialog before submission independent of validation

20356838
submit	submission
i would think that validation would prevent both the submission and the submit handler from running

20356845
realloc	malloc
it is not a good idea to use malloc realloc with new

20356868
google-chrome	firefox
this code creates a nice vertical scrollbar for me in firefox and google-chrome

20356874
macports	homebrew
if you re a homebrew user instead of macports homebrew has an ant recipe

20356880
post	get
i ve verified that the login form backend sees the redirect_to get parameter and that the login submission includes the redirect_to post value...but thats where things don t work

20356893
width	height
in this case you would have to set the width of your button to 700 500 50px and the height would be 800 500 50px

20356902
aggregate-functions	sum
once you use an aggregate-functions like sum you will have to aggregate or group by on each field in your select

textview	imageview
use a linearlayout and incorporate two textview around your imageview

20357043
post	get
access-control-allow-methods get post

20357049
put	get
as a software engineer who professionally writes code that produces and consumes pdf let me state that when i get tasked with having to put in special cases in my code to deal with non-spec compliant pdf a little piece of me dies inside

20357049
dictionary	map
if you had abcba for input the output string in pdf would be 000 001 002 001 000 and would map to a font with an encoding dictionary with a differences array that would be

20357066
postgresql	mysql
for example id in the sample table is the primary key so we know it is unique in the table so the following query conforms to the sql standard and would run in mysql and fail in many dbms currently at the time of writing postgresql is the closest dbms i know of to correctly implementing the standard - example here

20357138
getter	setter
a common pattern is to use getter and setter so we would want to be able to repeatedly invoke getter while looking for a null

20357155
min	max
if can be used after select to tell the database to return only unique rows or it can be used within an aggregate function min max count etc. to tell that function that it should be applied only to the set of unique values for that field

20357191
children	parent
this should pretty much be like setting a parent control to isenabled false which also disables all children

20357191
children	parent
is there probably another approach to getting all relevant children recursively set to read-only through a binding on a parent element

20357207
strftime	strtotime
or like the error message suggest you can at the top of your script before any calls to functions like date strftime or strtotime set this

20357274
folder	directory
this should copy images and js folder into your webapp directory and you can use sth like this for the js file

20357275
bash	subshell
the problem is your pipe which in bash not ksh creates a subshell

20357280
min	max
edit 2 a big part of the problem with the way that you re keeping track of min and max is in your evaluation function

20357280
min	max
you are then basing the score of that board off of who the current player is but the point of having a min player and a max player is that you don t need to know who the current player is to evaluate the board

20357280
min	max
for instance if you are saying that x is always max and y is always min then you don t need to bother keeping track of both player and piece

20357280
int	boolean
additionally having evaluate_aux sometimes return a boolean and sometimes return an int is confusing

20357297
google-chrome	firefox
i am out of ideas why my tests are running fine on firefox but not in google-chrome

20357333

20357813
children	parent
my preferred solution for this problem is to put the tail command and its consumer into a subshell and let the filter logic kill the parent and its children which includes the tail process

20357813
children	parent
in this approach the end-marker detection logic pid 104 looks for its parent pid 102 and all of its children and kills the whole batch -- including itself

20357833
for-loop	loops
your for-loop does not have a body so your last couple of lines reference i outside loops where it is not defined

20357881
post	get
when you execute the ajax request or submit a form post you are actually making another request to the server similar to the get request you did to initially load the page

20357953
for-loop	arrays
you should almost never use for-loop - the only reason to use it is to write your own iterator but you are acting on arrays here - use each method

20357962
put	get
but if i put it in the header so it will react for every page i get a redirect loop because it will try to redirect the actual login page to itself

min	max
parse the value first and just compare it with a min max value afterwards because there is no better way than regex to check how big the decimal value contained by the string is

min	max
you should really just parse it as a decimal without bounds checking it and then check the min max values after you ve parsed it into a numeric value

int	chars
nothing is different -- except of course when you have a habit of adding up a to b a nonsense operation on text or converting to and from int which is as okay as it is with regular ascii text with occasional high ascii chars if you take care of conversions when they may happen you should be fine

20362146
versioning	upgrade
i recently upgrade to tortoisesvn versioning 1.8.3 i was using 1.7.x before and it appears that there is now an option to do exactly this

20362264
equals	compareto
and if you implement both and it would make sense if your equals method returns true for all the cases where your compareto method returns 0 and for your equals method to return false for all the cases where your compareto method returns a non-zero value

20362303
post	get
if you get code-level impersonation to work with your workflow i would be really interested in seeing you post an update

20362360

there is also some syntax errors in the definition of def containsonlyodds lst you should fix the indentation of loops and if-statement

20362392

i m implementing a min max heap in c and am trying to do it in general since i ll need it for a future project

20362772
int	chars
when i say a file contains text data or it is a text file i usually mean you can read it with a particular encoding and thus a file that mixes text and binary becomes a little difficult because if you assume it is text data your program might crash on bytes that should be treated as binary data eg two bytes for an int rather than converting it to a chars in whatever encoding you re using

20362804
textview	imageview
first set the imageview then align the textview accordingly using the id of the imageview

20362804
textview	imageview
the result will be a imageview with an overlayed textview

20362927
children	parent
but with angular 1.2 things have changed such that the isolate scope of the parent is truly isolated--the children inherit the scope that exists outside the parent directive rather than sharing its isolated scope

20362927
children	parent
i ve started retrofitting my existing code to share the controller from the parent directive with the nested children but i feel that s the wrong way to go once i get into the situation where the children need to listen for changes on the shared scope.

20362945
put	get
if i put i get one line array foo.txt i am a file.txt bar.jpg etc.

20362958

20363065
tabcontrol	tabitem
steffen opel solved my problem with his link wpf validation errors disappear inside tabcontrol when switching tabitem

20363076

multiplying	add	range	min
a simple approach would be to use lcg_value and multiplying with the range and add the min value

20363432
maven	pom.xml
then if you use maven you add this to your pom.xml

20363432
children	parent
if you have multiple projects assuming they are maven you can make them all children of one parent project and run mvn sonar sonar on the parent it will analyze all the children for you

20363463
vim	emacs
this can be done really quickly with the correct vim or emacs setup.

20363526

of course set up a width and height variable

20363559

20363562
for-loop	loops
i m assuming i should do some sort of do while or do until or for-loop for this but then i get confused conceptually on whether to declare my variables in or outside of the loops and then how to concatenate possibly multiple unlisted names into the same message box at the end

20363565

you ll want to use a gridview or listview and an arrayadapter inflated with the above layout

20363654
int	double
so my variables are like double and int

no way of filtering grouping search results

20363743
put	get

20364018
folder	directory
in the same directory of the file i have an folder called images and the file to that image

20364025
fflush	gets
you re never closing the stream and so probably never flushing the stream either - the text essentially gets cached when you print it out and gets fflush to the file in chunks usually chunks that are much bigger than what you re writing hence the lack of output.

20364037
clang	llvm
it seems that you have the clang headers installed but not the llvm headers which clang relies upon

20364275
mongodb	bson
one thing you could do is simply not filter by serial_id at all if you detect that the list of wantedids is too large either because it would hit the bson limit or because it would cause mongodb to scan almost the entire collection

20364285
nsformatter	nsnumberformatter
since the labelformatter uses an nsformatter your custom formatter should override -stringforobjectvalue not -stringfromnumber which is specific to nsnumberformatter

20364293

post	get
i d post an image of the view before launching the uiimagepicker but i don t have enough reputation points and i don t really know how to get them either

red is a uitableviewcell hide and show blue tableview on click

20365218
width	height
yes you need to trigger a resize on the container each time on orientation change with js then calculate your designed width height aspect ratio then resize your container to screen.height then multiply your screen height your desired aspect then that result is your width then check if your width is not minor than screen width if not is good if true make the same but in backwards dividing screen width desired aspect ratio

20365218
width	height
in this way you can build percentually inside the container and will allways look the same in any kind of stuff the only change will be a strip on the width or height depending your aspect ratio and your device specs but it will be allways at biggest possible way

20365223
next	except
so each level except the last maps to the next level of map

20365241

20365620

a property is basically syntax sugar for a setter getter

20365620
getter	setter
but in the end it s just a setter getter

what i m having trouble with is calculating the new width new height and new points of the rectangle after i ve dragged one of the rectangle s points

20366892
width	height
if the rectangle were not rotated this would obviously be very easy because the width and height would change by the same amout as the mouse s offsetx and offsety

20366892
width	height
however this rectangle can be rotated so offsetx and offsety don t match up to the changes in width height

20366892

20366892

it s only when i click post or any other link on the admin panel to make a new post that i get the following error

20367124
int	double
in one case you say that the same operator has to accept double and int

20367124
int	double
you can get around this easily be converting the last case to double then back to an int but you could also lose precision doing this and it probably isn t what you want to do if you re going to treat as int division

20367133
int	chars
int main int argc const chars argv

20367147
int	double
you can always parse to int or double if you need to at some point but it will be easier to sort and search with a homogenous data type

my personal favorite is caliburn.micro which includes an eventaggregator a service that provides the ability to publish an object from one viewmodel to another in a loosely-coupled fashion

20367436
getter	setter
you should use getter and setter inside the code

20367476
decltype	auto
in addition to that in c++14 you can also use decltype auto which mirrors decltype auto as that of variables for your function to deduce its return value using decltype semantics

20367476
decltype	auto
an example would be that for forwarding functions for which decltype auto is particularly useful

20367476
decltype	auto
with the use of decltype auto you mimic the actual return type of func when called with the specified arguments

you can make a wrapper div with a class and define id to the link as i did and use jquery s .toggle if you want to toggle or use hide and .show if you just want to hide and show once

20368622
textview	imageview
if you define a linearlayout containing an imageview and a textview it s a lot easier to manipulate the size of the image being displayed

20368771
post	get
you can get current post id with this code

20368817

uiswitch	uibutton
you can you use uiswitch control for on off or you can also use separate uibutton for on off

20369085
post	get
for fundamental types such as int it really doesn t matter but you may want to get in the habit of using the pre-increment over the post increment because the post increment has to create a copy perform the increment and return the copy

20369086
hide	show
if you re going to hide them and then show you ll need to call reflow or fire the resize event to get things to calculate the correct sizes

20369292
vsto	add-in
we ve had initially major problems when we started in 2009 getting vsto add-in invantive control for 32- and 64-bit excel some sheets required 64-bit to handle the full volume of data please note limitations of .net array in 4.0 consider 4.5 to run with any oracle version installed for instance 32-bit 10g or 11g might be encountered already installed in combination with any office version why o why do people still run 32 bit....

20369335

20370185
post	get
since response of post call is null always i get following stacktrace when calling getallsongs

20370208
int	chars
the most tedious but ultimately quite simple part will probably be dealing with the fact that in c++ chars is simply a small int type on which you can do normal int math

20370208
ord	chr	pascal	delphi
at least if memory serves in pascal or a derivative like delphi you ll need ord to convert from a character to an ordinal and chr to convert back from ordinal to character

20370208
ord	chr
will end up something more like chr ord a + in mod base

20370268

20370547
win64	windows
there are also native windows ports of dos2unix available win32 and win64

20370552

20370626
free	malloc
another possibility would be always to use malloc and not to use the delete operator but free to release the array later

20370731
persistent	transient
but if you don t want to persistent your list then you need to move your list creation logic from the setter method to some other method and annotate this method with transient annotation

20370771
post	get
another way would be using post instead of get

20370778
free	memcpy
if you need to write such a function you need to allocate a new memory area copy data to it maybe using memcpy function or simillar and free the old memory

20370857

my suggestion for this kind of requirement is to use an md5 hash

20373757
hash	md5
populate it for every record with an md5 hash of anything maybe the value from the id column or just any old random number doesn t matter too much as long as each record is different

hash	md5
if the md5 from your select query results in a hash that is larger than the last record in your table you might get no records from the query

having a fixed md5 hash on each record means that the records are in a fixed order

the suffix land indicates landscape mode the particle sw###dp indicates the minimum dimension width or height so i guess that in you case you could prepare some folders called values-sw480dp and values-sw480dp-land and there you would put your dimens.xml file with the special dimensions for that particular device

i am showing toast of a textview text of the same listview on imageview click

20377904
pem	pkcs#12	hex	binary
the other bit of the puzzle in case you get here before discovering the key issue is that the key file you download from the console is pkcs#12 and is downloaded as hex text so i converted that to binary and then converted that to a pem so i could include it in the source code

20377935
sip	agi
i used to send agi requests from asterisk sip server to an external app and reply back with commands like dial ...

20377936

height width x 100 in this case 9 16 x 100 56.25

20378210
for-loop	arrays
in addition for the second for-loop for printing int arrays you d better using x aone i .length instaed of x aone.length since it will cause issue when the number of rows and the numbers of columns in int arrays are different

20378234
ssl	https
to backends but it would still need the ssl certificates for the https to function on client side

20378234
apache	nginx
this is why usually the ssl offloading is done on the top level in your case it would be nginx which then passes the x-forwarded-for header to varnish which further passes it to apache and apache converts it to client ip

20378303
post	get
when there is a get or post variable xdebug_session_start or the xdebug_session cookie is set xdebug will try to connect to a debugclient

20378812
matlab	simulink
i m running monte carlo simulation for a simulink model with a matlab script that looks more or less like this

20378833
getter	setter
i expect we would need to see the definition of student you have given the constructor but not the getter setter

20378889

that because i will use it to solve a problem in my assignment the code works fine if the numbers are from the same data type for example int and int but if it is from different data types like double and int it no longer works as if static key word on m is not exist

20379266
int	double
i need to know it dose not work with different data types when using int and double while iam using template

i m using i686-w64-mingw32-g++ instead of gcc g++ because the dll can t be opened otherwise

20379321
getter	setter
i just wanted to ask for opinions from pros on how to improve my code writing and how to add a setter getter method to it like some validations like returning something when the inputted value is not correct

20379368
jboss	weblogic
we ve used many versions of this product from version 8.3.0.0 up to 8.5.0.8 with it s cmod web enablement kit odweb java api and in several platforms such as aix windows and linux using weblogic jboss and ibm was as app servers

20379386
maven	pom.xml
for example if you are using maven you would ensure the following was in your pom.xml

20379432
min	max
obviously getting both the max and min would be a bit trickier and uglier but is doable

20379433
min	max
using min and max would also work and be a lot simpler

20379442
google-chrome	safari
this simple code works on iphone safari windows google-chrome android mobile google-chrome no problem

20379482
udp	tcp
i wrote a udp http tcp server on my linux

20379486
getter	setter
when having an application built inside a single main class having getter and setter does not make much sense

20379486
getter	setter
getter and setter make sense when you re trying to apply encapsulation on some classes applying the java beans principles

20379486
getter	setter
then it would make sense to define getter and setter

20379486
getter	setter
moreover getter and setter are used to expose instance fields not static variables

20379538
getter	setter
i ve not created getter setter for test

20379539
getter	setter
these should be private and if the user needs to know about them then there should be some getter and setter to retrieve them

20379539
getter	setter
getter and setter

20379539
getter	setter
with your shiny new improved code maybe it s time to add some getter and setter

20379546
folder	directory
this leads to a directory structure similar to this in the app_code folder

20379585
client-side	server-side
even if there is client-side validation you can t trust it or assume that it ran properly and would want to re-validate server-side anyway

20379619
entity-relationship	diagram
where it gets confusing is that a lot of professionals use entity-relationship diagram to depict a relational model rather than an entity-relationship model

innodb	myisam
nb your db must support foreign keys for example myisam doesn t support it but innodb does

20379636

20379667
getter	setter
in the getter setter method like this

20379670
getter	setter
you do need getter setter inside each of the entities such as

20379670
children	parent
existing parent with new cascading children don t have this problem

20379680
put	get
you put that directly on the property you want to validate so you get the desired behavior of the validation error being associated to the senior property

20379814
width	height
by setting the width and height it means the view can effectively control the dimensions of the modal dialog due to the container window s setting

20379814
width	height
i suspect i ll need to use a different approach to setting the initial window size such as providing the width and height for the window to bind to unless i m missing a simple solution

20379814
width	height
i ve found a solution by removing the sizetocontent option from the parent window and removing the width height from the user control xaml

20380289
int	double
in this case i check two different arguments for their type compatibility by converting them to pointer otherwise int and double would be compatible

20380306
pop-up	dialog
i m not sure what you re trying to do but consider things like modal dialog using javascript and css where appropriate and just opening links with target _new and letting the user s preference and browser dictate whether that s a pop-up or a new tab

i am writing an asp.net application that has a gridview that uses an objectdatasource to fill it with data from a list of objects that is populated by a rest call

basically - you should use active record only if all you need are glorified setter an getter that talk to database

20383699
hash	md5
instead of basing the name off the page name try concatenating all of the filenames in order and calculating an md5 hash to use as your bundle name - this serves as a fairly good uniqueness check and should really cut down on your bandwidth usage

20383861
dbcontext	objectcontext
dbcontext simply acts like a wrapper around objectcontext

20383861

wadl	wsdl
rsdl aims to turn rest like a hypermedia in other words it has more information than a service descriptor like wsdl or wadl

20384259
wadl	wsdl
my conclusion now a days wadl is more common that rest and integration frameworks like camel cxf already supports wadl generate and consume because it is similar to wsdl therefore most easy to understand in this migration process soap to rest

20384896
hide	show
i might be completely wrong about this but i believe the correct way to show and hide things in angular is to use the ng-hide show directive

20384896
hide	show
effectively just modify the following css to get the transition you want to show or hide the element

20384915
sse	avx
simd sse avx with intrinsics or with a simd library

20384926

hide	show
in viewdidload i determine if i need to show hide the middle button and set the frames for the view and bottom buttons appropriately

20385354
hide	show
based off of alienwebguy s answer but without hide and show ing the element instead just animating the opacity

20385374
submit	submission
not all browsers interpret a click attached to a submit button as submission the form so you are effectively just negating the click of that button

20385374
submit	submission
preventing a form submission should preferably be captured by attaching the submit handler to the when you have a or so this is the best way to assure success

20385413

that makes 32 points per circle x 3 add or subtract operations per point + 6 add subtract shift operations per iteration 102 add subtract or shift operations per calculated point

20385453
matplotlib	cartopy
as far as i understand the cartopy module simply enables matplotlib to treat its plots or drawings as coordinates and projects these to real world geographic projections

20385453
matplotlib	cartopy
now i ve seen questions and guides on how to embed matplotlib into tkinter but these always involve creating a matplotlib figure and then using the show method and figurecanvastkagg on that figure whereas the instructions to create a cartopy map is usually to simply use the pyplot s axes method while providing a cartopy projection object and then using show with the pyplot module instead of the figure object

20385453
matplotlib	cartopy
i ve tried some different things but i just can t make sense of how to reconcile these two approaches creating a cartopy matplotlib and embedding matplotlib in tkinter

20385453
matplotlib	cartopy
i have experience with cartography python and tkinter but i m new to matplotlib and cartopy so it might be that i just don t understand these modules enough yet

int	double	int	chars
one of the following types bool byte chars double float int long sbyte short string uint ulong or ushort

20385531

however when you use an imageview you can set the width and height to match_parent and then use a feature called android scaletype in the layout xml and use the centercrop option and it will automatically.

20385531
textview	imageview
for your purpose i would recommend using a relativelayout and putting an imageview and then a textview on it

20385650
rtp	rtcp
rtp rtcp sockets etc

20385650
rtp	rtcp
sending frames in real-time over rtp rtcp is the correct approach

20385650
rtsp	rtcp	rtp	rtcp	rtp	rtsp
it contains many of the necessary steps including how to configure the encoder packetise to rtp send rtcp as well as some rtsp server functionality

20385665
versioning	upgrade
as with library versioning use of two sets of annotations is not optimal but doing so may help reduce risk of versioning upgrade

20385708
puma	thin
but if you re doing a lot of blocking io such as http calls to external apis like twitter puma still improves mri s throughput by allowing blocking io to be run concurrently eventmachine-based servers such as thin turn off this ability requiring you to use special libraries

20385767
ubuntu	centos
centos 6.4 and ubuntu 13.10

20385882
for-loop	arrays
for-loop - make new arrays going to be horrible on large arrays

20386211

in there i have a couple of folder in the root directory where i am storing some logs and files

20386256
google-chrome	firefox
this solution must work for ie8+ firefox google-chrome

20386259

20386288
pop-up	dialog
often they also include mobile widgets fancy dialog selectors that pop open and look just like the native pop-up on ios or android

20386298
width	height
there are height and width attributes available to use in tags but this will just scale the image to the size you specify in browser

20386298
width	height
you may also consider adding constraints for height width into the css of the item-thumb class you are already using

20386301
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i don t set options the third parameter preferring to fall back on browser defaults and it works perfectly in google-chrome firefox and safari

20386310
hide	show
when it evaluates to true then it will hide the column when it evaluates to false it will show the column

20386337
google-chrome	safari
if the former it s because google-chrome safari are out of compliance with the html5 specs the event should never be fired on page load

20386338
mp3	ogg
muses radio player supports mp3 acc+ and ogg streams

20386345

im writing a simple login test using rspec 3 and capybara 2.2.0 and cannot for the life of me figure out why this test keeps failing

20386363
nsfilemanager	uimanageddocument
the uimanageddocument will have created this sqlite file inside the uimanageddocument package a directory so you need to get the url to the original sqlite file and use this as the url in the new version of the app if necessary use the nsfilemanager to move the file to another location but that s not really necessary

20386385
button	checkbox
button and then uncheck the break checkbox and check the ignore subsequent exceptions checkbox and then click ok to close the dialog

20386398
mayavi	matplotlib
anyway if you re willing to do advanced 3d stuff mayavi is way better than matplotlib

notification hub is a wrapper over mpns wns apns gcm optimized for large arrays of notifications

20386499
serializable	deserialization
i m working on a system for serializable deserialization and i m trying to get some really fancy stuff going with functions

20386514
int	chars
a chars is 16 bits and an int is 32 bits

20386514
int	chars
every time you add 1 to your int ptr you re adding 2 chars pointers worth

20386515
mediacodec	glsurfaceview
i have an example application full source that encodes camera frames with mediacodec while displaying them on a glsurfaceview

20386534
qmenubar	qmainwindow	qmenubar	qwidget	qmainwindow	qwidget
this means qmainwindow qmenubar or qmenu can not be used since they inherit qwidget

20386578
width	height
since i don t want to use a set width height that would distort the proportion of some images i just set the height to fit the design and let the browser resize the width accordingly

20386620
range	max	range	min	min	max
well the documentation shows you an example of how to override the messages for one of the default validation constraints blank nullable min max size range etc.

20386626

but some of them are portrait and some of theme are landscape

20386626
portrait	landscape
in xml i have two files one for portrait picture and one for landscape

20386632
int	chars
chars is 16 bits while int is 32 so after cast you read 32 bits at the time

20386648
children	parent
you can not change the effect on any of the children that is inside of the parent div

20386648
children	parent
then the children are located inside the parent which are nested nice and cozily in there

20386648
children	parent
since the children are nested inside of the parent container they will then become transparent due to the parent container being transparent

20386660
hash	salt
this function will handle all the tricky parts like generating a safe salt and will include the salt in the resulting hash

20386759
feof	atoi	fgets	feof	fgets	atoi
feof will return non-zero after the fgets has failed the null argument will probably allready havecrash atoi

20386792
min	max
matlab already takes the absolute value for max or min for complex numbers

20386792
min	max
so another quick way to do this would be min test+1i -1i or max test+1i -1i

20386806
portrait	landscape
if you add your fragment to your activity programmatically you can check to see if your picture is landscape or portrait and then launch whichever fragment you d like

20386806
width	height	portrait	landscape
in order to determine whether your image is landscape or portrait - by which i assume you mean whether the image is wider than it is tall or not you could load the image into a bitmap and check its width vs its height

20386866
getter	setter
use integer as the type and provide setter getter accordingly

20386868
getter	setter
if it s actually supposed to be a method for setting superteamname then change the name of the function setsuperteamname would seem appropriate or better yet change it into a property with a getter and a setter

20386875
prop	each
there are many vbscript documents around that do something like for each prop in object.properties_ so i assume this is somehow possible

20386904

int are castable to chars up to 2 16 because the the same 16 bits that express that int can be reinterpreted to express a chars in utf-16

20386938
int	chars
an int is 4 bytes to chars 2 so by incrementing as your int pointer does in units of sizeof int 4bytes rather than chars or byte 2 you are moving forward 32 bits reading 16 and then skipping forward another 32 causing you to skip every other chars

int	chars
now what you want to do is take a look at the string javadoc and figure out how you could replace a chars using the method substring int beginindex int endindex

20387564
int	chars
and then you think of a way how you can combine that in a for-loop with charat int index which gives you the chars at the specified index

20387584

make sure password columns are hash and salt and don t do this yourself - there are libraries available for this that are security-tested

20387707
integer	unsigned
and if you can convert a pointer value to an unsigned 32-bit or 64-bit integer the maximum value of that integer is going to be 2 32 -1 or 2 64 -1 respectively

20387707

using lehmer code any permutation of a sequence of n elements can be encoded and mapped to a decimal number using the factorial number system

20387806
udp	tcp
so when you say that tcp transfers the data then you re right http could work over other transport protocols such as udp but that is rarely seen but tcp transfers all your data whether you download a file from a webserver copy a shared folder on your local network between computers or send an email

20387823
children	parent
it seems like you ll have to persist the parent before adding children to it

20388073
java.util.calendar	java.util.date
as with the present java se 8 release with it s excellent date time api with java.time these kind of calculation can be done more easily instead of using java.util.calendar and java.util.date

20388315
versioning	upgrade
look at the change log or upgrade guide of the new versioning example

20388471
put	get
i often times put in the same name as the class so don t get the two confused in the code below

20388491
getter	setter
if you want to use setter getter is up to you

20388491
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome has support firefox has its own observer system and so forth so if you use those you need to prepare your code to handle situations where it isn t supported

my two test cases are google-chrome and firefox

20388581
google-chrome	firefox
while google-chrome shows the pages as expected firefox s child in example inner div with 100 height does not take up all of the parents height

20388581
google-chrome	firefox
as you may note from the images google-chrome correctly fills the available height with its light blue background colour while firefox does not

20388609
profiling	debugging
i edited the scheme build settings for build for profiling so that it would build a debugging build rather than a release build and things started working

20388658
lodash	underscore.js
i m looking for a lodash or underscore.js function that will return the result of .tap

20388679
int	double
if you are sure the numerals have at most two digits and are of moderate magnitude reading them as double multiplying by 100 and rounding to the nearest int will produce the correct result

20388679
int	double
simply casting a double to an int truncates not rounds to nearest and will sometimes produce incorrect results due to floating-point rounding errors

20388697
lodash	underscore.js
i like your code though because it shows how to use underscore.js lodash to sort pages by other properties

20388699
int	chars
when you use 10.10f you are telling printf use 10 chars positions to print the number optional minus sign int part decimal point and decimal part

20388728
move	drag
i use sourcetree and every time i drag and drop the files to the staging area they simply do not move

ubuntu	centos
even though this is a centos question here are the instructions for ubuntu

20388862
division	multiplication
perform the multiplication division

20388866
fadein	fadeout
otherwise you will run into issues of trying to fadein and fadeout at the same time if your delay is shorter than your fadein

20388888
getter	setter
getter setter

20388913
for-loop	loops
this can be done with a simple for-loop or with a foreach loops

20388913
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
in my opinion a for-loop would be easier than a foreach loops since you re using 2 arrays and a for-loop can give you an integer for an index to use for both

20388940
jstl	taglib
yes you can not call java functions from jstl as you are doing try using this functions taglib

20388965
folder	directory
the directory is correct the folder is there and previous uses of the folder have worked

20388996
ubuntu	linux
ok i have gnustep installed on both a windows 7 machine and an ubuntu linux machine

20389074
screens	tablet
take advantage of extra screens area available in tablet

20389084
serializable	deserialization
while i can think of a couple of cute uses for this - like parsing incoming data that has multiple representations for the same value - it is really quite a terrible thing to do in most real-world environments especially if you want to be able to do fully symmetric serializable deserialization

20389174
mouseover	mouseout
i would take a slightly different approach by taking the mouseover and mouseout attributes out of your image tag

20389174
mouseover	mouseout
note that i am using 3 images from flickr the default one on mouseover and one on mouseout

20389187
for-loop	loops
see i have a boolean method that gets the divisors that work by moding the number by a divisor that is checked and determined true by a for-loop not the first one that just loops the program for a determined amount of input

20389213
put	get
i noticed that i get a fatal signal 11 sigsegv at 0x00000004 code 1 in the logcat when i put this line probably because the inactive body is still in the contactlistener

20389220
oncreate	recreate
if you save the state of the application in a bundle typically non-persistent dynamic data in onsaveinstancestate it can be passed back to oncreate if the activity needs to be recreate orientation change so that you don t lose this prior information

20389223
width	height
i am creating an application that users will be typing item dimensions such as width height depth and also weight of the item

20389223
int	double
int string double decimal ..

20389223
width	height
my own approach is to create a dimensiontype table and when the user selects the dimension lets say for width height and depth as cm it will keep a foreign key the type of the dimension and it will store the data

20389224
minimum	max
when you view this navigation menu in a browser that has a minimum width of 200px max 767px and open the navigation menu all of the content is pushed down which is good as you can view all of the content however if you start to scroll down with the menu open the page content jumps upward at least 400+ pixels not allowing anyone to read 1 4 of the content on the page

20389336
for-loop	arrays
create an add some data using a for-loop and call bubblesort arrays

20389402
tinyint	varchar
tinyint varchar 30

20389402
tinyint	boolean
they should put in big letters and bold don t use the tinyint data type as primary key because symfony considered as boolean type and this may cause errors

20389410
google-chrome	firefox
we have a webpage at www.saddleback.com live and google-chrome and firefox cors ajax calls get aborted on some mac machines

20389459
put	get
instead of coding it this way i d create a new class entitled star or something of the sort which takes in an x position and a y position create set and get methods appropriately and then generates a number of random stars and put them into a star array to keep track of what you need to display delay and then black out again

20389473

google-chrome	safari
check out gifs of the animation on google-chrome and safari

20389567
getter	setter
obviously i can make it a private static variable and have getter and setter but i don t like this idea much either

20389576
put	get
simply put i want each level to require 50 more xp than last level and i need to get the level from an xp variable

20389627
keydown	keyup
hmm once i cleaned up some of your markup and replaced keyup keydown with keypress it s much smoother....

20389658
width	height
as a general rule of thumb store your data in a standardized format whether it s physical measures like length width height weight or date time information

20389717
for-loop	loops
there is nothing delaying your for-loop within your while loops from executing immediately so all images are appended at once then are faded out after a 3 second delay

20389717
setinterval	settimeout
take a look at the settimeout and setinterval functions

20389834
memcpy	malloc
one thing you should consider is that malloc is a very expensive function as compared to memcpy especially when concurrency is concerned

20389842
post	get
i am using the parse sdk and followed this blog post to get this case working

20389858
int	double
- for efficiency i created parallel interfaces and code that take primitive double and int and there this trick works just fine

20389868
put	get
this program just checks to see if the argument exists in any of the lists so for example if i put this north i will get the same result as this north or this north can i use isupper and islower

20389886
for-loop	arrays
if your logic is calling for calculating totals of 4 consecutive elements of the arrays then your for-loop should stop earlier

20389899
width	height
you could return an empty rectangle width and height 0 instead

20389923
min	max
generally speaking if you need to generate numbers from min to max including both you write

20389967
put	get
when i put only one line in the variable this order works well i get this error when the var has many lines and i need to copy all the lines 12 at least to the top of the file line by line

spock	grails	migrate	upgrade
i upgrade to grails 2.3 recently and try to migrate all old tests to spock integration test

20389999
versioning	upgrade
ok guys after wrestling with trying to upgrade the grails versioning for an existing application in intellij i decided to see if i could just make a new grails application with a new sdk

20390006

backing bean simply getter and setter

20390050

20390121
viewdidload	viewwillappear
but i found when i use the viewdidload or viewwillappear or view... etc methods to configure the subviews the subview will never add to the superview self.scrollview in here self.scrollview is a subview in the self.view see the original code below

20390121
super	self
if self super init

20390154
for-loop	loops
the only thing i can think of is a complicated for-loop or a giant nest of if loops

20390174
int	chars
the reason they re being printed as readable numbers is that the a - a expression evaluates to an int type - not chars - and int s do print in a human-readable numeric format

20390174
int	chars
the compiler s conceptually providing a int operator- int int function but no chars operator- chars chars and that forces subtraction of two chars values to be shoehorned into the int operator after undergoing the integral promotion

20390394
uiviewcontroller	uipageviewcontroller
i m using uipageviewcontroller to swipe through pages uiviewcontroller array

20390429
viewdidload	viewwillappear
in your viewdidload on the second view or viewwillappear is probably better set the background image to the image you put in the property

20390429
viewdidload	viewwillappear
and you should be good to go assuming you re doing everything properly in your second view controller s viewdidload or viewwillappear

20390915
width	height
they work only when fit 1 is set and specify width and height that slideshow should be set to have

20390950
express	node.js
i am running express and twit as node.js libraries

20390966
google-chrome	firefox
even more odd is that is only happening in google-chrome firefox and ie work fine

20390997
background-image	background-position
if that s possible in your context i d suggest setting the image as background-image for your text container with background-position left and adding a padding-left to avoid having the text on top of the image

20391089
children	parent
if i want to delete a parent i also want to delete its children and its children children and so forth

onfocus	onblur
you can then give each of them an onfocus handler that does element.show and an onblur to effect element.hide and simply keep the wrapper an inert wrapper

20406418
onfocus	onblur
that way if your users tab into the element it shows up they hit tab the browser finds the next tabbable element based on tabindex onblur fires on the old element and onfocus fires on the new element

20407048
for-loop	loops
i am pretty sure a while loops inside a for-loop inside is all that is necessary

in current css2 and css3 you cannot set font-size of a div relative to anything but the font-size of the parent div except in css3 where you can set it to the viewport i believe this is supported but buggy but not relative to the parent div width

20407697
width	font-size
you can use javascript to measure the div and set the font-size of a child div but a better idea might be to use an image of text that can resize itself by having width 100 so that it always fills the parent div exactly

20409123
children	parent
therefor the semantic html can help using position relative for the parent menu s and position absolute for the children

20409123
mouseleave	mouseenter
in that case we can use focusin mouseenter and focusout mouseleave as suggested by pomax earlier

20409123

20409614

20409620
width	height
the width and height are unknown as i m using wordpress created thumbnails

20409620

i suppose i could determine the width and height through javascript and apply a margin-left 50 and half the width negative left value but i d rather not if possible

qabstractitemmodel	qabstractlistmodel
since you re inheriting from qabstractlistmodel it ll work like qabstractitemmodel

another thing to mention is they are int boolean text everything

20409836
min	max
the idea is similar to binarysearch i just divide the array into two halves and calculate the min and max of each half and update my min and max fields accordingly

20409836
min	max
this would mean the min and max values must not have updated correctly

20409934
post	get
use post instead of get to prevent people from changing parameters and redirect them as soon as they are done to a new page or the same with no post parameters

20409939

terminate the string with a different delimiter than cr linefeed at the end and then pass that delimiter to readln so it knows when to stop reading

20409953

i do adb push databases and it should copy databases folder to my home directory but it throws me device not found error which is strange to me because everything works until that point

20410024

but you have to add container view permanently on a storyboard then you can just show hide it by sethidden method

i have a c# com-exposed .net assembly which i use heavily as a library for vb6 clients office vba

20410325

20410325
mouseup	mousedown
for the form to submit you must mousedown and mouseup while the mouse is over the send button

20410327
getter	setter
use getter setter rather than direct access to dependencies

20410337
serializable	deserialization
these might prove faster for simple use cases as you avoid deserialization and serializable

20410344

getter	setter
this is telling the compiler to make a getter and setter for the property mytableview and backing it with an ivar named mytableview_

20412632

20413005
abstract-class	superclass
and so on where there are a total of 50+ concrete classes the hierarchy is fairly shallow abstract-class superclass - abstract-class subsuperclass - abstract-class subsubsuperclass - class concreteclass is as deep as it goes and a concrete class never extends another concrete class

20413005
superclass	subclassing
ideally i d like to be able to tell the compiler that every subclassing of superclass has a corresponding implicit object for method in the type class and so s.method is type-safe or i ll get a compile time error if i ve neglected to implement a corresponding implicit object for a subclassing of superclass but instead all i ve been able to come up with is

20413018
emacs	aquamacs
i am not sure if this is a bug in aquamacs gnu emacs 23.4.1 or what but it seems i can t something very simple bring the cursor somewhere in the text by click then press shift and down arrow to select multiple line of text

cos	sin
as tal darom wrote in the comments you can replace every periodic feature x with two features cos x and sin x after normalizing to radians

20413384
cos	sin
as you can verify using a simple plot or by realizing that these cos sin pairs are really coordinates on the unit circle that this distance is maximal and the dot product minimal between two of these cos sin vectors when the original angles differ by 180â

20413392

so removing the element has no effect as you get the html code for it before removing it and then use that html code to put all the original elements back

20413889
put	get
don t get the html code and put it back just use remove and append to remove and add elements

20413891
getter	setter
the one potentially-useful aspect is that it ensures that prevents the possibility of code overriding a property getter without realizing that the property also has a setter or overriding a property setter without realizing that the getter does something other than returning the expected backing field

20413891
getter	setter
implicit interface implementation in c# may ease the burden of having to define three properties since a class which defines will cause the compiler to implement the read-only method using the specified getter the write-only method using the specified setter and the read-write method using both but from the perspective of the framework there are in fact three separate properties and the get set of the read write property is independent of the get set properties associated with the read-only or write-only properties

i am in the middle of a project atm that requires the use of both aes and rsa encryption and i have heard many times that openssl is a good open source implementation of these algorithms

20415126
rsa	aes
using libraries is really something i have no idea how to use so i think it is quite possible i am completely over-complicating things somehow so if someone could either help me use this tutorial or just tell me how i can use openssl to have aes and rsa encryption in my project i would really appreciate it

20415138
button	checkbox
but checkbox radio button can only be a simple string value

the trouble is the aspect ratio is often wrong because i don t set the width and height

20415764
width	height
i only pass in the vimeo id dynamically so i don t set a width and height per video

20415764
width	height
-- but these only work if you set the correct aspect ratio to begin with using the width and height attributes

20415764
width	height
most new vimeo videos seem to be width 400 height 225 but my website deals with some older videos that don t share this ratio so you get black pipes either along the top and bottom of the video or down the sides

20415767
oncreate	setcontentview
you should call downloadthread.start in oncreate of activity after setcontentview

20415775

for margin auto to work your elements need to have a width given to them somehow usually through width

20415859
width	height
you can set fixed width and height values for html textboxes checkboxes in css by doing the following.

20415859

hopefully setting a fixed height and width should resolve your conflicting size problems

20415892
kerberos	ntlm
finally i think it is the ntlm causes the issue as here requires two credential hops which ntlm can t handle it need use kerberos

20415909

you can use the idfa for the purpose of tracking the user clicks for upgrade actual conversions and also identify distinct users between paid and lite versioning of your app

20416085
profiling	debugging
finally i strongly suggest you check out this video tutorial by one of the developers of unity on memory debugging and using the unity editor profiling properly

20416118

this would copy all the files to the output folder as per the desired directory structure

20416692
implements	extends
to create a service you have to create a class that extends from service base class and implements the function in an infinite loop such as while true in the onstartcommand function

20416708
explode	implode
if it is an array use implode or explode function

20416723
uitableview	nsindexpath
uitableviewcell tableview uitableview tableview cellforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

20416743
hash	md5
you can improve performance slightly simplify your code and remove an import by using python s builtin hash function instead of md5 from hashlib

20416756
profiling	instrumentation
on ios you can use xcode s opengl profiling instrumentation for both of those

20416812
vim	emacs
you cannot have a graphic editor you need to use any editors like nano as you said or vim emacs

20416831
perforce	svn
i have done this in the past with perforce but i don t see how to do this with svn

20416867

what i want is to have two buttons in my app which should download sample.csv and sample.php i want to attach this file inside my app file and save it to user directory preferably in download folder or somewhere user can access easily

20416917
fast-forward	merge
i heard that its best to avoid the git merge workflow and to rebase commits locally so you put your commits as clean commits on top of head on top of what other people have been doing resulting in a fast-forward merge which doesn t have all the merging going on

20417009
fast-forward	merge
this should result in a fast-forward merge to master and then i just push

20417145
typedef	struct
incidentally you don t need the typedef infront of your struct declaration

20417177
scatter	graphing
i have drawn several bar chart scatter and line graphing in spss 21 and spent lots of time on editing their look

20417226

however what you can do is to use inputoutputstream to copy your file from the internal directory to your desired folder and then delete the file from the app s directory

20417316
pop-up	dialog
if forceupgrade is true show a pop-up dialog with options to either let user quit the app or go to google play store to upgrade the app

20417316
pop-up	dialog
else if recommendupgrade is true show the pop-up dialog with options to update or to continue using the app

20417316
versioning	upgrade
even with this forced upgrade ability in place you should continue to support older versioning unless absolutely needed

20417326
typedef	struct
using typedef before a struct definition will then treat the struct variable as a type so if you use

20417341
telerik	radwindow

20417344
pickle	dill
check out dill which extends python s pickle library to support a greater variety of types including functions

20417358
for-loop	arrays
in the for-loop the variable value is not a reference to the original arrays

20417379
for-loop	arrays
for that you need to set value with arrays index instead of enhanced for-loop

20417396
for-loop	loops
take a datatable instead of dataset ds and before the for-loop and bind the grid after loops

20417397
execl	fork
i know that you can use fork execl to execute a program from within a program but i m having a little trouble writing the piping of the io

20417426
getter	setter
if you want to allow outside world to access these variables is better creating a getter and setter getloan that allows you to do any kind of validation security check before return loan so it gives you complete control of whatever you want to do and single channel of access for client which is controlled and managed

20417431
for-loop	arrays
the java enhanced for-loop uses an iterator to go through the arrays

20417431
for-loop	arrays
as others have suggested to get around this simple use a regular for-loop and manually assign values to indexed slots in the arrays ie

20417451
range	max	range	min	min	max
since you don t want values of -1 or +1 exactly you can offset the max and min of the range by some small positive amount that is appropriate for you such as eps epsilon .0001

20417451
min	max
alternatively if you are prepared to drop the min and max values which will be +1 and -1 according to the above transform they may or may not be unique min and max values too you could do the more simple situation

20417473
disk	ram
a hashmap resides in ram a database resides on the disk

20417510
many-to-many	many-to-one
many-to-one working even for our many-to-many scenario

dictionary	map
i would say that what the pairing view legacy_orders_view represents is the map dictionary saying the order with id x had these versions

20417521
put	get	post	get	post	put
of course this example is just for an image as you ve suggested but you can use curl for all kinds of remote data retrieval via http get post put delete etc

20417527
put	get
so the get and put methods on synchmap acquire a lock

20417612
typedef	struct
i use the second one in order to define a struct and also define a typedef for the struct at the same time

20417612
typedef	struct
just for the record if you want to leave out the typedef and only define a struct then you code would be

20417631
width	height
the error indicates that there aren t enough vertices 3 minimum which can only happen with a rect if you pass in a zero rect either because map is nil or the frame has no width height

20417712
children	parent
i have a table that contains parent and 0 or more children for each parent with a flag indicating which records are parent

20417712
children	parent
specifically this is a database of emails and attachments where each parent is an email and the children are the attachments.

20417732
typedef	struct
personally i find typedef-ing of structures to be a very bad habit since the struct identifier helps differentiate structures and typedef of atomic types

20417753
hide	show
the problem is when i mouse hover from the menu to the container itself with the same class as the navigation that s been show the container slide up hide the contents

20417776

getter	setter
but its difficult to search for all possible getter setter method for spring

20418036
min	max
i m having trouble with part d-finding the max and min from the average.need help being able to calculate the min and max after it has been averaged

20418036
min	max
print out the average for each case and figure out how closely the trials match with each other by comparing the averages using min and max

20418036
min	max
matching min and max means the trials match exactly â the trials match exactly

20418036

if you get errors please post the log file

20418543
typedef	struct
the typedef keyword works with struct types in exactly the same way

20418543
typedef	struct
the forward declaration will give you an incomplete type until you finish defining the struct list part but that s ok c lets you use incomplete types in a number of positions including when you want to declare a pointer and including with typedef alias-creation

20418569
textarea	textbox
i want a textbox or a textarea in place of it

20422494
portrait	landscape
implement following way in your view which you want to rotate in both portrait and landscape both for iphone device

20422517
portrait	landscape
i am giving you an example of my app which supports only in landscape mode but as i took image picker and it supports only in portrait mode so i changed the orientation for only that view

20422517
portrait	landscape
you just need to change landscape instead of portrait if you want only landscape orientation for your particular view where you want to change it

20422527
folder	directory
create files folder in the respective section or use below code it will create directory automatically

20422563

i can t post what i ve tried because i can t get my head around where to begin on this problem

20422719
implements	extends
i did check org.springframework.orm.hibernate4.hibernatetransactionmanager and it sure does has the setter for entityinterceptor and my auditinterceptor extends emptyinterceptor which implements the methods

20422776
hide	show
you should probably use another layout that arranges your charts as you want for example vbox layout and show hide them selectively

20422830
inherited	subclassing
i think the order of inherited is confusing in the example - hand doesn t really feel like a subclassing of deck rather they should both be subclassing of a common card collection stack say

20422863
for-loop	loops
in my code there is a foreach loops i want to replace it by for-loop

20422893

i have no problem loading data from json file to my fullcalendar however i want all my data to appear only on the external list of draggable droppable events and then the user would decide where to drag events example

20422990

hi am using storyboard to design ui my entire application.it will support portrait mode for all screen except reports screen.in reports i have to show huge data so it should be in landscape mode.and also using tabbar controler

20422990

20423057
spaces	delimiter
you don t use a spaces or a delimiter in here

20423103
entities	entitymanager
everything works as expected as long as the entity inside the value attribute of the selectonemenu is loaded using the same entitymanager as the entities inside the selectitems

20423103
entities	entitymanager
but as soon as one of the entities is loaded via a different entitymanager and therefore has a different hashcode we are never able to get a match to generate the expected selected attribute of an select item html option

20423233
width	height
here is my idea firstly user has to point the folder containing images to make thumbnails of and specify thumbnail s height and width and secondly display the image with a movable rectangle transparent but with visible border of the given thumbnail s x and y on it so the user would be able to choose which area of the image to crop

20423256
folder	directory
you can use createdirectoryatpath withintermediatedirectories attributes error with yes in the intermediate directory parameter to create all the folder you need in the path

20423268
textarea	pre
the tab character has however special handling in pre elements and although this not that well described in specifications in textarea and xmp element in the latter character references cannot be used only the tab character as such

20423322
hide	show
i m trying to show hide onclick the row with the id sub2

20423353

width	height
- the width 703 height 768 dimensions are reversed by the screen capture so i end up with some of the master view in the detail screen shot

20423549
children	parent
if that doesn t work then the other approach is to use the parent property in the child to get a reference to the collection and then call a method you have written in the blb collection that updates the other children

20423571
width	font-size
in your first rule the declaration font-size 100 has no effect and the second declaration sets the font size to 1.375 times the basic font size and your media rules override that when the width of the viewport is at most 480px

20423571
width	font-size
they do not set the font size to 80 or 90 of the width you set with font-size 1.375em since that declaration is completely overridden

20423598
min	max
the non zero count returns 18 values here the code then goes into the bisect -like search using as min x-coord and as max x-coord which results in the array stopping at 9 instead of 10

20423607
folder	directory
if you can t resolve the php limitation easily an alternative is to ftp the installation file to the tmp folder and in extension manager - install use the install from directory option instead

20423632
google-chrome	firefox
it displays same on firefox and google-chrome

20423651
put	get
this approach has two benefits first you won t get any stackoverflowexception anymore and second you can easily put the code part above in the run method of a runnable and have multiple threads wait on a concurrentlinkeddeque

20423669
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
this code works just fine in google-chrome firefox - but fails in ie safari

20423734
capistrano	rvm
i cannot get capistrano 3 to work with rvm

20423750
onclick	onmousedown
edit reason as to why i ve chosen to use onmousedown instead of onclick to execute the event with the button

20423750
onclick	onmousedown
i have chosen to use onmousedown instead of onclick as it makes the app i m building feel less clunky due to the presence of this feature with onclick when you click on a button and then drag the cursor away from the button while holding the mouse button down and subsequently lift your finger off the mouse button when the cursor is in an area away from the button on the webpage the event will not be executed

20423783
avr	microcontroller
you ve run out of ram on the avr microcontroller

20423783
avr	microcontroller
either use less ram by either reducing the scope of your project or finding a way to encode your data more densely or use a avr microcontroller that has more ram in the first place such as the atmega1284p

20423799
onclick	onmousedown
i m not sure why you re using onmousedown instead of onclick for the button but either way if you re going to use jquery i d recommend removing the inline event attribute in favour of binding the handler with jquery

20423811
hide	show
i m using the following script to show hide div tags via css with the selection of checkboxes in a html form

20423811

20423998
prepare	execute
it seem that when sql query has semicolon at the end prepare execute statements fail

20424022
post	put
i m guessing you use either a put or a post and certainly read the request body so that shouldn t be a problem

20424061
awt	swing
since multithreading is an issue you re bound to run into when working with awt swing there are some utility classes methods especially designed to facilitate multithreading in graphics applications

20424081
prepare	execute
you can execute this prepare statement by statement execute

20424111
ubuntu	linux
in ubuntu linux if we want to set up python path we do something like this

20424138

i have abstract class transaction which contains couple of normal properties and methods and one method - behavior - which i made pure virtual so the classes which inherited from transaction can implement it on their own

20424180
or-operator	and-operator	or-operator	not-operator	not-operator	and-operator
see in or-operator all and-operator for arrays and nin not-operator for multiple values

20424188
children	parent
because you set the scope of variable _type as protected it can only be refered inside the model class parent and children of model class

20424308
for-loop	loops
however if you increase i inside repeat it still will come back to value resulting from for-loop so you have to do it in different way for example using while loops

20424313
children	parent
i would like to set the parent of a particular view to null by using the view s onclicklistener .i am worried about performance and using too much memory because i have not set all of it s children to null

when maven tries to build the child modules it can not find the parent pom.xml as it is not available in the maven repository it is currently in the process of building it so it has not yet been uploaded

20425229
maven	pom.xml
to fix this you simply need to change the parent definition in the child poms to define a real relativepath to the location of the parent pom.xml so that maven can find it

20425259
put	get
you need to get the ids of the users you ve checked and from the ids you can get their email addresses and then simply do a foreach to send an email to all selected users or put them into an email queue system

width	margin
when you use setpagemargin to set a negative margin to your viewpager the pages will become smaller than the full width of the viewpager

20425487
udp	tcp
you should be transmitting the contents of the udp or tcp payload only their data not the headers themselves using respectively a datagramsocket or a socket

20425487
udp	tcp
bear in mind that this skips the transport layer as those implementations take care of constructing the udp header in case of datagramsocket and the tcp header and options in case of socket

20425487
udp	tcp
your application will essentially need to be able to interpret and construct ipv4 and ipv6 headers and options and as the ip payload the udp headers and tcp headers and options

post	get
i think it s a lot cleaner to have a separate controller for each type with simple get post etc

20426931
mouseleave	mouseenter
so what we need is to link mouseenter and mouseleave events for each pair of buttons in two lists

20426931
mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave
so now when mouseenter any of paired buttons they both go to mouseover state and return to normal on when mouseleave

below is what i have managed to put together so far but your expert assistance is greatly needed to help get this working the correct way

this way from resolutions that have width from 0 to 320 the .carousel class will have 50px of height

20432873
rss	feed
for example in a random rss feed item s linked web page the relative link in the source code will look like this

20432873
rss	feed
i want to convert this rss feed into an rss feed in which each item s link is a link directly to the pdf so in my example the rss feed item s link should become art en datum aktuell nr 66132 frame 4 .pdf

20432873
rss	feed
my idea is to use yahoo pipes to loop through all the items of the rss feed follow the item s link look at the source code of the web page and extract the string between and the next stick the absolute folder path in front of the relative result and re-assigning this to the item s link

20433028
post	get
if possible rather than this low level sockets try to use basic http server this will give you better support for requests like standard http get and http post request what you called get and send and access to requests headers etc

width	height
from what i understand of html and css if you create 2 divs that have a width and height of 100 and place them in the same containing div you will only see 1 of the divs because they are both the exact same height and width and are placed on top of each other

look up the difference between storing strings text and numbers int double long float etc.

20433785
getter	setter
then you also might be able to use getter and setter for those variables you want

20433817
for-loop	loops

20433980
int	double
int and double are actually meant to have number operations done to them instead of string

20434004
ssl	https
thus far in my life anytime i added https to my server it was as simple as buying an ssl certificate and asking my webhost to install it for me so i ve never actually seen how the installation works

hide	show
what are the other possible ways to set hide and show fileds in other tabs not by ext.getcmp or ext.componentquery.query .

20434525
post	get
in modern web design there s a clear demarcation between get and post requests

20434525
put	get	post	get	post	put
html forms only allow get and post and a good number of web servers block the put and delete keywords by default

20434543
width	height
in fact you should just remove all the lines with layoutparams and use the default which is going to be match_parent width and wrap_content height for tablerow and wrap_content width and wrap_content height for textview

20434543
width	height
to enable scrolling wrap the whole tablelayout in a scrollview in your xml with match_parent height for the scrollview and wrap_content height for the tablelayout and match_parent width for both

20434554
floating-point	integer
i have an unfortunate case where api a uses integer timeouts in milliseconds and api b uses floating-point timeouts in seconds

this is an issue because any column re-sizing sorting or grouping that is preformed is lost when switching from template to template

20434758

a put edits that post without changing the routes

20434782
for-loop	arrays
however if the arrays urls_ary is the one to be sending data through ajax i d need to send each url individually causing me to run the call inside a for-loop which i think is inefficient

20434806
public	protected
you would need to put protected or private in front of your variable outside of your class methods to declare a class variable as anything but public

20434817
pop-up	dialog
it s a pop-up dialog

20434818
punctuation	words
it also assumes your words are separated by a single space each and your sentence contains no punctuation

20434824
public	protected
there are three types of visibility public private and protected

20434838
getchar	fgetc	getc	putchar
i note in passing that getc is functionally equivalent to fgetc and since this code is about to read from standard input and write to standard output it would be reasonable to use getchar and putchar

20434841
spaces	delimiter
would result in words containing each word delimiter by the spaces

20434893
unsigned	short
this assumes that bits points to an array of bool with at least sizeof unsigned short elements

it seems that the non-standard gnu pthread_setaffinity_np is absolutely required to get my c++11 program to actually put its threads onto different cores

20435010
gson	jackson
but in real world you shouldn t parse json with regex but with proper parser like gson jackson

20435040
hash-collision	key
because of hash-collision reinserting the same key does not guarantee that it ll end up in the same slot again

20435052
setinterval	settimeout
also note that i ve removed the after add - with parentheses it calls the function immediately and passes its result to settimeout or setinterval but you want to pass the function itself so just use the function name with no parentheses

20435078
ready	each
since an error is thrown each time it s not ready not 200 i want to wrap my calls in a try catch block -- retrying in the catch block

20435090
children	parent
but if it so happens that you want kill the process and all of its children on sigint and you are using linux then you can ask the kernel to deliver sighup upon death of the parent in your child processes

20435107
setinterval	settimeout
settimeout calls the specified callback function once after the time is passed i believe you are looking for setinterval

20435166

i ve looked at previous answers like this one elementtree findall returning empty list and the lxml documentation but most things seemed to be tailored towards parsing html

20435514
subtraction	multiplication	division	multiplication	division	subtraction
or you think having 8 separate adders is costly as you need to implement other mathematical operations like subtraction multiplication and division

20435565
nsmutablestring	nsstring
now you may never use this and in this case the method name makes it odd but consider you can do and get an nsstring or do and get an nsmutablestring

20435642
subtract	add
also change to your image folder path and add or subtract the correct s and the like to suit your needs

20435659
versioning	upgrade
this may be a bug or a problem introduced through an unusual upgrade performed on a pre-release versioning of the code

20435723
public	protected
the reason that public promises are binding on subclasses and protected ones are not is that if a subclasses were not bound by their parents public promises there would be no way for code that had a reference to an animal could safely call makenoise on it without knowing whether it was a type which wasn t required to have a makenoise member

20435723
super	implements
if animal implements a protected detectsmells member and cat supported it but fish did not the fact that fish doesn t support that method wouldn t affect a siamesecat s ability to call super.detectsmells since it knows super is a cat and not a fish

20435732
folder	directory
i have to use a bit uncomfortable directory format an url leading simply to project s src folder would be most welcomed path would be map.png only

20435819
stdout	stderr
0 redirects stderr to stdout which means that if your command is throwing an error fabric won t pick it up because it isn t being returned to fabric see this answer for more details on 2 1

if you don t know how to make getter for your classes and if your are using eclipse you can go to source -- generate getter and setter

20435916
submit	submission
part of the submission process is including a screenshot of the story published on your wall so you need to publish one before you can submit

20435959

i have entities user and discussionthread and i need to create many-to-many relationship but i forgot to put a icollection in user entity so code first created a one-to-many relationship

20435995
mapr	cloudera
...i liked bigdatauniversity.com and also noted that mapr hortonworks and cloudera all offer a downloadable environment that you can use to gain familiarity with the hadoop operating paradigm

20436080

20436110
apache	cherokee
look for a web server apache cherokee etc that supports wsgi and use something like this hello world

20436192
hide	show
tracking expressions are used to match array items with dom elements so that when you filter or reorder the array angular will only show hide or reorder some elements instead of rebuilding entire subtree

20436218
post	get
to solve this you need to expose your php as an api using http get or post methods

20436219
move	drag
-function-mousemotion it should move the small-box to where your mouse is pointing when you are moving the mouse sort of drag

20436293
hide	show
to hide or show it call setvisibility visible or invisible

i would make a hidden.java class that is a subclass of a type of layout say a linearlayout and has accessor to the fields that you want

20436373
children	parent	hide	show
i want to hide the parent checkbox and show it only after all children are done updating with the multiple ajax requests

20436373
children	parent
i d like to keep the parent checkbox unavailable until the children are all finished

20436374
classcastexception	runtimeexception
this will lead to really bad runtimeexception and classcastexception

20436376
screens	tablet
then you should create other folders for instance drawable-large which will handle drawables for large screens like your tablet

20436398
getter	setter
this leads me to believe that there s a setter for invoice.contact but not a getter

20436426
getdate	dateadd
the following sql select dateadd day datediff day 2 getdate 20 00 00 as a runs perfectly fine in microsoft sql query

versioning	upgrade
you might have upgrade your project type from an earlier versioning of asp.net mvc

20436523
int	double
double and int are incompatible types

20436523

this will give you a total of 100 indices max index being 9 9 and min 0 0

20436584
scrollable	panels
i have to get the table fit the panels and scrollable but something goes wrong

20436593
width	height
apparently wingetpos fetches the width and height of the entire window including the title bar and the window edges

20436593
width	height
here is a solution to fetch the width and height without adding in the title bar

20436617
apache	nginx
i have set up a basic server for a client and said client needs this to be based on nginx i would normally use apache for php based servers

20436635
hide	show
you can use this block to add remove show or hide subviews of the specified view

20436670
for-loop	arrays
so lets say that you have an arrays of markes which you will iterate in a for-loop

20436683

the get operation which means to query items from the database to the html page works fine but i cannot figure out why it fails when it comes to post or put with the error code 400 bad request

20436964
portrait	landscape
for example on a 3.5-inch iphone in both portrait and landscape you ll get the same application frame

20436978
put	get
1 build a binary search tree or a hash table to store tuples when we get a tuple search the equal tuple if we have then merge the tuple which have the same group value else put it to our search structure

20436982
google-chrome	firefox
i m not sure about other browsers but i know that google-chrome and firefox both would be easy to make this in

20436982
google-chrome	firefox
for storage google-chrome has the filesystem api and firefox has the file api

20437010
post	get
use get post or perhaps other valid method

20437056
hash	salt
i was under the assumption that you store the hash of the salt password

20437059
onresume	onpause
i am seeing some strange behaviour with onpause onresume in my app and cannot work out what is happening

20437059
onresume	onpause
i perform a database query simple subclass of asynctask in onresume and cancel it in onpause if it is still executing

20437097
jscrollpane	jsplitpane

20437133
width	height
i have image of width 1171 and height 1181

20437133
width	height
i need that image into print page using printdocument...so final image size would be width 596 and height 892

20437210
inherited	properties
i think it s acceptable maybe better to stub only direct properties determined by hasownproperty if the class has no inherited

20437214
hash	salt
your quote basically describes how to use bcrypt which is a key-derivation function as the basis of a salt hash function

20437214
hash	salt
that function s inputs are a password and a salt and its output is a hash value

20437214
hash	salt
so yes you do store the hash of the salt password

20437289
put	get
remember convert to string then put together so we get div1 + 1 div11

20437301
sml	prolog	sml	scheme	scheme	prolog
i ve built trees using sml as well as prolog but can t seem to get a hold of what i need to do for scheme

20437313
post	get
the method must be get or post and the code must be inside the tag

20437321
realloc	malloc
there is another way if you can use malloc for memory allocation then you can use realloc for resizing the array

20437335
submit	submission
i am creating a form without a submit button that will send a submission every time a form element changes value

20437407
post	put
i m going to put a full blog post up explaining it but in case you re still stuck

20437451
filtering	grouping
in app routes.php i put my routes into two grouping and on each grouping i used the proper filtering above

20437460
width	height
you need to specify the lengths for the padding using percentage values are based on the width of the parent not the height as you might expect

20437488
matplotlib	scipy	matplotlib	canopy
i d highly recommend checking out the enthought python distribution canopy which comes nicely prepackaged with pyfits numpy scipy matplotlib and a whole mess of other modules

20437568
width	height
#parent is absolutely positioned to the bottom of the page with a fixed width of 100 and a height of 75px

20437576
width	height
add and play with the width and height argument

20437592
put	get
what s happening is that we re measuring how much space we must put between title and roomid to get the desired alignment

20437615
post	put
if this is your use-case i suggest using http put or http post and not using multipart requests.

20437653
qmainwindow	qdialog	qmainwindow	qwidget	qdialog	qwidget
the base-class here must be same as the top-level widget in qt designer usually either qmainwindow qdialog or qwidget

20437815
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
if you just want to deploy a web application into the amazon-web-services magic consider using amazon elastic beanstalk

20437838

it will scale the image uniformly maintain the image s aspect ratio so that both dimensions width and height of the image will be equal to or less than the corresponding dimension of the view minus padding

20437938
mouseover	mouseout
but then i want it to show again in case of mouseover and disappear again on mouseout

20437938
mouseover	mouseout
and i can make an appear on mouseover + disappear on mouseout effect using this

20437959
width	height
however in this case where you re adding a width and height constraint those constraints should be added to imagefromlink not to its superview

20437959
width	height
this type of fixed width or height constraint doesn t involve any other views so it should belong to the view itself not the superview

20437959
width	height
adding a height and width constraint doesn t center it in its superview however

20437962
imperative	declarative
lambdas are a a declarative style methods are an imperative style

20437993
width	height
you ll need to manually set the height and width of the wrapper because the absolute-positioned children are as i said on another layer so they can t affect anything on the main layer

20438003
for-loop	loops
please check and see here my code of execute.php where the code of editor is goes and run and suggest me why for-loop goes to infinite loops

20438003

20438158
google-chrome	firefox
it works great on desktop devices tested in firefox v26 and google-chrome v31

20438175
strstr	substr
as per your requirement you can use strstr string substr

20438234
post	get
in a non-encrypted request both post or get expose everything in clear text anyway so they are just same piece of text arranged in different formats

in the same directory i have test.html oas.jar and a folder called lib

20440244
libstdc++	libc++

unsigned	short
to stress that last point if you were to pass an unsigned short you would need to va-cast to unsigned int

20441719
unsigned	short
this would be fine no matter whether on your platform the unsigned short is default-promoted to int or unsigned int both are possible

20441719
unsigned	short
this is indeed the case if the unsigned short is promoted to int then its value must automatically also be representable by an unsigned int since unsigned types can represent all the non-negative values of their signed counterparts

so to solve this i created a simple rack app that looks up a permalinks for the given slug which has a polymorphic reference to one of the different resource types

20448095
slug	permalinks
the permalinks themselves are generated whenever one of the resource types are created and handle building unique slug

fadein	fadeout
in order to make the interaction look feel smooth i ve added a fadeout to the div containing the featured content before the featured content is changed and a fadein after it is changed

20448162
width	height
using bootstrap 3.0.3 i m attempting to center both horizontally and vertically a div with a hard-coded width and height

20448162
fontfamily	font-size
what s interesting is that changing the body s font-size fontfamily and line-height appears to affect the scrollbar and thus i imagine this has something to do with the height 100 and the inline-block div

20448172
gson	flexjson
i was using gson too but switched to flexjson due to serialization issues

20448172
getter	setter
with flex you don t need instance creators just make sure your objects have getter setter for all fields based on javabean spec and you re good to go

20448243
post	get
save method of the controller get never called and in fact by using firebug no post is done

20448309
mvp	presenter
from my experience and please pardon my forthcoming general blanket statement the reason why mvp isn t seen that much in this technology is because many people either haven t heard about it forgotten it or simply don t see much difference from what a controller is and what a presenter is

20448316
submit	submission
so you will need to return false in the handler to stop submission and manually submit the form yourself depending on whether the user confirmed or not

20448358
profiling	debugging
you ll need to profiling and debugging this yourself

20448358
profiling	debugging
this is why you need to debugging and profiling

20448399
int	boolean
you are comparing a mix of int and boolean promoted to int since the first will return a boolean and it will be promoted to resolve the next

20448401
button	checkbox
i have 7 radio button and 5 checkbox

20448401

20448499
xmonad	xmobar
tells xmonad that you don t want your tiled windows to overlap xmobar

20448511
hash	salt
you still want to at least hash it and probably salt it. this video should provide a lot of help with doing this in rails authentication in rails

20448517
hex	binary
in principle yes you could convert a raw binary file into a text file full of hex digits that you can include in your source code

20448553
ubuntu	linux
i have installed java on my linux machine ubuntu 12.04

20448568
button	checkbox
another problem i have is that i want to use a checkbox to rotate the image i have a function rotateit that does this but i wasn t able to get the checkbox working because of the intvar doesn t seem to change note my use of lambda to make it work with the radio button

20448583
superclass	subclassing
so im trying to create a game created by an arraylist of many different custom objects blocks basically a rectangle with extra methods but im confused on what im doing wrong because along with creating the object i need to create an object of the superclass to make the object of the subclassing

20448583
for-loop	arrays
i want the jframe to have each block created one after another but where i am running into a problem is it appears im only creating one while i have a for-loop running to create 144.i realize the blocks wont line up correctly right now but my objective is to have to game start up with the object dirt to fill up the arrays list

20448583
superclass	subclassing
the object dirt is a subclassing within another superclass called block

20448600
portrait	landscape
for one it will make the process of switching between multiple layouts for your app very difficult for example if you want one layout for landscape and one for portrait since you ll have to do all of the work that android normally does automatically for you in onconfigurationchanged

20448607
google-chrome	safari
while many thought the browser wars were over a new war between browser vendors has reignited in the past few years since google-chrome was released apple started growing again and pushing safari and ie lost its dominance

20448699
ubuntu	linux
i m using google chrome 33.0.1729.3 dev on linux elementary os 0.2 based on ubuntu 12.04

20448739
portrait	landscape
the splash screen renders in landscape but the view of the app is in portrait orientation

20448782
superclass	subclassing
and you don t need a superclass to instantiate a subclassing

20448786
width	height
i implemented a div in mobile safari that has the same width as the device width and larger height than the device height

20448798
implements	extends
use screens instead extends game in your core class instead of directly implements applicationlistener

20448861
post	put
i need a way to put parameter in this post

20448875
for-loop	loops
because you don t do await the poetry task and you can t unless you return task instead of void its for-loop continues executing in parallel with the while loops in your main

17 int types chars + signed int types + unsigned int types + enumerated types

20448981
listview	gridview
what is supposed to happen is that when that checkbox is checked it takes the icon from the listview item turns it into a bitmap saves that bitmap to internal storage gets that bitmap from internal storage and then populates the gridview with that image

20448981
listview	gridview
this all occurs within my two adapters for the listview and for the gridview

20449030
button	checkbox
i have a little problem with js function that i created in the pic that i attached there is 2 checkbox cbmale cbfemale and a button for changeselection

20449030
button	checkbox
i want that when the cbmale is checked the cbfemale will be disabled and after the user click on the changeselection button there is a message that asking if he want to change selection if he does click ok the two checkbox are enabled and unchecked...and going vice versa if he click on the cbfemale first

20449030
button	checkbox
a picture of two checkbox labelled â maleâ and â femaleâ with a button labelled â change genderâ after them. 1

20449041
accessor	properties
javascript s properties accessor can t look within the object s being held by an array to apply a condition against them

20449050
getter	setter
the property must be a valid entity and the property should have a non-abstract getter and setter

20449074
button	checkbox
you are trying to simulate the behavior of radio button with checkbox

20449084
intersect	contains
i have implemented the following rectangle pojo with correct intersect rectangle and contains rectangle methods

20449084
intersect	contains
optimally i could make use of the intersect and contains methods but i ll take anything that truly works

20449110
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox and google-chrome and there are no issues in the javascript console

20449124
children	parent
foreground background assigned to a parent tag in html or in css would be the default color of all of its children

20449165
post	get	getter	setter
i can post the bean classes if needed but there s only the setter and getter and the annotations necessary to get the element names right

20449168
glut	glew
in turn this produced another error involving glew glut and opengl

20449191
google-chrome	firefox
the errors happen in a similar way in firefox google-chrome and ie 9

20449229
strlen	strcpy
same thing here except you use strlen to find the length of the strings and strcpy to copy them

20449229
free	strdup	free	malloc	strdup	malloc
also note that if you were using malloc and free like you re supposed to with c strings you could just use c s strdup function

20449229
free	malloc
but you shouldn t free malloc d memory with and you shouldn t free memory with free

20449230
fseek	ftell
since you re in a file you can always remember the current position with ftell and then go back with fseek

for-loop	loops
and here s another without loops yes i know you asked for-loop

20449330
subtraction	addition
of course if doing addition and subtraction or other math operations the precision is only as good as the precision of the current operation and the supplied duration

20449369
min	max
now you don t know in advance that you need 5 so you can determine the number you need by taking the min and max from the table

20449379
sse	avx
the integer code is written with sse2 intrinsics to be compatible with older cpu while floating point is written with avx to improve speed there is also sse code branch so do not suggest this

20449384
min	max
cells where the rounded value is truncated are ignored in computing the min max so i compute selectors for each function that give me the appropriate values

20449460
getter	setter
the best way create poco s in f# is to decorate it with the climutable attribute f# 3.0 language feature which creates a poco type with public getter and setter for all properties that are accessible in c# code but still behave as immutable types in f# e.g

20449470
sqldatasource	datalist
i am in need of a method of adding values to a datalist that are not coming from the sqldatasource that the datalist is connected to

the limit of classes within this range that should at minimum display in the table is 6

20449521
post	get
you are stating that last_id is a get request when it is a post request

20449611
int	chars
you can concatenate chars to a std string you just need one of the operands to be a std string otherwise you are adding int

20449634
post	get
the postdate in the is a numeric date such as 13.11.01 again i get the same date of today on all of the post in the loop

i upgrade to the latest versioning of php in the hosting and the problem was solved

20449871
unsigned	short
unsigned short is the most common data structure used to store unicode value although it cannot store all the code points

20449877
put	get
to get the extension you would need to compile it in yourself or google for a precompiled dll which is compatible with xampp and has the extensions you re using and then put that in your php modules folder on xampp

20449895
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
amazon-web-services elastic beanstalk instances do not have persistent storage

20450038
put	get
in the end i just put -ignorewarnings in to get something output

20450056
for-loop	loops
my question has to do with the order in which java checks the conditions of a for-loop when there is a print statement in the conditions of loops

20450061
rss	feed
the code below gets rss feed from yahoo and it works but i have a little problem when i rub the code it returns the feed but it also gives me an error like -

portrait	landscape
on my ipad retina however the app always launches in portrait mode and then rotates to landscape if the device is oriented that way

20450140
free	malloc
any crash inside malloc or free is and almost sure sign of heap corruption which can come in many forms

20450140
free	malloc
these bugs are very hard to catch without tool support because the crash often comes many thousands of instructions and possibly many calls to malloc or free later in code that is often in a completely different part of the program and very far from where the bug is

for-loop	loops
for-loop means loops is over

20450209
int	chars
btw i didint find any logic in that mind when you comparing two string which have been converted from int to chars simply you can check that two integers.

20450235
put	get
for put and get operations i have written below class

20450271
for-loop	arrays
i used a for-loop to populate the arrays with circles that have a random radius and color

20450284
put	get
so i get a null pointer trying to put if task.isdone in my invokelater

20450290
mouseup	mousedown
this is a simple example that is responding to the mousedown and mouseup events creating a rectangle then printing the results to a textbox it should give you an idea how to proceed

20450297
min	max
i want to specificy a global min and max variable to use in a regular expression checking id validity

20450297
min	max
but i want to use the variables min and max rather than hardcoding the numbers into the expression

20450316
min	max
btw please don t use the names min and max

20450326
maven	pom.xml
my maven pom.xml contains the following dependencies

beanstalk	amazon-web-services
i ve installed this and attempted to use it following the amazon deploying a flask application to amazon-web-services elastic beanstalk tutorial

20450474
post	get
look at the code for both get and post for an entity lets say address in this case

20450474
post	get
lets say i am using ajax to send requests to the api and here is my code for both get and post respectively

20450474
post	get
while get returns the correct post returns the following error code 500 message warning json_encode recursion detected in var www projects symfony vendor jms serializer src jms serializer jsonserializationvisitor.php line 29

20450487
getter	setter
however if i change the showdetailsvideo property at runtime the setter are accessed but not the getter indicating the wiring between the properties and the view element properties isn t working despite my use of the fody propetychanged package

20450512
put	get
so you won t get them out of the box if you put gcc strictly in ansi mode which gets you c90

20450515
next	except
everything works fine except that when i enlarge the window beyond a certain point the last element drops down to the next line as if there were not enough room for it above

20450515
box-sizing	border-box
i m using box-sizing border-box and vw s for my measurements and everything adds up to 100vw so i can t figure out why the last element is dropping down to the next line

20450517
filesystems	fat
i think the problem is that the fat filesystems supports filename length up to 42 characters but it is producing longer file names

20450557
int	double	int	chars
therefore i can only pass generic pointers int double and chars vectors to foo

20450559
for-loop	arrays
use a for-loop inside of paintcomponent and iterate through the arrays painting each circle item that the arrays holds

20450611
typedef	struct
take the following example and assume that is a void pointer inside a typedef struct

20450623
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox this works exactly as expected

20450677
width	height
i was having the same issue and i was able to fix it with css by specifying the width and height of the anchor tags like this

20450677
width	height
be sure to change the width and height according to the dimensions of your image

20450684
printf	strlen
s write printf gc | s s strlen

20450705
pthreads	fork
this is a simple technique in most of these fork puzzles on a pthreads system

20450736
width	height
that page shows image.png in the maximum height width proportion possible on said device

20450736
width	height
image path should be dynamic and the width height interpreted after the file has been loaded

20450752
google-chrome	safari
edit i ve checked out this issue on two computers both on osx and this issue is much more prevalent in google-chrome than in safari

20450752
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome totally staggers when loading in the data safari is really smooth and only has any noticable lag when you get to 600+ items and even then it s nowhere near as bad as google-chrome

20450774
post	get
if you get a lot of actions you can search for the actions in the post keys

20450778
int	chars
the exception happened because you defined image as array of unsigned chars but used unsigned int inside at function

20450778
int	chars
cout int image.at unsigned chars 1 1 n

20450883
getter	setter
however instead of accessing member field directly it is suggested to use getter or setter function like getstaff i and similar

20450890
hide	show
i need to show an image in beginning of my app and then hide and remove it from it s parent

20450904
cpu	processors
the only reason i can think of to compile different modules with different instruction set support is if you want to make a cpu dispatcher so your code can run on different processors

i am writing a game using lwjgl and slick2d

20450940
mp3	ogg
i have tried to load and play a ogg audio file that is 3.2mb in size if this counts the file was originally mp3 but because of the licensing issues with mp3 i chose to use ogg instead

20450940
mp3	ogg
i used this converter to convert my mp3 to an ogg

20450948
cpython	pypy
on the other side however if for your code this kind of micro optimization is fundamental then probably python is not the right tool for the problem you are fighting and you should consider other options like writing a small c++ extension interfaced with sip using cpython pypy ...

20450955
typedef	struct
this is defining struct term and typedef ing it to term_t at the same time

20451022
haskell	scheme
how does one interpret callcc in haskell coming from familiarity with scheme s call cc

20451048
int	double
since you only need three values the int a string and a double and the columns appear to be aligned then you can specify a suitable length for the string with the c conversion specifier

20451048
int	double
the types int and double are reserved words and cannot be used as variable names

20451165
google-chrome	safari
you should use the javascript console in google-chrome safari to look for the error and fix it before you deploy your app

20451168
int	double
this means that when you use the expression there is a hidden cast from double to int in order to match the type of temp

20451168
int	double
double do not have an exact representation like int

20451207
rss	feed
perhaps you have atom or rss feed for the same actions and you use page caching and your page caching isn t taking into account the format requested so sometimes if atom or rss is the first request then things get confused

20451249
width	height
setup only width and height what about x and y

20451305

it s not the socket that s converting chars to int it s you when you receive them into signed

20451841
int	chars
chars in data i converts it to a 4 byte int which may have a value between -128 and 127 0xffffff80 to 0x0000007f in hex then output that int

20451841
int	chars
you don t what to use point to access a 1-byte chars then convert this chars to int

20451860
jtabbedpane	jscrollpane
you added upgradescreen to jtabbedpane first and then again added it to a jscrollpane

20451860

20451928
width	margin
i am using chrome latest version and am finding that i can do what i want sort of but i am doing it in a way that doesn t quite work when resizing the screen horizontally ie the margin on the top ie the distance between the dashed line and the top of the blue box seems the change its vertical distance as compared to the width of the screen which is very strange to me

20451928
width	height
i really don t wanna specify height or width programmatically but the width seems to work in a scalable way

20451932
min	max
min + 1 until max value is reached

20451932
range	max	range	min	min	max
it shows min max value range and each number

20451947
implements	extends
assuming that s not what you want you can extends the vtable idea to include methods to return the address of member variables which will allow you to use go interfaces as a cheap way of implements the vtable

20451976
width	margin
margin in percents is related to width so just set top left right bottom properties

20452030

to be specific the behavior when converting from integer to floating-point is implementation-defined most implementations define rounding as being â œaccording to the fpu rounding modeâ and the fpu s default rounding mode is to round to the nearest

20453520
floating-point	integer
you should not rely on this behavior even if you know you are targeting an intel processor when targeting x86-64 compilers can emit for the conversion from floating-point to integer sequences of instructions that take advantage of the undefined behavior to return results other than what you might otherwise expect for the destination integer type

the easiest parallel implementation here is to just use a concurrent queue and atomic add operations although using one normal queue per processors and some work-stealing would probably be a very good idea in practice

width	height
by employing an abstract class you would be able to maintain some sort of a default height and width and override it whenever required

public	protected
i think that access levels public internal protected private defined in c# are just limited by compiler it s a strict rule for ide and developers but to clr and os they don t have to obey this rule they can call any function or method from reflected address like we could invoke method by reflecting so the private main method could be the entry

20475500
getter	setter
unfortunately in order to use the underlying storage inside the lambdasetter i needed to provide a getrawdata public accessor which can lead to broken encapsulation but you can either leave it out and provide your own storage container for t or just ensure that the only time you use getrawdata is when you are writing a custom getter setter method

personally i d store the object in an object store rather than serialise memcached apc even a session can be used you can also use nosql style databases and key stores all of which are pretty much perfectly suited to object persistance as they re mostly very fast access data stores without the sql overhead

20475719
memcached	apc
note apc is only really usable for object store when you run a single web php server if you need multiple processing servers then you ll need a distributed object store in which case the best you can probably get is memcached

free	malloc
put another way malloc and free deal with raw memory allocations while new and delete deal with objects and that s a very different thing

20488784

20490475
squash	merge
but let s just ignore that for now and finally get to squash merge and cherry pick

20490475
squash	merge
the action of this git merge is very similar to a regular merge except that instead of merge-commit m with two parents it will set up a squash merge commit let s call it s with only one parent

20490475
squash	merge
it s this commit-graph difference that makes it a squash merge rather than a regular merge

20490475
squash	merge

getter	setter
the i think cleaner way would be to create a setter and getter and so save the dataprovider in a local variable in your case probably arraycollection

20490562
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
the first question is if you look at the code you will find that every send requires a new objectoutputstream and every receive requires a new objectinputstream

20490562
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
the correct expected behaviour is that since both objects objectoutputstream and objectinputstream have already been created at creation

20490572
post	get
when you will click submit button then using jquery you can get the values and post to a page using ajax

20490586

use the css to hide the table first and then upon clicking on the link it will show the table

20491110
width	height
as a result in order to make the tabs wider you must change the height property and in order to make them taller you must change the width property

20491110
width	height
in the code example below width is set to 25 and height is set to 150

20491265
implements	extends
please tell me difference between extends thread and implements runnable interface

20491301
google-chrome	firefox
this one is working for all broswers ie firefox and google-chrome

20491308
superclass	subclassing
that said your two windows may share other functionality and if so it could be shared through a common superclass abstract if it relies on subclassing implementation detail

20491308
superclass	subclassing
if you do settle on a common superclass then that would extend the three interfaces if all subclassing were expected to support them

20491308
implements	modifiers
it may also implements some default implementation of these interfaces again watch access modifiers to ensure those you intend to be can be overridden while others may be final

20491395

20491479
put	get
next put and in cell c5 and c6 respectively and you will get the total count of colors

20491517
getter	setter
now the other option i have is to make a class and implement setter and getter with global variables

20491530
width	height
set the dialog height and width with the current viewport width

20491577
getter	setter
every cactiverecord instance or cmodel instance for that matter has a getter setter named attributes with which all the attributes can be set

20491585
itemscontrol	gridsplitter
so to make a long story short how can i use a grid in an itemscontrol with a gridsplitter that applies to all rows of ideally a group or the entire grid if that isn t possible

20491641
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
the first question is if you look at the code you will find that every send requires a new objectoutputstream and every receive requires a new objectinputstream

20491668
superclass	subclassing
overridden methods can throw only the subclassing of exception thrown by the method in superclass and it cannot throw the superclass of exception thrown by the method in superclass

20491713
getter	setter

20491739
folder	directory
ideally i would have a function finddir that finds the location of the lowest common folder in the project here projecta so that i can replace every directory string with

20491779

20491790
inline	inlining
good compilers do some inlining themselves when speed is needed but inline compels them

20491794
width	height
the second .content-wrapper .col1 is separate because whoever wrote the code only wanted the width and height to apply to .content-wrapper .col1 and not .content-wrapper .col2

20491800
getter	setter
it is better to make a class and implement setter and getter with global variables rather than to return collection further it depends on your use

20491832
width	height
is just selecting the col1 element and changing it s width and height to a fixed value

20491874
width	height
apparently i can t get the proper height and width of that label

20491874
width	height
the only way the text can show properly is adding manually an undetermined amount of size to height and width once the calculations are made

20491884
portrait	landscape
one issue is this app works and looks perfect in landscape but in portrait mode the dimensions just don t fit

20491912
min	max
and it works fine but only as long as the field you want to filter on is actually the max or min

20491921

20498615
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
i was able to have a uinavigationcontroller with the correct height defined by the os without having the uinavigationbar contiguous with its uiwindowâ s top so that is possible to do

20498615

the solution to get the view with the correct height from the start was to initially define the view with the whole width of the screen and then use the uiviewcontroller viewdidlayoutsubviews method to define the frame of the view with the width i wanted

20498621
for-loop	arrays
you can create an element for each thing in the arrays using a for-loop

20498632

20499087
width	height
you are using width auto which sets width of image in contrast of aspect ratio from height

20499094
width	height
to get the height divisions with the percentages you are using you need a total width that is divisible by 20 35 of 20 7 a prime number

20499094
width	margin
so that means you need your widths to not shoot for 100 window width but rather the width value that is the next smallest division by 20 and then perhaps center your display so that the 0 to 9.5px left over become side margins through an margin 0 auto rule

20499105

content-length	content-type
curlopt_httpheader an array of http header fields to set in the format array content-type text plain content-length 100

20499620

maven	m2e
i would recommend that you use the eclipse maven plugin m2e - it has an excellent graphical dependency viewer that should enable you to track down dependency conflicts quickly

20499689
int	boolean
one thing to be aware of is autoboxing if you have a variable declared as a wrapper class long int boolean etc. and you reference it as a primitive you will get a npe

20499697
post	get
as chuck mentioned on your controller then have a post method with the same name as the get you show

20499707
execvp	fork
it hasn t got anything to do with the actuall fork or execvp calls it s got to do with how you wait for them

20499707
waitpid	fork
for a foreground process like i assume you have been dealing with so far you will fork the new process run a program with exec and then wait for the child in the parent with wait or waitpid

20499709
hide	show
i would try to keep the html in your html file then just control the show hide or use ng-if from your controller function

20499986
getter	setter
that means that unless strictly necessary your should by default make your class s arguments private and let other classes access them through getter and setter

20499986
getter	setter
the work of creating getter and setter is so redundant that both eclipse and netbeans ides have a functionality that allows you to do these automatically

20500727
int	chars
an int has larger capacity than a chars so the conversion is not guaranteed to work

20500727
int	chars
the possible range in the value of a chars is 0 to 65535 but an int can be anywhere from -2147483648 to 2147483647

20500727
unsigned	short
char is an unsigned type java s only built-in unsigned type actually so even short and byte variables still need a conversion to char as they may be negative

20500733
int	chars
a chars is a 16-bit datatype while an int is a 32-bit datatype

20500733

20508465
min	max
other example filters are arithmetic mean max or min filters which returns the maximum input

20508465
min	max
similar filters can only return the mean max min of the last n inputs

20508465
min	max
store one input such as max min filters just compare stored value with input and if it s the new max min then set the stored value to the input

20508465
min	max
store a list of inputs such as max min filters of last n only stores the last n inputs so the filter method can iterate through the list and find the max min

20508465
min	max
this could also implemented in another way storing two values one representing the current max min and its age

20509268
width	height
on some devices it occupies both the height and width perfectly

20509268

free	calloc	free	malloc	free	realloc	realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
and since the array was not allocated by a call to malloc or calloc or realloc you must not attempt to free it

20509576
free	malloc
again you must not attempt to call free on this array or rather on a pointer to its first element since it wasn t allocated with malloc

20509576
free	malloc
a call to malloc 7 might actually allocate say 16 bytes and the only information free needs is the base address and the actual allocated size

20509576
free	malloc
malloc and friends do maintain some size information behind the scenes but only for the purpose of letting free work correctly

20513072

each and every thing is right the only problem is either by mistake you put your for-loop in wrong place or may be you are not so aware with 2d arrays now according to your program

20513072

20514150
rdf	owl
however when an owl 2 ontology is serialised to rdf the serialisation uses rdf plain literals in place of a typed rdf plainliteral

20514150
rdf	owl
now the treatment of literals in owl 2 ontologies does not apply to owl 2 full ontologies that is rdf graphs and therefore owl 2 full ontologies can have true non-typed literals and only these can have a language tag

20514189
setinterval	settimeout
i d also imagine that as js has been around a while now and implemented on all browsers for years that both settimeout and setinterval would work identically

20514192
range	infinity
if you want to support different floating point formats your code would have to understand the internal format of floats unless you only support same architecture both ends pick the floating point number apart into your own format which of course may be ieee-754 but beware of denormals 128-bit long doubles nan infinity and other exception values and of course out of range numbers and then put it back together to the format required by the other end

eigenvalue	diagonal
if you take one of the eigenvalue of the lower right 2x2 block and subtract it from every diagonal element then you get the shifted qr algorithms as per francis

20515168
eigenvalue	diagonal
if the split occurs in the last row then the last diagonal entry is an eigenvalue of the shifted matrix a-s i

20515168
eigenvalue	diagonal
conjugate complex eigenvalue have the same size so the algorithm will produce a 2x2 block on the diagonal solve the quadratic characteristic equation of that block to get the corresponding eigenvalue

noexcept	throw
the standard s policy on noexcept is to only mark functions that cannot or must not fail but not those that simply are specified not to throw exceptions

20517333
noexcept	throw
in other words all functions that have a limited domain pass the wrong arguments and you get undefined behavior are not noexcept even when they are not specified to throw

20517333
noexcept	throw
some implementations want to throw an exception there which they are allowed to since it s undefined behavior they can do anything but a standard-mandated noexcept on those functions makes this impossible

no you only need to explicitly synthesize to get the synthesized ivar if you explicitly implement all of the accessor methods both getter and setter for readwrite properties just the getter for readonly properties

20522715
getter	setter
you ve written the getter for this readwrite property but not the setter so the ivar will still be synthesized for you

20522715
getter	setter
likewise since this is readwrite if you implemented both the getter and the setter that would require you to synthesize the ivar if you wanted one

20528051
getter	setter
class properties are accessed using the convention of getter and setter - namely getwebserviceresponse and setwebserviceresponse string response

20528051
getter	setter
the only methods present in the bean are the methods to interact with the fields - that is a setter and getter for each field

20528051
getter	setter
also it s bad style to call your setter inside of your getter - the idea behind a setter is that it only sets a field and a getter only returns whatever value is inside of that field - even if it s null

20529238
queue	fifo
in wininet.c 711 we actually see where send is finally called on a socket if this send is successful we call buffchain_consume to de-queue so many bytes from the start of the buffer linked list fifo queue

inline	inlining
note that inlining small functions often results in smaller and faster code basically because the otherwise necessary calling sequence often requires more instructions than what is inline and the optimizer gets a better chance to further reduce the code by a more holistic view of what s going on

20529638
setcontentview	findviewbyid
only when a activity a calls setcontentview with a layout a then that activity a can directly access the elements in the layout a using the findviewbyid - means layout elements can be used directly by that activity a - or in other words layout a elements will not be directly accessible to activity b through findviewbyid

exif	xmp
but the real problem is that pil pillow doesn t give you an easy way to store exif or xmp or anything else like that

20529932
pillow	libtiff
ironically they did have partial exif support for jpg files which was never finished and has been stripped outâ also although it doesn t seem to be documented if you built pillow without libtiff it seems to ignore tiffinfo

now i don t know how the sorting is done but apart from the fact it s sorting almost 10 000 items in the array since it s a function used throughout someone else is handling that since it s coming up as a problem in their work and with the code i m looking at seems that it s only used to control the direction of the loop iteration if the second array had a size 16 and a size 17 and the first array wasn t cleaned up it would process at 16 skip though every single value till it gets to 17 which means failing that isset check 8 times before is true again and this is is i think the smallest example the problem with magento is that all the sizes for every time of product is grouping together even though 2 3s of the catalog would use xs - xl kind of scaling for sizes

free	malloc
the new and the delete operators are built ins for the c++ language but as far as i know they use the same system allocators as you do in fact you can override them and use malloc free and it should work which means that again this is the same memory

20543087
disk	ram
on top of this there are special ways but those change the way the memory handled in windows this is the virtual memory for example like virutalalloc virutalfree will allow you specify what you will do with the memory you want to use thus you allow the os to optimize better like you tell it i want 2gb of memory but it doesn t have to be in ram so it may save it on the disk but you still access this with memory pointers

20543087
disk	ram
yes this will be on the heap but how it is allocated depends on the implementation and whenever you override the new operator if you do you can for example force it to be in the virtual memory so in fact it could be on the disk or in ram but this is silly thing to do so yes it will be on the heap

rbac	acl
for inspiration look into acl access control lists and rbac role-based access control in particular

20549875
fast-forward	merge
if there were no commits on your release branch then each merge of master into release would be a fast-forward merge just advances the branch label along the line and does not create a new line

20549875
fast-forward	merge
from that point on starting with commit 7124029 on master every time you committed to master and then merge master into release a fast-forward merge wasn t possible so you created another line in your graph to record the merge

20549933
hide	show
since you are using postback set the div to set up conditions to show or hide the div or in the onselectedindexchanged event

20549959
hide	show
only way i figured out more from experience in js then tutorials is to use show hide like in javascript html

20549993

setinterval	settimeout
i think using settimeout is safer than setinterval

20550045
feof	strtok	fgets	strtok	fgets	feof
so after reading the last line feof will not be set you read another line with fgets which fails because there s no data then do your strtok stuff on this non-existing line

20550045
fgets	feof
it s much better not to use feof and check the return value of fgets like this

width	height
what i would like to do is to have the measurements of the gridview such as width and height so that i know what should be the optimal size of images when they are being showed in the getview method

20550102
width	height
in the xml layout file gridview was the only view then i added it to a linearlayout so maybe it atleast return the width and height of its parent...but that is still zero

20550102
width	height
and here is the cosntructor of the adapter where i get width and height always 0

20550119
width	height
mostly changes occurs in padding and margins and div height and width and all div becomes scattered

20550173
width	height
you can select width height and font so that you ll have comfortable window size

i realize this is an old post but i was running into the same problem and have since figured out how to not get the split conditional format rules

20550269
cpu	processors
as such they re only relevent for simple processors -- all the processors you name have a cache between the cpu and memory so are much more complex

20550269
cpu	processors
the closest thing to a cpu that actually implements the assembly language is something like early mips processors which is part of the risc design philosophy

20550270
stdout	stderr
so you re actually passing 7 file descriptors to gnu chess when you start it - the dup ed stdin stdout and stderr

maven	pom.xml
i ended up editing the maven super pom.xml in the jar file maven-model-builder-3.0.5.jar

20550323
single-quotes	double-quotes
note that json requires the use of double-quotes for all internal strings so you must either escape all internal strings to use with the data-rows attribute or use single-quotes around the data-rows attribute string eg

20550558
post	get
search is not necessarily a post you re trying to get some data not modify or insert

20550618
post	get
anyway with get or post when you use this kind of approuch to search on a database remember to use method do avoid sql injection

20550675

20550848
int	double
the third way is a bit complcated due to double rounding to int

20550848
int	chars
1 in the first step the floating-point number is converted either to a long if t is long or to an int if t is byte short chars or int as follows

20550848
floating-point	integer
otherwise if the floating-point number is not an infinity the floating-point value is rounded to an integer value v rounding toward zero using ieee 754 round-toward-zero mode â 4.2.3

20550869
int	chars
so first we convert them to int removing the separating - and . chars by you is it . by me a - so i remove both this can you see in

20550896
subtract	add
convert the times to local time in the browser using javascript s gettimezoneoffset function to add subtract minutes

20550899
children	parent
it also allows you to switch easily the children object and change the way the parent will operate

20550899
children	parent
extensibility a children class may inherit from a parent class

20550904

i have create sticky navigation for my project and this sticky navigation must show only on desktop mininum 980px and hide below 980px on the fly when i resize my browser

20550991
many-to-one	one-to-many
are one-to-many and many-to-one you should be careful when using any

20550994
int	double
double are not capable of holding more than 64 bits of information and lose information when you perform operations such as power when the number overflows.also you use signed int so at best you can have rsa31 which is absolutely useless and can be broken in a microsecond

20550994
exponent	modulo
but even to use rsa31 you should perform modular exponent which is not exponent followed by a modulo because for real rsa when you use large numbers 1024 bits for say the result of an exponent would be 2 100 bit not something your computer can store

20551018
post	get
i want my android application to be able to navigate to one of these pages and post get the information required for validation and the query and then get a response

20551029
sorting	filtering
after filtering and sorting displaying the results to the user

20551071
filtering	grouping
you can grouping the records by title and count and filtering only who has two unique values of year

20551073
google-chrome	firefox
you can do this by right-clicking in he browser ind click inspect element in google-chrome or firefox

20551076

20551147
google-chrome	firefox
i am using the firefox browser in google-chrome and clicking the link gives a message couldn t find an application to open this link

20551155
hide	show
during our testing simply setting show title will not hide the title

20551155
hide	show
you also need to set the option show author to hide as well

20551155
hide	show
the only way to disable it is going to the global configuration and setting the global configuration to hide whatever i am doing in the article manager options tab of an article seems to have no effect setting it to hide show global

20551156
for-loop	loops
there is no reason to have a while loops around the for-loop and the if statement will never execute since i will be 25 by the time it is reached

20551176
sorting	filtering
in my app i am sorting an entity using only one nssortdescriptor but now i need to filtering the data for 4 different attributes

20551176
filtering	grouping	sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping
this is the code for the current sorting the result are all records from the entity sorted by the attribute displayorder but i need to filtering the records by four other attributes year month day grouping all of them integer32 except grouping which is string

20551232
post	get
in this controller you get the post datas and you can add your response on the

20551261
getter	setter
the purpose with public getter setter if you will are the fact that they constrain the user from doing more than you want them to

20551273
post	get
first thing you should consider is using the jquery post and get wrappers to make your life easier

20551281
client-side	server-side
i would assume that you should be able to atleast throw an id in there to differentiate even if these div s were being created dynamically either client-side or server-side

20551287
getter	setter
sorry i m not watching the video but i assume you re talking about things like getter functions to get the value of a property -- a private data member in this case and setter functions to set those values

20551287
getter	setter
if you provide getter and setter as pure pass-through functions then you re correct it s really not much different than just making the members public

20551290
getter	setter
code with getter setter are considered better than direct private member access because those functions can then control all of the input output from those variables and make sure it is of the type range or whatever that the class expects

20551343
implements	extends
my controlleradvice extends spring s responseentityexceptionhandler and implements no interfaces

20551348
width	height
my twitter player entries point to a simple html page which contains a videojs player my content is defined so it resizes to 100 width and height so that the small mobile web experiences won t experience cropping. of course all assets must be fetched via https like defined in the docs

20551364
dictionary	map
in this case rather than do a nested loop you could map each element into a dictionary of lists twice once for each number str pair within it

20551364
dictionary	map
when you finish each key in the dictionary will map to the list of elements which contain that key are similar

20551397
width	height
that the width and height exactly swapped values

20551420
put	get
you can pass anything you want to execute - you might get runtime errors if you try to put a non-numeric string into a number column - but you won t allow sql injections

20551434
inherited	subclassing
i ve found that filters that works with frames use a gpuimagebuffer that is a subclassing of gpuimagefilter most probably just to inherited some methods and protocols that loads a passthrough fragment shader

20551439
width	height
i removed width and height and have viewbox and preserveaspectratio xminymin none though.

20551446
oncreate	onstart
try restoring the state in onstart or onresume instead of oncreate

20551446
oncreate	recreate
oncreate is only called if the activity needs to be recreate after it is destroyed

20551473
express	node.js
i have a webserver written in node.js using express using a bunch of route commands

20551475
put	get
when i try to put the example code into eclipse i get errors in the catch and throw new areas

20551481
mouseover	mouseleave
upto this i was good but when i do mouseover and mouseleave after closing both the mouseover fires but the mouseleave is still disabled

20551489
getter	setter
creating trivial getter and setter public functions is a bit futile in my opinion

20551489
getter	setter
if your class functionality is fully expressed by the private variables then trivial getter and setter are a waste and somewhat of a code smell

20551531
hex	binary
i have examined the binary file with a hex editor

20551546
for-loop	loops
in general isn t the while loops just a rephrase for the for-loop

20551610
laravel	codeigniter
i suggest laravel or codeigniter if you are new to programming in general then codeigniter will be the easiest

20551646
implements	extends
up to now i have implements grid views with simple adapters usually extends baseadapter inflating a layout in the getview method and notifying the adapter of any changes in the data set using notifydatasetchenged

20551653
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
are typically the events you want to listen for in a normal browser google-chrome firefox safari however the events are fired at very odd times in ie

20551686
pop-up	dialog
before displaying the dialog box i am properly setting the dialog box s parent handle to be java application window on top of which this dialog box will pop-up

20551693
width	height
basically in both cases removing the height or width setting for the video for the thin div i removed the height and for the short one the width

20551707
cos	sin
i know that in floating point a sum over one period of sin or cos in equally spaced samples is not perfectly zero and that this is more a problem with the conventional transform than with the fast

20551707
cos	sin
this value grouping indside cos and sin should give in my eyes the lowest rounding error compared to because not multiplicating dividing significantly false rounded transcedental pi several times but only one time

20551729
hide	show
i was looking for divs to hide and show in my homepage

20551745
for-loop	loops
the intention is to use a for-loop for a fixed number of iterations and the while loops for an indefinite number of iterations

20551745
for-loop	loops
in fact one can write each for-loop as a while loops with prior initialization as you supected

20551753
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
it is always legal to assign an expression of subclassing type to a variable of a class type higher in the inherited tree a superclass or ancestor of the expression type

20551753
superclass	subclassing
it shall be illegal to directly assign a variable of a superclass type to a variable of one of its subclassing types

20551753
superclass	subclassing
however may be used to assign a superclass handle to a variable of a subclassing type provided the superclass handle refers to an object that is assignment compatible with the subclassing variable

20551757
notepad++	textwrangler
i ve been using regular expressions earlier in notepad++ and textwrangler so i know some basics already

20551788
post	get
you can use indy s tidhttp component to send http get and post requests to your webserver as needed

20551796
google-chrome	firefox
my problem is the responsive part it works fine in google-chrome and firefox and even on my mobile when i put up a public link via dropbox

20551819
hide	show
you add an event listener every time you hide or show the tab

20551832
spaces	delimiter
it s worth noting that it leaves trailing spaces these could be trimmed if desired and it allows some spaces delimiter fields to be empty

20551870
min	max
i am using sql server 2005 with a daily maintenance plan.today i noticed that reorganizing indexes task took around 10 hours which is weird comparing to the previous one max 20 min

20551903
for-loop	loops
every for-loop can be rewritten as a while loops and vice versa

20551903
for-loop	loops
typically if you need a variable in a loops that increases until a condition is reached you d use a for-loop

20551956
hash	md5
my goal is to make a script which builds a packages .tar files on local machine upload them to remote hosts and check md5 hash sum

20551980
hide	show
so there is the article title which you can show hide throw into the streets dowhatever and nothing happens

in xml i have textview an imageview 2 buttons to change images

20552070
uilabel	uibutton	viewdidappear	viewwillappear
since upgrading a project to ios7 i am finding that if i put call to change a uilabel or calling settext of a uibutton in a viewdidappear or viewwillappear it puts the new text right on top of the old text

20552090
junit	testng
i can run a test with eclipse or intellij selenium and maven junit also works but when i try to add in testng i get the following

20552189
punctuation	words
however if you want to at least make an attempt you can draw inspiration from the following - split the string into individual words removing punctuation and whitespace then test each words against a list of expected words

20552202
ubuntu	mint
i am trying to modify mint 13 ubuntu derivative s initrd

20552255
versioning	upgrade
in macos x this is similar to windows only that there s no separation between opengl interface and driver client that s the reason why macos x is so slow to keep up with new opengl versioning it always requires a full operating system upgrade to deliver the new framework

20552300
versioning	upgrade
i ve to upgrade my program to using in 64bit versioning of windows now

20552339
oncreate	onstart
it is by calling the handler from oncreate instead of onstart

beanstalk	amazon-web-services
i m curious about the overall workflow of an amazon-web-services beanstalk deployment

20552373
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
but i was just wondering if amazon-web-services beanstalk uses the latest command of npm install --production to install packages

20552379
ant	maven
but the goal here is not to modify the original build scripts both ivy.xml and build.xml and using maven as an outer layer to kick off ant build and then fetch the built results and publish them to nexus server

20552379
maven	pom.xml
since one pom.xml only maps one maven artifafct and in this case multiple artifacts are build not through maven but ivy

20552379
build-helper-maven-plugin	pom.xml	maven-antrun-plugin	build-helper-maven-plugin	maven-antrun-plugin	pom.xml
currently in the top level pom.xml i m using maven-antrun-plugin to invoke build.xml on top level and using build-helper-maven-plugin to attache artifacts but it doesont work

20552384
viewdidload	viewdidappear
you should put your code in viewdidappear instead of viewdidload

20552384
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
whatever is related to display even launching async blocks should always be in viewwillappear or viewdidappear

20552386
hash	md5
but of course you should use an easy hash function like md5

20552471
google-chrome	firefox
i also tried putting fb.event.subscribe edge.create function response inside and at the end of function and it works on google-chrome but it does not work on firefox

20552503
children	parent
i would like to order the parent by the lowest age of their children proceeding to the second or third child in the case of a tie

20552536
width	height
you can use document.createelement method to create a img object and simply set the source and optional height and width then add it to your div using append

20552573
post	put
edit if you want the same javascript to apply to all post you write i d put it into the theme s html

20552579
symfony	silex
for example symfony silex has controllers which return response objects with http status codes

20552613
width	height
do not have ie8 to test but i think what you can do is let your element with height and overall width hope it helps

20552638
converse.js	candy

20552726
ubuntu	debian
then say on ubuntu debian you would do something like this to add it to your shutdown sequence

20552732
int	double
value types like int or double are just the bytes a 32-bit int is just four bytes worth of zeroes and ones

20552739
typedef	struct
without having to refer to the type as struct node_s anywhere except the particular line declaring the typedef name

20552764
width	height
set focus on another control like a that is width 1 and height 1

20552795
popover	tooltip
the popover or in tooltip fact plugin of tb 2.0.1

20552797

20552808
vsto	add-in
edit managed to find this this may already help unknown publisher still appears on correctly code-signed vsto add-in built with vs2010

20552844
super	extends
the class is super run on so really hard to debug and extends but all the data is so tied together primarily because of these types of loops so not to sure how to solve

20552848

20552866
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i tried on google-chrome firefox and safari but the error persists on all three

the code isn t a simple cast because long int aren t represented as c double

20552953
post	put
you can post data that has been put through json.stringify but the server won t know what to do with it unless you tell it what it s getting

20553024
rss	feed
i have an rss feed that i am writing an rspec test for

20553080
shadowing	named
after some discussion in the comments it turned out as it usually does when builtin modules suddenly seem to give attributeerrors that the problem was that another module named string was shadowing the builtin one

20553087
hide	show
i would start by putting css classes on the rows you re trying to show and hide

20553092
google-chrome	firefox
the call to the function works well with google-chrome and firefox

20553094
put	get
i moved some stuf from its place but basicaly you were trying to get your file before it was even downloaded so i just put some stuff inside the succes block

20553104
getter	setter
i ve come up with the following using generics and es5 getter setter building off of the u blorkfish answer

20553104
getter	setter
note backbone.model defaults is optional but since we use it to build the getter and setter it is now mandatory

20553109
spaces	delimiter
i am thinking of using and as the delimiter and then narrow down to delimiting with spaces

20553124
hide	show
each cell has some views and i would like to hide or show that views when i change the current cell at least when the event starts

20553146

i keep running into the issue where the image show when the switch is turned on but it doesn t hide when the switch is turned off

20553178
minimum	max	min	max
for this specific purpose you could also initialize your max min variables to the minimum maximum possible values respectively

20553199
rspec	minitest
give approvals a try it works with rspec i have used for testing json payload and it is used with minitest in exercism.io

20553237
post	get
i need to collect all post created by one user and get count of people who joined them

20553247
min	max
one way to solve this can be using the first element in the array as the max min element

20553265
springboard	tweak
you can alter the lock screen with a mobilesubstrate tweak on a jailbroken phone but this requires reverse-engineering springboard the ios launcher app can be quite complicated and obviously cannot be distributed through the app store

20553300
hide	show
to show or hide a element you would need to set the style.display property

20553301
int	chars
is a chars a or b in this example but n - c - 1 is not defined as you can t subtract a chars array c from an int n

20568170
getter	setter
when i faced this problem i didn t had time to find an answer i just used a plain getter and setter or rethink my logic so i did not need to override accessors but now i m trying to answer my question and study in some books so far i had only found this approach

nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
when a contract is violated the thrown exception type reflects why it failed such as nullpointerexception or illegalargumentexception

20568489
nullpointerexception	runtimeexception
i could use junit s since runtimeexception is the closest common parent of iae and nullpointerexception but this is overly generic as the method under test might throw some other runtimeexception

20568493
bazaar	git
i want setup the projectile project for project that has no local git hg bazaar etc

20568573
rdf	owl
then you re one of those â œusers who are doing owl2 work with the current owl1 support and desire a suitable set of names.â to find out how the owl2 construction should be serialized in rdf we need to take a look at owl 2 web ontology language mapping to rdf graphs second edition particularly section 2 mapping from the structural specification to rdf graphs which tells us that the class expression

20569695
crypt	hash
if you use crypt you just use and crypt figures out from the hash you provide which algorithm to use

20569695
hash	salt
the 5 denotes the hashing algorithm the is an option the hashing algorithm uses and usesomesillystringforsalt is a salt which insures that hash of the same password looks different for different people and making it harder to brute-force attack the hash

for-loop	arrays
i want to execute two filtering and one replacing steps on a large arrays but i cannot figure a way to do it efficiently without making some copy or for-loop

20569850
folder	directory
so when i select root and add folder folder should be added to root as well as same name folder should be added to the directory where the root folder exists

20569855
public	protected
yes if they are either public or protected

20569873
jenkins	sonar-runner
however if i run the analysis by invoking sonar-runner via jenkins the resulting analysis will have missed the dependencies between the maven modules

20569884
fgets	strcpy
furthermore i replaced fgets with strcpy because you cannot use fgets to get multiple text lines or you can use a file instead for more text

20569917
inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties	superclass	subclassing
a subclassing will only inherited the structure methods and properties of it s superclass and it s superclass s superclasse s

20569962
google-chrome	firefox
tested on ie9 firefox and google-chrome

20570039
width	height
other people have already mentioned this next reason but the first time i ever took this.var or this.func seriously in as3 and i usually still look at its usage with clear contempt was when i was overriding uicomponent.setlayoutboundssize which has a parameter named width and a parameter named height

20570048
put	get
so if it s really important for that message to get there you probably want to put it in the url somehow query string or routing or use a database

20570066
super	self
you cannot use super myclass self within a decorated class in this way

20570066
super	self
myclass is looked up as a global and the global myclass is rebound to decorator so you are telling python to look in the class mro for __init__ starting from decorator which is myclass which calls super myclass self .__init__ looking up myclass as a global which is bound to decorator etc

20570075
children	parent
as parent are rendered before children in most cases you will get the same data over and over

20570075
ready	each
each include should then call the parent blade method to append it s data to the already populated section and then yield once it is ready

20570095
setinterval	settimeout
it s a job for javascript using either settimeout or setinterval

20570114
subtract	add
how the script works when the user scrolls it moves as fast as speed-racers value tells it to move speed-racer subtract from racer-offset when racer-offset is 0 it stops any further movement then when the user scrolls back the opposite direction it should add the value of speed-racer back to racer-offset till it reaches leftmovements value in which it will stop

20570114
subtract	add
it subtract correctly but when it is suppose to add values back is where the problem begins

20570114
subtract	add
in the image below you see under subtract racer-offset 2525252525252525 what it should do is take the value of 25 + add it to the exisiting value and that will be the value of racer-offset till the next scroll takes place

20570122
vorbis	webm
so youâ re left with the formats that quicktime supports â œout of the box.â this is a long list but it does not include webm theora vorbis or the ogg container

20570122
mp4	h.264
however quicktime does ship with support for h.264 video main profile and aac audio in an mp4 container

20570122
mp4	h.264
mobile phones like appleâ s iphone and google android phones support h.264 video baseline profile and aac audio â œlow complexityâ profile in an mp4 container

20570122
mp4	h.264
adobe flash 9.0.60.184 and later supports h.264 video all profiles and aac audio all profiles in an mp4 container

20570122
mp4	h.264
internet explorer 9 supports all profiles of h.264 video and either aac or mp3 audio in an mp4 container

20570165
integer	unsigned
c99 6.2.5p9 a computation involving unsigned operands can never overflow because a result that cannot be represented by the resulting unsigned integer type is reduced modulo the number that is one greater than the largest value that can be represented by the resulting type.

20570220
post	get
i want to hide the id of the record i want to edit from my users so to get to the edit eg widget form i make users click a link which submits a form that post the id to my edit action instead of passing it as a parameter

20570254
setinterval	settimeout
use setinterval instead of settimeout

20570268
hash	md5
i have this c++ program developed in visual studio which should print out the sha1 and md5 hash of a given string

20570277
switching	screens
instead of worrying about how things look in inches you need to switching to pixels and use media queries to resize your image dynamically based on screens sizes

20570432
post	get
it looks like it was used in this post here grails spring security cas working in 2.2.3 but i cant seem to get them to resolve

serializable	deserialization
extension methods that will allow you to convert prior to serializable and convert back after deserialization

20570630
children	parent
in short in solution 1 children inherit from an instance of the parent

20570630
children	parent
in solution 2 the class of the children derived.prototype inherits from the class of the parent base.prototype

20570645
monkeyrunner	androidviewclient
i m recently started to use python with mobile app automation as i decided to use python the main instruments that i ve found were monkeyrunner and androidviewclient

20570650
ant	maven
for example i have ant grails maven subversion and many other packages installed under opt on my mac

20570659
vsto	add-in
its a bit sad as it would look a lot more profesional if we could put a custom application icon on a vsto add-in that would be visible in the programs and feature list in the control panel.

20570673
simplecursoradapter	spinner
all i need is a bit help on getting the selected string value from a spinner populated from my database by a simplecursoradapter

20570674
udp	tcp
check what is officially supported for instance under windows phone os 7.1 last os i tried before switching tcp unicast udp unicast and udp multicast clients are supported

20570686
range	max	range	min	min	max
since your range are going up as multiples of i just use that fact to determine the max and min values

20570695
min	max
you can normalize your data but then when you receive new input from a user you must normalize their data by using the same min and max you used when you trained your network

20570695
min	max
as the built-in function don t give you those values you may want to normalize the matrix by hand and then store min and max to later normalize user input

20570703
width	column-count
you need to set the width of ul because number of rows will depend on the width also even after setting the column-count

20570705
width	height
as an example if you have a screen object which has two dimensions height and width

20570705
width	height
the area associated with a particular instance would return the value associated with a particular instance s height and width

20570725
cos	exp
i really prefer avoid those regular expression that exist out there cos tons of them don t work in all cases and i don t want analyze after read the standard if a reg exp is correct or not

20570737
subtract	add
however right now when i add subtract a number to the small number fields it adds subtract a div to both the empty small medium div as well as in both products

20570812
width	margin
the .container gets positioned in the middle of the viewport with a set width and margin 0 auto

i want create a linearlayout and add many views textview imageview etc dinamically from fragment.i tried to do this but i ve difficulty with the context when i choose a fragment by split action bar

20570857
g++	gcc
the following function declaration is accepted by gcc but not accepted by g++

20570905
width	height	int	boolean
i have tried createbitmap bitmap source int x int y int width int height matrix m boolean filter wit the appropriate matrix matrix.postscale 2 2

20570919
min	max
however the line later that adds the education min max still executes but the value of predicate remains null

20570931
mouseover	mousedown
among which click mousedown mouseover are working fine but pressmove pressup events are not responding and they are not even generating any error

20570971
textview	imageview
i want create a linearlayout and add many views textview imageview etc dinamically from fragment.i tried to do this but i ve difficulty with the context when i choose a fragment by split action bar

20570976
children	parent
the parent class would contain a collection of children and the children would have a reference to its parent then the parent could have x number of children as opposed to only two

20570980
post	get
here s the code i m using there are unnecessary post variables being submitted i intend to clean some of those up once i get these last three figured out

20570998
accessor	properties
and in the mybean class there should be a date properties with the corresponding accessor methods

20571002
oncreate	setcontentview
i have 2 activities the first one fills a static hashtable and in the second one i want to inside the oncreate method of the second activity and after the setcontentview

20571060
inherited	subclassing
it lets base and derived instances inherited from the same object - while it seldom can be helpful to have multiple constructors for a class this is not subclassing

20571060
inherited	properties
also have a look at javascript inherited and the constructor properties

20571077
getter	setter
by defining getter and setter we are revealing the real properties inside the object

20571077
getter	setter
this causes a huge misunderstanding because at least here in brazil the majority of developers that i know either i two weeks ago don t know for what is javabeans purpuse they use getter and setter to every class they made regardless if its a ejb project or its a project under javabeans convention

20571077
getter	setter
i understood why they don t just set the attributes access to public instead of making getter and setter it s because of the logic they can have on changing an attribute value like updating listeners reference which is very commom on visual desktop components

20571091
caliburn.micro	prism	caliburn.micro	reactiveui
imho any modern mvvm-framework like catel caliburn.micro mvvmlight reactiveui is much better than prism

20571097
width	height
for example if your canvas has a width of 300px and a height of 100px

20571098
screens	mdpi
xhdpi 320 dpi x2 twice as dense as mdpi therefore an image in this folder needs to be twice as high and twice as wide as its mdpi counterpart to appear the same size on an xhdpi screens

20571116
post	get
looks like you can get an idea to your answer here in this post of stackoverflow question

20571203
hash	salt
if my-password + my-salt ends up being the same hash as yours then it most likely won t when i try my-password + your-salt remember the system forces the correct salt i only get to enter the password

20571264
folder	directory
right now it takes about 3 minutes to build the directory tree in a decent sized folder and another 3 minutes just to print the new location in testing mode

20571324
oncreate	ondestroy
i am trying to generate trace files for applications using the debug.startmethodtracing on the activity oncreate and debug.stopmethodtracing on the activity ondestroy according to the following documentation

20571324
oncreate	ondestroy
finally in the main activity on the oncreate and ondestroy methods i started the tracing

20571392
width	height
height equal to dynamic width css fluid layout

20571408
ant	maven
the android sub-project uses maven rather than ant so there is no build.xml file

20571432
int	double	int	boolean
there are different types of arguments like int double string boolean

20571435
textview	imageview
just set click listeners on both the imageview and the textview then you will know what one was clicked

20571437
qscrollarea	qmainwindow
i am trying to display an image inside a qscrollarea located on the qmainwindow

20571501
getter	setter
revealing getter and setter isn t necessarily revealing the properties inside the object

20571501
getter	setter
the getter and setter both pass and return an array

20571552
getter	setter
first of all accessing the fields i prefere this to attribute via getter and setter is encapsulation

20571552
getter	setter
it s encapsulation because the layer introduced in the getter and setter allows you to hide that actual state of the ojbect

20571552
getter	setter
the javabeans standard suggests the use of getter and setter rather than direct access to the data fields to provide encapsulation opportunities

20571562
width	margin
i had set css margin 0 auto on the container but the container doesn t resize and thus doesn t get css width to work with margin 0 auto

20571583
width	height
then use that as the background image for the body tag with width 100 and height 100 p

20571584
getter	setter	accessor	properties
the original bean spec oriented to use different accessor to the private properties like getter setter or getter and setter together or nothing

20571584
accessor	properties
using reflection to access the object properties beyond the bean spec and because a reflection is impact on performance optimized code has faster method collection and access properties accessor rather than class attributes

20571600
typedef	struct
but i m on the opinion that an enum must look like an enum a struct like an struct and so on and this typedef hides that

20571628
dictionary	map
another option is using hash map dictionary like so

20571666
onresume	onpause
the solution i found was to add the gps listener to the locationmanager in a method triggered by my activity s onresume instead of in the oncreate and to do .removegpsstatuslistener when the gpsclass performed the onpause

20571698
libstdc++	libc++
when i change the c++ compiler from libc++ to libstdc++ then i get a lexical or preprocessor issue cstdint file not found

20571713
put	get
what i need is for the main content to scroll up over the fixed content and the fixed content i put the div as fixed that way i could get the effect of the fixed-content being scrolled over

declare an event handler class and specify that the class either implements an actionlistener interface or extends a class that implements an actionlistener interface

20571859
range	minimum
i m attempting to dynamically select a range to find a minimum date

20571867
children	parent
when you float an element its parent does not automatically expand to contain any floated children

20571890
hash	md5
the problem that you re going to have is the guessing at the number of times the md5 was hash

20571971
for-loop	arrays
if this is a concern the alternative is to use a conventional for-loop to transform the arrays

20572016
google-chrome	firefox
as you may know in javascript and in most browsers i can test firefox google-chrome and ie

20572064
width	margin
then you will need to add a container div to the ul with a width and margin auto

20572075
post	get
if you still don t get it please post some code and i ll show you on that

20572084
width	height
30 of width or 45 of height

20572093
postgresql	mysql
i m guessing that this depends on the type of db you are using and it s auto increment policy implementation but i would need a way to get this to work in at least sqlite mysql and postgresql others aren t important but they wouldn t hurt either

20572108
rsa	aes
thus you will have to securely generate a random symmetric key doing that properly in javascript is not easy encrypt the data with it using a secure symmetric cipher aes in a secure block cipher mode then encrypt the symmetric key with rsa

20572111
uiview	uipangesturerecognizer
i ve also tried placing the uitableview s in a parent uiview and using a uipangesturerecognizer to move the uiview around

20572122
min	max
with mere html this is theoretically impossible because you can wether define a absolute height and min max height values or simply use auto which will automatically justify the box height depending on the size of your content

20572168
google-chrome	firefox
the navigation bar looks perfect in google-chrome but doesn t line up along the right edge in ie or firefox

20572190
implements	extends
a type is usually implements by unexported struct rtype via typeof while the value contains a and extends flag which is itself a reduced form of the kind

20577341
post	get
the first one ist via get the other way is via post

20577341
post	get
post instead just sends the data to the php-script so you can use this data like get but you do not have any url-parameters here

i believe that you re having problems because you re trying to do a get request to a route which only accepts put requests

20577728
children	parent
setclassunion creates a virtual class that is a superclass parent to the component classes so then both children inherit from that class which means you can dispatch the same function against each child

20578215
put	get
you can put one or both of the numbers with the .0 in order to get a floating point

20578262
int	double
to be clear without the double -returning declaration the line is treated as a call to an int -returning function whose result is then cast to a double

20578262
int	double
it is likely the case that the calling conventions on the particular system you re on specify that int s and double s get returned in different registers so the 0 is likely just to be whatever happened to be in that particular register while the double return value is languishing unobserved

20578288
int	double
in your first code snippet you are getting zero because all the math is being done as int and then converted to double by the assignment

20578288
int	double
essentially be aware whether your calculations are being done as int math or in double precision otherwise you ll get caught out

20578338
getter	setter
if you are allowing values to be freely get and set to any value with public setter and getter without taking any action whatsoever when they change you get the exact same functionality from simply marking those fields public and doing away with the getter and setter entirely

20578338
getter	setter
again all this code can be made much more readable by making the fields in your node and edge classes public and scrapping the getter and setter

20578339
put	get
an easier way to get the counts you just put a # before the name of the searching string and increase the value of this new variable if the string is really the same with and then with a set # you get all your counts

20581421
min	max	integer	unsigned
the min max heap supports multiple elements of the same unsigned integer key priority but does not preserve the order of entries with the same priority

20581421
min	max
the min max heap priority queue has the advantages that it has less computational complexity overhead as compared to other types of non-simplistic queues produces the min or max depending on whether a minheap or maxheap implementation in o 1 time and inserts and deletes with a worst case o log n time while adjusting and building require only o n time where n is the number of elements currently in the queue

20581424
hash	md5
when you hash data with sha1 or md5 or whatever you lose information the original string can t be recovered

20581498

note also that this code doesn t have to call sin or cos because that is handled by rotating the coordinate system

20581765
for-loop	loops
the for-loop body receives an angle argument as part of loops control

20581774
textview	imageview
i think that it would be better to use a single webview to show the content than a textview an imageview and a textview again

20581795
integer	unsigned
delphi 7 doesn t have an unsigned 64-bit integer type

20581795
integer	unsigned
you can tell from its windows.pas where ularge_integer is defined as a variant record holding either two unsigned 32-bit integers or one signed 64-bit integer which makes little sense until you realise that that s simply the least bad alternative if you really need something that s binary compatible with unsigned 64-bit integer types from another system

20581795
integer	unsigned
an unsigned 64-bit integer type requires compiler support which your compiler lacks so you cannot create it sorry

20581795
integer	unsigned
int64 was added in delphi 4 and that might be sufficient to avoid the need for a working 64-bit unsigned integer type but if you re stuck on delphi 3 not even that will work

20581796
google-chrome	firefox
i know how to access firefox and google-chrome using -moz- and -webkit-

20581915
int	chars
you try to cast a member variable from chars to int using the wrong syntax

20581950
google-chrome	firefox
this problem is also addressed at here which caused some developers to leave google-chrome and migrate to firefox

20581990
put	get
firstly jpeg is a lossy format so the number you put in might not be the exact number you get out a true black is likely to become a gray

20581994
min	max
it seems that the way min and max work on the char strings in name is by alphabetical order where a is the smallest value and z is the greatest and so forth

20581994
int	chars
what would happen with strings of both alphabetic chars and int or special chars

20582006
put	get
i could put the command at the bottom of every target but a it would get executed multiple times and b that is ugly and difficult to manage

20582095
width	height
the last size is the middle center size which has the width being linewidth less wider than the clientrectangle width and the height being linewidth less higher than the clientrectangle height

20582111
mouseup	mousedown
i ve found an other way instead of mouse click i ve used mousedown for going to frame 2 and mouseup for going to frame 1

20582121
int	chars
you should also change the type of temp from int to chars since name is a chars variable invalid conversion from chars to int is due to this error

20582208
width	height
i don t have benchmarks at hand but i think it won t be a problem at all if you set a width height different than the original one

20582242
min	max
the outer max high min low etc is here just to make group by happy they are not really meaningfull here since they have been processed in the inner select i don t know what open and close are so i just put first and last values with same partitionning

20582262
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i achieve this for ie internet explorer but now i am trying to transfer this data to all browsers such as google-chrome mozilla firefox safari

i d expect the user would just tap again - this time without a tap drag - and move forward successfully

20582406
freemarker	velocity
in 2.x we have support of multiple view technologies like velocity freemarker jasper reports jsp

20582420
int	chars
this will count all upper chars all digits and all non alphanumeric chars in password giving an int

20582443
post	get
the context.request.body is the right place to get post values but you need to include a name attribute on the form elements that you want to access

20582447
crossfilter	dc.js
the button could trigger some javascript without refreshing the page if you want to filter your data you can take a look into crossfilter or use a library that leverages it like dc.js

20582475
width	height
will output nan as calcarea in part of the global scope so has no knowledge of any instance of a rectangle class and the global scope does not have a height or a width attribute

20582545
for-loop	loops
variables declared in the for-loop initialisation clause are local to loops they are not accessible outside of it

20582571
implements	modifiers
if you implements m you do not need to repeat the implicit modifiers

20582593
width	height
that works for the complete desktop without any scaling width height framerate with the program below

20582603
min	max
also in this case you need an unique index on item_id and stock_reporting_date columns otherwise you need to use an aggregate function min max etc select max y.stock .

20582619
int	chars
it is important to say that my teacher ask from us made a chars array and not int array

20582674
children	parent	entities	entitymanager
in my case entitymanager had two entities in its context a parent with a list of children entities cascade cascadetype.all and a child from the list to remove

20582674
children	parent
looks like another solution is to remove cascading so that merging of parent entity wouldn t cause saving all its children

20582718
ubuntu	debian
debian ubuntu

20582854
rss	feed
i m writing a stylesheet to process rss atom feed on dreamwidth.org a livejournal-based blogging site

browsers safari google-chrome

20583091
portrait	landscape
you can specify different layouts for portrait and landscape orientations

20583115
folder	directory
chances are good that the files and folder remaining were in the directory at the root level of your disk which would be things like the trash and laptop-based time machine cache

20583117
sorting	filtering
this way the user can initially start filtering sorting etc even if the full dataset has not finished loading

20583127
int	chars
a comparison of a chars against an int value would then look like

20583158
kairosdb	opentsdb
there is also a fork of opentsdb that is called kairosdb and it uses apache cassandra as database so that you can store points up to milliseconds while opentsdb allows you to store points up to seconds

20583158
kairosdb	opentsdb
so i suggest you timeseries distributed databases like opentsdb kairosdb for plotting data in a quite simple way

20583286
int	double
you need the int to make the cast explicit from your which is a double to an int to fit in your variable since a double has 8 bytes in java and can not be stored in an 4 byte int

20583290
int	double
it s to cast the resultant double to int

20583293
int	double
double to int datatype

20583295

i m trying to compare two int or double parameters by using the method from main

20583300
entity-relationship	diagram
entity-relationship diagram have nothing to do with normalization

20583300
entity-relationship	diagram
entity-relationship diagram are not a logical design they are a conceptual design and that s a different beast and most of all they offer no way at all to specify the applicable fd s

20583307
int	boolean
this public boolean equals fat other method accepts only one argument but you are passing 2 arguments here equals bitterchocolate_amount milkchocolate_amount also as you said to compare 2 int then the method will be like this

20583309
google-chrome	safari
i m trying to convert my extension to the safari extension format but i can t figure out how to map the google-chrome sendmessage onmessage functions to safari s

20583512
google-chrome	firefox
both url complete fine when work in firefox or google-chrome

20583539

20583951
youtube	vimeo
i am using the android webview to embed youtube and vimeo players

20583961
for-loop	arrays
at first i suspected that there where some issue in the code i could be choosing the wrong types of variables somewhere but i tested it by including inside the for-loop a remind that i m using a 1-d arrays for storing couples of numbers not a 2-d one so in the condition i just multiply to test whether the problem was that the code was not looping 800.000.000 times but only 165191050

20583986
post	get
observations i use the method get because i want to show the answer with a no ajax call you should use post

20583986
gson	jackson
if you need to receive data to be serialized to objects you need to receive an object or to return and object you need to use for the communication json and in the servlet use some json serializer i recommend you gson o jackson so you receive a json string as parameter and deserialize in the servlet to respond serialize your object to json and send in the response if you send json you need to change the data attribute of the jquery ajax call so data json

20584000
jsf	seam
if no specific converters are provided and jsf is being used seam tries to infer the right converter from the destination property s class

20584000
jsf	seam
if no seam converter is found for the target type then seam delegates the election of an appropriate converter to the underlying jsf implementation

20584000
int	double	int	boolean
in the case of the jsf 1.2 ri this returns one of the default converters for byte boolean short int long float or double if the target type is one of these

20584043

folder	directory
i suppose you want to recursive the folder in a directory

20584237
hash	md5
and i am in need of something that will save a session id md5 hash rand 1 1000 variable

20584252
folder	directory
you need to read the directory and print an option tag for each time you find a file that is a folder

20584252
folder	directory
first thing you need to open file handler to your directory by giving the main folder path than itterate over the directory by using the read method on the folder handler

the problem is that the code works with int values only while i need my array to have double elements .

20584521
post	get
however it s recommended to use post for inserting and get for fetching data

20584536
implements	extends
there are a number of modules on cpan that implements the lcs algorithm for 2 sequences such as algorithm diff and string lcss_xs but i m having a hard time in extends them to work with more than 2 sequences because the lcs across multiple sequences is not necessarily a lcs between any two of them

20584537
int	double
you comparison function is for int not for double

20584547
post	get
file uploads are not possible with the get method so you have to use the post method

rank	max
you can go fancier and instead of returning simply an int containing the number of each card per rank you can also return the max card the max number of similar rank etc

20584943
width	height
i think the flickering is due to the fact that you re not setting a height or width for the new image element and therefore the following chain of events is happening

20584943
width	height
there is no width or height information for this new image so the element shrinks to 0x0 whilst the image data loads

20584943
width	height
now that the browser has the image data it can obtain the width and height directly from the data and it sets the img to have these dimensions

20584943
width	height
to avoid this either set a width and height on the inserted img element or just change the src of the element rather than messing around with removing and inserting elements

20584995

i want the max v -min v to be the same for each facet but max v and min v would be different depending on the data range for each row of plots

20585077
range	max
max v -min v are of the same size plenty of y-axis is wasted and trends are obscured by the extra range in each panel

20585083

for-loop	loops
the only solution i can come up with is to run through all courses in a for-loop and then have another for-loop within that for-loop to run through all activities and generate a new option if the activity.course.name field matches course.name but this is horribly inefficient since you have to loops through all activities for each course

the keys are 0 1 2 3 4 and this for-loop repeats while variable is smaller or equal to arrays count 5

20588822
cpu	processors
this is necessary because at a hardware level a processors has a local bus copy of memory values for performance often referred to as bus memory or cpu cache

20588845

linear-gradient is a type of background-image not a background-color

20588865

20588876
width	height
what you can do is go to the rectangle tool and expand it to whatever height you want however you must make sure that you expand the width to the edges of the web canvas past the body border until the tooltip displays 100

alternatively you could use a combination of background-image and background-position which has the advantage of not touching the display value

20588986
hide	show
then on the completion of each task call a method that holds the code to hide the progress bar and show the list

20589034
range	max
to be honest rather than returning false and doing nothing else when you set anisotropy above or below the acceptable range i would consider clamping the values to 1.0 max

20589089
for-loop	arrays
creating the arrays in order is a trivial for-loop and there are plenty of standard algorithms for shuffling too

20589100
int	double
i then cast this double into an int to produce a number which i can use to draw an image in a jpanel

20589101
width	height
this means the image takes width x height x 4 bytes in memory where width and height are the image size in pixels

subtract	add
consider this example you have 3 buttons add subtract and equals

20589194
jcheckbox	jradiobutton
note that jtogglebutton is the parent class for jradiobutton and using it would allow you to add jradiobutton jcheckbox and jtogglebuttons to the list

20589194
jcheckbox	jradiobutton
since your jradiobutton is not part of a buttongroup perhaps you should be using a jcheckbox instead

20589194
jcheckbox	jradiobutton
you should follow a with code that creates your jradiobutton or jcheckbox that sets their actioncommand string that places them in the gui and that adds them to the arraylist

20589207
for-loop	arrays
i can make a separate arrays of keys sort them and then do a for-loop with an indexâ but that seems like a lot of work and rather inefficient

queue	fifo
however different queue can have different scheduling policies such as fifo fifo last-in-first-out lifo priority or random

20589447
queue	fifo
however in computer science programming we typically use the word queue to refer specifically to fifo queue and use the other words stack priority queue etc. for the other scheduling policies

20589447
queue	fifo
in practice you should assume fifo when you hear the word queue but don t completely rule out the possibility that the speaker might be using the word more generally

20589450

whether it becomes a parent itself depends on whether it forks its own children

since your children exit immediately the signal from the parent might never be delivered because the children are dead already and the kill in the parent might be failing with esrch no child with that pid exists any longer

then write with std ostream write

20597042
width	height
if i removed everything from that textview but width and height parameters the tests worked just fine again

20597052
hide	show
then in your js when the button is clicked simply use to hide the first and to show the contact form

20597089
width	height
finally i had to use a plain activity to avoid the exception you got plus another one where actionbarview checking it s width height

20597100
post	get
as example this is the rewrite rule for an url used to get all post from an author

20597121
getter	setter
now you don t need to write a custom getter or setter and will be able to directly assign to coordinate from the code that instantiates this class

20597154

when i hover over the circle the text shows up nicely but if i remove the mouse the third time i mouseover the height and width of the box that matches the dimensions of the text starts growing continuously and there s this weird stroboscopic effect

20597291
portrait	landscape
note this value ie portrait or landscape does not correspond to actual device orientation

20597291
portrait	landscape
the browser to use landscape styles instead of portrait

20597291
portrait	landscape
so to recapitulate it is not actually the screen orientation that triggers portrait or landscape media queries

20597291
width	height
however it is the ratio between height and width of the screen

20597291
portrait	landscape
here are the representative media queries affecting portrait and landscape orientation

20597352
put	get
you get this error because you re trying to put ascii-8bit character to utf-8 encoded database

20597439

in the javascript file i am using to update the preview in real time when the option to display the extra elements is changed i am checking weather or not the elements have been loaded and if they have i use fadein and fadeout to remove or add the elements however if they have not been loaded i will need to force the preview to reload using jquery as the elements will not yet exist to fadein or fadeout

20600347
quicksort	median-of-medians
in quicksort that subroutine does all the heavy lifting required to sort everything and in median-of-medians it does one of the essential steps to shrink down the input

daemons	launchd
a better approach would be to use scrapy daemons api to launchd spiders upon getting a spider request you ll then use curl like this

20612117
maven-deploy-plugin	pom.xml	maven	pom.xml
the property is used to set the configuration value for the maven-deploy-plugin to skip deploy as default which should be overridden in a sub pom.xml for packaged projects and i believe that it should be possible to override a user defined property like this but not a maven property which would be maven.deploy.skip in this case

20612117

the widget is two level with parent and children and that s all

20618811
children	parent
i added one an elif to handle anything where a parent was checked as it didn t seem to read that the children were checked as an effect of this

20618811
children	parent
i m sure the code is nasty but by only selecting the children it partial checks the parent which allows for the export function to work correctly

20618819

i ve tracked all of the errors to a line something like for some reason show and hide aren t returning anything

20618819
hide	show
in the showhide and the show hide functions in the jquery file the return values are defined

i wonder if anybody has done a performance analysis for the maximum time that the wakelock will be acquired by the alarmmanager or has an alternative approach

20620977

i m betting i got confused with post and get methods

20622011
getter	setter
for each es5-only functionality either it s methods or methods or new syntax â getter setter etc. you have 3 options

20622011
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox

20623137
rbac	acl
managing perms acl or rbac or other within the database is a bloody mess and hard to get right

20623137
rbac	acl

something like this...though i m not sure how i feel about pyquery try beautifulsoup

20623409

20623616
prepare	execute
now my doubt is the following here how to execute an action if the before_action returns false it was told that the goal of the before_action is to prepare something before the action is execute if it returns false it doesn t mean that the action is not run but according the book it is right so...so i am getting a little bit confused

20623714
keydown	keyup
the problem i m running into is that it s possible to trigger a keypress or a keydown and type a character without triggering a keyup

20623714
keydown	keyup
conversely only the keyup event can read the value of the input with the newly inputted character because both the keydown and keypress fire before the character is added into the input

20623714
keydown	keyup
the only solutions i can think of are triggering the keyup event one the keydown event but this can cause problems other places

20623735

for example if you want to fill all view with rectangle you have to retrieve its size like i did in onsizechanged then draw rectangle with canvas.drawrect 0 0 width height border

20623980
int	chars
assuming each line ends in a whitespace chars followed by the int id you can use this

20623988
versioning	upgrade
if you are unable to upgrade your versioning of wpf then you will need to disable resize as others have mentioned

20624089
free	malloc
you can see the same behavior with plain old malloc and free except that you ll probably get a segfault at free instead of a nice error

20624094
put	get
i get absolutely no error messages but when i send things to mysql via php script nothing happens in mysql i also sent something via the mysql command prompt and it looks like it just made a test table and didn t put anything in it like i asked but i m not positive i did everything i should have in this case

the ant script when executed waits on the sudo passwd -

20624214
sudo	passwd
my aim is to execute this ant script such that it does not wait for the sudo passwd

20624256
for-loop	loops
i cannot see any click handler in your code and the for-loop will really to that loops and you ll logically see the last iteration

20624282
int	chars
converting to chars before converting to int gives the expected values

20624351
ng-show	ngcloak
have tried with ngcloak and ng-show but these don t stop the browser looking for the image they just hide the container

20624394
hive	hdfs
if the partition already exists in hive hdfs directory then you don t need to run any hive alter commands

20624405
daemon	cron
then setup a daemon or a cron job that runs as root scans the text file for the commands to be executed and runs them

20624441
google-chrome	firefox
the following is result in google-chrome and firefox google-chrome render the radius very smooth however firefox is not same as ie i have also attached my css below

20624468

another thing to watch out for you re declaring a variable multiplyresult as the input element for the multiplying result but then re-declaring that variable as the result of your albeit erroneous multiplication

20624521
scikit-learn	liblinear
the warning refers to the liblinear faq since scikit-learn s linearsvc is based on that library.

20624755
phpstorm	webstorm
once webstorm phpstorm are launched this way you can run a script with root access without supplying root credentials

you will need to save the position x y and size height width of the window yourself and set those values when the program starts up again

20624798
ubuntu	linux
that key will be added to the authorized_keys for the default user ec2-user for amazon linux ubuntu for the ubuntu ami etc

google-chrome	firefox
it is perfectly centered in firefox and google-chrome

20625086
versioning	upgrade
please upgrade to the latest versioning

20625114
google-chrome	firefox
that being the case firefox seems to be closer to the spirit of the css specification wording whereas google-chrome seems to have decided to clip to the edge of the content box which is the inner edge of the padding box

20625114
google-chrome	firefox
thus i think firefox is perhaps more right but other developers at google-chrome think otherwise

20625141

coldfusion	railo
the following code works on adobe coldfusion 9.01+ but not railo 4.1

20625173
range	minimum	range	max	range	min	minimum	max	min	max
this seems backwards normally min should return items above the minimum and max should return items below the maximum so that when you specify both you get a bounded range

20625174
children	parent
parent must wait for their children

20625192
rspec	capybara
i m not sure where to start debugging but i m using rails 4.0.2 ruby 2.0.0p353 and rspec + capybara for testing

20625352
getter	setter
hibernate will handle a java.util.date or java.sql.date directly so you could change the data type to one of those and then perform the mapping to the joda object in the getter setter so it s available that way to the callers

20625395
mouseleave	mouseenter
for instance the entire table appears to be re-revaluated when the value of changes on mouseenter mouseleave

20625416
fgets	fgetc
edit the reason that one could not use fgetc instead of read is for the same reason that using fgets won t work

20625416
fgets	fgetc
thus i suggest that you follow the advice of the documentation and never mix streams io using fgets fgetc etc. and file descriptors io using read write etc.

20625453
google-chrome	firefox
essentially roko is correct google-chrome implements the feature with anti aliasing ie firefox do not at least with the version settings u are using

if this is undesirable you can use min | max

20625640
children	parent
however when it comes to multi-parent reproduction crossover one of the frequently used techniques is to produce 2 children instead of 1 from the same 2 parent

20625640

of course after the crossover you can do the mutation

20625702
for-loop	loops
the third section in the for-loop is run after each iteration execution of loops body

20625892
udp	tcp
the program has to handle udp tcp ipv4 ipv6 and pim multicast connections

20626037
width	height
yes the problem occurs because u have set both height and width to your textbox

20626037
width	height
the reason being scrollviewer helps to scroll only when the height or width required by the textblock control is not available and then it provides scroll bar to see the content

20626037
width	height
since the height and width of the textbox since explicitly set is within the range of the scroll viewer it doesnt provible scrollbar

20626136
hash	md5
joomla use md5 hash to store password which is many to one mapping

20626136
hash	md5
so its almost impossible to recover joomla password from md5 hash

hash	md5
to change password just generate another md5 hash and replace it in database

20626145

but now my problem is that when i click on sub menu or child of any parent menu item it successfully takes me to the child page but removes active class from parent and puts it on children because it is the currently viewed page

20626265

detecting change in letter regions english letters are all connected except for the letter i lowercase so if horizontal spacing of a region of strokes is more than say 33 of the length of the first stroke height or width of the character being drawn i think it s safe to assume you have created a new letter hence the gap

20639728
touchesbegan	touchesended
detecting stroke types to detect the direction of a stroke horizontal vertical diagonal simply check the starting x y touchesbegan and the ending x y touchesended and compare with if-statements

20639728
touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchesended
another acceptable approach is a touchesbegan and a touchesended being called but not touchesmoved being called a tap is a dot to detect if a stroke is a line or a curve use distance formula between the starting and ending points and compare it to the actual amount distance drawn which you can keep track of with variable changes in touchesmoved if the actual amount drawn is more than 30 that of the distance formula i would say it s safe to assume a curve was drawn instead of a line like in the letter c you can also detect which way a curve bends by keeping track of the furthest left and or further right points x-val and comparing it to the starting or ending x-val point
