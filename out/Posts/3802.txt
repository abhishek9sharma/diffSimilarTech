9120304
queue	fifo
but if i have several nodes and load balancer in front then i can not guarantee fifo ordering of requests for async execution for the same client since i have already several queue

9120813
division	multiplication
note that converting just the first operand is enough to cause both the multiplication and the division to be done in type double

9120827
queue	fifo
use ehcache or some other distributed cache i built a queue wrapper around ehcache to enable it to be used like a fifo queue and it also has rmi or jms replication so multiple nodes will see the same data

9120865

typedef	struct
an anonymous struct with a typedef in the global namespace

9121174
typedef	struct
a tagged struct with a typedef in the global namespace

9121174

set the image width ensuring that it scales it s height proportionally

9121214
min	max

i have a page that uses rich fileupload and a a4j commandbutton what i want to achieve is the first time the page is loaded the fileupload shoul appear be rendered my backingbean default is true and so it renders correctly and when the user hits the commandbutton i would love to hide the fileupload and show an outputtext this is not happening no error at all

9121279

is seems that formrendered is always evaluated to true when i want it to be false once a user clicks the button and so the fileupload hide and show the outputtext

9121330
google-chrome	firefox
it is really fast in google-chrome but slow in ie and firefox

9121334
free	malloc
avoids n calls to malloc free it s faster and simpler to allocate deallocate

9121357
for-loop	arrays
you can try length cacheing - create a variable for example and use that in the for-loop s condition rather than getting the length property every time - depending on the implementation there is usually an overhead with looking up an arrays s length so if you have a big arrays this difference can be noticeable

9121357
put	get
also create temporary variables to keep your str and ank strings as they get bigger then only put them in the innerhtml right at the end

9121362
pop-up	dialog
when a user clicks my download link there is a slight pause between the click and when the download dialog pop-up in the users browser this is because my server is creating a zip of a bunch of files and it could take a short while

9121362

field component usually a jtextfield but it also could be a jcombobox or a jdatechooser control

9121408
int	double
however when i tried removing the static assert to take a look at the alternative compiler error i was shocked to discover that gcc doesn t even complain when you try to make a const double referring to an int

9121408
int	double
that means that when printing a double it should interpret 8 bytes at that address as a double and print it yet there is actually a 4 byte int at that location

9121415
dictionary	map
i would change to using a dictionary variable that would let you easily map string names to values

9121421

rtp	rtcp
the rtp specification says that the rtcp packets for a given rtp stream will be sent on a port that is +1 of the main rtp port

9121430
rtp	rtcp
so for example if you have video arriving on rtp port 9010 then on port 9011 you can expect rtcp packets

9121430
rtp	rtcp	rtp	rtsp	rtsp	rtcp
when i m negotiating a unicast stream via the rtsp protocol i have to suggest pair of ports that i would like the video sent to me on 1 for rtp and 1 for rtcp .

9121430
rtp	rtcp
the problem i have is that i actually need a pair of ports and i need the rtcp port to be +1 of the rtp port in fact i think i need the rtp port to be an even number

9121440
post	get
if you can post more details about your intended use case you ll probably get better answers

9121606
free	malloc
i guess using malloc and free withing the same scope produces overhead but what s the alternative

9121639
for-loop	loops
but then when you loops back to the begining of the for-loop q is incremented to 2 so you look at hedf next skipping fedf

9121656

9121963
ciimage	uiimage
in the uiimage docs under the ciimage property it says if the uiimage object was initialized using a cgimageref the value of the property is nil. apparently the uiimagepickercontroller does initialize the image from a cgimageref because this property is indeed nil

9121990
put	get
but i get all sorts of errors when i try to put code that actually draws something into a page or block.

9122249
vim	emacs
i think if say some vim users or people who want the post management but not org-mode publish but perhaps markdown or something else right now its hard-coded to just open emacs - if those people wanted to help make this more generic then well that d be great

9132804
stdout	stderr
i m shelling out to the svnadmin dump command which sends the dump to stdout and any errors it encounters to stderr

9132804
stdout	stderr
stdout will go to the backup file but stderr is what i need to capture in my perl script

9132804
stdout	stderr
stdout needs to end up in a file and stderr needs to end up in perl

9132832

9132856
cvs	svn
i used to work with cvs for several years but for some reason the company started to create all of their projects to svn

9132856
cvs	svn
next thing i know is that i have to convert my current netbeans java cvs project into a svn one

9132861

you just need to get the current scrolltop value for the div you wish to scroll and then calculate the difference between the y position of the mousedown and the current y position of the mousemove then add that to the div s scrolltop position

9132909
ssl	https
understands multiple network protocols out of the box including tcp ssl http https websockets

9132914

9132937
google-chrome	firefox
also in recent versions of the three major browsers google-chrome firefox ie there is a built-in inspector

9132956
many-to-many	one-to-many
even if you still do it with only two entities invoice and product which implies that you combine the concepts of product and selling product in one entity still the relationship between invoice and product is one-to-many not many-to-many

9132969
cout	cin
iostream do to ensure the initialization of std cin and std cout

9132989
spaces	linefeed
the words are splitted at every spaces tab character newline character carriage-return character and linefeed character

9133032
webkit	gecko
this is possible by using the fileapi that is part of html5 but it s only supported in modern browsers webkit gecko and the api is not completely finished yet so it s kind of a changing target

9133047
stdout	stderr
well there are generic ways to do it within perl too but the bash solution which the above makes me think you re looking for is to redirect stderr first to stdout and then redirect stdout to a file

9133047
stdout	stderr
however do not do it the other way ie put the 2 1 at the end or else all the output of both stdout and stderr will go to your file

9133055
post	put
instead of putting the link in the message parameter you can put it in the link parameter of your http post to the graph api

9133065
stdout	stderr
to read both a command s stdout and its stderr separately it s

9133085
crypt	md5
the othe question you refer to only provides links to the traditional crypt 3 method based on des and the 1 method based on md5

9133130
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it needs to work in all browsers that jquery supports ie7+ firefox safari google-chrome etc

9133190
post	put
however this acts a bit funny with post put and delete operations if you need to use an additional parameter like so

9133233
post	get
well how does your code look which is the result you expect which one do you get if you get an error post the exact error message

9133311
children	parent
set a fixed height for the parent then set the children with height 100 meaning 100 of the parent element

9133312
children	parent
by giving .artist-container a higher z-index you are placing it higher in the stacking order than the child image though children always have a higher z-index than their parent

9133314
for-loop	arrays
from step 4 to 5 specifically in the second for-loop a new arrays images src is being created and is passed to the callback function which is defined as inline just before step 2

client-side	server-side
nope it can be done server-side or client-side

9133357
hide	show
so when i don t release the finger mouse after xyms the header footer doesn t show hide

9133420
outputstream	inputstream
the general idea is that your server and client will communicate with each other using inputstream s and outputstream s which can be accessed from a socket via getinputstream and getoutputstream once the connection between them is made

9133426
profiling	instrumentation
in my instrumentation profiling on a dual-core iphone 4s i see no significant difference in rendering speed or cpu usage between the stock version of this sample application and my modified one that runs the frame upload on a background queue

9133556
uiview	subviews
use a subviews with the same size as your uiview and set the color and alpha on the subviews to your desired tranparency rather than setting the alpha of your view

9133559
ant	maven
my guess is that the tests are executed one by one or class by class in eclipse and by a build script such as maven or ant in hudson

9133600
implements	extends
implements a table model by extends asbtracttablemodel and use the list to implements its methods

9133722
put	get

9133762
post	get
them make a http post or http get request from the android application to the server to get the required data

9133788

9133818
hide	show
so how to show hide an other cobobox with the help of a combobox item

9133827
hide	show
both popups cannot be show simultaneously so assign the macro to a keyboard shortcut and alternate between that shortcut and the undo shortcut to add remove parentheses and show hide the function list

9133837
post	get
first you would need to use xpath component to get value for your xml tag and then setbody to pass parameter to proxied request optionally you could switch from post to get

9133946
pull	push
then the registry cache is cleared and the push pull then works

9133947
width	height
update yes i can do it by setting specific height and width on the inner square

jsonb	hstore
alternatively you can use the data types json in postgres 9.2+ jsonb in postgres 9.4+ or hstore for key-value pairs

9134318
ready	each
each .ready adds a handler to the list of handlers for the ready event

9134361
mouse	keyboard
another good strategy would be to build a program that simply runs the gui of your export program by sending mouse and keyboard events directly to it

9134362
for-loop	arrays
if you are using your own set up webserver you could enable curl where you can parse the xml sourcecode saving it into variables and showing it step by step using an arrays and a for-loop

9134362
explode	substr
so you know what the source actually looks like when using curl next step is to find the specific data in that url and parse your way to that point using explode creates arrays and substr and you can save those into an array like

9134382
ready	each
each document ready block will be run sequentially as shown here

9134423
macports	homebrew
i ve installed the dependencies via macports and homebrew as well

9134424
filtering	grouping
since we can t filtering by where for a time interval we use it as a grouping function and filtering by having

9134440
fgets	getline
for a simple task like this one you should use fgets or better getline if you have it and convert the age to an integer with strtoul

9134455
google-chrome	safari
wow64 applewebkit 535.7 khtml like gecko google-chrome 16.0.912.63 safari 535.7

9134603
post	get
file get attached in the post as a file upload

9134644

9134671
width	height
i can see the face width is 18.75 and the height is 33.33 but the full size is 844x450 so how can i reflect these values to grab the face specially with the rotation values as well

9134703
width	height	inherited	properties
the first child input of an element with the haslayout properties triggered for example via zoom 1 a clearfix setting a height or width will inherited the sum of the left margins of its ancestors

9134705

9134956
bibtex	latex
when using org-mode and its latex export bibtex or biblatex is often used to handle references

9134959
floating-point	integer
you are storing floating-point types into an integer type

9134967
int	double
edit as said in other post use double or float instead of int to avoid truncated division

9134969
uncaughtexceptionhandler	runnable
while i agree with john vint that executorservice with an uncaughtexceptionhandler is a good approach if for some reason you really want to stick with runnable i d suggest that your base class command have some fields getters for status and exception

9134997
folder	directory
though there s probably not much of reason for a php folder - just keep all your pages in the root directory

9135011
ssl	https
i have been using django for a few months and the ssl middleware to redirect to https from http in my urls

9135023
cvs	svn
note that netbeans support cvs svn and mercurial vcs out of the box

9135063
int	double
the intermediate results are not int this should be a double

9135063
int	double
since you will use this in a division it should be a double 1 2 is 0 if calculated in int

9135079
explode	implode
so null is accepted when no value is given simply to maintain the process of explode and implode by php

9135093

if you check the wiki you ll learn that all new services like foursquare linkedin instapaper evernote have been added to this new version

9135433
getter	setter
have a look at apples advanced memory management programming which tells you how to implement your own getter setter properly

9135440
rss	feed
as no one has a good tutorial for storyboard using html parsing this is becoming less of an optionâ i have had to move on to an rss feed reader

9135456
waitpid	fork
if your application is single-threaded you can t wait on a process that will be created after the waitpid call starts because there is nothing to do the necessary fork to create the child

9135469
portrait	landscape
there is a function to check for landscape checker too but if the first if statement is false meaning the device is not in portrait then it must be in landscape hence the plain else

9135496
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
sqlconnection sqlcommand and sqldatareader all implement idisposable

opera	safari
implement the two modes and ie windows 6 mozilla safari and opera

9135640

9135671
rss	feed
i have curl command line running to get an rss feed on a site that requires a login

9135677
onresume	onpause

9135800
intersect	contains
it can contains rectangles and graphic paths and has an intersect method which returns the intersection of itself and another region graphicspath or rectangle

i have looked into the following none of which can be used with maven without either creating your own artifact for it or adding a whole bunch of extra hacks to your pom.xml

9135852
width	height
i think it has to do something with your width and height

9135874

9135942
fseek	ftell
the file size is representable in the data type used by the fseek ftell variant you choose

9135945
hash	salt
make sure you salt your hash - this prevents rainbow attacks or at least requires the rainbow-attacker build a table with your salt in mind

9135945
hash	salt
for example hash hash card#+salt1 +expiredate+salt2 - requires knowledge of both the card # and the date to generate easy for you but can t easily be reverse-engineered rainbow requires for every card # every useful expire date + knowledge of both salt

9135945
hash	salt
dynamic salt throwing a random value into the hash is great for reducing rainbow attacks - you store that random piece in the table with the hash value - now when building a rainbow you have to build one for every dynamic salt

9135945
hash	salt
however for your needs you can t do this - you need to know the right random salt to use the second time you create the hash otherwise you ll never get an intercept on the second card use .

typically the add method will take the passed-in delegation and add it to either a list of delegation or a multicastdelegate

9136187
allocator	stl
you can get around both of those issues by only destroying from the library that creates good practice anyway and using stl objects that take a deleter for allocator and exporting using undecorated names and or the c style extern c for exported methods

9136203
stdout	fflush
on a terminal stdout is usually line buffered you have to either fflush stdout or a print a new line n to see your characters printed

9136203
stdout	fflush
on non interactive devices streams are often full-buffered and you have to fflush stdout to have your characters printed

9136209

for my assingment i m supposed to create a file of precomputed hash values from a given dictionary with a salt of 0 - 255 to each password

9136226
width	height
object â if the two bitmapdata objects have the same dimensions width and height the method returns a new bitmapdata object that has the difference between the two objects see the main discussion

9136231
int	double
however i want to be able to allow vectors of int to be added to vectors of double etc and automatically get the right return type - this requires a trailing return type

9136237
put	get
i looked on msdn and i kind of get the idea that it s in memory and not put on the file system but i can t find it anywhere it says this explicitely

9136243
width	height
you cannot retrieve width height before image has been loaded

9136246
pull	push
on the other hand you can manually merge their branch and push which i semi-regularly do for mistargetted pull requests

invoking in jscript vbscript from windows script host html

9136286
google-chrome	firefox

you should consider using a recursive settimeout instead of setinterval to avoid a race condition

9136343
implements	extends	jtextfield	jlabel
userinputdialog is a class i wrote that extends s jframe implements actionlistener and keylistener uses flowlayout and presents the user with a jlabel jtextfield and cancel ok jbutton s

9136343
keyevent	actionevent
when the jtextfield generates a keyevent where or when the ok jbutton generates an actionevent userinputdialog does some input validation calls setvisible false and then calls myapp.dosomething jtextfieldinstance.gettext

9136356
innodb	myisam
if you are not using innodb table and instead are using myisam you can use mysql s built in full text search

9136357
int	chars
on the other hand if you see it inside a routine that is copying a string or formatting an int along with dealing with leading trailing chars etc. then you know to concentrate on that

9136400
free	malloc
a pointer allocated with new or malloc in the exe should not be released with delete or free in the dll and vice versa

in google-chrome the attribute is null in firefox it is an empty string

9136992
ready	each
this scenario assumes you have premade views ready for each controller scenario i included action code as well in case you wanted to use that

9136992
ready	each
if no premade views are ready then just put in the code that should show up for each case instead of rendering another view

9137028
superclass	subclassing
the question is is there a way so that i can force to call a method using the subclassing one if the one i am creating is the superclass

9137083
jquery	scriptaculous
look into jquery and scriptaculous

9137093

note that sometimes hiding for example button or checkbox is not the best solution

9137134
hide	show
to use a uiactivity view just show it in the webview s didstartload delegate method and hide it in the didfinishload

9137180
superclass	subclassing
so basically you can call a superclass from your class but not a subclassing

9137180
superclass	subclassing
there s no relation there unless you initialize your subclassing by passing a reference of itself to it s superclass

9137189
move	drag
as i drag the slider i m hoping to get the above-specified behavior but all that s happening is the squares are rotating as they should while the lines do nothing they should move up and down with the squares

9137193
jobs	cron
eventually i would like to have two cron jobs for peak and off-peak with different intervals

9137196
hide	show
in this function i check model properties and call model.trigger hide or model.trigger show

9137201
multiplying	multiplication
unless you use a fast algorithm such as karatsuba multiplication the algorithm to multiplying two numbers as you described is the simple o n 2 algorithm that you learned in elementary school - multiplying each digit of the second list by each digit of the first list carrying as necessary

9137210
facebook	fbconnect
i m using fbconnect to post messages on facebook

9137210
post	put
i tried to put the itunes link of the app in the message but it post a link to itunes as i wrote

for-loop	loops
to do this with the structure that you are using arraylist it would be done using 2 for loops one for each list enhanced for-loop since its an iterable object

9137222
firefox	safari
using firefox 9.0.1 and safari 5.1.2 both on os x

9137227

9137270
int	boolean	int	double
if you google for this names you will find out that they are similar to string int double and boolean

9137289

when asking for a width or height from a css styled element you will have a value returned as a string containing px to filter off this px and make it an integer i use the parseint function

9137292
getter	setter
i see that there are no getter and setter methods in cakephp models to access columns in a database like there is in symfony

9137292
getter	setter
without those getter and setter methods i can t really do pure oop programming in cakephp

9137292
getter	setter
or do i have to implement those getter and setter myself in the model

9137294
firefox	safari
my tree looks fine when viewed in firefox and safari

9137299
rss	feed
i am working on a drupal module proving rss feed generation though not posting it to drupal answers as my question is not really drupal-related

9137307
next	except
moving iterator from one element to the next is an o c operation both in the list and in the multi map except c is slightly smaller for the list so it is unlikely you ll gain much by combining the two

9137330
hide	show
i have tracked down the problem to the way that popuppanel show hide itself which affects the other subclasses like dialogbox

9137330
children	parent
when a parent s visibility css property is changed internet explorer doesn t notify its children about the property change events

9137334
width	height
as you can see the width and height are interpreted very differently

9137347
super	self	superclass	subclassing
in the implementation of a subclassing you can call a method of the superclass by using the super keyword instead of self

9137372
filtering	grouping
your grouping query is just an equality filtering on a single property of the customer kind

9137372
filtering	grouping
if that s not ok option 2 or a set of separate customer-to-group pairing entities in the same entity grouping would make the grouping query with ancestor filtering strongly consistent with updates

9137376
post	get
you also should capture the msg that you get from a post

9137412

i ve built this webpage at and in google-chrome safari it looks ok but in firefox it s broken

9137498

i was wondering if there is a way to only load the image as 16x16 instead of like 2000x2000 not just change the width and height of the image and also not changing the actual size of the image with php

9137539
respond.js	modernizr
first off based on the forums i have been reading you should not include respond.js from modernizr they are more than likely going to drop it

9137562
viewdidload	dealloc
think of viewdidload and viewdidunload as being like the init dealloc for the view property of the view controller

9137568

hide	show
it will hide the div but when i try to submit the form it won t show the iframe

9137646
m2e	pom.xml	maven	m2e	maven	pom.xml
you probably should be using maven with the eclipse m2e plugin and configuring the annotation processing in each project s pom.xml files .

9137646
maven	pom.xml
this page describes how to configure maven s java compiler plugin and this one lists the attributes you can set in the pom.xml file

9137671
onresume	onpause
likely when you switch from one tab to another setcurrentitem just detaches the ui from the currently active fragment or calls its onpause method and then re-attaches the ui for the newly selected fragment or calls its onresume method

9137737
int	chars
error pm136 illegal explicit conversion from underlying misra type unsigned chars to unsigned int misra c 2004 rule 10.3

i tried to override onpause onresume ondestroy with this

9137752
onresume	onpause
i tried to override onpause onresume ondestroy

9137795
viewdidload	viewwillappear
ui-related things should go in viewdidload if they re related to setting up the views or viewwillappear if they re related to configuring the views loading them with data

9137822
hide	show
the more elegant way would be to add a filter method to the mycollectionview which would use underscore methods to filter the views you want to show hide and do its job of well.

9137822
hide	show
jquery hide show can be a bit taxing - though it s a concern you will have only with large amount of data views

9137868
versioning	upgrade
the easy fix is to upgrade php to the latest versioning or i think it was fixed in the next versioning of php

9137873

9137902
jqgrid	jeditable
the reviewed products are jqgrid jeditable flexgrid tgrid and ingrid

9137912

sounds like you should just use assign for any primitives like int or boolean

9137935
hex	binary
i am writing a relatively simple program using tkinter that is a converter for binary decimal and hex

9137984
cpython	ironpython
i am unsure how to use multiprocessing without jython or cpython or some other ironpython whatsahoosie and have opted to use threads for my multicore centos program

9137993
accessor	properties
when you access a view controller s view properties the view accessor method checks whether the view has been loaded yet

9137996
mouse	keyboard
the program allows for a whole lot more and is worth a closer look if you need to automate tasks that require special mouse keyboard actions across multiple windows

9138045
inherited	subclassing
it would seem that a subclassing does inherited the private fields in that these very fields are utilized in the inner workings of the subclassing philosophically speaking

9138045
superclass	subclassing
a subclassing in its constructor calls the superclass constructor

9138045
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
the superclass private fields are obviously inherited by the subclassing calling the superclass constructor if the superclass constructor has initialized these fields in its constructor

9138045
accessor	superclass	superclass	subclassing
but of course without accessor methods the subclassing cannot access the superclass private fields it s like not being able to pop the back panel of an iphone to take the battery out to reset the phone.

9138045
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
the private fields even if not accessible by the subclassing are the inherited state of the superclass

9138068
portrait	landscape
what s more android fun is if i just rotate my phone orientation that will fix the bottom layout and it lays out perfectly in both portrait and landscape

9138077
int	chars
during some processing i am using the int value of chars of these capital letters

9138080
width	height
remember width and height of the images must be the same

9138131
button	checkbox
the form consists of 10 questions and the answers are either 1-value radio button or multiple-value checkbox

9138149
fseek	ftell
the fseek and ftell functions are both defined by the iso c language standard

9138149
fseek	ftell
so if the file was opened in binary mode ftell gives you the number of characters from the beginning of the file -- but an fseek relative to the end of the file seek_end is not necessarily meaningful

9138149
fseek	ftell
in practice on unix-like systems text and binary modes behave the same way and the fseek ftell method will work

9138149
getchar	ftell
i suspect it will work on windows my guess is that ftell will give the byte offset which may not be the same as the number of times you could call getchar in text mode

9138149
fseek	ftell
since the fseek ftell method is system-specific anyway such as stat on unix-like systems

9138149
fseek	ftell
on the other hand fseek and ftell are likely to work as you expect on most systems you re likely to encounter

9138149
fseek	ftell
if working on linux and windows is good enough and you re not concerned with large files then the fseek ftell method is probably ok

9138173
hide	show
if you want easing then just create a div style the arrow with css hide the div and show it with jquery

9138207
haskell	ocaml
they are both in the same ball-park as pascal ocaml haskell and lisp which makes them about half as fast as c and c++

9138236
fadein	fadeout
i am using fadein fadeout to give a slight delay so when the mouse moves from the menu to the submenu the submenu stays visible .

9138253
httpconnection	downloading
can i use same httpconnection for full downloading

9138257
width	height
i have tried a few different things pulled from the net like replacing the right bottom of the ortho call with width height aspect ratio but nothing seemed to correct the problem

9138281
goto	break
then have the loop break if and goto a label before the loop where you have an algorithm that generates a new number maybe somthing as simple as adding one or what ever you want

9138281
multiplying	add
also don t forget that if and the number hasn t failed yet but isn t at the end yet that you need to multiplying the value by 10 then add the next number in the array to be able to test the next place

9138284
folder	directory
the aim is it to create a directory struction based on the work id but its not creating the folder or uploading the file but it is returning that it has succeeded but also failed ive spent the past few day trying to fix it but to no avail can anyone see what is wrong with it or point me in the right direction

9138309
pull	push
how would i set up my server to pull data from a mysql database and then push it to the browser

9138320
client-side	server-side
php runs server-side not client-side

9138327
comparator	comparable
i am trying to overwrite the default comparator method in java by writing my own and using implements comparable however it seems that java is still using the default method

9138348
comparator	comparable
you are implementing it wrong as comparable the raw form of does not declare a method comparator string it declares a method comparator object

9138348
comparator	comparable
most likely you want to implement instead of comparable and accept a word to comparator

9138421
integer	unsigned
in c89 which the misra rules specify the type of an integer constant suffixed with a u is the first of the list unsigned int unsigned long int in which its value can be represented

9138421
integer	unsigned
the definition of the bitwise shift operator specifies that the integer promotions are performed on each operand this does not change an unsigned int and that the type of the result is the type of the promoted left operand

9138421
int	chars
the only explicit conversion here is the cast of this unsigned int value to unsigned int so this must be what the compiler is warning about - although there is no unsigned chars in sight which means that the checker appears to be buggy

9138427
nodejitsu	heroku
heroku does not sure about nodejitsu or nodester.

9138480
for-loop	loops
to read the file in you ll want to use the open function along with a loops a for-loop would make good sense to read each line

9138555
post	put	post	get	put	get
test rest uris get post put delete - i must be able to assert data returned against data sent

9138564

the other answers on this question helped me but ultimately the jquery forum thread this + option selected attr rel option selected is not working in ie helped the most

9138625
explode	implode
i can do this fine in js with the eval function but in php my efforts have resulted in a complicated series of explode and implode functions

9138709
inherited	properties
prototypal inherited is limited to properties of objects

9138728
post	get
i have a wcf rest service when i used get method it works fine when i pass the data along with the url but i need to use post method and when there is no data to pass in post method it works fine

9138755
put	get
so what is being said in this passage is in my mind good advice always double-check that when you go to do something you re going to get more out of it than what you put in

9138758
getter	setter
sometimes it s worth the extra effort to create protected getter and setter methods and make all data private

9138758
superclass	subclassing
in other words it s not a discussion about classes in general - only about how should a superclass best make things visible to it s subclassing

9138796
portrait	landscape
my game is in portrait mode but i want the ad to be in landscape mode

9138898
ssl	https
based on what i read that i need to have an ssl setup and installed on my web server so that i can use the https secure connection on the page where a login is going to be used

9138900
google-chrome	firefox
the pdf must be opened in the browser browser control or ie firefox google-chrome etc and edited in place

9138965
width	height
i think you ve tangled map height and map width it s indexed by y x and you access it by x y

9138971
put	get
trying to get each button_select_sub li s text and put it in an array

9139086
gridview	sqldatasource
btw i ve created some gridview and sqldatasource to show all users and it works

9139093

if your site has an ssl certificate setup properly forcing users to an https url should be fine

9139101
filtering	grouping	sorting	grouping	sorting	filtering
a grid ext grid supports paging sorting filtering grouping summaries editing out of the box

9139144
innodb	myisam
foreign key constraints can t be applied to myisam engine.both table should use innodb engine for supporting foreign key constraints

9139170
ssl	https
here is a tutorial on wamp2 https and ssl setup if you just need a development environment

9139205
post	get
as far as updating the view after a post i don t know if i get exactly what the problem is but here is the third part of a good tutorial

9139224
gridview	sqldatasource
when you published it the sqldatasource gridview worked because it was pulling the connection named connectionstring that pointed to the correct server

9139225
post	get
post this to server and parse it so you know which image object should get the loaded attribute

9139266
pull	push
i am trying to pull text from various parts of a webpage and push them to an array one index per webpage. the following code loops forever and i can t figure out why

9139299
shadowing	named
furthermore these mutable values and the class s parameters should have different named to avoid shadowing and confusion

9139314
ubuntu	linux
i m trying to run a cleanup.php script on a magento site hosted on ubuntu linux 10.04.1 the script command is

9139323
width	height
i was thinking you could use one of the max- css properties but they only support width and height

9139333
int	chars
a second problem is that getchar returns int not chars

9139344
feof	getchar	fgets	feof	fgets	getchar
notice that feof 3 is valid only after a read operation getchar fgets etc... so coding while feof stdin is generally wrong contrarily to what i wrote in the previous version of this answer

9139344
int	chars
you ll better test that getchar is returning eof so your mychar should be an int not a chars

9139380
width	height
you ve obtained the new screen width and height from the resize event

9139391
ssms	ssdt
this two software are two different things one is a database server sql server 2008 r2 the other ssdt is a set of tools that expands functionality of visual studio to allow the developer to use a lot of feature that are in ssms directly inside visual studio

9139400
children	parent
when creating dropdown menus it s always more advisable to put the children ul elements as direct children of the parent li item for example

9139400
children	parent
in that light check out this jsfiddle which i built on your original code where the children line up with the parent exactly simply by assigning them a width of 100 effectively hitting the edges set out by the parent

9139420
filtering	grouping
so here we first filtering out all the irrelevant skills with the where clause and then grouping by user

9139504
post	put
for example if i have a 20gb vhd i would like to break it up into chunks of say 5gb each without splitting and saving the individual chunks first and put post these to blob storage like s3 rackspace azure etc

9139522
for-loop	arrays
i want to create arrays dynamically within the for-loop

9139575
width	height
actually i am using this modified version of the library which enables you to query the width and height of the svg as specified in the svg document

9139610
getter	setter
therefore themeselector is just a property of that type which has setter and getter

9139634
uitableview	uisearchbar
as hinted at in the self-answering comment if you want to get table search behavior like the built-in contacts app you can t just slap a uisearchbar into a view with a uitableview instead you need to use a uitableviewcontroller together with a search display controller

9139638
inherited	subclassing
in my eventclass i have a concrete method compareto event in which i expect it inherited by all subclassing

9139638
inherited	subclassing
to make it compile i have to add a int priority in eventclass and i was thinking i can shallow it in subclassing and it will works just fine with the compareto inherited

9139689
g++	gcc
i compiled the code on my system using gcc then g++

9139702
superclass	subclassing
the additional declaration of int priority in the subclassing shadows int priority from the superclass

9139710
octal	decimal
here you are giving octal numbers as input and expecting the output in decimal and thats the reason you say output is wrong which is correct

9139724
crossover	mutation
the mutation and crossover operators will help ga to jump the discontinuity in the search space and lead to better exploration

9139762
width	height
i d like to add a vertically-tiled png image underneath just a stripe of 1px height which would display a fixed width 800px of white and the rest should be some other color like red in the example below or gradient and should grow

9139784
pascal	delphi
the wmi delphi code creator tool allows you to generate object pascal

9139813
int	chars
since you want the digits in base-10 i think this would be easiest to read if you convert the intermediate fibonacci int to strings then step through each chars in the string as a chars array

9139813
int	chars
as you step through it you can convert each digit back to an int by subtracting the chars 0 from it

9139823
innodb	myisam
currently the storage type of table is innodb i want to add full text search on the table which is only possible on myisam engine

9139891
bash	zsh
using only bash and zsh

9139891
bash	zsh
bash and zsh interprets as a new line

9139902

you are not accessing protected function in your derived class you are trying to overload it and promote from protected to public

9139940

on the server i have a very simple wrapper for the context which only contains one public properties the inherited is practically a requirement of indy

9139982
dictionary	map
when a country has a new shop in it you ll need to compare the position of that shop against the country image position on the map probable easiest to just keep an internal dictionary of shops against country rather than trying to calculate this from their gps position on the fly and draw the appropriate green image inside the scrollview in from of the map

it was a bit strange but it seems to act differently if you select the pom.xml and click to maven - add dependance

9142283
m2e	pom.xml	maven	m2e	maven	pom.xml
if you add then directly to the pom.xml as i was doing before there is an additional step that seems a bit strange and that is to select the project again i am using m2e not the pom.xml and then click maven - update dependencies .

9142299
nsmutablestring	nsstring
interestingly you have used a nsmutablestring i did it with a nsstring and used the class method stringwithformat

9142610
maven-ear-plugin	pom.xml	m2e	maven-ear-plugin	m2e	pom.xml
if you have a plugin execution defined in your pom.xml like the execution of maven-ear-plugin generate-application-xml you also need to add additional config information for m2e that tells m2e what to do when the build is run in eclipse should the plugin execution be ignored or executed by m2e should it be also done for incremental builds .

9142724
google-chrome	firefox
this has worked for me in firefox but not google-chrome where the item is not saved

9142770
addition	multiplication
for instance num includes numeric operations like addition and multiplication while ord includes less than greater than and so on

9142808
put	get
but then you re trying to get something out of the resulting intent in your onactivityresult method that you never put in

9142810
min	max	range	min	range	max
after that it joins back to the original table again for same date range criteria but also adds the qualifier that either the low or the high matches the min or max from the prequery

9142810
min	max
this will include all those entries that qualify the min max criteria

9142839

int	chars
to compare particular chars s in your string you can use chars charat int method also from string type

9143119
int	chars
you have to remember that chars charat int is zero-based so 0 is first 1 is second and so on

9143119
int	chars
and in this example you can see that i compared two chars just like i would compare int egers - with simple

9143141

9143225
salt	md5
if you re running your passwords through md5 you ll get a bit more security from adding a cryptographic salt

9143228
ready	each
you can t just blindly write a string of characters to a uart - you need to check status on each character - it works in the single character example because the uart is always going to be ready for the first character but for the second and subsequent characters you need to poll or better yet use an isr but let s walk before we run

9143229
versioning	upgrade
all the code that every one wrote against the first versioning of the interface would no longer compile forcing an upgrade

9143236
post	put
this will return some json about the gem and there are put post methods for the api

9143337

9143397
int	chars
use charsequence.html#charat int to get the chars at a specified position

9143418
width	height
what i m making is a 2d tile map in canvas and for objects in the map that are greater than one tile in size they have their width and height set to negative numbers to tell me how many tiles offset in x y they are to get to the tile with the relevant data

9143445
int	chars
if you want the int value -1 as a chars then you can do that by saying unchecked chars -1 but you should be aware that this is a very bad idea

9143453
width	height
the issue is that the elements while they do exist in the dom when the javascript is initially run haven t actually been rendered in the browser and thus do not have an actual width or height yet

9143464
width	height
make sure the parent width and height are larger or the same as the msg control s width and height

9143497
for-loop	loops
the other advice i have is that a for-each loops is faster than a for-loop

9143500
fiddler	charles
i would seriously recommend using something like charles or fiddler to track the requests being made

9143598

portrait	landscape
if you don t really need landscape support for your application you can also block the activity to portrait mode and you don t have to manage the orientation changes

9143653
width	height
in order to position the child views correctly depending on orientation i need to take the width and height of the framelayout in account

9143653
width	height
in order to get a callback to the fragment when the width height has been calculated i override onsizechanged in framelayout which calls the fragment

9143658
portrait	landscape
if your application doesn t have a different layout for landscape and portrait then this is a good route to take

9143687
onkeyup	onkeydown	keydown	onkeyup	keydown	keyup	keyup	onkeydown
in the body tag i have onkeydown keydown event onkeyup keyup event

9143687
keydown	keyup
and instead of returning the milliseconds between the keydown and keyup and gives me a number between about 20 and 200

9143687
keydown	keyup
i can t really give you the whole code because it includes a lot of other code that is not part of it the keyup and keydown

9143841
mouseup	mousedown
so clearly i need to simulate a doubleclick by using mousedown or mouseup and a combination of timers a stopwatch etc

9143874
for-loop	loops
i personally think the while loops looks less clean than the nested for-loop

9143879
folder	directory
place that code in a seperate file called fib.py in a known directory -- say your personal bin folder

9143904

9144686
free	alloca
i was revising c and came across to alloca free functions which is described as allocating storage on a stack like space

9144709
free	malloc
and yes this is different from malloc and free which allocate on the heap

9144709
free	alloca
don t attempt to free memory allocated with alloca because it is automatically free when the function that calls alloca returns to its caller

9144712
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	calloc	malloc

9144827
lodash	underscore.js
as suggested by barry p jsfiddle underscore.js or lodash also have a debounce each with slightly different apis

9144840
versioning	upgrade
my guess would be that the .net framework installed on the server got upgrade and the private constructor is no longer present under the new versioning

9144862
punctuation	words
you might want to write another query or procedure or add some nested replace statements to further remove punctuation from the resulting temp table of words but this should be a good start

9144892
google-chrome	firefox
under firefox it does not fire no matter what just under my google-chrome it behaves like this

9144937
width	height
38 mm width x 21.2 mm height each cell

9144946
children	parent
most controls specifically the common controls which includes sliders will send a wm_notify to their parent when certain events happen allowing the parent to handle these events for a collection of children

9145019
for-loop	arrays
with an arrays it would be just a for-loop something like

9145021
for-loop	loops
finally the for-loop assign to loops variable even if it is not used

9145025
firefox	safari
the code below works perfectly on desktop safari and firefox but not mobile safari

9145039
width	height
kheight and kwidth are the height and width of the screen and they are never 0 or nil

9145045
groovy	gpath
the gpath mechanism in groovy lets you do things like

9145045
groovy	gpath
but other classes in groovy also have some gpath magic and there is where things get more interesting

9145056
super	implements
i m currently trying out different ways to implements the concept of a super but the fact that i can t get this to work with the existing code is stuck in my head

9145058
versioning	upgrade
first i would encourage you to upgrade to the latest versioning as it has a lot of bugfixes

9145075
versioning	upgrade
you must either upgrade ioncube loader to versioning 4.0.9 or newer or disable it by commenting or removing this line in your php.ini file

9145078
setinterval	settimeout
instead of settimeout i used setinterval

9145092
post	put	post	get	put	get
note this will put all of your micropost records in the html element and it will tick but the content is static meaning you re not going to get new post in there unless the page is refreshed

9145094
children	parent
edit i modified the original post to handle cases of multiple children in the same parent

9145097
min	max	range	min	range	max
the basic idea is assigning a color range yellow- black to a depth range min distance from sensor- max distance from sensor

9145179
subtraction	addition
this addition or subtraction to the value does not occur because the progress has changed but instead based on how long it is held at that point of progress

9145186
ssl	https
as it is now i am told heroku converts ssl to non-ssl calls and sets the http_x_forwarded_proto to https so i think i need to deal with this in restlet but i m not sure how

9145198
udp	tcp
both zeromq and 29west lbm use a brokerless approach to messaging and support the same transports tcp udp ib so latency should be broadly similar

9145222
children	parent
this does yet handle a case of multiple children in the same parent but i am unsure if it does so the way you want

9145251
int	double
the one that takes a double as the argument returns a long not an int

9145260
int	double
static long round double a static int round float a

9145272
int	double
because math.sqrt returns a double the version of math.round gets called which returns a long but you want to put it into an int thus the ide suggestion

9145284

9145353
crossover	mutation
the ga on the other hand has the population size mutation rate the crossover mutation operator and selection operator

9145353
crossover	mutation
that may seem much at first but often you choose between two or three crossover operators and maybe two or three mutation operators and mutation rate usually doesn t have such a big effect on the performance as long as it s 0

9145426
width	height
you basically look at the browser s width height to determine which css properties to apply to the page

9145539
pop-up	dialog
to check the style click on new address next to the last textarea box and the jqueryui modal dialog box should pop-up

9145541

the game company just buys the processors and uses it - they don t pump 200 000 000 into designing their own cpu and trying to compete with the likes of motorola intel freescale etc

9145567
google-chrome	firefox
hi i had a problem several times while dealing with floats in ie here is an example of what i mean note that this example works in firefox and google-chrome

9145574
google-chrome	firefox
i disagree with robertc s statement but back to your actual question i found firefox and google-chrome display identically if you set a width in pixels but not if you set a width as a percentage.

9145574
google-chrome	firefox
i m just really hoping things progress to the way firefox handles flexbox while google-chrome is close i just don t agree with how some things are handled and the lack of animation between flex values just plain sucks

9145577
superclass	subclassing
eliminating the need to set properties of the superclass in the subclassing as intended by the superclass es implementation

9145590
youtube	vimeo
youtube vimeo and facebook videos are embedded as if posting manually

preferably i d like to be able to set the relativesource the converter and the mode once in the tabcontrol the path once in each tabitem and only have the converterparameter set per radiobutton

9145649
width	height
it would be a class with variables such as x y width height text clickhandler enabled and so on

9145649
width	height
now you re free to make as many button instances as you want each one has it s own state enabled or disabled text width height all of those

9145715
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
seems to work in google-chrome firefox and safari can t test in ie atm

9145768
try-catch	exception-handling
edit all exception-handling will be handled with try-catch if necessary

fadein	fadeout
i tried looking at jquery source but could not figure out what they were doing exactly for fadein and fadeout

9145820
ubuntu	mint
b on ubuntu mint it s all i tested so far i execute with subprocess.check_output xdg-open file_name but this is not always blocking ex when you open one text file by default with gedit if gedit is already open the function returns immediately

9145832
ubuntu	centos
i am assuming that centos uses sudo like ubuntu does

9145850
put	get
there are also the non-blocking i o functions which include an implicit yieldâ the current â œtaskâ is put on hold until the i o completes but the other tasks get their chance to run

this also happens with dolphin but does not happen with firefox mobile or opera mobile

9145896
inherited	subclassing
and i have two subclassing that inherited from this model called mysub1 and mysub2

9145916
oncreate	onnewintent
the flag flag_activity_single_top will start the activity if its not started or if it is running it will be caught in onnewintent so you will need to put some code in both the oncreate and onnewintent to extract the bundle and check for the action

9145920

now i really need to post data and get all of the products under that product category

9145938

cocos2d-x	corona
i seemed to find small hints that corona uses 32bit pixel format for everything so we cannot use different pixel formats as we do with cocos2d-x

9146035
hlsl	glsl
hlsl is specific to directx and glsl is specific to opengl

9146035
hlsl	glsl
there s no way to compile a glsl shader in directx or a hlsl shader in opengl

9146035
hlsl	glsl
cg is an intermediate language created mainly by nvidia that can be compiled as both glsl and hlsl

9146035
hlsl	glsl
from what i have seen cg isn t quite as popular as glsl or hlsl but i haven t looked into it much

youtube	vimeo
a user chooses a video url and has a choice of using vimeo or youtube and upon saving i would like to validate that the url code of the video youtube or vimeo is correct

9146231
youtube	vimeo
when i have the youtube code i cannot save a vimeo video and vice versa

9146269
stdout	stderr
presumably java like c and c-derivatives does not buffer system.err stderr etc. unlike system.out stdout etc

9146283
opennlp	stanford-nlp
you can use one provided by nlp tool like opennlp or stanford-nlp

9146314
crossover	mutation
isnt it something like o p g o fitness pc o crossover + pm o mutation

9146314
crossover	mutation
if p g pc and pm are constant that really simplifies to o o fitness o mutation + o crossover

9146379
crossover	mutation
if the number of generations and population size is constant as long as your mutation function crossover function and fitness function takes a known amount of time the big o is o 1 - it takes a constant amount of time

9146384
width	height
override the imageview and in onlayout you can get proper width or height after calling super.onlayout

9146393
for-loop	loops
i could of course adapt this method and replace my triple for loops with one for-loop that repeats the repmat method o number of times but i feel like there should be a way to do this without loops

9146407
smartsvn	tortoisesvn	rapidsvn	smartsvn	rapidsvn	tortoisesvn
if you ll create external svn-repository accessible from workplace and home it can be own server or hosted googlecode sourceforge unfuddle assembla github solution reconfigure versions to use new repo and install svn-client on windows tortoisesvn is nice maybe - smartsvn from syntevo crossplatform rapidsvn you ll be able to use and modify your code from virtually any location

9146439
uicontrol	uibutton
since uibutton inherits from uicontrol you can use the method

9146468
gridview	entitydatasource
i have a gridview that is populated from an entitydatasource in asp.net

9146475
children	parent
since ul#menu li targets any all s that are children of the ul#menu parent you would only need the one selector.

9146491
google-chrome	firefox
i have tested this on google-chrome firefox iphone and it works fine

9146512
serializable	deserialization
as to type it is assumed that handlers are constructed for specific types and no extra type information is passed during serializable or deserialization process expected type if handlers are used for different types must be passed during construction

free	malloc	int	chars
if i read in data elements as chars i don t get any malloc errors but if i read in as any other data types say short or int the program successfully reads in the bytes but when i free the pointer i get this may be due to a corruption of the heap

9146629
ostringstream	std
you need to to use std ostringstream

9146629
int	double
this perhaps incorrectly assumes that getx and gety return some kind of numeric type int float double ...

9146675
children	parent
however these pages now contain sub-pages children and i would like to parent pages retain their selected css attribute when accessing one of their children pages

9146675
children	parent
i also created the web.sitemap file to organize all the parent and their children pages

9146709
put	get	versioning	upgrade
if you wanted to you could let the cookie expire every few months so it would get retested every once in a while or you could put the exact browser versioning into the cookie too and reruns the tests and set a new cookie if the browser versioning every changed software upgrade

9146743
inherited	properties
i was going to create a style for mappolygon but i can t seem to add a setter for anything other than the properties inherited from control which doesn t help very much since the mappolygon doesn t actually use many of those properties

9146758
width	height
you can explicitly define your layout width and height in layout xmls to be 800 480 for all the un-supported resolutions like 1024x600

9146758
width	height
i don t recommend fix your width and height to a specific value but since it s client request i guess you have to take it

9146773
ienumerable	iqueryable
firstordefault returns a single item and not an iqueryable or ienumerable - any is only defined on those

9146786

9146863
button	checkbox
i need it such that if user check on the checkbox item respective button images will be shown.

9146876
children	parent
if you really need the children to have different code than the parent for some reason you are better off separating that code out of the main code as its own script and then using exec after the fork to run the child script

9146933
firefox	safari
if i load this page on any browser safari firefox ie on my win 7 pc

9146943

9146979
emma	jacoco
you can use a free code coverage tool like emma or jacoco which have their own eclipse plugin

9147037

9147128
button	checkbox
below the 3 convert from radio button are 3 convert to checkbox

9147128
hex	binary
the following code is meant to convert from binary to decimal if the dec_bttn checkbox is checked and to hex if the hex_bttn checkbox is selected

9147130
inherited	subclassing
types cannot be converted except up their inherited or interface hierarchy and variables can only be assigned subclassing or implementing objects

9147130
int	chars
certain types can be converted when convenient chars and int and variables can only contain the type they are declared as

9147165
svg	vml
i have a map implemented via raphael js which wraps vml and svg to support cross web browsers drawing

9147178
post	get
i am curious as to how you got more than 1 loop to run by definition it should work like you re experience but for some reason when i post the same concept i can only get the while to produce one result even though there are 10 images

9147187
children	parent
the need is to normalize the scores of the children of a parent on a scale of 0-1 edit sum of the scores of the children must sum to 1

9147250
getter	setter
those getter and setter are never called by the binding system hence you should never place additional code there

9147276
integer	fractions

trying other perfectscript commands such as wpactivate and revealcodes 1 gave similar errors except that the revealcodes 1 command somehow managed to turn that feature on the next time i opened wordperfect from the gui manually

9147384
fgetc	fread
fread gives you as much control as fgetc and has the advantage of being able to read more than one character in a single i o operation

9147389

these same pages can be reached using the following code via the console in google-chrome and firefox

9147629

everything seems to be working in firefox but in google-chrome and my mobile bb browser fwiw it seems as if no flashdata is persisting between pages

9147725
superclass	subclassing
as a good general rule the superclass should never know about the subclassing

9147725
superclass	subclassing
consider redesigning your class hierarchy or use an abstraction such as the subclassing implementing an interface and the superclass expecting in instance of that interface

9147729
superclass	subclassing
the fact that the subclassing constructor has parameters of the superclass type is basically irrelevant as far as java is concerned - it s just a coincidence

9147752
gif	png	gif	bmp	tiff	bmp	tiff	png	bmp	png
the system.drawing.bitmap class supports bmp gif exif jpg png and tiff

9147756

what you d normally do is put your starting thing first and then go through the mapping to get to the ones you want

9147793
linefeed	delimiter
i use find s -print0 and read s -d to use null bytes as the file delimiter so it won t even be confused by linefeed in filenames

9147813
metaclass	subclassing
however grails uses grailsdatabinder - which is subclassing of databinder you might be able to do some meta programming and metaclass stuff so that your custom property editor gets registered and found when bind is called

9147862
post	get
i have a lot of old blog post and such that were linked to but i don t have them on the blog and if anyone happens to click through from another site that they get kicked to the homepage

sortedlist	sorteddictionary
a sortedlist and a sorteddictionary do not have any built in capacity limits - none of the framework data structures do except an array which has a fixed size

9147977
width	height
the output from the exception states exception in thread awt-eventqueue-0 java.lang.illegalargumentexception width 0 and height 0 must be 0

9147998
width	height
but until it actually is added to the container it won t have a width or height and even after it is it might not have the width and height that you asked for

9147998
width	height
one option is to just use 600 directly for the width and height of your new buffered image and when you add the panel to the jframe make sure you call pack on the jframe to allow the window to size to the preferred size of your panel

9148014
width	height
to 0 or to height or width

9148096
ubuntu	debian
i m sure questions to the haskell mailing list would result in quick help for a platform as mainstream as debian ubuntu but you might need to manually install a newer version of hp that what s available through the os package manager

9148100
wadl	wsdl
there are a few initiatives like wadl web application description language - but those are far from widely accepted and thus not really a valid alternative to wsdl

9148145
width	height
the reason this won t work is that pack is not called to set all the width and height values until after the panel has been initiated which is why height and width are not set yet

9148145
width	height
and bufferedimage will throw an exception if the width or height are non-positive integers

9148151
subtract	add
i am making an iphone app which uses uibutton s with placeholder text on them to add and subtract pre-defined constant values

the problem is that on python-3.2 there s an attempt at shutdown to fflush stdout without checking if it was closed

9148416
post	get
in many programs the server doesn t care whether the request uses get or post that s why one method simply delegates to another

9148421

9162197
hide	show
i hide and show table rows by adding removing a class name called hide

9162197
hide	show
this approach has the advantage of being able to hide show any element without knowing or caring what its normal display style is

9162197
addclass	removeclass	hide	removeclass	hide	show
so to hide an element addclass document.getelementbyid asset hide and removeclass to show it

9162197
addclass	removeclass
it does essentially the same thing however these addclass removeclass methods are a little more robust than modifying element.classname manually

9162210
rss	feed
then you simply call any url you want to use that is causing utf8 issues i found a problem with an rss feed hence my need for it with the url of the problem file in a url get variable like so

so if i gave it a 1200x990 width x height image it spits out a

9162432
apache	nginx
note this works for nginx not apache

9162440
width	height
the first is your logo which is set to be aligned in the bottom right corner with width height scaled to it s actual size

9162440
width	height
the second is your background image which can be aligned however because you will set it s width height to fill_parent

9162445
post	put	post	get	put	get
when the user clicks the button then the form will do perform a an http post or get depending on the method attribute you put on the form element

9162445
post	get
you may wish to read more about html form elements and how a form works difference between a post and a get request request variables and the different types of input elements

9162445
post	get
in the php script that the form post to you may need to track which button the user clicked to get there if there is more than one and which message needs to be deleted

9162468
width	height
it s working correctly - it s resizing to a height of 300 and keeping the aspect ratio which in this case makes the width 400

9162489
next	except
this works for every time of the day except between 00 00 and 04 00 because than it will give the time of the next 4 am

9162612

9162695
nsstring	nsdata
- nsstring createencodedstring nsdata data

9162699
hide	show
so you could do something like this assuming you are wanting to use a checkbox to hide show

9162748
folder	directory
one bad ideas is to set documentroot in a local vhosts file to the mysubdomain folder â but that exposes the directory structure in things like

9162750
jboss	glassfish
if you re already targeting a servlet 3.0 compatible container tomcat 7 glassfish 3 jboss 6 etc with a servlet 3.0 compatible web.xml in your webapp then you can make use of the new el 2.2 feature of invoking methods with arguments

9162750
jboss	glassfish
if you re however targeting an older servlet 2.5 compatible container tomcat 6 glassfish 2 jboss 4 5 etc then your best bet is to install jboss el to achieve the same

getter	setter
i have the following model ignoring irrelevant obvious code like setter and getter

mouseout	mouseenter
you only have mouseenter not mouseout

9162780
tclientdataset	bde
tclientdataset local files unfortunately are not a replacement for the bde as a local database engine

9162780
tclientdataset	bde
if you re using tclientdataset only you re not using dbexpress at all and tclientdataset can work with any dataset implementing the required interfaces including bde ones

9162780
postgresql	mysql
you should look at alternatives like sqlite firebird there is an embedded version if you need only local access or postgresql if you re looking for small and free engines mysql is free only if your application is gpl or there are several other engines available from stripped down versions of commercial ones sql server express and oracle express or relatively cheap ones

9162813
versioning	upgrade
we are a team that needs to upgrade an application to a new versioning and we have to know the code that has already been reused or considered as useless

awt	swing
i ve wanted to do something i know from awt swing development add command to event queue so that it will be executed after processed ui events it means also after finishing preference change operation

9162876
xslt	xquery
thus whether it is xpath 1.0 or 2.0 does not even matter if you want to create a list of new nodes containing the letters you can t do that with xpath alone you need a host language like xslt or xquery to create new nodes

9162886
abperson	abrecord
my context is an app where i would not select the contact from the peopleviewer but by having a abrecord uid previously stored in a database for example 6b2b9b69-cfc4-46f2-aeb1-43a99382d305 abperson

9162917
opera	google-chrome
the component allows that any html can be placed in the title bar but it has issues moving the mouse around in opera flickers the dropdown a lot and in other browsers google-chrome ie9 the dropdown cannot be opened

9162917
onmousedown	onmouseup	onclick	onmouseup	onclick	onmousedown	onmouseover	onmouseup	onmouseover	onmousedown	onmouseover	onclick
more specifically i ve disabled the following events onclick onmousedown onmouseup onmouseover onmouseout onmouseenter onmouseleave

9162917
opera	google-chrome
this makes it better in google-chrome ie9 but opera still flickers a lot so i suppose that something is still wrong

9162933
google-chrome	firefox
while this works fine on google-chrome but the tb_window collapses in firefox

9162948
wxpython	listctrl
when it comes to something like this i think the usual method i ve seen advertised is to use a virtual listctrl see the wxpython demo

9162985
min	max
it could be min max limit 1 or some other criterion

9163037
getter	setter
second is used together with synthesize in .m module and setter getter s are created for you by the compiler

9163037
getter	setter
you can still define your own getter or setter with this

i want get complete content of a news or post of a website via feed

9163040
ssl	https
poco c++ - net ssl - how to post https request

9163056
apache	nginx
i m not sure who is recommending to you that you use both nginx and apache but that s a horrible idea

9163056
apache	nginx
apache can be just as good but requires building from source and knowing exactly what configuration to use to match nginx

9163124
rss	feed
it retrieves rss feed

9163130
inherited	properties
for the vm layer i like the containment pattern more than inherited and at this layer i also implement inotifypropertychanged which is also a properties of the vm and not the data model

9163146
subtract	add
update values for all nodes following the deleted node add the number of incoming nodes and subtract the number of outgoing nodes for this node

9163161
clang	llvm
and then compiled it to llvm ir by typing clang -s -emit-llvm main.c -o main.ll

9163161
clang	llvm
is this maybe because i m using incompatible versions of clang and llvm

9163172
try-catch	exception-handling
repository level must have try-catch construction that handle sql exception-handling and write errors to log

9163172
try-catch	exception-handling
if you want to notify user about something gonna wrong if business logic provide exception-handling - you should use try-catch constructions in your controller actions and use modelstate.addmodelerror as one of ways to notify user or use other way to pass info about error into view

9163227
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
working in ie 7-9 google-chrome opera firefox

9163237

the recommended solution is to use the sprite map in an inline image and have that element s height and width set in your css

9163241
udp	tcp
1 enumerate all current sockets open in the system including the process that created it and for both tcp and udp what ports and addresses they are current bound to

9163248
hide	show
whenever you hide .star you need to show .unstar and whenever you hide .unstar you need to show .star

9163249
unsigned	short
this is also a bit iffy since it assumes the resulting address can validly be cast into a pointer to unsigned short

9163263
accessor	properties
1 properties is a special way to define getter- and setter-methods or as we call them accessor in objective-c

9163263
accessor	properties
using properties will declare your accessor for you and is equivalent to declaring setmyarray and myarray yourself

9163263
accessor	properties
remember that properties declares the accessor for your properties synthesize will implement them

9163278
width	height
it seems like they ignore their layouts and fill the entire screen instead of the layout width and height from their xml layouts

9163278
width	height
a similar issue occurs on my ics-based galaxy nexus which completely ignore the match_parent tag for height and width

9163304
uninstall	upgrade
i would day that rolling your own self-update will never reach the sophistication of either of these technologies clickonce rpms appstore and offer the user the expected behavior vis-a-vis discovery upgrade and uninstall

9163326
width	height
i have a control docked to a window which i need the height and width of

9163326
width	height
obviously as the window changes size these values change but when i am requesting them using the height and width variables they are giving me the original height how can i get the new height

9163337
mdpi	hdpi
use drawables with different sizes for hdpi and mdpi and then give your ratingbar a specific height in dp

9163397
gwtupload	gwt-rpc
actually there are two ways of uploading file with gwtupload as you mentioned and via gwt-rpc this one is a bit difficult due to browser security

9163400
outputstream	inputstream
the ivy fileutil copy inputstream outputstream copyprogresslistener boolean ultimately transfers the artifact bytes to a local file and in turn notifies the antmessagelogger of download progress

9163426
disk	ram
so even ignoring practical considerations like disk is slower than ram it will be slower

9163439
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to the latest versioning of 1394kdbg.sys

9163460
sudo	passwd
the slow response from sudo when you enter an erroneous passwd is so that if you are mounting a crude brute force try and guess the passwd attack with sudo you are slowed down every time you guess wrong so that the attack takes longer

9163461
post	get
so even if you modify the value in the model if you have a different value in the modelstate which often happens in post actions it will be the value from the modelstate that will get used

9163470
min	max
is there a way in ios for me to get the max and min values of an nsmutablearray of double numbers

9163484

post	get
to get the post data source execute

9163566
post	get
to get the post data source execute har.request.postdata.text

9163567
iprincipal	iidentity
for example the user property of httpcontext is an iprincipal which contains an identity property of type iidentity

9163661
parallels	bootcamp
this current installation is far more stable and i can still wrap parallels around the bootcamp partition - i guess parallels is just not quite 100 perfect for installing windows

9163669
children	parent
the children of said parent group then display as single line

9163669
children	parent
i have 7 parent groups and 39 children on one page

9163687
min	max
if you wanted to simply get the min and max doubles

9163740
put	get
of course modify this code to put tagid in between to get the jquery selector

9163779
hide	show
basically i know i could hide show different code with media queries but i m trying to avoid serving extra code if at all possible

9163781
pubnub	pusher
there is also pubnub instead of pusher pubnub has help documentation

9163802
vim	emacs
for example you could just say emacs foo.c or vim foo.c even if foo.c doesn t exist yet

9163802
vim	emacs
this is assuming you have the emacs or vim packages installed in cygwin of course

9163846
folder	directory
i have the folder containing the csv files as a sub directory in the directory that contains the source code

9163879
width	height

add some event listeners to the width height boxes and do some maths on them when a new value has been entered into either

9163879
width	height
on the basket page the product will show with width height and size from the hidden configurable

9163891
int	chars
scintilla has a function sci_setcontrolcharsymbol int symbol where you can set the chars that will be used for the control chars

9163891
spaces	linefeed
these mnemonics come from the early days of signaling though some are still used linefeed linefeed bs back spaces cr carriage return for example

9163940
getter	setter	inherited	properties
it uses getter and setter to map a s properties on itself of course one could also do it via inherited

9163967
jqgrid	datatables
i think jqgrid datatables and slickgrid are the popular jquery based grid controls for client-side data binding

9164009
serializable	deserialization
you should always put the code itself into its own file pair to manage the user defaults and this module should be responsible for serializable and deserialization though objects that are serializable should own that virtuosity themselves

9164030
accessor	ivar
notice that the contentview ivar is defined to be an id and that all of the types in the accessor methods are implicitly defined as id too so -setcontentview returns an object probably the window instance self

9164030
nswindow	appkit
nswindow was introduced in the first version of appkit - the gui framework in what became cocoa back in 1994

9164030
nswindow	appkit
indeed it may even be the case that appkit s nswindow contains code from application kit s window and that this contentview ivar was not updated in the change

9164041

if i start in portrait view 1 view and am viewing the details fragment switching to landscape replaces the list view holder

9164050
hex	binary
i don t even see any numeric significance in its binary or hex representation

9164181

9164216
h.264	webm
if you offer both h.264 and webm all modern browsers should be able to play it out of the box

9164232
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
if i simply export the arrays list contents using the for-loop without the while loops everything works fine but when i want to use the while loops so that i can provide options the output text file doesn t contain anything as if the program simply didn t do anything but create an empty text file

9164264
put	get
i ve put some console.writelines in the main string args function within the harness file but these never get written

9164308

9164348
jobs	cron
ps i have seen a similar problem of multiple spurious instances a while back in context of cron jobs that were designed to to hang around indefinitely upon their initial first launch

9164392
background-repeat	background-image	background-repeat	background-position	background-image	background-color	background-image	background-position

9164424
width	height
i can see that width height after line 3 but once the page is rendered to browser i get portrait again

9164439
folder	directory
is it as simple as creating a folder in the plugins directory dropping in the jar file and restarting eclipse then modifying the target runtime

9164441
background-image	background-color
you re having that problem because css gradients are defined as background-image not background-color

9164462
execl	fork
i would like to point out another way this could be handled fork twice and have the child exit while the grandchild would call execl

9164475
opera	firefox
when i place button in opera it is in center vertically but in firefox the button text appears a little bit down than opera s which ruins my website s design

9164599
spaces	delimiter
currently i am split on the textarea itself where spaces is my split delimiter but i realize now that thats not right

9164607
mxmlc	compc
it works very similarly to the mxmlc and compc command line

9164607
mxmlc	compc
compilers but it compiles faster than the mxmlc and compc

9164625
classname	inherited
the type classname must implement the inherited abstract method

9164657
folder	directory
if i move the css out of the jqueryui folder which is inside the js folder then it will break all of the paths the css has to it s own image directory which is just below where the css is currently located ..

9164663
clang	llvm
on my system i have clang 2.9 but llvm 2.8

9164730
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i have a uinavigationcontroller within one of the tabs of a uitabbarcontroller

9164798

9164825
pop-up	dialog
just pop-up an alert dialog notifying the user

9164867

9164977
postorder	inorder	preorder	postorder	preorder	inorder
various kinds of traversals - inorder postorder and preorder on double tbt

9164980
textarea	textbox
the other page uses a textbox instead of a textarea

9164986
soql	apex
apparently a new feature of the spring 12 v24.0 release of apex in salesforce.com is that unit tests no longer have access to real data -- thus if i m understanding the change correctly a soql query will now only retrieve objects that have been inserted during the course of the unit test -- and even that is subject to some limitations

9164988
children	parent
positioned elements children will consider their parent to be bounds if the parent is positioned

9164994
maven	m2e
the m2e plugin is built into the latest version of eclipse and does a decent if not perfect job of integrating maven into the ide

when i remove the imageview and place a big textview instead it also doesn t pad and work nicely

9177464

9177502
min	max
i want to check if the value in b16 is greater than min date and less or equal to max date

9177511

9177646
int	chars
the + is not a valid chars when dealing with int simply the absence of a minus sign would indicate positive

in your example the struct and the typedef have the same name

9177898
typedef	struct
by typedefing typedef struct student student you re able to say struct student by simply saying student

9177914
typedef	struct
the typedef allows you to virtually create an alias for student instead of having to use struct student constantly thereby actually making it behave more like a built-in type

9177941
maven	pom.xml
in my maven pom.xml i add the following dependency declaration

9178001

opera	safari
http_referrer does t work in ie browser it works fine for all browsers like mozilla safari opera etc.

post	get
also if you implement ajax calls that means you have to expose a rest web service on server side something that responds to an http get or post call

public	protected
initially i couldn t assign anything to it but by setting it to public rather than protected i was able to use it in my test and avoided trying to call the base class initialize method

i have a list of draggable that can be dragged into the trash the fixed droppable but i don t want the horizontal scrollbar to appear when dragging them near the trash

9178282

9179101
jobs	cron
on ubuntu there are cron jobs that run it from time to time but to find newly created files you have to run in manually

9179158
inherited	properties
every entity that you want to automap must have an id properties or inherited from a class that has an id properties

9179261
put	get
if your requirements are to provide client authentication to the server using public private keys then things get more complicated because if you put the key in the apk no matter how much you obfuscate it including embedding it in a native library it will only slow down a dedicated nefarious user

as with c++03 you can optimise the initialisation you want to perform once in all your constructors either by putting them into a subclassing or a base-class often with protected or private inherited as it s an implementation detail

9179566
public	protected
i quite like the inheritence as i then use it in a as a class member rather than a member of some aggregated object and i prefer the inheritence protected or private here but sometimes if the base class has members i want to be public i will use public inheritence but give the base class a protected destructor

9179578
google-chrome	firefox
this occurs in ie firefox and google-chrome

9179626
getter	setter
the shipmentactionid class also has the unit and listindex properties with the same signatures on the getter and setter methods

if it s your ui that is taking a while to load then users might just have to deal with an initial load time the first time the tab loads however you can stop the delay when switching to an already loaded tab by extending the tabcontrol to keep it from destorying it s tabitem

9179922
tabcontrol	tabitem
the default behavior of wpf s tabcontrol is to unload a tabitem when you switch to a different tab and reload it when you go back

9180100
getter	setter
i am using special getter setter to intercept changes made to properties of an object and it currently works great for any normal user-defined properties

9180100
getter	setter
however i would love if i could employ the same idea to built-in properties like htmlinputelement.value or array.length but these are unfortunately defined as unconfigurable and thus i get an error when attempting to redefine them using a getter setter

9180131
getter	setter
one way to do it would be to have an extra unencryptedemail property in my contact model that would have a getter and a setter that would decrypt and encrypt the email property but i find that having to add an extra property is not as clean a solution

9180139
google-chrome	firefox
the javascript above opens a new tab in the version of google-chrome and firefox i have but not in ie

9180263
postgresql	mysql
for example both postgresql s money and mysql s currency fields are not recognized by django s models so it will emit models.textfield followed by # this is a guess

9180503
put	get
in my pre-oo days i retrieved the info from the db put it into variables then used compress to send and extract to get all the variables

9180505
getter	setter
a good practice you can adopt is to call _bar the internal variable you re going to modify by getter and setter and call them simply bar

9180520
jcomponent	jdialog	jwindow	jdialog	jwindow	jcomponent
jpanel has by default flowlayout you have to define that exactly if you want to change layoutmanager jcomponent have got implemented various layoutmanagers jframe jdialog jwindow from java5 has borderlayout by default

9180864
for-loop	arrays	strcpy	strncpy
you should either exchange the values of the pointers themselves but they are not pointers but arrays or use a for-loop to swap each character one by one or use a c function like strcpy strncpy to do the swap and use an external variable above as temporary variable

9180905
folder	dir
inside the html dir i can create subdomains or folder

9181554
javassist	cglib	javassist	bcel	bcel	cglib
you can break down bytecode framework into ones that provide a high level api that allows you to get away from learning low level opcodes and jvm internals e.g javassist and cglib and low level frameworks when you need to understand jvm or use some bytecode generation tools asm and bcel

this all works great in portrait mode but when the application changes to landscape mode which we want to support the default behaviour is for the tabs to move up into the top action bar which seems to eliminate the ability to have a screen title shown and seems crowded with the actions that appear on the right of the top action bar

9182556
width	height
for example an image tag with attributes src width 1 height 1 should be captured but its not

9182598
getter	setter
i would but by no means is necessary rename those attributes and getter setter and remove id from it as you are now technically speaking managing objects not ids

9182623
zipoutputstream	zipfile
unfortunately it seems as though when i dispose a zipoutputstream it needs to write in random file locations in order to create a valid zipfile

9182635
width	height
give your element a viewbox with fixed width and an exceptional height

9182653
srp	principles
generally i base my code by thinking on a tdd-oriented level extracting all dependencies from classes making them more usable following the srp principles and thinking what can go wrong when other people on the team use the architecture for example one big advantage of separating into assemblies is that you control your references and clearly state no data-access code in domain

9182667
ksort	usort
i have had a look at usort and ksort as well but couldn t get a working answer

9182686
put	get
as for the reason you get a localjumperror there if your code isn t in a method then there isn t anything to return to or put another way nothing to jump back to

9182822
int	double
so it could be an int or a double or a

9182846
width	height
reference width height

9182847
width	height
using .width and height will return a unit-less number that is in pixels if you want to get the exact height width set including px or em then you can use .css width and .css height

9182936
jobs	cron
i was thinking about just running cron jobs with python scripts that also use sqlalchemy

9182963
hide	show
you should be able to achieve effect like on flusta.com using some combination of hide with sliding + show with bouncing effects

9182973
width	height
when you have a vertical gradient that means you need to repeat it horizontally and that means you need a width of 1px and a height of the gradient height you want to have

9183018
getter	setter
by design the getter and the setter of a property be declared of the same type

9183050
qpainter	qwidget
i m pretty sure qwtplot does this but i m trying to keep things light so i m just using a simple qwidget + qpainter for now

9183068
width	height
of course you need to define a width and height to the .background class if there are no other elements inside of it

9183117
textarea	textbox
i need to create user control with textbox textmode multiline or html textarea

9183117
textarea	textbox
when in edit mode textbox textarea has to be resizable

9183117
textarea	textbox
but in read only mode this textbox textarea is disabled and it must be automatically resized height to fit the text

9183117
textarea	textbox
i could just hide textbox textarea in read only mode and display text in div but i would like to keep edit and readonly page look same

9183147
google-chrome	firefox
a jar file c program files x86 mozilla firefox google-chrome omni.ja

9183178
post	get
note that for single request i mean avoiding issuing a head request prior of get post

9183181
width	height
this is good for static things such as height and width

9183201
apache	nginx
if you are running a production server nginx apache etc and you want code-reload then you need to add something to your wsgi module to detect code changes

9183275
swt	swing
so i m making this program with a gui and i haven t worked with swing swt too much but a little bit to know what s going on

9183280

google-chrome	firefox
when you press f12 it brings up a debug window similar to google-chrome or firefox and you can switch the compatibility mode to ie 8 there

9183353
onclick	onchange
first give ids to the checkboxes and hook onchange not onclick

9183407
children	parent
the children can be just hidden but all children have to be directly after its parent node

9183411
hide	show
if you want to switch layouts you either need to create a new activity to go in to or put all of the views you want into your one layout and hide show only the relevant ones with setvisibility or with something like a viewflipper

9183460
gtk	clutter
i think it has something to do with the fact that gtkclutter.init must be called before gtk.init and clutter.init but the latter two are called upon import of the gtk and clutter packages

9183473
firefox	safari
this has a normal speed in safari but the zoom effect is really slow in firefox

9183473
width	height
if i set the item width height to the size of my images thing slow down again

i m trying to see what is supported and to compare mapping-by-code possibilities with fluent nhibernate

9183490
set	bag
set and bag

9183507
for-loop	arrays
the problem was not the counting for the arrays it s the embedded for-loop which will take o n n and in andrew s solution it s only o n +o n +o n +whatever take to find a object of the key in the dictionary which i guess would be in a hash table lookup and that s really fast

9183525
punctuation	words
you could use wordpuncttokenizer to separate the punctuation from words and later filter out the bigrams with punctuation with apply_word_filter

9183562
uitableview	nsindexpath
the problem is when i called - uitableviewcell tableview uitableview tableview cellforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath because i need to add to the cell with 90px an scrollview that have 90px of height but it s added on the middle of the cell instead on the top

9183564
google-chrome	firefox
while my code works just fine in both firefox and google-chrome my workplace requires that it also works in ie

9183575
google-chrome	firefox
it works great in ie9 firefox and google-chrome

9183577
iccube	mondrian
iccube had the right-ish idea just mondrian needed || instead of + and currentmember.name instead of just name

9183591
google-chrome	firefox
adding default makes firefox and google-chrome validate the cursor rule

9183593
cpu	hyperthreading
there is hyperthreading technology which can handle more that one thread per cpu but it is hardly dependent on type of calculation you want to do

9183603
udp	tcp
a tcp client will never receive udp packets since tcp and udp are two separate protocols at the socket level

9183603
udp	tcp
the socket will see you are listening for a tcp connection it will receive the udp datagram see no listeners and throw it away

9183651
maven	m2e
i see that for some jars maven m2e automatically downloads sources and or javadocs

9183690
hash	md5
the concrete given sample is the md5 hash computing of a file

9183728
google-chrome	safari
since i need webkit i ve tried the operation using safari and google-chrome

9183728
google-chrome	safari
even though my macbook is several years older than the dell laptop the load time for the macbook is more than 4 times faster than the dell laptop safari seems to be a bit faster than google-chrome on both platforms

9183811
inject	interceptor
this will inject your interceptor with the appropriate code

9183821
width	height
width and height specify the width and height of

9183829

multiplication division and modulo

9183882
subtraction	addition
addition and subtraction

9183902
jobs	cron
i don t have a great cron specific answer for this but in case its helpful there are alternative schedulers which give you more information about the running jobs from a central view something like cisco s tidal scheduler

9183903
onresume	onpause
when i am having issues with the life cycle methods what i would do is add oncreate onpause onresume etc etc in all my activities with a log.d in onpause inside to trace down exactly which method is being called at what time

9183908
hash	salt
step 2 extract salt from the password hash

9183908
hash	salt
step 3 use the salt to compute the hash from the plain text received from the user

9183908
hash	salt
seriously read up on salt password hash

9183941
google-chrome	safari
i find however that the size of the database is dependent on the platform and the database size varies greatly between safari and google-chrome

9183984
superclass	subclassing
all method and variable can be overridden bydefault in subclasses.if we want to save the subclassing from overridig the members of superclass we can declare them as final using the keyword final

9183998
int	boolean
you can either use the action with store_true | store_false or you can use an int and let implicit casting check a boolean value

9184016
put	get
guys i got a php file that use it as xml for a flash object the problem is when is put _get in the php file i get the same output but the flash doesnt work but if i remove the _get variable it worksss

9184042
for-loop	loops
the c# compiler will rewrite the foreach loops into the equivalent for-loop if it knows that loops collection is an array.

9184053
gridview	formview
and when selected it shows a formview with more detailed information on the customer that was selected in the gridview

9184053
gridview	formview
i want to make the customers name in the gridview to be the select button that displays the formview

9184055
portrait	landscape
when i run my app now the presentation of this view controller causes my app to start in portrait rather than landscape

9184089
crossover	mutation
for some problems i found that using crossover at the beginning and then mutation it will speed up the process for finding a solution however this is not very good approach since i will end up on finding similar solutions

9184089
crossover	mutation
if we use both crossover and mutation i usually get better optimized solutions

9184114
dateadd	datepart
the datepart hour is not supported by date function dateadd for data

9184124
memcached	apc
i ve compiled php 5.3.9 and nginx 1.0.11 and want to use apc and memcached with php

9184124
memcached	apc
i keep getting this error when attempting to load the apc memcached modules

9184182
int	boolean
the problem with the above suggestion is that the count variable should be a boolean and not an int

9184207
put	get
if you have a layout in your dialog you could get a reference to that as view and put a onclicklistener on that

9184211
treeview	treelist
check out the demos for treelist and treeview

9184212
hash	md5
for authentication generate a hash i.e md5 of the password then compare the hash stored in the database

9184250
int	double
when used with numbers int long double etc. it adds them just as you would expect

9184250
int	double
ps in case of int long double etc

9184341
button	checkbox
i made a dialog in visual studio 2005 i added some checkbox and button

9184431
put	get
is there a way to get around having to modify my build to put the files in

9184455
width	height
the root of the problem seems to lie with the onsurfacechanged command passing down the presumably altered width and height

9184455
width	height
perhaps calling setlayout int width int height explicitly with the desired width and height may get you better mileage.

9184479
for-loop	arrays
when json.stringify encounters an arrays it iterates in a similar way to a for-loop from 0 to simplearray.length to find the values

9184479
inherited	properties
however defining the object with makes json treat it as an object and therefore it loops over the object s properties excluding inherited properties from the prototype chain

9184510
webclient	httpwebrequest
you could take a look at the webclient or httpwebrequest classes which allows you to send http requests

9184531
cvs	svn
cvs and svn are both easy to setup on a server and they have clients for all the platforms mentioned

9184559

gripper is use to resize window with to listener mousedown and mouseup

9184625
pull	push
pull then push giving you this

9184634
accessor	properties
you will find there that while you can use the bracket properties accessor syntax with all object references --

9184634
integer	unsigned
only using a parameter value which string representation is that of an unsigned 32-bit integer value less than 2 32 -1 accesses an element of the encapsulated array structure and write access affects the value of the array instance s length property

9184645
dictionary	map
another way would be to override something that stands just before mvc tries to map the request to a specific route but has already parsed the request url and filled the routevalues dictionary

9184652
google-chrome	firefox
and then on mouseup all works fine on firefox but on google-chrome when all onmouseup handlers are finished the gets selected loosing the precedent selection of caption

9184692
width	height
while google frowns on what you are asking designing for 1 device in particular you said the device as 166ppi so you could just use 165 pixel inch in your setting and set the height and width of the psd depending on the size of your screen whatever it s width and height is in inches

9184751
int	double
it won t be zero but because sizeof scores and sizeof double are both integer-type expressions sizeof scores sizeof double is int division so if then

9184774
debian	linux	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian
to install it on ubuntu debian based linux machines run this

9184775
explode	implode
the opposite of explode is implode

9184813
getter	setter
instead we have to write getter setter code

9184813
getter	setter
what we d like to do is allow simple interface usage public data member like without function call syntax while underlying getter setter might be complex doing more than data assignment reading only

9184813
getter	setter
there is simple getter setter pair in the example above that doesn t do any additional job integrity check or bounds checking but this code may be complex performing bounds checking integrity check etc

9184817
firefox	safari
this does not happen on firefox or safari

9184862
ant	maven
i am working on converting an ant execution of the soapui testrunner to use the maven plugin and i cannot get a good answer on how to execute multiple projects using this plugin

9184867
pop-up	dialog
this isn t a general solution to the pop-up centering but it solved my issue with the facbeook auth dialog

9184878
qtimer	qapplication
qtimer along with all other event based classes need there to be a qapplication instance

9184914
post	get
- if there s a specific piece of code you re interested in and are having trouble writing on your own feel free to post it as a separate question so that you can get more targeted feedback

9184931
next	except
thus the pattern is moved one place further and since from the border table it is known that all characters of the pattern except possibly the last match the next comparison is between the last pattern character and the aligned text character

9185005
post	get
you will need two different methods one for get and another for post

9185031
qpushbutton	qframe
the generic call to a button like qframe qpushbutton #btnname css blah

9185076
libc	newlib
the newlib dtoa.c sources are in the src newlib libc stdlib subdirectory of the source tree

put quotes around the href and give http the full two slashes not just one p other than that post your code to output it

9185147
comparator	comparable
i think you will find this link helpful java sorting comparator vs comparable

9185147
comparator	comparable
the sorting is solved using comparator and comparable

9185153
libs	buildpath
open the project buildpath dialog and make sure all the libs point to the correct locations

9185199
superclass	subclassing
this method will work because all of the subclassing comission salary and hourly can be generalized to an employee superclass object

9185242
nunit	mstest
you can then test the business functionality by using a unit test library like mstest built in with most team system skus of visual studio or nunit etc

9185250
ant	maven
you can download it for free and run the compiler using a build tool like ant maven gradle etc. from your ide flashdevelop flashbuilder fdt etc. or directly from the command line prompt

9185285
google-chrome	firefox
use the google-chrome or ie developer tools or firebug in firefox to look at the css applied to your thumbnails

9185346
folder	directory
in order to fix the error above right click on the webapp directory in your project explorer and select build path â click use as source folder

9185450
maven	pom.xml
i have no experience with maven so editing the pom.xml file is out of the question

9185461
twig	smarty
or you could go with some sort of template engine like twig or smarty and treat your database value as a template and your variables as the data

9185467
getter	setter
alternatively you could explicitly define your getter and setter to convert nulls to empty strings

9185475
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
to loops over an arrays you can use a for-loop or a foreach loops

9185508
labwindows	labview
yes the usb-6008 supports both ansi-c or .net control without labview labwindows or measurement studio although these are certainly great options as well

9185616
submit	submission
what i thought was after i click on the submit button for the first form the submission for the second form should also be triggered i should received 2 posts on my server side example.com try

9185621
svg	vml
it s possible an svg vml solution would be better depending on what you re doing

9185635
ready	each
another way of doing it is to have a main javascript file that will be ran for each page when it s ready let s call the html file index.html and the javascript file index.js

9185653
int	chars
in c# the compiler automatically converts from chars to int

9185668
filesystems	fat
copying a file to a filesystems that does not have a concept of an executable permission most prominently fat formated usb sticks then copying it back after a rename on another os leaves osx with the dilemma of whether to see the file as executable or not - the ._.originalname metadata store is decoupled from the file by the rename

9185694
portrait	landscape
i have a listview which should have the theme theme in portrait and the theme.light theme in landscape mode

9185725
post	get
you just need to make the request a post request rather that the get request

9185725
post	get
when you are using the form you want to send the data from the form to the server that may process the data and hence it has to be post and not get

9185730
folder	directory
i am looking to copy files from a directory structure over to a new folder

9185732
ienumerable	ilist
ilist and generic ienumerable the collection is serialized and

9185732
serializable	deserialization
collection during both serializable and deserialization

9185740
integer	unsigned
uvec4 is an unsigned integer type

9185740
integer	unsigned
you can only write unsigned integer values to a texture that also has an unsigned integer texture format

9185740
integer	unsigned
gl_rgba8 is not an unsigned integer texture format

9185756
versioning	upgrade
the way i ve upgrade on my local machine was to delete the folders of these libraries and then manually install the newer versioning

9185771
opera	firefox
i seem to have an issue where firefox is displaying a blurred text shadow of 0.75 opacity just fine on white background but in webkit and opera it s too dark crisp

9185771
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
the firefox version seems the blurriest followed then by opera s and then google-chrome safari webkit

9185779
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the code works in google-chrome firefox safari etc. but for some reason it just displays the dialog form in ie8

9185785
children	parent
so it depends on whether the parent object is written to automatically dispose its children

9185815
post	get
ajax or post method get is probably not very suitable here for large images

9185828
prepare	execute
execute db test prepare

9185859
width	height
when you specify a percentage based height or width the computed value is in relation to the parent container

9185971
qthread	qfuture
in the constructor i create all the widgets on this main widget and at the end i try to create a new thread using qfuture i use qfuture instead of qthread cause it allows me easily to call functions with any type of parameters like qtextedit qtextcursor... but it gives me this error at compilation

9185971
children	parent
qobject cannot create children for a parent that is in a different thread

9185971
qthread	qobject	qtextedit	qtextcursor
i ve read here on stackoverflow how others use qobject which i never used and i don t get the idea of it and qthread the only combination but i already tried to use qthread and i wasn t able to pass qtextedit and qtextcursor to it

9185974
serializable	deserialization
this is because during deserialization the serializable instantiates a default instance of the struct then sets all the fields following instantiation

9185995
opengl-es	glsurfaceview
edit im able to bind the camerapreview in a glsurfaceview i just need to know how to draw a box with text inside it just like a toast in opengl-es

9186017
listview	gridview
if you wish to use a listview that uses a gridview then you can set the celltemplate of a column to a datatemplate so the principle is the same

9186019
children	parent
this is quite a normal usecase typically you would work around it with an on delete trigger on the parent that also deletes the children selecting them by parent

9186034
int	chars
as you can see it s relatively easy to read through a file stick the first int you come across into one container and then the first string into a chars

9186112
dictionary	map
in other words a dictionary hash table is required to map vertex ids to indices within the heap in expected constant time

9186142
getter	setter
input text area and am able see the sysout in setter the value submitted from page and not able to access the getter values

9186159
put	get
css3 gives you pseudo-classes like nth-child which can be put to good use to get the desired result without much effort

9186178
width	height
i think i found the solution for my issue define width and height in image control rather than in wrappanel the code is

9186187
post	get
it seems like this might be the best way to do this even though it seems hackish in which case i ll post this as an answer once i get everything working

9186262
sum	floor
otherwise if you need a sum of setting elements that have type apartment or context floor excluding counting setting that has both elements with required values you probably need

9186317
wordpress	joomla
although i prefer wordpress over joomla the acymailing solution is great and has worked successfully for several clients of mine

9186320
folder	directory
did a build solution and looked in the bin directory of my console application and low and behold there was a folder called files and within it a file called file1.txt

9186364
getter	setter
the book class has 3 properties id title and author with it s corresponding getter and setter

9186380
width	height
i suspect the problem could be in setimagesize method which loads the img element background image needed to save it s real width and height

9186437
footnotes	epub
the epub is filled with footnotes annotations which are internal links anchors

9186507
width	height
all subsequent operations are done with these width and height values resulting in a final image that is only the size of the primary display

9186548
stdout	stderr
you ll pass it the command to run then array containing descriptions of streams to open to represent stdin stdout and stderr for the process

9186549
agile	sprint
i want to follow agile methodology and scrum process in my project.i referred web sites and created a product back log items and started to create sprint backlogs

9186557
stdout	stderr
also note that exec is just a convenience wrapper around spawn which offers a much more powerful interface and lets you use streams for stdin stdout and stderr

9186576
maven	pom.xml
this solution could be adapted to generate a maven pom.xml

9186586
width	margin
margin 0px auto needs an fixed width and a block element

9186593
setinterval	settimeout
check out the settimeout and setinterval methods for js

9186635
integer	unsigned
don t try using unsigned integer types java only supports signed types i m sure there are libraries to deal with it if necessary

9186637
unsigned	short
i have 16bit unsigned short image and i read this 2byte unsigned short array

9186663
inherited	subclassing
you can override the form s createhandle method call the inherited method first to create the window then use fmxhandletohwnd to get the hwnd that you can subclassing

9186663
inherited	subclassing
be sure to also override the destroyhandle method to remove the subclassing before then calling inherited to release the hwnd

9186674
post	put	post	get	put	get
if i put some values in the viewbag in the get action method to set up some form labels then when they user clicks submit button and the form is posted back to the server via http post the viewbag values are no longer within the post action method

9186712
ubuntu	debian
i ve battled with python packaging for ubuntu debian before as well and i agree the docs are a mess non-existent misleading they really need a quickstart guide for the simplest possible situation

9186734
realloc	malloc
this code uses realloc instead of malloc for the initial allocation calling realloc with null as the first argument is the same as calling malloc

9186760
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
here it s a screenshot firefox safari and opera in this order

9186767
portrait	landscape
i ve done two screen layouts a portrait and a landscape

9186767
portrait	landscape
the problem is that if the phone is rotated ondestroy is called to reload the new layout landscape or portrait

9186801
put	get
i could force it to by adding all the classes that get put in when a page is rendered commented out

9186878
ubuntu	debian
sometimes when downloading software from the internet i find that there is a .deb package ready for either my debian ubuntu and also a tarball to be compiled

9186922
post	put
some people like to put everything in one giant bundle but i prefer to use them as containers for specific pieces of functionality ie user management blog post management asset management.

9186950
uiview	subviews
i mean uiview has a subviews property where you could look for uitextfields and find the firstresponder using the uitextfield isfirstresponder property

9186963
onclick	onkeydown	onclick	onchange	onchange	onkeydown
you could use onchange onkeydown onclick etc the same way

9186969
backbone.js	backbone-forms
i m trying to implement a simple login form with backbone.js using the backbone-forms library

9186971
google-chrome	firefox

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
below is the script same issues in firefox opera google-chrome safari on mac

9187026
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
on all other browsers ie9 safari google-chrome and firefox the login works fine but it doesn t work in ie8

9187040
width	margin
make the width smaller and to align it in the center place it inside the container of the element and set its margin to 0 auto

9187107
integer	unsigned
the c# compiler will try to protect you from accidentally negiting an unsigned integer but you can force it like this

9187129
qpushbutton	qframe
the selector qframe qpushbutton will simply ignore qpushbutton because it is not a valid pseudo-state

9187129
qpushbutton	qframe
i assume what you really wanted was for the rule to apply to any qpushbutton with an objectname of btnname which is also a descendant of a qframe

9187145
hide	show
your sample code won t work because you cannot give the filter authority to both show and hide items in the listing

9187145
hide	show
in general a filter should either show or hide or similar and in this case it should hide

9187145
hide	show
the master should ensure that all listing items are initially show so that the filters can selectively hide them

9187145
hide	show
it is tempting to think that you could alternatively do things the other way round - namely to hide all items initially then allow the filters to selectively show

9187163
onmousedown	onmouseup
it looks to me that all tutorial about html drag and drop set the onmousedown and onmouseup events to the document rather than the element itself and as i tested with below codes

9187163
onmousedown	onmouseup
when clicking the element both the onmousedown and onmouseup event will be triggered

9187168
disk	ram
only having 1gb of ram that s going to be fully eaten up once everything is running so you ll be paging to disk and on a netbook that disk is probably not the speediest

9187193
hide	show
best i can figure is to hide them all then show when the title is clicked

9187226
hide	show
to avoid the flickering when you first press the toggle button just invert the order of hide show in the toggle function

9187263

a good malloc library generally lets you mark a region of memory as free so it can be used to satisfy a subsequent malloc call

9189168
free	malloc
malloc keeps track of the memory that is free or not

9189168
free	malloc
in your case mapping malloc to sbrk and making free a no-op will work as long as you don t allocate too much memory ...

9189189
for-loop	loops
says loops through the string we read from the char_cfg file doing something for each character in the string. since this for-loop is inside of the other for-loop we will actually go through this for-loop multiple times once for each of the iterations of the outer loops

it is because some implementations of malloc stores header information at the location a-4 or wherever and free internally reads it by pointer arithmetic

9189196
realloc	malloc
if you want to shorten or lengthen the memory chunk you allocated with malloc you can use realloc as gustav said

9192150

inline	inlining
but this doesn t mean the function will necessarily be inline generally nowadays it appears that the compiler will decide if inlining the function will lead to any benefits

9192183
hide	show
i.e. on click of the close button trigger a click on the introduction link which should then execute your first function which if i m reading it correctly will do the hide and show for you .

i thought that i put my configuration in there which explains why the application didn t get registered with wink on startup

9192960
ant	maven
integrate that with your build tools like ant or maven etc

9192990
google-chrome	firefox
not that i just want to watch the values in the javascript console google-chrome firefox or whatever

in our maven pom.xml file i updated the slf4j dependency to

9193118
ant	maven
you can use ant or maven as your build tools

9193139
client-side	server-side
the common way to do this is to implement dual validation client-side and server-side

9193143
disk	ram
it would be great if it can store n elements in ram and rest in disk

9193170
free	malloc	free	realloc	realloc	malloc
this designation is meant to drive home the point that you never mix new and delete with malloc realloc or free or bit level sets for that matter

9193170
free	malloc
during interviews it s good to say that new and delete use the free store malloc and free use the heap

9193170
free	malloc
new and delete call the constructor and destructor respectively however malloc and free do not. yet you will often hear that the memory segments are really in the same area - however that can be compiler specific that is to say it is possible that both can designate different memory spaces as pools not sure why it would be though

9193203
width	height
you can try removing the width and height attributes on the svg root element adding instead

9193243
hide	show
if you don t want to show a new form you could wrap all controls labels textboxes.... that are related to your user inside a container for instance a simple panel and hide show the panel depending on your form state

9193258
ant	maven
if you want the jar to be created everytime you build try using maven or ant that does these packaging tasks for you automatically

9193263
portrait	landscape
i know in android you can provide different xml layouts for portrait and landscape

9193272
mouse	keyboard
however it s very important to remember that the requestpermission method only works in event handlers triggered by a user action like mouse or keyboard events in order to avoid unsolicited infobars

9193316
mouseup	mousedown
define an interval in mousedown and when the mouse click is release mouseup clear that interval

9193428

i have tested up until firefox 10 it has improved a bit but is still not running very smoothly compared to safari google-chrome

9193581
width	height
width height left and top

9193581
width	height
the image resized has a max width height of 800px

9193582
uilabel	uibutton
you should not create new uilabel and uibutton and adding them as a subview every time

9193615
ember.js	sproutcore
you may also want to checkout the sproutcore 2 ember.js s previous name demo app contest

9193615
ember.js	sproutcore
generally speaking to convert sproutcore 2 to ember.js just change the sc namespace to ember.js

9193676
ubuntu	linux
freetts no audio linux ubuntu - no errors

9193702
width	height
suppose you want to optimize the size of a rectangular parallelepiped dened by its length height and width

9193702
width	height
the corresponding phenotype is a parallelepiped of length 1 height 7 and width 10

9193714
junit	jmockit
as robotium is restricted to application boundaries it can t access system data hence tested the behavior using junit jmockit based unit test

9193725
versioning	upgrade
i have taken the backup of my live portal and i want to upgrade it to newer versioning in localhost and then move the upgrade versioning to my live site

9193737
gtk	cairo
if you need to create a cairo context for drawing with the gtk c api it goes something like this

9193775
oncreate	ondestroy
incremented in oncreate decremented in ondestroy

9193775
oncreate	ondestroy
calling startservice or bindservice from a testcase should result in a second onbind or onstartcommand but should never result in a second oncreate before the first ondestroy

9193808
getter	setter
he said if we use setter and getter in that class then by using those setter and getter we can get that private data easily

9193811
width	height
another very important clarification you need to have a height width set or at least a minimum height and width set otherwise certain browsers firefox will not load the resource

9193816
children	parent
i think that even if you call finalreleasecomobject on the parent object if you haven t released the child objects too then even though there are no reference to the parent there may still be references to the children hanging about

9193851
getter	setter
the support for data hiding can be explained by the fact that the getter and setter methods are like gateways to the data

9193852
getter	setter	public	protected
if you make the setter getter public protected default then you could access the private members on different levels

9193852
getter	setter
if you make setter getter private then the data is really hidden

9193860
nswindow	nsimage	nswindowcontroller	nsviewcontroller
note in addition in os x v10.7 you cannot create weak references to instances of nsfontmanager nsfontpanel nsimage nstablecellview nsviewcontroller nswindow and nswindowcontroller

9193902
width	height
because a jframe has a 5px border around it look at any frame on your computer screen you ll notice a kind of embossed border - that border is 5 px in width adding 10 pixels onto height and width

9193909
getter	setter
basically the getter and setter allow you to expose class variables as you like and hide any others

9193909
getter	setter
getter and setter also allow you to perform any other necessary steps such as validation

9193909
getter	setter
getter and setter can have different access modifiers themselves so you can expose data to certain classes but not others by using different access modifiers

9193912
portrait	landscape
that way i can show my content in the normal fashion in landscape mode and in a slider in portrait mode thus saving space

9193916
uilabel	uibutton
i have done similar with uibutton basically i created a uilabel with a width and centered text and set it as the custom view for it

9193919
uilabel	uibutton
you can inherits from uitableviewcell make for it .xib and put any control you want uilabel uibutton etc

9193925
getter	setter	mutators	getter	mutators	setter
in java access to private members is done through accessors and mutators getter and setter it is all about hiding and controlling access to your members so you can control how inner state of instance will be modified

9193941
put	get
while this question did get answered i never got a clear answer of where to actually put the song file

9193957
getter	setter
if we want to make the values accessible we provide access methods getter setter for example

9193957
getter	setter
but there is no requirement to provide getter and setter for all fields or to name them according to fields in general

9193963
accessor	properties
be aware that any properties of a class can be accessed if the mutators and accessor are public

9193971
webrat	cucumber
i want to use webrat in combination with cucumber for writing acceptance tests for a web application

9193987
vb.net	vb6
when i call my dll from vb6 everything works fine but when i call it from vb.net 2.0 framework targeted - vs2010 i get this error

9193995
cos	sin
and the get set for x y do some coordinate transformation with sin and cos

9193995
public	protected
so to sum up my answer to the question would be the public interface of a class might provide set get but the actual implementation can and should be hidden by making all members private or protected

9194020
post	put
i can understand some frowning-upon making up yet another media type but i humbly suggest it s more correct than the post put alternative

9194029
mouse	keyboard
if you use a control in your datatemplate that handles mouse clicks a textbox that gets the keyboard focus this will prevent the listbox from receiving these events

9194036
mouseover	mouseout
.live mouseover function and .live mouseout function .

9194053
integer	unsigned
unsigned integer overflow unlike its signed counterpart exhibits well-defined behaviour

9194078
retaincount	dealloc
the parent would call release on the child but this has been retained if the method is executing so retaincount should still be 0 when dealloc is called

9194132
implements	extends
take a look at spark s own buttonbarskin for a good example and make sure these buttons at least implements iitemrenderer or just extends buttonbarbutton

9194133
draggable	droppable
i was testing out an interface i built using jquery ui draggable droppable and sortable and noticed that the drag and drop doesn t work in the mobile browser

9194173
width	height
from experience with setting jpanel or jframe size i have always used setpreferredsize new dimension width height

9194189
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

9194198

9194255
subtract	add
and i basically want to add or subtract the value of the options if it s off subtract if it s on add it

9194255
subtract	add
the thing i can t work out is how to get the text of the select to do an if statement so if it s yes add the value if it s no subtract the value

9194259
disk	ram
a source bitmap is raw saved randomaccessfile on disk no ram memory then source bitmap is released now there s no bitmap at memory and after that the file info is loaded to another bitmap

9194281
tax	shipping
this causes the tax for the shipping cost to be added twice

9194304
subtract	add
i d also suggest if you re using html5 that using the data-x attribute to store the flag whether to add or subtract the value would be more semantic

9194322
children	parent
for example only release the parent when all its children s work are complete or put the release code in a completion handler block that will only be called when no child method is being executed

9194351
post	get
or you could use the post-redirect-get pattern in your post action method display the same view if there are errors or else redirect to a get view that displays something else

9194355
junit	jmock
jmock depends upon hamcrest and junit uses and includes some hamcrest classes in it s jar so this is probably where the problem comes from

9194411
hide	show
bit of a hack but you can hide the ecb windows call swap-windows and show them again like so

9194436
width	height
actually the content_css should have your site .css adding purpose so for textarea you can restrict in your css and you can set the width and height

9194439
rss	feed
on this page i had an rss feed from my homepage www.stafflink.fi but now this application page is empty

9194476
range	max
if anyone puts value in this value manually lets say to database max value then application would throw out of range exception

9194478
for-loop	arrays
i am writing a bash script where i need to create arrays inside a for-loop and name each arrays using the string contained in the counter an arrays element each iteration

9194481
hide	show
this will basically hide all controls and then show just the one you want

9194500
google-chrome	firefox
it by default have some firefox ie google-chrome instances

9194503
memcpy	strncpy
i strongly encourage the use of the safer strncpy or if you just want to copy data no 0 necessary the faster and safer memcpy

9194524
folder	directory
i create a directory in the documents directory with the string my folder by pressing a button

9194524
folder	directory
but if this directory already exist i want it to be named my folder 1 and if this exists then my folder 2 and so on.

9194534
move	drag
you d obviously want the locations of drag move touches etc. and you can get those from the event itself

9194537
post	get
then when i try to post on facebook i get the same message and i am not able to do it the operation cannot be completed

9194547
implements	extends
good but lacking the view code like the base class etc how other views implements extends it

9194569

google-chrome	firefox
in ie this works fine...in google-chrome and firefox 10 the buttons aren t clickable

9194615
google-chrome	safari
fyi using javascript style parameter names like backgroundcolor works fine for me here in safari 5.1.2 and google-chrome 16

9194629
vim	sublimetext	vim	textmate	textmate	sublimetext
try textmate vim or sublimetext 2

9194668
pop-up	dialog
if you want to handle pop-up dialog use

9194708
portrait	landscape
think of it as an ipad changing from landscape to portrait and a div flipping when this happens

9194718
google-chrome	firefox
in real life it s a bit more complicated since firefox and google-chrome does not wait for the file selection dialog to close before continuing the script after and internet explorer waits till it s closed before continuing

9194745
noexcept	throw
there is even a noexcept construct available to see if something might throw

9194766
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
or use google-chrome or firefox or opera

primes	modulus
it is perfectly possible to use rsa with a modulus n that is composed of more than two primes factors p and q but two things have to be noted

9195786
primes	modulus
the security of rsa is effectively bounded by the magnitude of the second largest primes factor of the rsa modulus n

9195786
primes	modulus	modulus	fractions
finding small primes factors that are less than 2 32 can be done in a fractions of a second on a modern computer simply by trying to divide the modulus n by each such primes and check if the residue is zero meaning n is divisible by that number or not meaning that number is not a factor of n

hash	salt
the purpose of the salt is to make it arbitrarily more difficult for an attacker to use a precomputed table of hash common passwords

9195974
hash	salt
if the salt is always the same then the attacker just precomputes a table of hash common passwords with that salt

9195974
hash	salt
the attacker now knows which two users have the same password because they have the same salt hash and can make the reasonable assumption that this is the weakest password in the database

orientdb	neo4j
this can be a solution but you would end up with code that is written specifically for neo4j which have his own api different from others graph databases like orientdb for example and going on with the development you would probably need a more flexible way of retrieving data and map the results to your objects so i suggest to take a look at the tinkerpop stack that is basically a series of java apis and abstraction layers to work with graph databases

9199281
google-chrome	firefox
doing so with a plain object as a base element works flawlessly but when using a domelement as the base element the base element is modified if a property by the same name exists on google-chrome and firefox

9199281
inherited	properties
being so affects how the prototype inherited in this case works making the native setter implementation for the value to act instead of the creation of the properties on the extended object

9199294
inherited	private-inheritance
the private-inheritance variant can introduce unnecessary multiple inherited

9199342
width	text-align

9199644
pop-up	dialog
it just pauses the execution of the program and a dialog box pop-up saying runtime check failure #3 - variable number is being used without being initialized

width	margin
the problem appears to be the lack of a parent container for the floating pane that caused the resize handler to have zero width and lie outside the floating pane s defined margin box

9199653

children	parent
i tried adding a the buttons as children of a relativelayout that was centered in the middle inside the parent relativelayout and that sort of achieves what i m trying to but then the eclipse complains with a warning stating that one set of relative layout tags is useless and that i should consider getting rid of it

9199668

maven	pom.xml
if you re using maven for your build which i suspect you may be make absolutely sure that the following dependency is in your html pom.xml

9200395
maven	m2e
we use maven m2e eclipse combo for our work

9200395
maven	pom.xml
we start with importing master maven pom.xml file in eclipse and our projects get imported

valgrind	memcheck
the memcheck tool in valgrind does not report stack based memory errors unless you overrun the top of your stack address space

9200831
photoshop	paint.net
my answer use paint.net or photoshop and enlarge said icon or make another

9200835
mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave
you need to use mouseenter and mouseleave instead of mouseover and mouseout which would bubble up to the parent when triggered on child elements

9200835
mouseleave	mouseenter
also as suggested by j08691 you may just want to use .hover as this method binds handlers for both mouseenter and mouseleave events

i am using the below code to add images and i would like to set width and height of an image

9200965
libpcap	wireshark
if you want to read the file header you will have to write your own code to replace libpcap and that code will not be able to handle for example pcap-ng files which will be the default file type in the next release of wireshark unlike code that uses libpcap which can read pcap-ng files as long as all the network interfaces in the pcap-ng file have the same link-layer header type and snapshot length when they re using libpcap 1.1.0 or later

so i have a main file a tile superclass and two subclassing of the tile class- bomb and flat

9201868
svnkit	maven-release-plugin
if your question actually is why the maven-release-plugin can t use a pure java svn client instead of relying on a command line client then the answer is that it s because of a licensing issue the svnkit library can t be distributed under the asf license

the first detailed above is directly via branches that people pull and push from to

9204651
strdup	malloc
so what you really want is to allocate some persistent memory with strdup or malloc so that you can return it from the function

9204675
free	malloc	free	realloc	realloc	malloc
if you allocate the memory for content with malloc 3 you can grow the space required with realloc 3 but this introduces the potential for a horrible error -- whatever you handed the pointer to must clean up after the memory allocation when it is done with the data or else you leak memory and it cannot simply call free 3 because the content pointer might be to statically allocated memory

9204744
springboard	backgrounding
thanks for the comments i think ive sorted it out i did not have icloud on my iphone as its older one and i ve been testing on simulator and thats is why ive had this issue so if any one else has this problem the way to fix it is to start and stop your app in the simulator first as when you stop the app by clicking stop in xcode after running it kill the app the wrong way here is the log 9 02 12 12 46 52 pm application app name exited abnormally with signal 9 killed springboard 5273 which then stops the app from accessing core data while in backgrounding ill send apple a bug report but i dont know if its something they want to fix

there is no simple maven command that will show you the chain of parent poms for a pom.xml

9204999
maven	pom.xml
you are right that technically the parent pom.xml is a dependency of your project but it is not a literal maven dependency and is handled completely differently

9204999
maven	pom.xml
the chain of parent poms along with active profiles your settings.xml file and the maven super pom.xml from the installation directory are all combined together to create your project s effective pom.xml

9204999
maven	pom.xml
the effective pom.xml is what maven really uses to do its work

9204999
m2e	pom.xml
i know you didn t ask but for others reading this if you want to see your parent pom.xml simply open up the pom.xml in the m2e pom.xml editor and click on the parent artifact link on the overview tab

i have simple relative layout - an imageview iv1 and a textview tv1 to the left of iv1

9207972

9211055
google-chrome	firefox
all session related stuff works perfect on google-chrome firefox

9211086
int	double
the executescalar method returns a value of type system.object so you need to cast it to number decimal or double or int

9211676
serializable	deserialization
generally speaking most serializable deserialization is tolerant of this or can be configured to be tolerant of this

9211684
hide	show
you can t show or hide sections directly with code but you can affect data sources which in turn can trigger rules

9211716
stdout	stderr
this will redirect both stdout and stderr into your file and capture and print the return code

9211731
consistency	acid
for instance when it is used with myisam it will use no acid transactions but consistency will be ensured by a r w lock at the table level

9211731
innodb	myisam
innodb implements mvcc multi-versioning concurrency control so locking is much more complex than with myisam

9211736
calloc	malloc
you can substitute malloc with calloc to initialize the elements to 0 otherwise the array might be filled with random values

9211790
public	protected
so the rmi works fine if a just return a int or something but when a try to return gamestate which is a class defined inside the gameserver java file the following error occurs game state is declared neither public protected or private

9211801
ubuntu	linux
i m using linux ubuntu 11.04

9211832

9211875
for-loop	arrays
easy to do with an arrays and a for-loop

9211883
folder	directory
i ve added the style sheet folder to the iis list of virtual directory - still not working

9211895
width	height
if the types x y width and height are used throughout the application then not only will there be no cast but your application will be much safer and much better documented too yeah.

9211898
min	max
there are probably other special cases you want to deal with to constrain it -- just pick min and max radians and check them before using in a transform

9211898
min	max
use min and max to limit angle1 and angle2 remember it s radians so and

9211910
maven	pom.xml
you could however roll your own maven pom.xml project that only depends on the core jars you need

9211937
int	double
conversion of an int or a long value to float or of a long value to double may result in loss of precision-that is the result may lose some of the least significant bits of the value

9211937
floating-point	integer
in this case the resulting floating-point value will be a correctly rounded version of the integer value using ieee 754 round-to-nearest mode

9211937
int	double
converting from a 32-bit java int to a double which in java has 50+ bits of precision will not lose the magnitude or any precision

9212010
int	double
but it can not automatically cast double to int ie.downcast

9212068
client-side	server-side
it seems like you re confusing server-side and client-side actions

9212103
width	height
however i am failing to understand why the width and height of the images and that of its corresponding outer div is coming to 0px

9212103
width	height
an easy solution would to be change the height width from within javascript but i m sure there would be a better solution

9212156
min	max
if your diagonal is going the other way to test this see if xa xb you need to swap min for max on the x

9212157
int	chars
you say that dropping the last 3 chars of the string gets you most of the way that is the same as converting to an int and then dividing by 1 000

9212165

9212323
rss	feed
i had exactly the same problem with rss feed

9212335
folder	directory
the proper way is converting the svn repo to a git repo using git-svn and then performing a clean clone throwing away the old working directory with the .svn folder and the git-svn remainders

the above script works fine only when the textbox mode is set to single and the text displayed on the delivery address is copied and pasted on txtbillingaddress when the checkbox is checked but when the textmode is set to multiline the jquery fails as textarea is rendered in a different way

9213079
box-sizing	border-box
it works better with the box-sizing -moz-box-sizing for firefox set to border-box

9213088

9213144
calloc	malloc
i know this question may be marked as a duplicate of difference between malloc and calloc but still i would like to ask it

9213144
calloc	malloc
because i feel we can do the same using malloc which can be done by calloc

9213158
keydown	keyup
in addition also play with keydown and keyup events to figure out what suits you most

9213170
int	boolean
method.invokenative object object class class class int boolean line not available native method

9213192
tostring	getter
option 3 is provide a getter that returns the formatted phone number i called this tostring above

9213200
calloc	malloc
well calloc also initializes the memory block to contain zeroes unlike malloc

9213215
daemons	systemd
also i m not sure if it also works in other environments maybe as a systemd daemons or so

9213231
calloc	malloc
thus if you intend to set your allocated memory to zero then using malloc you have to compute twice or use a temp variable which is what calloc does

9213275
portrait	landscape
so...on to my issue when loading the web app from the home screen in landscape you can see the page content behind the splash screen lighter green area in the landscape image below where the states bar was in portrait

9213323
accessor	properties
a properties may apply access modifiers to individual accessor for instance

9213332

as others have mentioned though the call to calloc will actually zero-out that memory where-as malloc will simply give you a pointer to that memory and the memory may or may not have all zeroes in it

9213357
hide	show
i have two hyperlinks above this area and would like to use those to show hide the text below

9213357

9213368
cobertura	emma
like cobertura or emma reports after running the unit tests it shows me which all part of my code was fired up by the unit tests

9213394
hide	show
i would strongly suggest using classes for both the hide show button and the hidden content areas

then i ll have to rewrite it as an extension for google-chrome firefox

9213678
gentoo	linux
i just installed gentoo linux amd64

9213689
integer	fractions
if you use exponents to show both integer n 0 and fractions n 0 values you have the problem that you need one exponent for 2 0 1

9213689
integer	fractions
so we are back to even numbers again 254 for both sides integer and fractions but with a lower bias

9213689

9213732
ncover	testdriven.net
unfortunately as far as i can tell testdriven.net does not yet support using other ncover arguments like ea

9213732
ncover	testdriven.net
so my best advice is to contact support testdriven.net to find out the latest on configuring and using ncover parameters

viewmodel	caliburn
caliburn micro has a lot of this built in to the framwork allowing you to save properties of a viewmodel or the entire graph to both phone state and app settings

9213822
calloc	malloc
for these situations calloc num size should be preferred though you could also test for overflow before calling malloc if the fact that calloc initializes the newly allocated memory to zero bothers you

9213829
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in production with google-chrome and works fine locally if i use firefox or ie for google-chrome it doesn t

9213898
memmove	memset
the worst thing possibly going on in your code is a kind of memset memmove operations which happen to overwrite memory occupied by your core data stack manager

9214042
int	double
a member method named foo bar returning an int and taking a double argument named num1 and a float argument named num2

9214050
int	double
you therefore need to parse it as a double and then get the int part

9214064
google-chrome	firefox
i have tested my code in all main browsers ie firefox and google-chrome and i get the same error message

9214078

9216786
jar	war
you ve already discovered two of the possible solutions introduction of an additional parent pom for the wars perhaps the additional pom extends the original parent so you don t have to duplicate all of its config or duplicating the jar plugin config in all of the war poms

9216786
jar	war
another possibility is to use the maven-assembly-plugin instead of the jar plugin to build the classified jar for the war projects

9216786
jar	war
the assembly plugin is not included in the default lifecycles for either jar or war packaging so you could configure it in the parent s section and then only reference it in the war projects as raghuram described

int	boolean
all historical versions of basic i ve seen which have supported bitwise boolean operators with int have used all-bits-set -1 as the value for true comparisons

9217648
vb.net	vb6
while vb.net is its own language quite separate from vb6 there is a lot of code which has been ported from vb6 to vb.net and may rely upon the fact that comparison operators yield all-bits-set when true

9217649
chr	multibyte
using str_replace to try and fix the bad windows character chr 148 right double quote in the above valid emdash string which does not even contain any double quotes will result in a scrambeled character at first i thought that str_replace might not be multibyte safe and tried using mb_eregi_replace but the problem was the same

keydown	keyup
since you tagged this as flex in your main application add an event listeners for keyup and keydown

after further scrutiny i found that ui_mainwindow.h which is generated every compile by qmake had been moved into the source directory instead of the build directory which must have caused some internal conflict with qcreator where it would not regenerate it and just copy the old one to the build folder

9218015

now i m working in an advertising agency and now our big problems are interface design problems like misaligned elements colors text fonts javascript features like fadein fadeout and slidein slideout elements css problems like overlapping elements with z-index and so on.

9218323
apache	nginx
i am new to server-side development so many of the things i m saying are probably being said incorrectly and while i understand how node.js works on its own i have seen discussions about proxying http requests through another server technology a la nginx or apache for efficiency

9218350
x86	64bit
assemblies marked for x86 can still run on 64bit windows

9218352
hide	show
you have to make a rdlc file but what you can do is to fill this rdlc with columns you need and depending on what you need you show hide the columns

9218383
x86	64bit
in your project which is 32 bit only then x86 or only 64bit only then x64

9218395
sorting	filtering
this works perfect if we not decide to filtering but if we want to filtering the values we see the ugly binding.donothing in the filtering drop down items the sorting and filtering is also wrong

9218404
vim	emacs
the developers which work to the same project using unix emacs or vim editor are bored to see each time the ctrl-m m character

9218430
division	modulo
on the odd chance you are not familiar with it the modulo - aka percent sign - will give you the remainder of division

9218473
folder	directory
use the path relative to the resources folder that you included as a source directory in the build path options if you weren t aware of how to add the folder as a source folder right click on the project go to properties go to flex build path click the source tab and add it there

9218547
uitableview	nsindexpath
in your - void tableview uitableview tableview didselectrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath make sure check whether indexpath.row is equal to array count if that s the same then

9218562
getter	setter
you could just make it a class with everything public thats all a struct is and use an initialisation list - no need for getter setter

9218567
getter	setter
i have used the property decorator to turn getlocalname into the attribute local_name - in python getter setter are considered bad practice

9218583
apache	nginx
when you say through another technology i assume you mean through a dedicated web server such as nginx or apache

9218609
post	get
now i m trying to get the plugin to pull in the blog s latest post but i m running into a bit of a snafu

9218626
getter	setter
using getter and setter is in my opinion more correct than accessing the right hand sides s members directly

9218633
put	get
they will be called when a view did get put into the dom or will get put into the dom respectively

9218637
maven	m2e
i suggest trying out the m2e-wtp plugin in addition to your currently installed m2e plugin which doesn t contain support for wtp based projects this plugin is available in the eclipse marketplace via the embedded marketplace client or on the web it provides a tighter maven integration with wtp and should improve the overall maven with wtp experience

9218700
post	get
.load uses post or get depending on the parameter passed

9218738
width	height
i would also recommend not even doing 9 td s in the 1st because it s redundant the images will push the boundaries of the table to fit their specs regardless of td height width settings

9218815
mef	prism
for the login to be verified i need to initialize some of the application data that is loaded by prism mef so i cant put it in app.xmal.cs

the background-size property is supported in ie9+ firefox 4+ opera google-chrome and safari 5+

9218962
int	boolean
accessing a byte boolean can be more work than accessing an int or long so if performance is the only consideration a int or long can be faster

9218981
getter	setter
i m still new to ruby but i recall that class fields are all private so they would need to be accessed through getter setter methods

9218985
range	minimum
i recall minimum executables in the 400k code range on a powerpc

9218985
range	minimum
in comparison the rtems minimum c executable is probably in the 32-40k range on that same target

9219019
zypper	yum
most linux distros i think but am not completely sure maintain these sort of dependency lists for yum or zypper or apt or whatever the package manager is by hand and only one layer deep leaving it up to the package manager to traverse the graph

9219038
width	height
similarly if i wanted it to repeat-y it would make the 100px the width instead of the height

9219040
width	height
you can create a single full width element with the height and background color you desire

9219052
put	get
when all is said and done i get 69 and 12 put those together i get 6912 but didnt need a full 4 digit adder to get there

9219052
subtract	add
the avr may have other ways to solve the problem but most processors at least have two forms of add and two forms of subtract so that you can cascade the adder to be as wide as you need

9219095
shim	polyfills
they state it has transparent support for binary data and has automatic fallback to the web-socket-js flash websocket shim polyfills if the browser does not support websockets natively

9219146
post	get
i know there are many post about this issue however i cannot find one single answer on here that describes exactly what i am trying to do and i have been searching for hours...so hopefully you all can help me and steer me in the right direction the main thing i cannot figure out how to do is get the source file and pass that to my update function where i will ftp that file to the remote server.

9219204
width	height
width 100 and height 100

9219209
width	height
need to set the width and height of the wrapper div also if the image is not in the same directory as the css the reference is wrong

9219226
inherited	subclassing
as for the updating as far as i can gather you would add extra overhead by doing all that separately from the raw data however it might not be avoidable in which case you might as well subclassing the bullets into various subclassing that implement the various differencies all of which inherited a common draw -function or override a getvertices -function and possibly a gettexvertices to allow for varying implementations there

9219227
disk	ram
of course when the source file is open it s content by the time of editing as wel as any user changes even not saved are loaded in the ram but it doesn t compare it to disk content that d be too slow it listens to a system event when the system tells it the file changed

9219230

filtering	grouping
on the main report i have a parameter to filtering by grouping and i have it set to filtering by grouping unless you choose all for the parameter then it shows all grouping

9219276
filtering	grouping
this filtering setup works fine on the individual sub reports however if i run it selecting all as part of the main grouping it causes the sheet to loop indefinitely and doesn t show the data properly

9219320
width	height
set the width and height of the wrapper as others have said and join those css styles in one declaration and you can get rid of all other styles once you set the dimensions of the container

9219335
hash	salt
that s most likely because the membership provider hash the password and salt it for saving and retrieving the hash is compared not the unhashed password

9219354
implements	extends
right now i m trying to use a jdbcpagingitemreader by extends abstractsqlpagingqueryprovider to implements my own query-based paging strategy but it s proving more difficult than anticipated

i figured how to post data but now i am not able to get the id of the report and the data is getting corrupted like below

9219530
client-side	server-side
look a bit into these technologies and make a little server-side script that gathers data from the database and send it in a structured format to the phone json xml then make a script in javascript on the client-side that parse these data and utilise them

9219535
getter	setter
as such it was fairly unclear how fluid or otherwise the resulting setter getter could be expected to be

9219819
button	checkbox
when i have the large icons checkbox unchecked the small button action2 are fine

9219820

i would suggest you hold the data in javascript so you only need to show the necessary options for each model without having to hide some

9219824
google-chrome	firefox
this is a new feature supported by google-chrome and firefox 4 chromium.org sts

9219838

superclass	subclassing
you ll get a menu of many kinds of related files among which will be the superclass and subclassing lists

9219969
pop-up	dialog
i want to set the dialog title to the value of the data-title attribute on the pop-up element and set modal based on the presence of the data-modal attribute

i am currently trying to connect pipes between a parent and its children

9219989
children	parent
the children are execing sort and are sorting input they receive from the parent

9220028
getter	setter
i thought that using property synthesize statements was equivalent to me creating the getter setter

9220028
getter	setter
i had always assumed that if i was using a property in this sense it was perfectly valid to use the getter setter with dot syntax in the form

9220065
floating-point	integer
for example if you compare an nsnumber object that has an integer value with an nsnumber object that has a floating point value the integer value is converted to a floating-point value for comparison

9220094
post	get
it s not clear to me from your code where the post action is getting from or what it is doing with it but you will need some way of passing this same this to your get action probably as a single string that is comma separated

9220100
for-loop	arrays
i m writing a pitch detection program in java and compare two doubles in each iteration of a for-loop in order to determine the highest magnitude point in a sample arrays

width	height
then if the ratio is say 150 you can change change the width and height of you fixed object using javascript and multiplying each by .66666

9220193
getter	setter
by using the getter and probably a setter too you will adhere to the information hiding promise whereas by using direct access to the member variables you won t

9220193
getter	setter
considering convention you would have to stick to setter and getter - no matter what names you give them though

9220221
int	boolean	int	chars
there is a deal code which shuffles the deck which is in base 36 and in a saved game i have two other data structures with boolean and small int - less than 36 - all will work as digits in base 36 or using just one case of letters and numerals and a few punctuation chars as separators in the mix

9220232
filtering	grouping
thus you filtering on ranking 1 to grab the first from each grouping

9220295
public	protected
i see that i can go into the designer.cs file to change the access modifiers from protected to public but it would be too much work if i have to update that file every time i make a change to the ascx file

9220458
hide	show
putting the javascript code as near the top of the document and not wrapping the code in a document.ready event handler allows you to minimize the flash of content that is common when trying to hide show content based on js

9220464
put	get
in the terminal i get what i want output i just want to use a variable and put the output into a variable

9220496
primes	modulus
if 1000000007 or whatever modulus is primes you can do divisions using the modular inverse

9220498
multiplying	division
then the result of the division can be found by multiplying the numerator n by the reciprocal 1 d to get n d

9220516
width	height
because absolutely positioned elements do not fill the box of the playarea div the height and width you assign each child div do not expand playarea s height and width

9220516
width	height
in this case giving playarea a width of 580px and height of 785px will position the p element correctly

9220541
viewdidload	viewwillappear	portrait	landscape
my app is fixed to landscape mode yet during viewdidload and even viewwillappear the following portrait dimensions still return

9220547
hash	salt
however dictionary attacks don t try to decrypt the password hash so salt or no salt it doesn t matter they will just try out many passwords until one works

9220557
hash	salt
if the attacker has the password hash and salt used by your site app they will simply brute force salt + password

9220557
hash	salt
however using a salt offers more protection against rainbow tables precalculated hash tables so they re still worth using

9220570
hash	salt
if a hacker has both the hash and salt used as well as knows the algorithm used to hash the password then it s simply a matter of time to crack it

9220570
hash	salt
which brings us to the primary reason why we hash salt things in the first place to buy time

9220581
addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	division	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction
ok so i am not that knowledgeable with math outside of basic addition subtraction multiplication and division i do not know much more then that

9220597
fontfamily	font-size
the bounding boxâ s height is based on font-size and fontfamily but is independent of the actual string

9220597
fontfamily	font-size
when we recreate the text in svg by generating it in php we can get the font-size correct and the fontfamily correct

9220617
hash	salt
calculation of hash on the fly are done pretty quick as with salt he will need to recalculate all and wont be able to use predefined lists

awt	swing
addendum see also painting in awt and swing opacity

9220735
innodb	myisam
based on this oracle blog article and attached whitepaper i assume that migrating from myisam to innodb may solve your problems

9220735
innodb	myisam
innodb delivered 4.6x higher throughput than myisam while achieving

9220735
innodb	myisam
you should probably benchmark your queries on both myisam engine and innodb make sure that you set up foreign key s correctly

9220770
int	double
you see the warning because log10 is defined for float double and long double but not int and it s being called with a int

9220770
for-loop	arrays
the for-loop is doing a linear search for the maximum of digits in any of the numbers in the arrays

9220791
int	double
as for the ambiguous call error you get it because you are calling log10 with an int argument which can be converted equally to float double and long double all types for which log10 is overloaded so the overload to choose is not clear to the compiler

9220808
gitolite	gitosis
first use gitolite instead of gitosis

9220808
gitolite	gitosis
add a repo to gitolite gitosis

ember.js	backbone.js
we re going to use backbone.js or ember.js but i have a concern

9220816
ember.js	backbone.js
in addition backbone.js or ember.js do not provide an event system publish or subscribe patterns..

put	get
google doesn t seem to agree with that and no matter what i put in the accept-encoding -header i always get the content back encoded in gzip

subtract	add
you could programatically retrive the current axis with plt.axis and then subtract add a small margin on and re-set it

9220959

google-chrome	firefox
in my opinion google-chrome firefox and ie s current behavior is a bug ndash

post	get
if you posted to get to the current page instead of a post then a response.redirect to get the current page when you hit the browser s refresh button it s going to re-post

9221070
qtkit	avfoundation
to do this it s easiest to use avfoundation frameworks instead of qtkit as editing manipulating the video is much easier imo though it seems to be a bit slower and the code may be less compact

9221072
dictionary	map
a dictionary hash map etc. would easily handle those requirements although your third requirement would be an o n operation

9221107
getter	setter
a possible downside is that this object is totally open such that if you invoke a nonexistent method on it it will just return nil if you invoke a setter it will create both the setter and getter

9221141
hash	salt
using a salt is to be recommended even if you use a slow hash method

9221188
post	get
get data from services on the server side using http get post or ajax calls

9221263
width	height
issue is that user may link to an image that is of extremely large height and width which is more than the height and width of the div it is in causing some overflow layout issues

9221269
width	height
basically itâ s a way to make elements inline but preserving their block capabilities such as setting width and height top and bottom margins and paddings etc

9221282
hide	show
if all of your data is known ahead of time you can put it all on the original page response then hide show the appropriate divs but it sounds to me like you want live data in which case you need to request the live data from the server

9221308
.htaccess	httpd.conf
this is in httpd.conf not .htaccess

9221342
qobject	qwidget
also would it be possible to create a plugin that inherits from the interface and a baseclass that inherits from qwidget that inherits from qobject

9221353
google-chrome	firefox
this submits on firefox but not on google-chrome

9221372
versioning	upgrade
if whoever bundled the app on the device does a proper job of it then the app will still have a market link even as a system app and market will prompt the user to upgrade it if a new versioning is available

9221385
mouseover	mouseout
what you need to do is set the css display property to block on mouseover and none on mouseout

9221404
hash	salt
if every password is hash with an individual salt you can t re-use information in the same way

9221430
stdout	stderr
opens a gnome-terminal executes folder script1 and directs stderr of the gnome-terminal command to stdout

9221430

when i try to put new shot in list of shots for the player i get nullreferenceexception

9221550
avr-gcc	winavr
after reading about how to set up an arm cross compiler i get the feeling that something like winavr avr-gcc was doing a lot of stuff like this for me behind the scenes so i wouldn t have to deal with it

9221590
chown	chmod
chmod to 755 and chown to regular user took care of the problem

9221606
pop-up	dialog
the problem is zonealarm and other firewalls will pop-up a dialog box asking the user to authorize a program requesting internet access

multiplying	multiplication
assign each 4 threadblock an nmatricies nblocks long chain of the matrices to multiplying with one of the four being responsible for each block of the multiplication

9221625
rspec	minitest
i recently switched an application from rspec to minitest it was well worth it

9221625
capybara	minitest
the improvement extends to integration acceptance testing i find minitest with capybara much more readable straightforward than cucumber much less brittle

9221646
for-loop	loops
you can shed the do while loops in favour of one for-loop

9221668
google-chrome	firefox
lets assume you are using a browser like ie firefox or google-chrome and that we aren t talking about using network functions from the arduino

9221693
hide	show
and script using show and hide instead of changing the visibility style

9221747
for-loop	loops
there are several great suggestions for refactoring the code to remove the duplication of effort here but to get the program functioning immediately you ve got to break out of the for-loop surrounding loops

9221749
setcontentview	findviewbyid
assuming you use findviewbyid to initialize button you would need to do that every time that you do setcontentview r.layout.view1

9221750
pull	push
a regular spring would apply both tension and compression forces pull and push depending on the deflection

9221778
disk	ram
another difference unlike ec2 auto-scaling scalr allows you to scale based on cpu ram disk network users.

9221804
nstableview	nssegmentedcontrol
so either you wired things up the wrong way or you have a severe memory management problem where the nssegmentedcontrol is deallocated and an nstableview is currently to be found at its memory location

9221819
folder	directory
i ve tried uninstalling and reinstalling socket.io i ve tried moving the project folder to different directory locations i ve tried moving the socket.io to an external folder and a few others that i can t seem to remember atm

onresume	onpause
be a good citizen though and unbind the service on onpause and rebind in onresume so that the service can be killed if needed

9221924

9227531
exponent	modulo
from a mathematical point of view the answer is otoh yes presuming you use an internal representation of the private key that only contains the modulo n and the exponent d and the other exponent e is generated randomly

9227531
exponent	modulo
the private exponent d will on the other hand be almost as large as the modulo so the private key data will be almost twice the size of the public key data

9227550
hash	md5
in php there is md5 to get a md5 hash of string passed to it

one way to do something like this is to have a layout that contains the row of buttons you want to show or hide

9227792
hide	show
you can then use an onclicklistener to set the button clicks to show or hide the layout

9227795
daemons	systemd
this is fine when it comes to human interaction with the systemd as the human can enter the passphrase to unlock the private key and then decrypt the data however when it comes to automated services which need to access the data to process transactions at a later date there is an issue with how best to provide the credentials to the service daemons process

9227795
daemons	systemd
the daemons process will be run as its own user and group on a linux systemd

9227869
entities	entitymanager
for example in java and jpa you have the entitymanager that you use for finding entities maybe do something on them etc

9228019
width	height
place image as background or set height width to 100 in css

9228022
screens	mdpi	screens	tablet	tablet	mdpi
for example an image that filled a screens on a phone-sized mdpi device with a screens resolution of say 480x320 wouldn t fill the screens on an mdpi tablet device with a screens resolution of 1280x800 without blowing the image up

9228022
put	get
one idea could be to put your images at the highest resolution you can get in the drawable-nodpi or assets folders

9228023
width	height
it s been caused by the fact that the image img sometimes was not completely loaded at the time the script asked for its width and height

9228161
getter	setter
first of all check your getter and setter in bookingbean.java

9228170
jar	war
it s a good option for when you have a jar library that doesn t change often but you update the war frequently

9228170
jar	war
and obviously you could have a mix so maybe the jar is standalone but you have a multi-module project that contains the two war files

9228186
touchesmoved	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchesmoved
i ve done something like this myself and i think you should do it exactly as you said simply track each move with the touchesbegan and touchesmoved and touchesended and use the cgrectintersect with your uiimageviews or coordinates however you want to do it

9228517
children	parent
after all these operations end other children of a parent node are never shown in the tree

9228525
for-loop	loops
i know i could use unique function to find the whole distinct users and after to run the for-loop through all the rows check if equal and then sum up but the problem is that i have more than 8mln rows and to run double loops it would be too expensive

9228538
hide	show
if the user selects another cell hide the currently selected cell and show a new cell below the newly selected cell

assuming your module is open source indicate that license in a commented header and publish that license in the maven pom.xml

9228826
setcontentview	findviewbyid
calling findviewbyid on the activity object will only work if the current activity layout is set by setcontentview

9228835

9229397
uitapgesturerecognizer	uigesturerecognizer
your code suggests that you are using a uigesturerecognizer most likely a uitapgesturerecognizer to detect the initial tap

9229397
uigesturerecognizer	uibutton
the problem is that uigesturerecognizer is being greedy and stopping the uibutton from receiving the touch

9229412
client-side	server-side
just program the necessary logic on server-side and client-side

9229423

collections list set collection bag could be set to empty collection so that you dont have to check for null as the underlying nature of hibernate does not distinguish between a null collection association and an empty one

9229925
post	put	post	get	put	get
rest uses a uniform set of standard verbs put post get delete quite unlike soap

9230032
folder	directory
i plan on having a directory of sounds for each instrument in my assets folder piano1 c4.mp3 piano1 d4.mpg ...

as a work around you can annotate the superclass with the xmlseealso annotation that provides jaxb a reference to the subclassing

9230069

other than testing the app in portrait mode then close it to test it in landscape mode

9230853
std	ostream
assuming that we re talking about overloading operator for all classes derived from std ostream to handle the matrix class and not overloading for matrix class it makes more sense to declare the overload function outside the math namespace in the header

9230863
stdout	stderr
we ve got an old web ui wherein part of it polls an appliance via ajax to get the results of long-running commands so the progress and stdout stderr of the commands can be displayed to the user

popupwindow	pop-up
once a user presses a menubutton it pop-up a popupwindow containing a textview edittext and two buttons ok and cancel

9230903
uiview	subviews
another potential solution is to have a look at some of the uiview methods for adding removing or exchanging subviews

9230917
hide	show
i believe you want to show hide these options based on the vegetarian option selection

9230918
ironruby	ironpython
the good news is that the code of ironpython ironruby and the dlr is open source and has recently been re-licensed under the apache2 license

9230937
hide	show
if you want to hide the navigation bar in the home page you just need to hide show it from the code using

9230998
put	get
then you have to put eclipse s package-list which you get here in your working-directory

9231095
public	protected
there is no reason you can t add more parameters to the afterconstructionhook but since your reference to sender is already of type tmycomponent i don t see the point when you can access everything public or protected in tmycomponent sender from within your hook function and if you inherit locally known as a protected-access class you can access the protected stuff too

9231125
base-class	subclassing
in a subclassing of uiviewcontroller -- then make that the base-class of all of your view controllers

9231344
free	malloc
the only pointers you may ever pass to free are those obtained by malloc or those obtained from functions which are specified to return a pointer to memory as if obtained by malloc

9231344
free	malloc
strtok_r does not return a pointer to a string as if obtained by malloc so you may not call free on it

9231363
post	get
if the parameters are in the post or the get then you would use requestparam instead

9231410
int	double
currently that means i have two versions one for double and one for int

9231410
strtol	atoi	strtol	strtod	strtol	atof	atof	strtod	atoi	strtod	atoi	atof
it is common to see this in the standard libraries but they are not consistent enough to use a guideline atof atol and atoi is one set and strtod strtol strtoul is a different set and abs labs is a third

9231446
hash	salt
thereafter you ll save the hash and salt in your database something like

9231446
hash	salt
the attacker will also have access to your database so he has all the password hash and the salt

9231446
hash	salt
even if your users enter weak passwords the salt makes sure that the resultant hash are not googlable

9231540
qpainter	qimage
for this i ll need to edit the qimage using two instances of qpainter and both might be working on the image simultaneously

9231591
abstract-class	superclass	superclass	subclassing
i m implementing a jpa-like process all classes representing a table must subclassing a dbtable abstract-class which contains a hashmap linking column names string to java.lang.reflect.field i got from calling getclass .getdeclaredfields in the superclass constructor called from the subclassing constructor

9231591
superclass	subclassing	implements	modifiers
i want to dynamically set these members of the subclassing from a resultset which would call the field.set this resultset.getxxx column in a method originally implements in the superclass as a helper but i get a java.lang.illegalaccessexception class dbtable can not access a member of class mytable with modifiers protected

9231591
abstract-class	superclass
so it turns out the method is executed in the superclass context the abstract-class

9231593
int	double
i suspect that given this question needs to be asked you only have a requirement for a double and an int your two functions

9231707
width	margin
when i switch to landscapetoleft the width of navigation bar is stretched and it is fine.however the position of items bar on it stay the same...their positions are not changed at all.therefore there are huge room from the rightmost button to a right margin

9231789
google-chrome	firefox
this occured in latest google-chrome firefox and ie7 8

9231797
mamp	wamp
try installing a web server like xampp or wamp for windows or mamp for mac

9231798
floating-point	integer
as a general rule i would provide at most one floating-point and one integer version unless it s really performance-critical to get the benefit of working on smaller types

9231834
inherited	properties
by using for..in you are looping through all of the array object s properties including inherited ones through the prototype model

9231841

9231905
daemons	launchd
launchd agent from daemons in user context

9232090
public	protected
you only need to change the protected virtual expression visit expression exp method to public

9232103
rpm	yum
in the rpm spec file the requires section should list the package names that are shown in the yum repo not the rpm filenames

9232180

we iterate through the int array and use the numbers as indices in the boolean array

9232189
vim	emacs
i ve been an emacs user for about 4 years and vim user for about 6 months maybe more like 15 if you count all the times i ve tried to learn it and hated it

9232189
vim	emacs
if i don t like some small thing because of git diff in the shell i don t use emacs vc features very often although when i do i love them i open it with vim and get the hell out faster than i could hit alt-tab

9232189
vim	emacs
the fact that emacs editing commands are more readily available while typing make typing much faster than it is in vim

9232189
vim	emacs
that means things like org mode which i use for everything todo lists bug tracking notes long emails documentation... make more sense to me in emacs than they would in vim

9232198
apache	nginx
writing your own server may be a nice learning experience but i am not sure you d be able to make it nearly as performant as nginx or apache

subclass	abstract-class
itemizedoverlay is an abstract-class so you need to create your own subclass of it

9232300
adplus	procdump	debugdiag	debugging
i am not very familiar with debugdiag but tools such as adplus debugging tools for windows and procdump will both let you create dumps for this

9232314
int	double
just don t convert t2 and t1 to some other type int or double before doing the subtraction

9232314
subtraction	modulo
well modulo 2 32 the result of subtraction wraps around too

9232355
getter	setter
i haven t debugged it but i bet eventually calls defaultmbeanserverinterceptor.registerobject which creates a dynamicmbean for you and properly registers your standard javabean properties setter and getter

9232369
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
unfortunately i am seeing an issue in safari that doesn t appear in firefox or google-chrome

9232595
int	double	int	chars
simple types bool byte chars short int long float and double

9232602
keystore	jks
what would make sense would be to build a new keystore jks that you would use as a truststore using the ca certificates not sure if you ve been provided with them

9232602
keystore	jks
that s why it might be better to create a separate truststore keystore jks might be easier for the ca certificates

9232604
comparator	icomparer
since my implementation of priority queue has an icomparer field i think it is sufficient to add a comparator property to edit this field like as follows

9232622
sorting	grouping
there is another way by using jobconf but that again does not seem to work in terms of setting mappers reducers partitions sorting and grouping classes

9232627
move	drag
when you grab the left side of the browser window and drag it to shrink the window to 1000px or less the cutouts in the canvas move to the right and reveal the wrong part of the background image

i have a sharepoint 2007 site the exposes rss feed to a static html page

9232738
webclient	httpwebrequest
i searched around and found different codes in which you can inherit the webclient from httpwebrequest and set the timeout for example

9232766
html5lib	beautifulsoup
i was finally able to resolve this issue through parsing the html through html5lib before handing it off the beautifulsoup 4

9232867
post	get
once i get these templates created i ll post them somewhere findable so others in this situation can same some time

9232881
post	get
when twilio makes the request you should be able to get the variables out of the post request like any post request

9232910
post	get
as mentioned in this post there are lots of things you can t even get a notice for losing power internet connection etc

9232946
unsigned	short
thus if you have an unsigned c type that goes from 0 to 255 the smallest java type that can represent the upper half of that range is a short

9232953
folder	directory
if not go into the hudson home jobs directory and open the config.xml found under the folder named after the job and remove the reference to the plugin

9232957
magento	oscommerce
i ve been developing e-commerce sites for a long time starting with yahoo oscommerce zencart and then moving on to magento several years ago

9232983
dictionary	map
you could have a dictionary that is a map from your keys to filenames and then each file has the 1000x1000 array in it

9232992
children	parent
when a parent is selected their children show up in a new dropdown

9233036
observer-pattern	mediator
in the original book that coined the terms observer and mediator design patterns elements of reusable object-oriented software it says that the mediator pattern can be implemented by using observer-pattern

9233036
observer-pattern	mediator
however it can also be implemented by having colleagues which are roughly equivalent to the subjects of observer-pattern have a reference to either a mediator class or a mediator interface

9233036
observer-pattern	mediator
or if mediator is implemented using observer-pattern the button would say hey observers which would include the mediator my state changed someone clicked me

9233036
observer-pattern	mediator
in my example that probably makes less sense then directly referencing the mediator but in many cases using observer-pattern to implement mediator would make sense and the difference between observer and mediator would be more one of intent than a difference in the code itself

9233083
actionscript	haxe
there is a library for haxe which makes it possible to compile actionscript assembly language into abc at runtime but this is still lower-level than the actionscript you normally write

9233083
actionscript	haxe
actually there is a runtime library for executing haxe code which again is very similar to actionscript

9233098
post	get
when i try to assign the data sent with the post method to an object i get the following error

9233154
bmp	png
however silverlight s image control doesnt support displaying bmp s so i need to convert the bmp byte to png or jpg byte

9233198
hash	salt
edit i should note that this technique transfers the responsibility of security to the server - you ll want to use salt hash for password comparison on the server an idea you ll see in some of the other comments for this question

9233198
hash	salt
this prevents the plaintext password from appearing anywhere except the edittext view on the device the ssl communication to the server and the server s ram while it salt and hash the password

9233207
verilog	vhdl
the synopsis is that synthesis transforms high level verilog vhdl constructs which don t have real physical hardware that can be wired up to do your logic into low level logical constructs which can be literally modeled in the form of transistor logic or look-up tables or other fpga or asic hardware components

9233256
prepare	execute
i ve extended the pdo class to create a simple db class and currently use prepare + execute for all queries run to the database even the ones that do not have parameters select from table

9233259
width	height
i have a 2.1 avd with the default values so the screen is smaller and this works exactly as expected- the image is scaled up to fill the width and the view height is wrapped to the scaled height

9233259
width	height
on my droid bionic with a longer screen and on any avd with the same screen dimensions this doesn t work- the image is scaled to fill the width but the view is wrapped to the original pre-scale image height so the top and bottom are cropped off

9233268
ord	chr
use chr and ord

9233278
range	max
i believe the range i would like to filter is a floiting point with max 6 digits

9233294
google-chrome	safari
the first thing would be to open the console in google-chrome or safari and check the javascript console to determine if it is a javascript error

9233303
prepare	execute
yes because when you call pdo prepare the server must create a query plan and meta information for that query then there is additional overhead to bind the specified parameters when you use pdo execute

9233305
width	height
iâ ve tried jquery bigtext and jtextfill but they both seem to depend on a fixed width height

9233305
width	height
as each database query returns various number of rows columns i canâ t set a fixed width height as it would not maximize the screen with a small table result

9233317
apache	nginx
node.js isn t running on neither its own nor apache nginx it doesn t need a webserver to run at all imagine a node.js script that copies files for example

9233317
ssl	https	apache	nginx
and sure you can if you have written a webserver in node.js put it behind apache nginx to let them serve static files for example or to use https since ssl support for node.js isn t very stable yet compared to apache nginx

9233334
unsigned	short
this seems to work with word being unsigned short

9233339
mouse	keyboard
set it to false and excel will block all keyboard and mouse input except for any dialog boxes you display

9233352
internationalization	translation
the first big step is internationalization aka i18n implement the structure that will allow to translation your website and present it to user in different cultures

9233352
internationalization	localization
internationalization is a bit like climbing the mountain in front of your village and localization is getting down from the top of the mountain to the villages in the different other valleys climbing up the mountain is not an easy task but it s the shortest path to travel to the surrounding valleys

9233368
apache	nginx

windows	wow64
it s called x86-32 emulation or wow64 on windows presumably something else on other oses and it s a hardware flag in the processor

9233406
post	put
put another way if you had 100 urls you could post that array probably as json as well to mysite.tld huntergatherer - it does whatever it wants in whatever language you want and just returns json

9233412
content-length	content-type
you can configure apache to only return the minimum set of headers which would basically be content-type text plain or another shorter mime type possibly custom mimetype content-type a b and content-length 0 thus not returning a response body at all

9233430
junit	testng
you can use parametrized test with junit or testng or write a simple wrapper java application

9233442
for-loop	loops
in general though a foreach loops only directly touches the source expression once when it fetches the iterator - whereas a for-loop has no magic in it and how often it s accessed simply depends on the code - both the condition and the step part of the for-loop are executed on each iteration so if you refer to the variable in either of those parts you ll see any changes.

9233445
inherited	properties
or if #testobject2 is a children of the #testobject1 element and it inherited the properties declared in that css piece

9233462
verilog	hdl
verilog is both a scripting language and a hdl hardware description language

9233462
verilog	hdl
almost all of that is irrelevant when you are restricted to the synthesizable subset of verilog which can be used as an hdl

9233462
verilog	hdl
having done so would demonstrate that you understand how to use verilog as an hdl

9233476

9234078
superclass	subclassing
in your subclassing you dealloc the instance methods the subclassing allocated but then the superclass needs to do the same so you have to explicitly call it

9234123
octal	decimal
standard c only has decimal no prefix octal 0 prefix and hexadecimal 0x or 0x prefix constants

9234172
octal	hex
from what i understand octal was more popular than hex among users of 18-bit architectures since a word would be exactly 6 octal digits

children	parent
i would like to select all parent who have children where

9234186
hex	binary
it is easy to convert binary into hex

9234192
inherited	subclassing
the point is that you are creating subclassing by inheriting them in your case this seems to be a custom viewcontroller myviewcontroller which inherited data and methods from uiviewcontroller

9234202
ssl	https
for https there will be a small overhead for the ssl tls channel itself but the bulk of it will be taken by the handshake in particular the server certificate assuming you re not using client-cert authentication should be the biggest

9234205
serializable	deserialization
the user data will be duplicated on serializable deserialization

9234244
public	protected
besides of ide tricks a real warrior s way would be using assembly.load to load application dll into the memory and then using reflection search through all the types for public private protected static fields

9234297
jtree	jtable
i did not yet look at how a jtable handles the filtering with rowfilter s and perhaps the same can be done on a modified version of a jtree

9234359
rss	feed
facebook s feed are available in rss natively .

as i said when i ll place open dialog below the dialog div outside of accordion div the pop-up comes up normal but once i put the button there pop-up doesn t come out

9234982
crypt	salt
i believe that crypt is supposed to return the salt value prepended to the front of the return value

9235029
int	chars
its not valid to call printf expecting a chars and giving it an int

9235056
int	double
it logically represents a single value similar to primitive types int double and so on

9235059
children	parent
current children are un-bound removal of foreign key to parent entity

translation services aren t a replacement for localization

9235119
post	put	post	get	put	get
he argues that good ol xhtml is actually perfect for this since tools for parsing it xpath are readily available it supports forms think get link templating and put post and delete methods and has a well-understood way of identifying hyperlinks plus some other advantages mainly achieved through the ability to use the api with any standard web browser eases the jobs for devs qa and support staff.

9235283
portrait	landscape
besides the fact the monogame runs the game in portrait instead of landscape i have noticed that the movement of the player sprite behaves really different

9235291
vmware	virtualbox
instead get a virtualization software like vmware virtual pc or virtualbox and run your application stack in the virtual environment

similary to css transform jagged edges in google-chrome same occurs with firefox on 3d transforms eg - remember firefox

width	margin
might want to try adding absolute positioning on the canvas wrapper with left 50 and a negative margin at half the width 675 2

9235413
width	height
i suspect that the image may not be ready in the dom when jquery attempts to measure its height and width

9235442
implements	extends
if you think on classes and you understand your model as abstractaction fooaction and baraction it is probably because you can have the same methods implements in a different way on the subclasses or extends some parent method

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome firefox safari but when it comes to ie there is a strange behavior

9235453
width	height
invisible elements return a width and height of 0

9235454
width	height
you can bind a load event handler to the element before adding it to the dom to get the width height once it s available

9235454
width	height
you can also explicitely set the width height of the image using css or inline attributes

9235470
wan	lan
so things you can usually get away with on a lan will lead to more errors on a wan

9235493
width	height
i am wondering if there is a maximum pixel width or height to html documents or if browsers start to have difficulty with the dom at certain lengths

9235493
width	height
are there limits to the pixel height or width of documents

9235497
width	height
try logging the image s width and height once the image has loaded

9235553
width	height
it would be new to me that there is a limitation for maximum width or height of a webpage

9235579
nstablecellview	nsoutlineview	nstextfield	nstableview
there you can determine whether the nstablecellview instance containing your nstextfield instances is currently selected by using this code which i use with a nsoutlineview but it should also work with nstableview

9235582
ethernet	wireless
i m getting a wierd problem when the internet connections are changed from wireless to ethernet cable and viceversa as per the users it is occuring rarely 3 out of 10 times but we cannot avoid it

9235592
udp	tcp
now if we use tcp instead of udp

9235592
udp	mtu
again many memcpy s will be needed to assemble the packet which shouldnt be larger than 65535 and then it would be fragmented by the kernel to send it in packets of size of the mtu not much difference as with udp here

9235592
udp	tcp
for this particular application sending simple data chunk to the client from an index given by the client tcp will not perform any better than udp

9235592
udp	tcp
+ consider that the implementation of tcp stack is much more complicated than udp more instructions are executed there

9235592
udp	mtu
the whole point for making the protocol to run faster is to assembly udp packets as large to the mtu as possible

9235593
accessor	properties
while the synthezised properties would the be used via self.foo which would then utilize a call to one of the synthesized accessor methods

9235619
jwindow	jdialog
top-level windows jframe jdialog jwindow are not added to containers

9235634
ready	each
don t know how your combine process works either but if it could be organised so say once queries 1 3 are ready you could do an intermediate process or if it s in some logical order once all the queries are ready to read could you start reading into to simple classes and then throw each one at a combine task..

9235660
getter	setter
another interesting fact of objective-c is that using dot syntax to access variables in this way is really just a handy way of calling setter and getter methods to access them

9235674
rss	feed
you use this frontend when you have static data that could change from time to time that has no relation to the current user that is it is the same for all users like an rss feed or dynamically created javascript file for example

9235674
post	get
with it you can cache content not only based on the request uri but also based on information in a cookie session get or post parameters

9235674
post	get
by default caching based on cookie session get and post is disabled so for this to have any effect on a user logged into your site you have to tell the cache if there are any pages you want to cache based on that information

9235674
post	get
use the page frontend if you want to cache pages with dynamic output based not only on request uri but the cookies session data or get post parameters

9235675
opera	safari
failed in many other browsers like opera safari

9235740
pop-up	dialog

i am looking for a way jquery plugin perhaps to create a grid of variable height fixed width divs

9235772
oncreate	ondestroy
anytime i released the mediarecorder and then pressed the back button the app would close and restart--onpause onstop ondestroy wouldn t fire in the activity i was leaving it would just be dead and then oncreate would fire in the application

9235782
free	malloc
memory allocated with malloc should be deallocated with free

9235822
width	height
when you move the message box in your code above you are telling it to appear at desktop coordinates equal to half the width and height of your main application window size offset from origin the top left corner of you desktop

9235857
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in google-chrome and ie but in firefox the border-color gets set to the same value as the forecolor

9235913
superclass	subclassing
nsdictionary is a class cluster so you re just asking the abstract superclass whereas private methods may only exist on concrete subclassing

9235968
rss	feed
i haven t worked with the sharepoint rss feed much so i have no idea if there s a simpler way to get replace the page name with the title

9235978
udp	tcp
good for both udp and tcp

9235978
udp	tcp
for tcp sending an object with a write send will not generate a packet necessarily most likely it will wait until you fill up the mss and then dispatch several objects remember that it is a stream and it has no packet boundaries as udp has

9236000
width	height
moreover changing height and width of the span by height 500px

9236000
width	height
in order to be height and width to be effective change the span to div

9236027
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uisegmentedcontrol	uitabbarcontroller
i decided since i need everything nested in a uinavigationcontroller stack that the best way to achieve this 3 separate projects into one kind of thing i would create something similar to the uitabbarcontroller in which you have 1 uiviewcontroller class which stores and nests other uiviewcontroller -- however i want to use a custom uitoolbar with a uisegmentedcontrol to delegate between the different view controllers

9236030
expressionengine	multisite
expressionengine is a great option because it has a multisite features

9236032

9236075
google-chrome	safari
in ffx google-chrome and safari i get no issues

9236153
pop-up	dialog
in portrait orientation and on a phone i d like the search criteria fragment to be displayed like a pop-up dialog instead of beside the search results

9236153
portrait	landscape
what i noticed was that in landscape orientation the embedded view was actually keeping old versions of the view around and these would be overlaid with newer copies of the view each time i switched to portrait and back again

9236157
floating-point	fixed-point	floating-point	integer
but another added benefit of this approach is that it could make your program run faster since fixed-point integer arithmetic is much faster than floating-point arithmetic

9236223
int	chars
you should not cast int to chars

9236239
int	chars
turns out that even if i have a specific code for an extension remove this chars and i explicitly although there should be no reason for this specify the parameter s type it ignores my extension and tries to call the original remove int method

9236252
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in latest versions of google-chrome and firefox and maybe safari as well is natively supported as a synonym for document.getelementbyid

9236263
int	chars
it s applicable due to the implicit conversion from chars to int

9236311
division	multiplication
notice that it does not do any division only additions not even multiplication and not that it matters with so small numbers but it might with bigger ones

9236314
hide	show
the top box should hide its scroll bar the bottom should show a scroll bar and when the user scrolls i d like the offset of the top box to change to the value of the bottom box

9236339
int	chars
you didn t cast to a chars from a int when you wrote to the file as you did with the screen display

9236346
put	get
this implementation provides constant-time performance for the basic operations get and put assuming the hash function disperses the elements properly among the buckets

9236397
width	height
height 0 the height of the div will always be half of its width

9236400
post	get
i have seen post on stackoverflow that indicate it s no big thing to get fiddler to see your indy traffic that you just have to configure the port to make it work

9236414
public	protected
it is because you dont have public protected internal on your enum it takes the default value which is internal for classes and enums

9236434
maven	m2e
i see no such analog in maven m2e

9236500
post	get
when i run this i get a 404 not found error with the method showing as options as opposed to post or get

9236542
innodb	myisam
i considered changing them to innodb to make the database 100 the same but then read the myisam is faster

9236553
for-loop	loops
you re entering the for-loop several times but can only enter the while loops on the first pass through the for-loop

9236553
for-loop	loops
the first time through the for-loop you enter a while loops

9236553
for-loop	loops
every subsequent time through the for-loop it.hasnext is false so the while loops does nothing

9236607
repo	egit
today i notice that atlassian has a nice free gui shell called sourcetree and i am wondering if there are any issues if my local git repo is being accessed from both egit and sourcetree at the same time

9236611

the width 340 and height 420 will be the display area of google s home page

9236615
folder	directory
i think made a 755 directory on my server called git and then uploaded the bare git repo in this case its a folder called test.git to this directory

9236622
readdirectorychangesw	filesystemwatcher
i am aware of findfirstchangenotification readdirectorychangesw and the filesystemwatcher however i think these are only able to detect file creation and changes

9236625
width	height
here goes...i have an image and decide that of the height and width it s the width that needs to be reset to fullscreen width

9236625
width	height
i want to maintain the aspect ratio so in doing the width resize the height of the image becomes greater than the height of the screen

9236625
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in firefox and ie but in google-chrome i end up with a band across the bottom

9236625

9236722
super	self
if so then just call the super smtphandler self .emit record method

9236753
put	get
here is how things with list comprehensions will get solved easily for you here i am simply generating a list of x y 2-tuples but for your use case you will have to put real logic here including your star case

9236772
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox 10 you can make the current page go fullscreen real fullscreen with no window google-chrome using this javascript

9236782
json.net	jsonfx
i have used json.net extensively in the past and came to prefer jsonfx over it a few months ago

9236796
client-side	server-side
this solution is obviously more tailored for client-side rendering but using partials for your server-side mustache templates could also allow you to use both slim and mustache

9236839
backbone.js	javascriptmvc
it s part of javascriptmvc but no reason why you can t use it with backbone.js

9236855
bindparam	pdostatement
take a look at the examples of the pdostatement bindparam method

9236862
nsurlconnection	nsoperationqueue
if you want to update a web service then perform tasks in sequence you could create a new class that used nsurlconnection to perform the update then when the nsurlconnection finishes you could start an nsoperationqueue

9236877
hid	keyboard
you might be able to read the raw hid events coming from each keyboard using the usb hid manager but i m not sure that will work it seems like a big security hole if ordinary apps could read raw keyboard events sniff passwords etc.

9236880
pipe	file-descriptor
in order to avoid blocking on the read to the stream created from pipe you can get the file-descriptor associated with the stream using fileno and then use poll or select with a timeout value

9236886
ubuntu	linux

setinterval	settimeout
since the canvas element is filled from javascript you can use the settimeout or setinterval functions see here for more help with javascript timers

9237069
spine.js	backbone.js
from what i can see you still have to duplicate a lot of the logic when using backbone.js or spine.js in rails

9237075
post	get
the funny part is that i get a right amount of post i get the excerpts right for each post but id and title are empty plus the date is wrong 1.1.1970

implement the hmac algorithm on top of the md5 hash you re already using it doesn t look too hard - i ve pasted the pseudocode below

9237227
hash	hmac	hash	md5	hmac	md5
don t bother with hmac - just generate the hash at both ends using a regular md5 by concatenating the message and the key - that should be pretty secure it s what most people do

9237235
uilabel	uibutton	hide	show
i am trying to show and hide three controls like uibutton uilabel etc

9237578
fast-forward	merge
strictly speaking the merge into master is guaranteed to be a fast-forward a trivial merge so it doesn t actually need a work tree but there s not really a built-in way skip the checkout

9237578
fast-forward	merge
also note that if you didn t want to rebase the feature branch you could just skip that not rewrite feature_branch and end up with a merge commit in master instead of the rebased feature_branch and fast-forward merge

subsequent edit added a timeout to hide after only a mouseover on the show login element plus some other updates.

9238060
mouseout	mouseenter
while i still think using mouseenter and mouseout to handle a login form is not the right way to go from a usability perspective below is code that demonstrates what jim jeffers is describing and attempts to handle some of the pitfalls of the approach

9238060
mouseout	mouseenter
i handle this by having them logindisplay on mouseenter event it will work on mouseout but it makes more logical sense on mouseenter

9238080
erd	diagram
i created erd database diagram in jdeveloper just for getting it s schema in sql

9238110

uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
you need to use uitabbarcontroller with array of uinavigationcontroller depending on the complexity of your usecasse

9238224
put	get
to put it another way the basics behind idempotency is that the get operation doesn t affect the results of the operation

9238242
put	get
2 if i put in this url i also get the expected

9238262
public	protected
one thing you could try with the app store submission is to add a password protected account login to the app to make it look more like a private client app than something that markets products to the general public

9238265
width	height
checking in firebug i found that content of child-panel is there but as its width height is not set so its invisible

inspired by jmock easymock and hamcrest and designed with c++ s

9238560
document.write	settimeout
the reason it does not work is that once document.write is called the first time it overwrites your existing code of settimeout and since there is no code so it will not work

9238560
setinterval	settimeout
instead of using setinterval use settimeout

9238571
min	max
you didn t mention to sum up the values in field3 or max min or etc

9238576
stdio	fflush
now in this condition only debug-point1 will be print on stdio debug-point 2 print was written to stdio buffer but its not fflush because it didnt get n so we thinks that crash occur after debug-point1

google-chrome	firefox
i know the server needs to support jsonp and i don t think it does but when i change datatype to jsonp i can see the response page resources show up in both google-chrome and firefox -- so the server actually sends the response to the browser a static html webpage + some java script -- which contains the data i want to get at

9239018

x86	64bit
the anycpu setting will cause the assembly to jit ed to x86 on 32 bit platforms and x64 on 64bit platforms

9239301
x86	64bit
as for your example setting active solution platform to x64 project platform to x86 and project target to x64 would mean that when selecting that solution configuration the project assembly would be built to jit only to 64bit causing an error if you tried to run it on a 32 bit platform

9239570
hide	show
eg if three columns in repeater control and if it is null then hide and if notnull show that field.

9239584

a good approach would be to create a user object getter and setter left out

9239589
integer	unsigned
the typedef name uint_fastn_t designates the fastest unsigned integer

9239589
unsigned	short
for example on a 32-bit machine uint_fast16_t could be defined as an unsigned int rather than as an unsigned short because working with types of machine word size would be more efficent

9239593
fgets	getline
you should be using formatted input functions like getline if you your implementation has that scanf or fgets

salt	md5	hash	salt	hash	md5
i d recommend at least saving the password as a hash so use something like md5 and i d use a salt key too so something like md5 password. salt - the salt can be a timestamp of when the user signed up a random string of letters numbers which i d recommend - and save this as well in the database

9240508
salt	md5
when the user signs in sanitize the data check username exists and grab the salt key of that matching entry then md5 the incoming password with the salt key and see if the strings match

hash	md5
also about the md5 hash thing - no even if it s in private scope you can still view and modify it in a javascript debugger

9240763
width	height
to make it work i thought to use an array of objects with the width and height of a background-image of every element i bring to it

9240763
width	height
to do this i ve created an empty img element set the src attribute to the background image and once it s loaded getting width and height

on debian-based systems and this includes ubuntu linux mint and aptosid sidux at least besides the options of installing rhino and others already mentioned you have have other options

9245612
versioning	upgrade
edit this approach has another benefit - if you end up writing multiple primitive layers for different apis you may be able to let the user pick between them you may have a more expensive higher-quality map layer which you charge for and a cheap free one which you don t - allowing people free access to a lower-quality versioning and letting them buy an upgrade to the better maps

9245623
winpcap	pcap.net
well this may be an overkill and i m sure there are much better opinions but just to get some of the job done you may look at winpcap and it s perfect .net wrapper pcap.net

i am inclined to use post call because telerik grid requires some data in json format and json doesn t work well with get

9245628

9246022

9246028
int	boolean	int	chars
i think the rule of thumb is that primitive types like int chars boolean and maybe string are copied but objects just have their reference passed

9246060
for-loop	arrays
edit also you should use memset instead of a for-loop to zero an arrays

9246072

i am running it under linux ubuntu 11.10 python 2.7.2+ python-pygame 1.9.1release-0ubuntu4

9246109
ienumerable	iqueryable	filtering	grouping
since not all method calls can be mapped to database queries it is sometimes unavoidable to use an ienumerable but all filtering joining and grouping should be done on an iqueryable if possible then as a last step you can use the asenumerable extension methods to switch to using ienumerable and linq to objects

9246131
hide	show
when i run the actual use case and select a file it doesn t hide it after one is selected but the hidden waiting div does show as it should

9246405
public	protected

in other words if a person belongs to several groups you can t avoid duplicates unless you pick which order_index to sort by using min max avg or sum

9252673
setinterval	settimeout
2 your function won t animate instead of you use a setinterval or a settimeout

ready	each	versioning	upgrade
in the majority of the commercial java world i believe the current dominant practice is you should upgrade when you are ready to. in other words as the developer you first need to realize that a new versioning of a library is available for each of your libraries

9252690
debian	linux
but other practices do exist for example within the debian linux distribution it is theoretically possible to delegate a lot of this work to the debian package maintainers

9252690
jar	manifest.mf
i thought paul grime s solution was pretty neat but i suspect it relies on projects pushing version info in the the jar s meta-inf manifest.mf file

9252695

9253454

to get the custom layout to put into the actionbar add this menu item into it

9253575
int	chars
eof is an int value outside the range of a chars since its very purpose is to indicate that no chars is present so if you want to be able to compare a value to eof then you need to retrieve and store that value as an int rather than as a chars

9253637
width	height
the image then forgets about the max height and width

9253698
accessor	properties
i read up on indexer accessor usage on properties but when it comes to handling them for xml i am coming at a loss

9253701
min	max
as can be seen i can t simply take the max and min to get the amplitude

9253725
getter	setter
as spring batch instantiates jobs will all internals from xml configuration that means all necessary beans have setter getter and you can create the job from empty page

9253742
division	modulo
you will have to do some math magic to get the nth digit of an arbitrary number basically using division and modulo 10 if you want it to be a number

9254183
.htaccess	httpd.conf

9254438
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
note that this may not be a complete solution i have only tried it with safari google-chrome and firefox yet but for the tested browsers it seems to work

9254509

when a user visits a secure web site by using https ssl reads a secure email s mime or downloads an activex control that is signed code signing and encounters a new root certificate the windows certificate chain verification software checks microsoft update for the root certificate

9254725
innodb	myisam
the above solution is for myisam for innodb the norm is to set a sceduled script this can be set as a cron job or a windows scheduled task if you dont have that kind of control over your web host you could possibly set up a small server at your work office and run the cron from there

9254729
getter	setter

you could always put the second one in an iframe and on your form submit communicate with the iframe to get the content but it is a less elegant solution

9255654
post	get
it turns out the calls to methods automatically always do redirect and my post is calling a render method copy from examples which i did not know does not do a redirect so it would keep the errors in flash for the next get which does not happen as the body is sent back in response to the post which is usually a bad thing and then on the next get my errors are the re and validation.haserrors gets those errors from flash causing the issue

9255654
post	get
so if you use render in your post you don t call validation.keep nor params.flash from what i understand or call another get method that you have

9255654
post	get
for some reason when i tried just changing render to redirect my stuff just threw some platform exception which seemed weird so i could not use redirect method for some reason as i would prefer to stay more rest compliant here where http post returns a 303 redirect to get the next page even if that page is itself with errors

what s happening in this case is that the wikipedia article contains one piece of code that handles a general case that handles preorder inorder and postorder traversals all in one

9256745
postorder	inorder	preorder	postorder	preorder	inorder
you can think of preorder inorder and postorder traversals all as special cases of a more general algorithm

specifically suppose that you want to do a tree traversal and perform some operation at a particular time during the search either preorder inorder or postorder

9256745
postorder	inorder	preorder	postorder	preorder	inorder
one way to think about this is that you do some preorder operation before visiting the current node some inorder operation between visiting the node s child and the node itself and some postorder operation after visiting the node

9256745
preorder	postorder
the advantage of the wikipedia code is that it lets you do operations that would require both a preorder and postorder step

9261731
getter	setter
using some automated testing like unitils is not really an option since the code-coverage should not go up if only getter setter are tested

9261731
getter	setter

for the first have a look to the null value of the defalutcellstyle do not put a text if you get a null value

9263146
onmousedown	onmouseup
you could use javascript functions for the divs to respond to onmousedown and onmouseup events to change the background style or alternately the class attribute of the div back and forth

9263146
onmousedown	onmouseup	onclick	onmouseup	onclick	onmousedown
the below code contains both solutions kat1 has onmousedown and onmouseup kat2 has onclick

9263146
width	height
and by the way since width height and float are common attributes to all categories they should need only one definition in the style

this example on the mdn explains very well how defineproperty works and makes dynamic getter and setter possible

9265685
getter	setter
technically this won t work on any dynamic query like you re looking for but if your valid getter and setter are defined by say an ajax call to a json-rpc server for instance then you could use this in the following way

9265692
width	height
you should be altering the uiscrollview s contentsize setting its height width instead

9265717
post	get
xmpp could use http in two ways polling 21 and binding. 22 the polling method now deprecated essentially implies messages stored on a server-side database are being fetched and posted regularly by an xmpp client by way of http get and post requests

the problem is that fadein fades the element in by animating the element s opacity from 0 up to its previous opacity so if you normally hide an element default opacity 1 fadein will fade it in from 0 to 1

9265908
fadein	hide
however if an animation was running before which brought the element to opacity 0.005 for example and you stop hide fadein then the element has opacity 0.005 when entering the animation and fadein will only bring its opacity from 0 up to 0.005 making it look invisible

9272574
for-loop	loops
in imperative programming many things like a for-loop a while loops an if statement don t have values they just do things

9272574
for-loop	loops
since a for-loop is intended to just do things even in ocaml the expression inside loops should have type unit

9272574
for-loop	loops
if you really need to use a for-loop for some reason you need to make your acc variable be a mutable value and you need to mutate change it in loops

9272630
integer	fractions
to get the fractions part by itself subtract the integer part from value

9272630
integer	fractions
when you have the fractions multiply by ten and get the that value as an integer which will be a single-digit integer

9272636
google-chrome	firefox
browser i am using is firefox 10 and google-chrome 17

9272696
width	height
if you are using em or percentage or none at all try px instead to set a specific pixel width and height and other dimensions such as padding margins etc. this is called using fixed dimensions and may solve the problem of things scaling incorrectly when you zoom

9272699
put	get
so i need to put it in itunes store after that only i will get lookup id

9272777
width	height
i checked this by pasting the image to a word document of a4 size ms word automatically scales down the image by 36 ms word takes only 64 of the original image dimension and sets the absolute height width

9272777
width	height
let me know how to automatically set an image height width to fit in a4 pdf file

9272830
versioning	upgrade
moreover with every latest versioning of the applications we upgrade these variables to retain user settings

9272880
nspanel	nsopenpanel
apparently apple s nsremoteopenpanel doesn t descend from nsopenpanel or nssavepanel or nspanel which is where the setfloatingpanel method gets defined

9272936
difftime	mktime
then convert the struct tm to a time_t with mktime and use difftime with the two time_t values

9272938
x86	mips
this is mainly only true for x86 because neither arm nor powerpc nor mips nor sparc implement their fpu as stack based machines

9272939
inherited	properties
private properties can t be inherited

9272956
gdi	direct2d

9273240
freebsd	linux
i needed to create a small remote desktop software in c that compiles on various platforms linux freebsd windows... i ve been looking into various image formats for a while but still couldn t come up with a good idea to use them right now here is what i do

9273241
width	height
first you check your window height or width size

9273295
jar	war
a war file is a jar with a special purpose and wikipedia tells us

9273309
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is the width is shrinked on firefox google-chrome

9273360
google-chrome	firefox
with google-chrome and firefox json outputs hi but ie it doesn t work at all

9273376
wsimport	jaxws-maven-plugin
it seems that this is not possible using technologies mentioned above wsdl xsd contract-first approach using maven jaxws-maven-plugin wsimport goal

9273385
width	height
i get original width and height from metadata object

9273398
getter	setter
create getter setter using dynamic methods or expression trees

9273398
getter	setter
cache those getter setter in a dictionary

9273398
getter	setter
have your method look to the dictionary and invoke the getter setter

9273405
width	height
in this case the highest element will define the size of your wrapping div thus defining the baseline 3 while on the other hand the modification of position and width stated in 2 can t be applied to such minimal spaced maximum height elements

9273410
git-rebase	amend
i believe the git-rebase will then automatically continue after the amend

9273410
pull	push
you should then be able to push this back to the central repo and others should get the changes with their next pull

9273445
width	height
when the files are loaded in the wrong order first js then css any javascript code relying on properties set in css files for example the width or height of a div won t be loaded correctly

9273447
int	double
keep your tostring int and overload with tostring double in this way

9273454
outputstream	inputstream
i m trying to send a large file inputstream file over an output stream outputstream out

9273523
versioning	upgrade

9273574
post	get
my apologies for not providing any code but i m stuck in the concept here - i ll post a working solution if i can get some hints on how to do this

9273623
ant	maven
ant maven even a reasonable use of make will provide this stuff for you

9273624
width	height
i am trying to send information about the user browser to a mysql database via ajax and this method that used to work perfectly on another site is now working partially meaning that the data about the screen and browser width height the color and pixel depth don t appear in my database and the information collected via php are sent saved

9273624
width	height	google-chrome	firefox
i checked that i wasn t blocking any script deactivated noscript i tried it on firefox and google-chrome and epiphany without any success no data about the screen and browser width height the color and pixel depth

9273673
uigesturerecognizer	uitouch
the difference is that you can write everything one of the defined uigesturerecognizer does in uitouch code but it will be complex and probably buggy so you have access to some of the most commonly used gestures for free

9273691
children	parent
the value is unique to the parent but all the children need to use it so that seems wasteful given that there will be a lot of other calculations going on

9273695
button	checkbox
i which the user is requested to input name and password and some checkbox and radio button

9273719
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine with google-chrome and firefox but this doesn t work in ie6 or ie7

9273730
hide	show
so each time an user answers a question a the view might call setvisabilityb in the presenter which handles whether to show or hide question b

9273730
hide	show
so far so good but the answer in question b show hide question c and when the user changes his hers opinion on question a the view have to call both setvisabilityb and setvisabilityc .

9273795
getter	setter
in the setter - not the getter - you need to call a propertychangedevent that notifies the ui to react to it

9273815
height	border-box
for some reason chrome applies border-box to it which causes your height 13px

9273818
libjpeg	libpng
you can use libpng libjpeg etc.

9273831
ember.js	sproutcore
i am wondering whether there is a straightforward mechanism like in sproutcore or ember.js where just a binding will do

9273877
uiview	subviews
generally speaking - uiview hittest withevent will look into its subviews recursively and might return itself or any of its subviews

9273905
updatepanel	scriptmanager
i only want that content to update so i ensure enablepartialrendering true in my scriptmanager and set updatemodel contitional on the updatepanel

9273919
folder	directory
it will create a minecraft folder in the same directory as your launcher

9273933
post	get
when i attempt to post a commentactivity i get a 405 response

9273949
org.json	gson
for encoding data in json yes gson is a good approach but i think that org.json would be more easy to use

9273962
vim	sublimetext
it s really valuable to have an ide or maybe vim config or sublimetext setup that allows to jump to symbol definitions really easily

9274013
tex	sweave
however having said that i have not actually seen an example where sweave outputs a dataframe as a tex file - all of the sweave examples i have seen so far seem contrived and not something that i can build upon

9274091
jtextpane	jeditorpane
i m not sure if the links below to articles about pagination and printing of the jeditorpane jtextpane will do the trick for you but surely they did a lot for me

9274126
post	get
if i want to get wall post made by my self i came up with the following fql query

9274219
width	height
it is equal to the width divided by the height

9274219
width	height
you can apply that factor to any new width or height you set the video to

9274219
width	height
another way to do it is to find out by which factor to scale the video then set scalex and scaley instead of width and height

9274219
width	height
to create a proportional subclass of any displayobject by overriding the setters for width height scalex and scaley to make all scaling proportional

9274267
prepare	execute
this interceptor is very useful for any situation where you need to ensure some logic runs before the actual execute method runs.so if you see this is some kind if init for your action class and it makes sure that before the action s execute or any other method get called this method prepare your execute method to work fine

9274350
jar	war
i have a war project depends on artifact axis2-kernel which is depending on servlet-api-2.3 with the scope of compile mistake of provided so mvn install packet the servlet-api-2.3.jar into the war file and causes a validatejarfile ... - jar not loaded. error in tomcat 7

9274356
implements	extends
to your question there are two ways to run map reduce jobs in java one is by using extends classes in org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce package and other is by implements classes in org.apache.hadoop.mapred package or the other way round

9274365
youtube	vimeo
in that specific toolbox you have one input field in which you paste and submit a youtube or vimeo url

9274382
filesystems	ntfs
for windows if the filesystems is ntfs you can use

9274409
hide	show
my main problem with your approach is that your view contains the business logic for when to show and hide questions

9274409
hide	show
the presenter can hide or show the questions as needed

9274441
for-loop	loops
quite often a for-loop can be converted into a query to be evaluated lazily and then a foreach loops which performs some action on each value returned by the query

9274460
unsigned	short
you can store each float in 2 bytes by representing it as an unsigned short ranges from 0 to 65 535 and dividing all values by 2 8 when you need the actual value

9274469
mouseleave	mouseenter
all you need is to subclass qscrollbar and reimplement mouseenter and mouseleave for it as you ve done for qtableview

9274480
onresume	onpause
after i touch the screen is called onpause and onresume

9274485
innodb	myisam
depending on which storage engine you use whenever you query a table mysql needs to open from 1 innodb up to 3 myisam files on disk

9274550
width	height
most properties that are non-numeric cannot be animated using basic jquery functionality for example width height or left can be animated but background-color cannot be unless the jquery.color plugin is used

9274581
public	protected
if you don t declare any constructors for a non-static class the compiler provides a public or protected for abstract classes parameterless constructor for you

9274582
maven	cargo
i have application launched using maven cargo plugin with jetty6x

9274608

9274693
qmainwindow	qframe
what i mean is i have qmainwindow and on it qframe and init qlistview and in it

9274770
debian	linux
i m running glassfish v3.1.1 build 12 using java build 1.6.0_29-b11 on linux debian squeez 6.0.4

9274792
int	chars
otherwise the string s chars are converted into bytes according to the platform s default chars encoding and these bytes are written in exactly the manner of the write int method

9274801
xslt	xquery
as xslt 2.0 uses the same functions as xquery 1.0 xpath 2.0 you can also use the function fn element-with-id

9274839
implements	extends
don t forget using abstract classes limits you to some extent because a descendant class can only extends one class whereas it can implements any number of interfaces

9274840
onclick	onmousedown
use onmousedown insted of onclick

9274872
nexus	artifactory
but i would recommend using sonatype nexus or jfrog artifactory for storing artifacts not found somewhere else

9274872
maven	pom.xml
maven will always prefer what is directly in you pom.xml

9274878
post	get
first post so please forgive me if i get it wrong

9274889
margin	height	width	height	width	margin
inline element can t take width height vertical margin padding

9275007
int	chars
well int in front won t work and chars doesn t make sense either since it s a mixture of both

9275008
int	double
examples of this are basic numeric data types like int bool or double

9275072
chown	chmod
the documentation for chown and chmod should be of great help

9275118
unix	bsd
the chroot system call was introduced during development of version 7 unix in 1979 and added to bsd by bill joy on 18 march 1982 â 17 months before 4.2bsd was released â in order to test its installation and build system

9275138
draggable	droppable
i m trying to use jqueryui draggable droppable sortable to move not copy items from a source box to either of the destination boxes

9275162
width	height
so i want to increase the height and width of the uialertview

9275185
dbcontext	objectcontext
the developer i m copying used the code first approach so their databasename entities inherits from dbcontext whereas i generated mine from the database so it inherits from objectcontext

9275186
folder	directory
the fix was to move the cygwin directory inside a folder excluded by mcafee s oas and create a symbolic link to the old location like so

9275218
post	get
many a times a get a problem that the code needs to be parsed one good example is when i wanted to display ads between the post

9275221
csv	tsv
but if you still want to use csv tsv files you can still easily do so

9275221
csv	tsv
btw if one wants to generate csv data one can use a great little library from ostermiller which will format the csv tsv file in the way that excel will understand fully

9275239
min	max
you re doing something odd with your min and max

9275243
draggable	droppable
in the callback this represents the droppable the draggable is dropped on

9275270
xpo	openaccess
i tried entity framework openaccess and xpo

9275270
xpo	openaccess
i think we re going to buy xpo or openaccess

9275334
integer	unsigned
i ve implemented a 256 bit integer using an array of unsigned long long and used x64 assembly to implement the add with carry

9275338
multiplying	addition
so group class provides methods like multiplying and addition of two bignumbers

9275342
action-filter	onactionexecuting
i have had a similar problem using mvc 3 action-filter and seems they are cached quite aggressively in mvc 3 and found that sessions were not always being opened as onactionexecuting not always fire

9275346
std	ostream
for c++ iostreams flushing a stream amounts to calling the member function std ostream flush which in turn calls std streambuf pubsync on the associated stream buffer this ignores the detail that the stream are actually class templates

9275346
ostringstream	std
on the other hand flushing a std stringbuf which is the stream buffer used to implement writing to a std string used by std ostringstream actually doesn t do anything the string is entirely within the program and the std string representing its value is constructed when the std stringbuf str member function is called

9275346
std	ostream	ostream	istream
when reading from an std istream the tied std ostream if any is flushed

9275346
cout	cin
by default std cout is tied to std cin

9275346
std	ostream
if you want to set up a tied std ostream yourself you can use or if you want to remove a tied std ostream you can use std cin.tie 0

9275346
std	ostream
when an std ostream is destroyed or when it would normally destroyed in case the std ostream is one of the standard streams the std ostream is flushed

9275346
std	ostream
you can also explicitly request flushing an std ostream

9275346
std	ostream
you can call the member function std ostream flush std cout.flush

9275346
std	ostream
calling std ostream flush will do nothing if there is no stream buffer

9275346
cout	cin
generally this isn t a problem because the normal case where buffered output needs to become available when reading from std cin is handled by std cout being tie d to std cin

9275378
menhir	ocamlyacc
indeed menhir is mostly backward compatible it can read ocamlyacc source files but improves over ocamlyacc in many directions grammars can be combined symbols can be named etc.

9275378

ocamlyacc is a parser generator for ocaml mostly deprecated by menhir

9275388
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
to save an text as file you should be using fileoutputstream and to read the file you should be using fileinputstream

9275430
mvp	presenter
a standard design pattern for gui is mvp presenter first or any variation

9275450
hide	show
the second option is to add it in gui builder if you do this it won t show at first you have to go to the left hand side where there is a list of components and click on other components jframe1 to make it appear this will hide your main form which you can hide by clicking on the main form component in the navigator

9275456
children	parent
however i d like the tree to be bi-directional - that is each node has a list of children and a pointer to its parent

9275458
getter	setter
edit it s possible to do it in ie 8 and above using a getter and setter

9275504
hide	show
i have a form in php which has drop downlist and a textboxt which show and hide bases on dropdown list value

9275504
hide	show
i did the show and hide using javascript

9275504
hide	show
here is my show hide feild in js

9275573
google-chrome	firefox
verified in google-chrome ie firefox

9275641
google-chrome	safari

9275647
width	height
for setting the fixed width and height as attribute will bring the solution for fixed size image

9275675
int	chars
don t allow the user to enter text and special chars in textbox edittext .when user enters the number in the textbox convert that number to int as follows integer.parseint yourstring

9275765
int	chars
there are plenty of ready to use validation filter scripts out there you can just plug in to check that your expected value is chars int float etc

9275789
folder	directory
you can do nothing without .svn folder present in all your working copy directory including root directory

9275789
folder	directory
.svn folder is also known as the working copy s administrative directory

9275789
folder	directory
more specifically as shown on the picture .svn folder contains info about working revision the one your working copy has and timestamp of all files in the current directory of working copy

9275790
width	height
what it does is it adjusts the height of the view only if the new height that is based on aspect ratio of the drawable and the adjusted width in our case that s exact width of the parent view is smaller than the adjusted height which at this poin is just drawable s native height plus padding in our case

9275804
folder	directory
if in the same folder change sample_config.xml to sample_config.xml as sample_config.xml would look for the xml file in the root directory

9275888
rss	feed
however on my mainpage i want to display the most recent news coming from multiple rss feed

9275890
filtering	grouping
the next sub query uses a simple grouping by to filtering out all the start dates for each seedid and also counts the days

9275916
hash	salt
regarding the hash password stored in the database you could add a salt to improve security

9276012
hash	md5
if that is right you might as well store the session id and timestamp on the same place and just go ahead with a guid for the file name instead of providing them to your md5 hash function which would be safer from a collision standpoint

9276026
ubuntu	debian
one handy way to use local lib is to install your distro s local lib under debian ubuntu apt-get install liblocal-lib-perl then use that to set up your own private cpan library

9276095
folder	directory
i am assuming you are in a directory just outside interfaceimplementation folder

so you can push and pull changes and branches from there

9277709

9278240
cpu	processors
now of course modern processors mostly eat memory in cache-line-sized increments but our means of expressing groupings and dividing the now-virtual address space remained and the smallest amount of memory which a cpu instruction can access directly is still an eight-bit chunk

9278240
cpu	processors
the machine code for the cpu instructions and or the paths going into the processors would have to grow the same way the number of wires connecting to the memory controller would in order for the registers to be addressable - it s the same problem as with the system memory accessibility i was talking about earlier

if you are reading and writing non-byte primitive types short int float long double then the underlying processor will have to do extra work if the cpus endianness byteorder.nativeorder is different from the default java big endianness

9282095
cpu	processors
assuming your cpu is an x86 processors

9282134
width	height
had the same problem i m sure you re using the float property which is fine bus still for it to work under the horrible ie you need to give every div the height and width properties even if they get it from someone else or by default

put	get
i m doing a simple check for some user data that get s put into session on sign in

9282203

all works fine in firefox and google-chrome the problem is in ie

9282901
google-chrome	firefox
again it works great in google-chrome and firefox but ie.. i only tested ie9

9282976
mouseup	mousedown
i m a bit successful also using mousedown and mouseup events of a picture box

9282976
mouseup	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown
the mousedown event sets the starting point and mouseup event sets the ending point diagonally opposite point of rectangle. the problem is nothing seems to be occuring between mousedown and mouseup events well..that is obvious because i didn t add any code on mousemove event

9283079
post	get
not only that with the viewstate validation turned on you should also get a security exception - since the value the page post with is not at the list of available values

9283083

after following the link provided by jmh_gr i found the problem was that the defaultcellstyle for the datagridview itself is inherited last on the cell so i had to remove the padding from the dgv properties and apply it to all the columns except the one i didn t want padding on

9283235
mp4	h.264
you could use the or tags which are supported by apple products however your video would need to be encoded in the h.264 mp4 format

9283268
int	double
fixed point would turn these into int operations rather than double operations

9283294
sequence	permutation
the solution the sequence of operations is some permutation of the string 1234 where each digit represents the position of the character being replaced

9283319
soql	apex
from within apex you could do a less elegant try catch approach with dynamic soql dml at least to determine if something you suspect is there is actually there

9283347

fyi guava has bytestreams.copy inputstream outputstream which you can either use directly or look at how it solves this problem

9283589
mouse	keyboard
in general you re well served by using keyboard shortcuts in visual studio instead of the mouse

9283638
google-chrome	firefox
the following works fine in firefox and ie but not in google-chrome

9283638
google-chrome	firefox
the strange thing is that google-chrome does see the css â if i don t put the xml-stylesheet instruction google-chrome warns me that this xml file does not appear to have any style information... and displays the xml as a tree just like firefox does â but i don t know why it ignores it anyway

9283648
put	get
i decided to put the user name before the date since that s the easiest thing to accomplish but i get you can accomplish the opposite with a user_upload_dir filter and some regex

9283710
postgresql	mysql
this feature is supported by db2 sql server since version 10.0 - 2008 postgresql since version 8.2 mysql and h2

9283798
put	get
by using the below wizard in visual studio installer to get the location of my .exe which the user can choose to put where he prefers i manage to place this command just where needed

9283839
int	chars
in antlrworks the input int a12q2efwe chars eq45dsf is being parsed using the debugger as follows

9283843
ienumerable	iqueryable
to get round the problem you simply need to do the bits that aren t in linq to sql with linq to objects so you need to convert iqueryable to ienumerable using something like asenumerable

9283859
for-loop	loops
your for-loop would have worked if you ran it in reverse start at the highest index and loops while

9283872
min	max	aggregate-functions	sum
technically there could be a more general implementation that handles all of the aggregate-functions max min sum count ...

9283890
ssl	https
this is not an explanation nor a true solution it s simply the most pragmatic way of dealing with this issue that we ve found in our case doing a wcf soap request over https using a client ssl cert with an apache java based server

9284050
post	put	post	get	put	get
put your website url set the number of post that you want to have in comments get the code

9284050

backbone.js or spine.js offer routing on the client-side but in my experience i only got that to work for really simple cases but this could also be caused by my limited knowledge experience in such frameworks

9284131
stdout	stderr
for a sequence of commands enclose them within parentheses then append the symbol but be sure to redirect stdout stderr somewhere otherwise your script will hang waiting

9284158
hash	salt
i add a per-user salt to the hash storage of a user s password so the stored password hash looks like this hash password + perusersalt

9284158
hash	salt
in this case the salt and hash storage of passwords is useless because the correct combination of username and password will yield a successful login

9284179
ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	icollection	ilist	icollection
if the method returns some ienumerable icollection or ilist then i like to make it static if possible and leave it on the repository even if it uses navigation properties

9284184

if it is starting at the root of your website then it is a relative path because if you move your website to a different folder then the paths to these directory and files don t need to change they are relative to the web root

9284217
hash	salt
if the user has a simple password the salt and hash won t really matter

9284217
hash	salt
you have to require a secure password from the user then do the one-way encryption hash it with the salt and use ssl like you are

9284221
width	height
you d still have to figure out how to randomize the height and width of the pieces add an onclicklistener and then move the pieces

9284233
free	malloc
think wrapper functions for malloc and free . it would also need a lock mechanism to enforce singular access so that the two processes don t stop on each other

9284239
mouseup	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown
finally in mouseup you set a flag that indicates that mousemove should not be doing anything until mousedown again

9284265
voip	sip
crazy idea user would define a phone number of your server sip voip as forward when declined -number

9284274
prepare	execute
currently instead of using the db driver i m using a model instead which has all my pdo code like prepare fetch execute etc

9284281

9284314
entity-relationship	diagram
as a requirement we needed to create an entity-relationship diagram then from that diagram derive the database schema

9284314
entity-relationship	diagram
if the professor specifically mentioned part was unnecessary then there must be some way to remove it that results in a simpler entity-relationship diagram and schema - but i can t see what it is

9284314
entity-relationship	diagram
but now i have to figure out exactly what modifications to the entity-relationship diagram would correspond to this schema

9284320
google-chrome	firefox
tried it some time ago and found it not consistent between firefox and google-chrome yet

9284347
children	parent
it includes basic operations like looking at children and at the parent of a node while also allowing easily iterating through the structure

9284404
filepath	unc
i m honestly not certain whether unc paths are supported or not but if you want a fully-qualified filepath you need to use iirc

9284480
lxml.html	elementtree
however as far as i know the base elementtree library lacks some convenience classes for things like selectors so a solution that allows me to use lxml.html without etree.htmlparser would still be useful

9284510
folder	directory
just recompile locally look in the bin directory of your web app sort by last modified and you ll see the dlls that get updated - these should get moved to the corresponding bin folder of your server

9284541
filesystems	ntfs
this property is stored as an alternate stream on the ntfs filesystems - specifically a stream named zone.identifier

9284541
filesystems	ntfs
fat32 filesystems obviously don t have ntfs alternate streams

9284563
post	get
now what we observe here is that in both our get and post actions we have repetitive mapping code between our domain model customprofile and our view model changeprofileviewmodel

9284580
hide	show
show a hidden field if an option is selected and hide that field if not i have this part working - although if i use a variable it doesn t work

i did using the classes audiorecord and audiotrack but these are not suitable to transmit the pcm data

9284622
put	get
on the asp.net layer i pull data into a dataset and then call getxml to get an xml string and then put the xml into a text file for import export

9284640
dbcontext	objectcontext
ef modeladapter is based on objectcontext so you will have to use objectcontext api .net 4.0 instead of dbcontext api if you want to use it

9284709
division	modulo
the download for stl says the stl was developed on sgi mipsprotm c++ 7.0 7.1 7.2 and 7.2.1. and as far as i can tell without actually having the compiler and hardware mipspro passes the division to the cpu and mips hardware truncates to 0 which would mean std modulo has always been misnamed

9284762
division	modulo
in ruby and python is in fact the modulo integer division is done towards minus infinity in these languages

9284762
haskell	scheme
haskhell and scheme have two separate operators mod and rem for haskell and modulo and remainder for scheme

google-chrome	safari
i am having a problem with links inside a jscrollpane in safari and google-chrome on windows

9284778
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the problem only occurs in safari and google-chrome works fine in firefox

9284797
google-chrome	firefox
there is a second issue with your code however in firefox loading external dtds only works with google-chrome urls this check is hardcoded

9284824
try-catch	exception-handling
it doesn t appear to be a bad_alloc exception-handling because i tried wrapping the code in a try-catch with a bad_alloc catch handler

9284840
hide	show
basically i have 2 divs i want to hide show in multiple places stage 1 stage 2 stage 3 etc as so

9284840
setinterval	settimeout
i ve seen a lot done with window settimeout as well as setinterval and .queue

9284844
children	parent
but it brought all the children themselves and not the parent anchors

9284847
google-chrome	firefox
the above code works fine in firefox and ie however google-chrome continues to submit the entire form vs

9284903
put	get
this might get you close enough to what you need otherwise the basic approach is sound but you may need to fiddle with that pattern to get it match exactly the stretches of text you want to put through anonymiseword

9284911
packets	multicast
after looking up packets decoding for multicast and broadcast packets i am having some difficulties in creating the decision logic

9284911
subnet	packets
i cannot know what subnet a packets is from and so i cannot determine specific broadcast addresses due to custom sub-netting

9285005
submit	submission
everytime i try to submit the form it comes back with my failed validation error that there was a problem submission the form

9285108
post	get
short version i need to get an array of distinct tags matching web or any other term for that matter out of the post collection

9285127
client-side	server-side
when i access an x y coordinate client-side i expect the property to be lowercase but server-side it is uppercase

9285136
cpu	affinity
process1 rt priority 40 cpu affinity cpu 0

9285136
cpu	affinity
process2 rt priority 39 cpu affinity cpu 0

9285225
post	get
you will have to use post instead of get if you want a clean dynamic url

9285273
nsstring	nsobject
one of the objects is an empty nsstring which has just the default nsobject s implementation of valueforkey which naturally doesn t know anything about the above key file ... so it throws an exception

9285283
guava	lambdaj
there are already quite a number in circulation - functional java the functional parts of guava lambdaj and others - all doing much the same thing or at least having overlapping bits doing much the same thing

9285283
guava	lambdaj
at the company where i work where there are a lot of big fans of functional programming we seem to have settled on functional java having had lambdaj guava and a couple of homebrewed functional frameworks in our codebase and having rewritten bits of it in scala

9285359
width	height
a shadow of a zero rect x 0 y 0 width 0 height 0 won t show at all

9285373
google-chrome	firefox
i have a web application that has been running just fine in internet explorer 9 firefox and google-chrome but a couple strange features occur in internet explorer 7 and sometimes even 8

9285373
google-chrome	firefox
again this works in ie9 firefox and google-chrome but it will not open the dialog in ie7 or ie8

9285383
pull	push
to resolve your immediate problem you should make a backup of the local file remove the original pull from the remote branch and then git rm followed by a push to make sure the remote repo deletes the file as well

9285428
x86	64bit
libx86 uses lrmi the opposite of dpmi on x86 and an x86 emulator on x86-64 since afaik vm86 mode cannot be used from 64bit mode

9285469
aggregate-functions	sum
this looks like you are running into a constraint issue on your table that you are inserting into or values you are operating on...like aggregate-functions max sum avg.. exists on a null value

9285501
button	checkbox
the spacebar can typically be used to interact with most clickable controls such as button and checkbox

9285540
codeigniter	cakephp
the .net framework is largely built around separating presentation from content which is not a focus in php unless you use a framework like cakephp or codeigniter or others

9285547
width	height
measures the object s width height

9285550
google-chrome	firefox
which would work in firefox but not in google-chrome

9285552
int	double
mpi has built in pair data types - mpi_double_int for a double + an int or mpi_2int for two int that you can use

9285552
int	double
if the value you re reducing isn t an int say a double you create a structure containing the reduction value and the int index and use the appropriate mpi pair data type

9285565
google-chrome	safari
firefoxâ s firebug add-on or the web inspector in google-chrome safari should be able to show you the stylesheetâ s mime type.

9285575
qdialog	qfiledialog
i have a qdialog that opens a qfiledialog like so

9285593
hide	show
or probably better hide this input field and show only if nol value is selected

9285619
hide	show
obviously you will probably want to extend that to hide the input again if another value is selected and perhaps show hide the label element too

9285632
filesystems	fat
if trying to write to alternative file stream on fat filesystems failes then it s output to stderr will be redirected to nul

9285644
udp	tcp
turn off options such as tcp segementation offload udp fragmentation offload general segmentation offload large receive offload and generic receive offload

9285653
put	get
variables from an html form passed as part of the url get put into a array by php

9285654
innodb	myisam
i m not sure which mysql engine you re using but your should consider doing those statements within a single transaction too you would need innodb instead of myisam

9285743
freebsd	linux
if by all network interfaces you mean all interfaces that are connected to physical networks and aren t capturing on things not thought of a networks - the loopback interface is an example of the former and the usb capture devices on linux and freebsd 9.0 and later are examples of the latter - then

9285774
primefaces	icefaces
the impression i m getting about the new icefaces 3.0 ace datatable nã e primefaces 2.0 datatable is that it is intended to be used in a view- or session-scoped bean but i don t see how one could get around staleobjectstate and or lazyinitializationexceptions if one has model objects coming out of the dao in request a and entitymanager a and then being modified or paged in by request b with entitymanager b

9285776
put	get
i have a monitor that won t get any darker so i want to put a translucent black filter over every site i visit.

9285781
tabcontrol	tabitem
and i am binding the itemssource of a tabcontrol when i add a new tabitem in the contructor of mainwindowviewmodel it is working

9285788
installation	upgrade
after extension upgrade installation or uninstallation refresh all

9285836
int	chars
then as has been suggested before all you need to do is iterate through the string two chars at a time here it would be useful to iterate by index convert those values to int and then convert that int to a chars

9285849
rss	feed
i have made and rss reader and have a listbox with all the feed in it

9285863
ienumerable	ienumerator
after this didn t work i to find out had to implement the ienumerator and ienumerable interfaces and add the required methods to my class

9285868
packets	pcap
struct pcap_pkthdr is not the structure that defines the format of packets headers in a pcap file

9285868
winpcap	libpcap
it s the structure that defines the format of packet headers as provided to programs using libpcap or winpcap

9285868
packets	pcap	winpcap	libpcap
the structure that defines the format of packets headers in a pcap file is not in any of the pcap include files because libpcap winpcap provides routines that read those headers and transforms them as necessary to pcap_pkthdr headers

9285868
packets	pcap
unlike struct pcap_pkthdr the time stamp in packets headers in a pcap file always have a 32-bit seconds field and a 32-bit microseconds field even on systems where time_t and the tv_sec value in a struct timeval are 64 bits

9285868
winpcap	libpcap
libpcap 1.1 and later know how to read pcap-ng files the libpcap winpcap api isn t powerful enough to handle all pcap-ng files but it can for example handle pcap-ng files that only have one section and only have packets from one network adapter and libpcap 1.1 and later can read those

9285868
winpcap	libpcap
i would suggest just as unwind suggested that you use libpcap winpcap to read capture files rather than writing your own code to do it

9285875
post	get
but i m not able to get the json results from said post

9285949
draggable	droppable
you can use the revert option with a value of invalid to send the draggable back to where it came from if it s dropped anywhere other than on a valid droppable

9285951
public	protected
this may be a very stupid question and it s making feel like my brain has gone...but i cannot fathom how to set a protected or public variable from a base class

9286020
move	drag
when i drag an image changing his y axis and then try to resize it it s automatically move to the las y axis position x is consistent

9286028
x86	64bit
for example if you are running win 7 64bit or win server 2008 r2 you may install 32-bit jre in c program files x86 java jre6 and 64bit jre in c program files java jre6 and perhaps ibm java 6 in c program files x86 ibm java60 jre

9286039
for-loop	loops
and using a for-loop really is the most sensible thing because you are modifying something in the body of loops and not for example creating a new iterable or list. you can however simplify the code by using a collections.defaultdict like so

9286092
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
does it in latest google-chrome firefox and safari builds which tells me it s not a browser issue

9286118
width	height
to match the container s height in which case you get a width

9286118
width	height
to match the container s width in which case you get a height

9286125
hide	show
show hide works perfectly fine

9286132
maven	pom.xml
i m using maven eclipse and have updated my pom.xml to use selenium 2.19 for the server

9286133
google-chrome	safari
then you run into this webkit bug and get incorrect rendering in google-chrome and safari while other browsers are rendering this per spec

9286140
post	get
besides the httpservletrequest#setcharacterencoding doesn t affect get requests it affects post requests only

9286147
post	get
as your form method defined is post so use to get values after submit instead of

9286155
ienumerable	ienumerator
i found remove the implementing of ienumerator ienumerable then you don t have to use xmlinclude

9286155
ienumerable	ienumerator
i guess if class implement ienumerable and ienumerator

9286155
ienumerable	ienumerator
what i suggest is to implement ienumerable ienumerator

9286241
visualvm	jprofiler
other options include using visualvm or jprofiler or dynatrace like tools

9286280
cos	sin
essentially store sin x and cos x values for a bunch values

9286280
cos	sin
now using sin a sin b cos a cos b y-a and y-b approximately calculate sin y

9286282
int	boolean
sql isn t the best at handling casting between types without using something like cast or convert which means that the int value isunumeric returns will only be resolved as a boolean when you use some comparator etc to produce a true false result

9286322
post	get
when a user of my gae app clicks the back button i need to prevent them from seeing a cached version of the page - that is i need the python get or post code for that url to be run

9286373
innodb	myisam
the only difference between the tables besides the fields themselves is that product is an innodb storage engine and has other tables referencing it as their foreign key while news is myisam and does not

9286388
put	get
follow-up this approach does suffer from losing type safety but it only impacts put k v and as get object and containskey object always accepts object

9286436
voip	sip
i m trying to write a voip app for android using the android sip api yes i know this only works with some androids with version 2.3

9286441
width	height
inside magento templating code i want to get the width and height of the original product image uploaded by admin when creating product so as to make according adjustments

9286442
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
everything is working very well on internet explorer which is extrange but the onclick event is not working on safari google-chrome or firefox

9286442
onmouseover	onclick
are there some functions like onmouseover or onmouseout or onclick that does not work on those browsers

9286469
portrait	landscape
i have the following problem i have an image that i want to disappear when i change my phone from portrait to landscape

9286493
width	height
this will put a separator that will allow you to resize in the designer and disables adding text changing the autosize forces the size s height to be 2 and width to be whatever you want and disables adding text

9286514
filtering	grouping
google grouping thread which suggests that there is a duplicate filtering present in the scheduler

9286520
google-chrome	firefox
i ve opened the developer tools network tab in both google-chrome 16 and firefox 7 on this cuzillion test page and both appear to show scripts and images being downloaded -all in parallel can post screen-shots

9286568
for-loop	arrays
it outlines what you d have to do in the general case though since you re working with c-imports what you can do is modify it a bit so that a there is a temp variable which is an arrays like result but use to overlay it on the my_type.value and then use the for-loop to copy it out

9286590
switching	screens
so basically i ll switching the src for an array of images based on the user s screens resolution

9286610
children	parent
the decisions on the previous point will affect the number of pipes opened in the parent vs the number opened by the children

9286664
min	max
now we change the heap from min to max but without rearranging the elements and insert a new element 25

9286664
children	parent
now the max-heap property holds for the root node its children are indeed smaller but not for the other nodes 3 is still the parent of 7 and violates the max-heap condition

9286700
post	get
if it s pure page-to-page navigation rather use plain get links instead of post forms

9286708
children	parent
children before parent

9286720
mouseup	mousedown
then mousedown mouseup occurs and set the global dragging variable to have the move method work

9286736
min	max
yes if you want to do more than just the basic sum min max or count you need to write your own reducer

9286808
udp	tcp
for instance zeromq can leverage udp multicast to run faster than any tcp protocol but the application programmer doesn t need to learn a new api

9286820
pop-up	dialog
i ve tried to use this post as a reference in order to have the pop-up dialog while my content loads

9286849
rss	feed
with my setrequeststring you will see there is a string input parameter so i can request different rss feed with the same method

9286854
debian	linux	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian
on debian probably ubuntu and maybe other linux distributions you can find your system s installed completions in etc bash_completion.d

9286868
curses	readline
i think that the best way to solve this is to use gnu readline for your input rather than the default curses input

9286888
width	margin
there does not seem to be a css equivalent to either marginheight or margin width and there is no way to access the source within the iframes

9286908
glut	sdl
otherwise you probably need to roll your own but make use of opengl glut gtk frp ogre bindings sdl and perhaps fungen if it s back on track

9286908
xml-conduit	hxt
xml process haxml hxt xml-conduit - good stable and powerful libraries

9286908
hunit	hspec
testing - quickcheck lazysmallcheck test-framework hspec hunit

9286984
post	get
almost all topics get responded to within hours and i have never seen a post which was never responded to

9286985
width	height
i was putting height for width and width for height

9287008
switching	screens
if you have a layout with 2 buttons on the screens and then switching to one with 3 buttons on the screens you have to somehow differentiate between those layouts in your code

9287042
scrollable	panels
the problem you are having is that you are nesting scrollable panels

9287042
scrollable	panels
in your tab panels you set the defaults to always add scroll to each card and then within that card the dataview is also scrollable

9287072
cos	sin
the simplest are based on the following trig identities where d is constant and thus so is cos d and sin d

9287072
cos	sin
however this requires two variables one for sin and one for cos and 4 multiplications to update

9287073
mouse	keyboard
the service will be responsible for connecting to the server sending the image and receiving mouse keyboard events

9287170
google-chrome	firefox
console.log on google-chrome and on firefox shows me good objects with correct methods and method playvideo exists there

9287220
integer	unsigned
i know that if you have 32 bits to work with you could represent unsigned integer values from 0 to 4294967295

9287241
svg	vml
not 100 sure if this helps but the following says something about converting svg to vml

9287241
svg	vml
svg coords to vml coords

9287246
rss	feed
i know that it has rss feed with links

9287246
rss	feed
i want to limit the number of results when load rss feed with a request s format as

9287282
des	sha
when i tested an older version of net-snmp against my c# based snmp agent i noticed that for sha authen mode + des privacy mode a bug prevented the net-snmp command line tools from generating the correct message bytes the encryption is wrong so that no agent can decrypt it

9287287
pop-up	dialog
the screen saver program needs to know that when it gets that command line argument it should query the system for which window is in the foreground and pop-up a dialog in that window modal means that it blocks access to that window until the dialog is closed

9287287
pop-up	dialog
you could just have the preview mode pop-up a new window with the preview and have the settings mode likewise pop-up its dialog in a new window

9287320
width	height
repaint is actually a one-liner that calls repaint 0 0 width height so your basic thesis here -- that repaint with arguments is fundamentally different from repaint without -- is provably false

9287339
mdpi	hdpi
i thought finding the center of the graphic would be a great asset when laying out the gui and determining which folder hdpi ldpi or mdpi the graphics should be taken from

9287352
popupwindow	pop-up
i have use popupwindow for auto-suggestion pop-up in a dialogfragment

9287352
pop-up	dialog
on portrait that pop-up doesn t reach soft keyboard pop-up look small it seem like its size is limited by dialog windown size

9287391
pop-up	dialog
now i have a label and i want when user click it it pop-up a color picker dialog and let user to change the background color of the label

9287393
width	height
the basic problem is that zend_pdf_page is using the media box attributes to calculate the width and height of each page rather than in this particular case the crop box

9287416
udp	tcp
udp is less reliable on a wide area network but in a closed environment of a vm talking to its host you can safely skip all the tcp reliability stuff

9287479
vim	sublimetext
you could also use the built-in textedit app although it s horrible imo a command-line text editor such as vi or vim or a different editor such as sublimetext

9287479
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the major browsers for mac google-chrome safari and firefox all have advanced web design tools the built-in inspectors in google-chrome and safari and the firebug add-on for firefox that will allow you to see the javascript console network requests etc

9287524
getter	setter
objective c emphasizes using getter and setter

9287524
getter	setter
to make things simpler it even generates getter and setter when you synthesize something

9287551
maven	pom.xml
if editing the pom.xml file is out of the question i d strongly recommend steering clear of maven

9287564
width	height
the first thing to know is that a canvas element has intrinsic dimensions number of pixels in the inside coordinate space set by the width and height attributes and properties

9287564
width	height
if you set width and height on an image it s basically the same as setting style.width or style.height

9287586
profiling	debugging
the tools for debugging this type of issue are called memory profiling

9287594
width	height
obviously i can calculate it from various css properties width height and so on

9287631
post	get
my get and post methods are

9287697
implements	extends
interfaces don t implements or extends classes

9287697
implements	extends
what the javadoc actuallys says is that randomaccessfile extends java.lang.object and implements closeable datainput dataoutput

9287718
setcontentview	findviewbyid
and findviewbyid will work only after you set the layout in setcontentview

9287746
put	get
i tried link ing to a bootstrap.css file that i put in the hosted file system but none of the styles get applied

9287747
apache	nginx
but my fd told me that it is better to serve that web app under apache or nginx

9287758
implements	extends
i have read anonymous class can only implements the interface or extends the class but not both

9287794
move	drag
the view does not move along with the finger drag

9287794
move	drag
it move after the finger drag is finished

9287811
width	height
for the bottom and right sides the code basically adds the width or height of the bounding box to the left or top side

9287822
portrait	landscape
you may also get similar messages if you apply orientation portrait or orientation landscape specific styles or meta tags

9287841
apache	nginx
nginx is better suited than apache as it is light and single threaded vs apache thread per request in most normal setups

9287843
apache	nginx
you don t want to use apache because nginx is better suited since nginx is built for async i o

9287853
google-chrome	firefox
the code below works great in firefox but doesn t work at all in google-chrome or ie

9287853
google-chrome	firefox
i have added a console.log test and this runs in firefox but not in google-chrome or ie

9287869
folder	directory
then i ran bundle update and it created a whole new folder called update in my rails directory containing all the gems and it seems like my rails project is no longer linked to my rvm gem directory because if i remove the update folder it fuzzes about not being able to find gems

9287881
min	max
check for max and min file size

9287881
hash	md5
use an algorithm md5 hash to determine the new filenames

9287882

how do i allow apache to apply changes to nginx

9287892
clang	llvm
i am trying to load the provided hello pass into llvm 3.0 compiled with clang

9287924
move	drag
for example if they wanted to add a text box to the page then they would just drag the text that said text from the sidebar into the main content window and then they could edit straight from there and move the box up or down on the main page if they wanted to

9287950
spaces	delimiter
my program is to accept input and parse out a spaces delimiter string into tokens and classifying those tokens accordingly

9287950
spaces	delimiter
one for processing the spaces delimiter tokens and the other for determining the type of delimiter tokens

9287959
ssl	https
maybe it is somehow connected with getting osm tiles via network or something like that - we have a proxy connection so https and ssl port are not available but all in all network on the device is ok

9287997
jar	manifest.mf
note when i unpack the jar file there is a folder named meta-inf which also contains manifest.mf but not the name of main class

9288023
nsstring	nserror
bool loadfromcontents id contents oftype nsstring typename error nserror outerror

9288023
nsstring	nserror
id contentsfortype nsstring typename error nserror outerror

9288077
google-chrome	safari
so basically i have a .getjson call that seems to be working on google-chrome and iphone 4s safari browsers but not working on a bunch of other ones including the ipad 2 safari

9288128
x86	64bit
often esp with x86 you will see a 64bit processor operated in a 32 bit mode basically running code instructions that expect 32 bit registers not 64bit with x86 the registers have different ways to access them as 8 16 32 or 63 bit so you can play these games

9288128
x86	mips
now mips unfortunately goes out of its way to confuse you and x86 does as well so avoid those pick something simple like the msp430 or arm or arm in thumb mode to learn first

9288136
super	implements
i ve tried implements the close method in the chingu window calling the super class close method

9288228
width	height
so you re trying to paint a rectangle that has the width and height of your jlabel but which is located at x 292 and y 5 relative to the jlabel when instead you want x and y to both be 0

9288257
folder	directory
the bundler re-installed all the gems and placed them in a new folder haml inside the main directory of the rails application

9288267
folder	dir
when i printed the dir it is pointing the cgi folder too

put	get
you put the field declaration in the middle of your code perhaps hoping that it would get initialized after the checkbox1_checkedchanged method runs

9288309
post	get
get and post data

9288317
google-chrome	firefox
all other browsers google-chrome 17 firefox ie9 work perfectly

9288350
hide	show
i would like to display only 5 menu items at a time and i would use a vertical scroll button at the bottom or top of the jpopupmenu to show the menu items that are not listed and hide the ones that i just saw

9288353
free	malloc
also to answer your question as posed rather than just solving the problem free won t operate on any pointer that you didn t get from malloc

9288360

if you have a x86 target dll be it a .net assembly or a native dll then you must host this dll in a 32 bit process - in the case of .net this means selecting the x86 platform otherwise your dll wil fail to load on a 64bit machine

9294842
x86	64bit
however all of this will be a pain to implement and maintain - unless you have a very good reason just compile your application with the x86 platform instead at least until the external company release a 64bit version

9295012
hex	binary
you have to first understand and internalize the idea that hex notation is only an easy-to-read representation of binary

9295012
hex	binary
see hex exists only as a human-readable presentation format for binary each hex digit representing four contiguous binary digits

9295013

width	height
when i use include in a layout i have to set width and height both to include tag and to the layout it is linked to

9295164
google-chrome	firefox
in case of any file in firefox and google-chrome the line if system.io.file.exists fpath always returns false

9295197
width	height
include doesn t actually need a width and height if you specify the width and height of the root element of the included layout

9295197
width	height
so long as my_included_layout has a root element with a width and height it will be happy

9295198

png and gif are better than jpeg gif probably better than png

unsigned short arrays can be used with wide character strings - for instance if you have utf-16 encoded texts - although i d expect to see wchar_t in those cases

9295490
unsigned	short
i would suppose that they use unsigned short because they must be utilizing utf-16 encoding for unicode characters and hence representing characters both in and out of the bmp

so when a user clicks option one i want to hide all option2 and 3 text and show only 1

9295918
integer	unsigned
in particular there are different implementations for integer and floating point comparisons and this meant that templates were not really appropriate since there is no c++ linguistic grouping that differentiates int long unsigned size_t etc

in addition starting with jackson 1.9 if this is the only annotation associated with a property it will also cause cause the whole property to be ignored that is if setter has this annotation and getter has no annotations getter is also effectively ignored

9307359
int	chars
chars and int are rather tightly knit in c

9307359
int	chars
since these functions are often used primarily as macros their domain is restricted to the small positive int representable in an unsigned chars plus the value of eof

you can use sup.copy ptr len instead of strcpy anyway which is slightly safer in that you can specify the buffer size although strncpy would allow that too although you will still have to write the null terminator manually or have it already allocated

btw i do not mean apache nginx is useless i am just not familiar with this

you ll need to specify the width and height of these otherwise when they re loaded colorbox will think they have a height of 0 and make the box be the appropriate size the images will then load in and be bigger than 0 causing scrollbars to appear

9310627
width	height

if you are not going to change your url more frequently then instead of getter setter method i will say that you can keep static directly

9310844

usually you should use getter and setter for readability and code practices

not entirely sure what you mean by refresh a tree by using a propertychangelistener but agree with paul a propertychangelistener is not helpful in notifying the treemodel listeners which include the jtree

9311061
inherited	properties
when a child object has a properties inherited from its prototype object what s really happening is that the child has a reference to the prototype which contains the properties

9311061
inherited	properties
so if obj inherited the properties foo from its prototype and foo is 42 alert obj.foo will get the value from the prototype and show 42

and check is image is ready to use findviewbyid like you call the method and after do setcontentview or if it really is imageview etc

9311312
super	self
from my understanding the function super should allow a class that is nested within another to access its parent s self

9311322
viewdidload	viewwillappear
moving the call to another callback like viewwillappear or viewdidload did no good the keyboard won t show up in the first place

9311419
super	extends
the error you get spurs from the fact that super only works with new-style classes classes that explicitly extends object

9311419
super	extends
so even if you fixed the error allowing test and print to extends object super would not work in this case

9311453
post	get
set ajax type get maybe work by default data send type is post

9311491
google-chrome	safari
user-agent mozilla 5.0 windows nt 5.1 applewebkit 535.11 khtml like gecko google-chrome 17.0.963.56 safari 535.11

google-chrome	firefox
i have a link in my facebook page tab app which should send the client to the app canvas page works fine in google-chrome but just isn t going in ie or firefox

9311514
int	boolean
by that i mean there is no automatic conversion from int to boolean as with c

9311518
google-chrome	firefox
check the sample at and using firefox google-chrome inspect element on the prev button - adjust it to use y instead of m and you will see how it works

9311537
int	boolean
the reason for that is that in c there is no specific type boolean - instead any non-0 int evaluates to a boolean true

9311537
int	boolean
in java assigns 20 to a and returns the final result of evaluation as int value 20 however type boolean is expected - hence you re getting a compile-time error about the incompatible types

9311563
hide	show
my goal is to show hide on-screen software keyboard on some event and intercept input from that keyboard

9311563

when accessed through getter setter at least there is one place where i can do some checks

9311742
for-loop	arrays
i was doing a simple function loading two arrays using a for-loop

9311777
width	height
took a look at your link and that space below your slider is made due to the fact that your images are not scaling according to the width height you specified in your script and also due to some spacing on the .galleria-stage class

9311803
for-loop	loops
it s because the foreach method doesn t use the enumerator it loops through the items with a for-loop

9311808
pull	push
if all the setting of gitolite were done right you are be able to push and pull data to the server without direct using ssh command

9311826
pdcurses	ncurses
your best bet would be to use ncurses for unix systems and pdcurses for windows

9311831
try-catch	exception-handling
as an extreme example i know of one such application where pretty much every single method was wrapped in a try-catch block with a call to an static exception-handling handler method which threw a generic myapplicationexception type

9311887
pop-up	dialog
this usually results in the pop-up dialog on the console of the server when a user is logged in to ask the user who is assumed to be a developer what debugging tool he she would like to use to start debugging the problem

9312055
audiotoolbox	avfoundation
first of all include these frameworks to your project audiotoolbox coreaudio mediaplayer and avfoundation

9312190
teamcity	jenkins
i know that there are some plugins to fail build in teamcity jenkins but this is too far

9312213

the short answer is that the rails 3 routing api base your application on resources which is why these restful routes are being used and also means that it does things like support constraints

9312224
move	drag
i want the data to be move from one panel to another panel by the drag and drop feature as we experience in google plus

9312229
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome firefox etc it shows correctly in ie9 it doesnt show where the favicon should be it shows the internet explorer logo

9312256
draggable	droppable
it has a draggable droppable and sortable feature

9312385
prepare	execute
my inclination is to think that since the statement which fetched this rs was execute earlier in the process this rs will now be blind to the changes made by my prepare statements

9312429
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this issue is only present in safari i m using 5.1.3 and not google-chrome or firefox

9312440
post	put	post	get	put	get
it saves you work on both ends having to put the two resultant values into the proper post or get variables to send to php

9312444
chown	chmod
if your user is different from the user the server is running as apache httpd www-data for instance then you must either add yourself to the server group and chmod all the files so group permissions are set to read and write or chown all the files to you chown -r user user and add your server user to your group

9312499

i want to use this to hide the info button in the top bar when the user is on the info.php page and show it again when he is not on the info.php page

9312634

9312642
pseudo-class	visited
i have a little problem with the visited pseudo-class and the text-shadow property in css

9312642
google-chrome	safari
hover works fine on google-chrome safari but the visited link keeps the first text-shadow property

9312658
hide	show
for this i have tried some ways like enabling internal keyboard show hide notifications but these notification only gets called when external keyboard is not connected and this is not helping me

9312664
try-catch	exception-handling
since every exception-handling makes bundle activation pointless this try-catch block is really unnecessary so it s easier to throw java.lang.exception

9312678
hide	show
and in addition you won t be able to define opacity or show hide the links if the base a selector has done one of those things

9312754
entities	entitymanager
it has now been understood that the real goal is to have two entitymanager point to the same set of entities but somehow indicate that each entitymanager should limit itself to a certain set of those entities

9312754
entities	entitymanager
the only thing that s2 really offers is the ability to bind an entitymanager to all the entities in one or more bundles using the mapping attribute

9312756
min	max
reason performance increase since max and min would cause twice the iteration of the array which is in my case 7.5 million or more numbers

9312797
children	parent
in relative layout you always need specify the location of each child with respect to the parent or the between the children

9312857
ubuntu	linux
it produces pdfs with -djava.awt.headless true to avoid exceptions due missing x11 window server under linux ubuntu as well but the text items are not searchable and sometimes are even coded as images

9312879
google-chrome	firefox
inside google-chrome it works fine but in firefox or ie it shows only a link to facebook site

9312896
min	max
the min max fields creates a square and center lat long is for center point of the square

9312899
width	height
the first ints are the width and height of the image the byte arrays are in order alpha red green and.

9312899
width	height
blue.the width and height are pretty straightforward +getwidth int and +getheight int from the image object as you done and others are earned by convertintarraytobytearrays

9312934
width	height
i tried setting the height or width but that just cuts the stars but doens t resize them

the viewpager is fed by a pageradapter that provides a linearlayout to the viewpager which has layoutparams of wrap_content on both height and width

9313556

try calling before setting the position and getting the width height

9313580

assuming ieee 754 standard floating point numbers which are commonplace nowadays you get roughly 7.22 digits of accuracy for a float and 15.95 for a double so aim for 7 digits after the decimal point for a float ï constant and 15 for double to be on the safe side

9314480
post	get
in your case you want to get the height of 1 element and apply it to the other there are other jquery solutions to do this also - this one is designed originally to calculate the height of 2 elements and re-size a third as stated in the blog post

set their width and height as normal

9314626

the error message itself is rather confusing but by default cross-domain ajax requests are blocked by ie but do not appear to be so by other browsers - or at least google-chrome and firefox will function to that effect

9314641
min	max
besides the reasons specified by remus there is less practical need to support min and max

9314641
min	max
unlike count or sum max and min are fast to calculate - you are all set after just one lookup

9314822
hash	salt
this wouldn t be that helpful for open source code but for custom applications having part of your system salt in the code would be yet one more item required by an attacker to calculate the hash value properly

9314822
hash	salt
an additional password storage defense mechanism involves storing the salt in a different location than the password hash

9314822
hash	salt
use of the server s filesystem is one commonly used mechanism for salt isolation assuming the password hash are stored in different location such as a database or ldap server

9314822

be careful to ensure that both the password hash and the salt are not backed up together they should also be backed up in isolation

stdout	stderr
it also outputs the message to both stdout and stderr and terminates processing

9315651
integer	unsigned
if you want to reinterpret the float as some type that left shift makes sense on a suitably large unsigned integer type for some horrible bit hack like carmack s square root well you can do that too but on modern hardware it is highly unlikely that you really need to seriously consider if there is a better way to do what you want

9316449
post	get
_get and _post are empty because you are using the post protocol but sending variables through the get method encoding them in the url

9316449
post	get
the _request variable on the other hand operates on a different mechanic where it will parse all variables from the request whether they came from cookies multipart data post get etc

9316449
post	get
typically scripts and applications work off the _request data anyway as it s a much more concise collection of all the data and since you can t technically ever have get and post data in the same request you don t have to worry about collision between the data sets

stdout	fflush
fflush stdout

9318138
stdout	fflush
note you typically don t want to use fflush stdout unless you are debugging its really resource intensive and if you care about speed performance at all it has the potential to slow you down

9318532

when i get rid of the this my application builds but just never loads i put a printf 1 at the top which doesn t even run

9318781
pull	push
that said you can still run into issues if two people manage to push to the same branch at the same time more likely if one person thinks they re up to date and can push then before they manage to push someone else pushes so the first developer has to pull before pushing

9318888
tar	md5sum
to version these secrets keep the md5sum of the tar ball in a versioned file config secrets.tar.md5

9318888
tar	md5sum
write a rake task that expands the tar ball over your app only if the md5sum matches the versioned md5sum

9318888
tar	md5sum
you could include the md5sum in the filename of the tar ball meaning that from a version of secrets.tar.md5 in the repo you could identify the specific tar of secrets associated with that version

9318899
uiview	uiwindow
i have a uiwindow with a hard-coded uiview inside

seam 2.2 richfaces 3.3.1 jsf 1.2 jboss 5.1

9319403
width	height
pixelwidth height is from writeablebitmap so if you have some other source you might have to use another method property to get the width height

9319416
post	put
you are checking if the post has thumbnail the problems is that you put wrong code in else statement you have to put something like

9319428
getter	setter
perhaps you should add your class as an owner of the dependency property and override the getter and setter there

9319432
post	get
update i ve pretty much done the script now i ll post the full script once i get over this last hurdle

9319538
google-chrome	firefox
tried both google-chrome and firefox google-chrome is much worse normally a 2nd or 3nd link clicking will trigger

9319572
getter	setter
or you could remove the sythesize line from your implementation if you don t plan on needing the setter getter methods

9319582
getter	setter
you can always write getter and setter

9319586
google-chrome	firefox
if i don t specify a height my divs size properly in google-chrome and firefox but in ie7 it only displays a thin background and the content overflows

9319588
filtering	grouping	sorting	grouping	sorting	filtering
also the filtering sorting grouping etc..

9319619
put	get
the scripts create output.php with permissions 644 no execute and only owner can write and i am unable to manually change the permissions to 777 - although i would prefer to get a way that allows the scripts to create it - so i can empty the folder periodically for backup reasons and not have to remember to put it back in etc.

9319636
internationalization	localization
see also internationalization and localization

9319657
getter	setter
by always using the setter and getter methods for a variable you can avoid releasing an object and referencing the instance variable later when it may not be safe

9319737
min	max
this code is not complete of course it doesn t check for the max min values of the pages and there s no way of replace the letter but it should point you in the right direction

9319829
udp	tcp
datagramsocket are by definition connection-less -- here s a good page about the differences between udp and tcp for posterity

9319863
std	ostream
of course instead of std cout you can use any ostream

9319911
post	get
to get a feeling of using solver foundation with f# take a look at these interesting blog post

9319931
128bit	64bit
1 neon instructions can only load and store entire registers 64bit 128bit at a time to and from memory

9319943
getter	setter
what you may wish to do is make color and orange implement an interface named either nameholder if you want to expose both a getter and a setter or namesetter if you just want to expose the setter

9319977
for-loop	loops
i also changed the for in loops to a normal for-loop

9319980
background-color	transparency
for modern browsers i can use background-color transparency but ie6 doesn t support background-color transparency

9320003
easymock	unitils
i know there are many options out there for java unit testing including dbunit easymock unitils etc

9320035
google-chrome	firefox
everything vertically aligns fine in ie7+ firefox google-chrome etc

9320035
google-chrome	firefox
everything remains vertically aligned in firefox google-chrome even ie7 but for some reason ie8 goes screwy

9320167
vim	emacs
install emacs vim and eclipse+pydev

9320210
width	height
you could then use the left top width and height of the clipping rectangle once the position is chosen to actually do the crop in-memory

9320214
width	height
the example for the rectangle then went on to use width and height

9320228
post	get
ajax get post requests were returning null in ie

9320257
width	height
the problem is that a rectangle is not a square - you also cannot even say that a square is a rectangle because this causes a lot of problems too since a rectangle usually offers methods to independently set width and height - this would be constrained by a square - this is a classic violation of the liskov substition principle

9320257
getter	setter
from a rectangle class assuming getter and setter methods exist for

9320257
width	height
both width and height

9320258
width	height	inherited	properties
you should invert the inherited and you will discover that rectangle just have width and height and square has an additional properties called size

9320268
for-loop	arrays
your for-loop skips the last element in the datasource arrays

9320284
width	height
the key here is the border-radius being equal to the width and height of the ball

9320301
resharper	justcode
plugins like resharper coderush and justcode should be able to juggle the method between classes

9320320
rss	feed
i m trying to import the last 5 posts from a wordpress rss feed and show them on my site

9320343
stdout	stderr
btw though this is ugly it is basically how stdin stdout and stderr are #defined in most implementations in fact all the implementations i have seen

9320356
children	parent
the correct solution is for square and rectangle to be siblings children of shape not parent child

9320371
getter	setter
for now you unfortunately need to declare all getter and setter by hand

9320407
cloudant	couchdb
but the couchdb community is helpful #couchdb and luckily there are companies out there cloudant iriscouch that offer services from free to big business

9320498
profiling	debugging
obviously you would want to run your profiling against a debugging or staging build rather than your production system

9320505
qobject	qnetworkaccessmanager
the parameter in the qnetworkaccessmanager constructor is only needed to specify a qobject based parent which will be responsible for cleaning up deleting your object later and isn t necessary if you plan to call delete on it yourself

9320505
put	get
i m not quite sure what you are referring to by never loads or where you put a printf but in order to get anything back you need to actually keep the qnetworkreply pointer that is returned by the call to get

9320507
width	height
you may need to set the width and height too like

9320511
accessor	properties
the code can then call the object s accessor for the properties

9320511
accessor	properties
the simplest way to do that is to omit nonatomic which is how most people reflexively declare their properties from the properties declaration which will cause the properties accessor to be atomic

9320528
try-catch	exception-handling
i can see that you re not interested in exception-handling handling which is fine for now for a program of this scale but there are more visually-pleasing and readability-increasing solutions such as merging the consecutive try-catch blocks into one or simply declaring the function to possibly throw

9320559
screens	tablet
this means tablet and phones with screens size 5.1in+

9320560
rss	feed
i m adding some custom itunes podcast tags to a rss feed

9320564
public	protected
convention for exception serialization in .net is to mark the serialization constructor protected rather than public

9320604
switching	screens
you can sniff for the screens size and using an if statement if binary or a switching otherwise to set the orientation of the view manually

9320668
profiling	debugging
in ad hoc builds i see the application didregisterforremotenotificationswithdevicetoken event called but not when i use a debugging build using a developer provisioning profiling

9320669
jtextpane	jeditorpane
edit i found in an old thread that mentions the usage of the property endoflinestringproperty which makes sense since the jtextpane extends jeditorpane which uses a document

9320691
folder	directory
java packages can be treated as folder or directory on linux unix

9320701

you can use the css letter-spacing property in combination with font-size for starters.

9320712

it s width height top and left properties are animated and it is given position relative

9320876
google-chrome	firefox
now i copy this same svg i upload it to a remote host and both google-chrome and firefox render xml code

9320892
width	height
i think you opened lightbox first and then you can t fill it up gently with post response since lightbox had width and height already

9320926
nsobject	nsmanagedobject
however nsmanagedobject inherits from nsobject

9320926
nsobject	nsmanagedobject
it is not possible to use instances of direct subclasses of nsobject or any other class not inheriting from nsmanagedobject with a managed object context

9320934
opera	firefox
the problem is quite clear there - webkit interprets the 20 padding as 20 of the parent s content box while firefox and opera interpret it as 20 of the parent s total box including the parent s padding

9320943

explode	implode
now you can explode the fields or make an implode into a comma separate value to form a csv

9321051
integer	unsigned
from the nsarray documentation we can see that the count method returns a nsuinteger which is an unsigned integer

9321051
integer	unsigned
by subtracting 1 from an unsigned 0 we end up with the largest possible unsigned integer you can actually get

9321066
getter	setter
it s silly that it doesn t do this already and also that it has specific getter and setter for pretty much every primitive type and a few different object types instead of generic ones that just work in terms of object or at worst number string and parcelable in my opinion

9321074
libxml2	libxslt
i installed and linked libxml2 and libxslt via homebrew

9321149
g++	gcc
and compiled it with gcc not g++

as far as i know when the view post back the data mvc framework uses the id of form controls to map them with the parameters of an action of your controller.maybe that s why you can t get the right data

lxml	libxslt	lxml	libxml2	libxml2	libxslt
note that some of the python purist dislike the default set of python bindings rather than complaining i suggest they have a look at lxml the more pythonic bindings for libxml2 and libxslt and check the mailing-list

9324560

the lxml xml toolkit is a pythonic binding for the c libraries libxml2 and libxslt

9324560
lxml	elementtree
but with a a pythonic api compatible with the elementtree library in the standard library so this means the standard library documentation will be useful to learn how to use lxml

9324560
lxml	libxml2
that s why lxml is preferred over libxml2 even when the underlying implementation is the same one

9324560
lxml	beautifulsoup
one interesting thing to note is that if you have installed lxml beautifulsoup will use it as explained in the documentation for the new version

9324560
lxml	beautifulsoup
anyway even if beautifulsoup uses lxml under the hood you ll be able to parse broken html that you can t parse with xml directly

9324560
lxml	beautifulsoup
finally note that lxml also provides an interface to the old version of beautifulsoup as follows

9324560
lxml	beautifulsoup
so at the end of the day you ll probably be using lxml and beautifulsoup anyway

9330194
mouse	keyboard
keyboard one works fine but the mouse wheel events are a problem

9330222
implements	modifiers	implements	extends
if that couldn t be done then there would be some cases where a class wouldn t be able to implements an iterface and extends a class because they have the same method with different access modifiers

9330236
pop-up	dialog
pop-up a dialog and ask for user something

9330331

bash	zsh
add the below to your .bashrc for bash git bash or .zshrc for zsh file or whatever the equivalent is for your shell

9330342
bash	zsh
i ve tested this with bash and zsh on red hat and bash on cygwin

9330367

i ve seen some tutorials on how to setup a reverse proxy apache nginx etc however this is a vm dedicated for just jenkins and i d like keep it as lean as possible while having jenkins running on port 80

9330383
fadein	fadeout
for some reason your fadein is getting applied to all of the slideoverlays but the fadeout only gets applied to the currently visible one

9330383
fadein	fadeout
i would try to make it so that the fadein and fadeout only effect the actual one you are hovering over

all you need to do is hide and show the slideoverlay

9330461
freebsd	centos
hence i will suggest freebsd centos

9330461
ubuntu	mint
mint by default comes with a lot of pre-installed applications and is also done with a lot of new interface changes so in that way it is pretty similar to ubuntu and wont solve your problems

9330479
hide	show
it binds to click-events of those radio buttons both of them always hide both divs first and then show the appropiate div only the one that belongs to the radio button clicked

9330506
onchange	onkeyup
bind the check to onchange not onkeyup

9330544

9330546
hide	show
to make one hidden and other visible you have to first hide both the blocks then add show on the block you want to see

9330568
getter	setter
don t use getter and setter too excessively

9330568
width	height
store width and height of your bitmap in public fields of your gameobject class and access them directly

9330568
width	height
if you are still concerned about performance you also may precalculate the width 2 and height 2

9330605
getter	setter
you can then provide getter without setter so that they cannot be modified elsewhere

9330610
qmainwindow	qwidget
so you need to subclass qwidget or qmainwindow and define methods in that class

9330610
pyuic	pyqt
consider reading tutorial about pyuic usage pyqt by example session 1

junit	testng
as told earlier also you can also use testng data provider but if you are using junit you have to use above mentioned method

9330762
getter	setter
while we re on the topic using dot notation for everything is clearly misuse and if the book uses it everywhere it s technically possible i d say it might not be a very good book but it s imho nice for getter and setter

9330797
post	get
post is absolutely not more secure than get as to man in middle attacks

9330797

folder	directory
if it is in the folder directory instead change the last rule to

9330819
post	get
on a post back i get this error

9330856
ienumerable	iqueryable
you may also use iqueryable instead of ienumerable in you repository

9330856
ienumerable	iqueryable
but basically the iqueryable has the sql get generated and sent to the database while ienumerable calls the database then does the query in memory

9330856
ienumerable	iqueryable
this way you may change out the orm from linq to sql to entity framework or anything that can abstract the query to iqueryable or ienumerable

9330891
google-chrome	firefox
however i tried it on internet explorer and unlike firefox and google-chrome when you want to close the modal window it closes the whole browser window with a warning message that says beware the browser s trying to close this tab etc

9330891
google-chrome	firefox
you will see that it works flawlessly on firefox and google-chrome but not in ie

9330891
google-chrome	firefox
i did what he suggested and the result was this it still doesn t work at all on ie meaning that it still asks to close the whole window and not just the modal and correctly shows and closes a first modal in firefox and google-chrome but after closing the first one its not able to correctly show another one

9330908
submit	submission
instead of submission the form the normal way you could bind a callback to the submit event

getter	setter
in the symfony2 project i want to write some custom functions to change some setter and getter in an entity class

9331008
int	double
use double instead of int

9331024
pull	push
essentially the buildserver should check if there s modifications in svn if so then pull those down and then do a git push over to phpfog with the changes

9331035
getter	setter
you can use both the getter and setter of a property with dot notation

9331035
getter	setter
so how to replace the for notation depends on whether you are actually using a getter to get the value of the property or a setter to set the value of the property

9331101
for-loop	loops
other approaches to consider would be walking over the list backwards in a for-loop and removing by index building a second list containing the items to delete and then in a second loops over the second list remove items from the first

9331153
post	get
what it seems to be doing to me is that it s sending a get to the current page instead of a post to the updaterowajax.php

9331153
post	get
edit as i mentioned in my post further down i managed to get it working for a while

9331185

it now works correctly for both keyboard and mouse navigation

9331194
wav	riff
riff wav fmt and data look fine but the numbers in the header may need to be a different order little endian vs

9331212
submit	submission
the issue is because you are calling your updaterow function from the click of your submit button therefore the form is being submitted as it normally would as well as the ajax submission

9331246
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome firefox this works great but in ie if you click on the text it won t let you sort even though the text is within the handle

9331475
post	get
1 instead of using get method sending parameter in url use post method and the parameters will not be in html url anymore and you can do it by javascript

9331476
sin	math.h	cos	sin	cos	math.h
i believe they re just talking about the sin and cos functions included in the standard math.h header

9331476
cos	sin
to the top of your implementation file then call sin and cos with radian arguments

this won t catch google-chrome firefox which work fine with zepto but it does match the zepto team s intentions for the thing which may or may not be better

9331624
inherited	properties
so the job for you is just make sure that the design of your class is consistent and clear and if someone wants to inherited it then should be not dumb to just go and redefine non-virtual properties methods

9331630
entities	entitymanager
in any event a given entitymanager such as formacions needs to be able to see all the relevant entities including those involved in relations

9331636

i hope you know that if you want to define your own number of post you should add posts_per_page x to query if you want to always return all post matched to query put -1 in place of x

9331665
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is that the versions of firefox google-chrome that run on osx are for osx not plain x11 -- so even if you run the x11 server and use xvfb xvnc whatever and pass in display 123 firefox google-chrome don t care because they re not x-based they re carbon cocoa-based

9331680

9331736
sin	math.h
the functions sin and cosine functions can be used in files that import math.h

so unless you change that you already have math.h imported and can use its functions like sin

9331770
google-chrome	safari
i have no idea why this happens and it seems to happen on safari not on google-chrome

9331775

also i m not sure which context.xml ought to be modified there are 2 in the tomcat directory one in the conf folder and one in the webapps appname meta-inf folder

9332281
hash	md5
i would suggest using something like an md5 hash of the user s email instead

9332291
width	height
you can t directly set stage width and height because they are read only

9332294
google-chrome	firefox
it is fine in google-chrome and firefox

9332295
accessor	properties
i would think properties are still used for automatically generating accessor and mutators where public isn t used

filtering the search results by principal attribute values by grouping

9332500
distance	polygons
the polygons is moved based on the user s key-press either in x or z direction by simply adding the moved distance to the centre point and updating the vertices by adding the offset values to centre coordinates

9332504
filtering	grouping
data visible to a user is filtering according to his accesses which can be at the direction grouping or building site level depending on user role

9332508
profiling	benchmarking

9332516
readdirectorychangesw	filesystemwatcher
the .net filesystemwatcher and the readdirectorychangesw function both suffer from the problem that they generate the event even if the other application has not finished writing yet

9332521
opera	google-chrome
it is working fine in google-chrome but i get this error in opera

9332565
hash	md5
something like checking the md5 hash of the files or the files versions etc

9332605
getter	setter
property synthesize pairs autogenerate getter and setter and thus affording encapsulation

9332605

9332625
ostringstream	std
give each thread a std ostringstream to write output to

9332698
client-side	server-side
is there something i can do node.js server-side to keep the existing client-side pattern

9332716

just to let everyone know i gave up trying to get the post solution for this working - i was getting too frustrated with not being able to get any closer to a result and wasting too much programming time

9332716
post	get
instead i went right back to basics and i have changed the string to sign to a get instead of a post and then created a parameterised url which i then call to get the xml result

9332721
getter	setter
in objective-c property is just a abbreviation for standard setter and or getter of a variable in the class

you know even checking if number is equal to zero twice prior every multiplication is too much overhead if you account how low percentage of multiplying operations actually are optimized

9332820
facebook	fbconnect
if you definitely need to remove redirection to safari or facebook app you should open the fbconnect facebook.h class and find the following method

9332822
gson	jackson
aside if milliseconds make a big difference look at the stream parses that both jackson and gson provide for faster raw acess but you will be in charge of parsing logic and rebuilding your objects which may be a net loss

9332825
google-chrome	firefox
i used to implement htmlelement.getelementbyclassname but at least firefox and google-chrome only find the half of the elements when those elements are a lot instead i use something like actually it is a larger function

9332839
width	height
try setting the height and width of the input

9332857
google-chrome	firefox
i am sure you would know this but just as a reminder use firefox s firebug or google-chrome s internet explorer s developers tool and check for the post

9333023
versioning	upgrade
assumed this is a trivial upgrade and i just switched the versioning number in pom.xml

9333043
versioning	upgrade
difficult and not optimal since you won t be able to upgrade your site to late ci versioning easily

9333052
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
firefox google-chrome opera and safari all handle it better

9333058
width	height
but combining both only does the centering even when using height 100 and width 100 on all elements surrounding the img

9333081
post	get
what i d do is add a method in my post model to get the first comment according to your criterias

9333084
sorting	grouping
i am basically deleting all the grouping with no particles sorting them according to the number of particles and showing some properties

9333162
width	height
basically the image needs to take 100 of the height and width of the size of it s container

9333162
width	height
in the fiddle you can easily see it scale to the width but since the height of the fiddle is slightly more fixed it s harder to tell

9333271
config	ini
i m using the default zend_application design pattern which loads a zend config ini file automatically in the application bootstrap and i need to ini file s variables across many models and controllers

9333351
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
but to loops through an arrays you re really better off with a regular for-loop

9333357

safari 5.03 ie 6-9 firefox 3.6-4 google-chrome 8 ios 3.2-4.2 android

9333388
mouseup	mousedown
you could create a date in the mousedown then another in the mouseup and only fire your click zoom event if the difference between the two dates is greater than some threshold i would guess 1 10 of a second but you may want to experiment

9333390
equals	gethashcode
either override equals and gethashcode methods in the classes because your class needs to know how to compare instances see msdn for how to then you can call

9333429

9333473
mousemove	mousedown
basically if the user has mousedown and mousemove then panning is true

9333476
put	get
they normally get put into library developer xcode deriveddata project_name_and_random_crap build products build_type project_name .app

9333498
mouseup	mousedown
basically it calls dozoom only when the mouse has not moved between the mousedown and the mouseup events

9333511
solrj	rsolr
if you are using any client for solr like solrj rsolr you can easily iterate through the directory and execute the http urls to index the documents

9333517
folder	directory
the context.xml in your web application s meta-inf folder will take precedence over the one in the conf directory which is really just a generic default

9333540
int	chars
operator is not defined for types chars and int

9333558
portrait	landscape
the view controllers turn only to landscape view as i want but not the table view controller only in the portrait view .in supported device orientations i deleted portrait and upside down and i wrote in every class

9333603
min	max	range	min	range	max
the plot parameter xlim takes exactly two values the max and min range to plot

9333610
swt	swing
in my opinion swing is easier to learn and to use but the results of swt are often nicer - you can often feel that a swing application behaves not completely right

9333620
lxml	beautifulsoup
i ve not actually done this before but there are answers already on stackoverflow that explain several ways of doing with the aid of python libraries like lxml or beautifulsoup

9333623
children	parent
it works correctly when the example has parent properties set but it does not filter on children properties

9333632
libpcap	ebtables
sounds like you could use iptables ebtables to stop the forwarding over the bridge and use libpcap in your program to pick up the packets frames you would like to forward with your program

9333783
int	chars
assuming you are trying to create a 32 bit int out of 4 chars there is probably more checking you can do but at a minimum i would turn this into two methods convertchararraytouint and another one that does each shift shiftcharleft chars numbits and hide all the casting ugliness in there

post	get
the options http verb is used by the browser to query the web server about the url not to get its contents or post data to it

9334146
post	get
your server doesn t respond with the correct header data on a cors request so your browser assumes it has no rights to access the data and refuses to get or post to the url

9334168

9334188
width	height
i m trying to make some html with css pages i m new to both and i want to add styles to a table header with column long names this names are required to be long but the column width is fixed making these columns without css would show them with text wrapping so the row height would show just not nice

9334195
width	height
i know i need a height and a width

9334221
width	height
width and height toggle each rotation for example

9334221
width	height	portrait	landscape
in some it works as expected in others it interchanges the values so that i get large width in portrait mode and short in landscape in others it gives fixed width and height all time in others it doesn t rotate at all..

innodb	myisam
every query doing joins cannot have a mixture of innodb and myisam or else every select query deteriorates with full tables locks on both the myisam and innodb tables

9334379
innodb	myisam
here are some other posts i made that fully clarify innodb vs myisam

9334385
post	get
finally here is the response that i get from firebug with a post that does not include an attachment and then a very similar post with an attachment

i had to do the same copy var blobstorage to the new location and change the owner and group to plone with chown -r and chgrp -r

9334546
stdout	stderr
so in the case of 2 1 it seems that 2 stderr is made to be a copy of 1 stdout

9334546
stdout	stderr
i ve tested it with the other way around makes stdout to be a copy of stderr

9334546
stdout	stderr
when run on command line hello is output to stderr not stdout

9334564

however as most have pointed out setting the height width of the html and body element will fix this issue which is what i recommend

9334747
stdout	stderr
testing with a simple program that prints yay to stdout and nay to stderr i can confirm your test results

9334764
int	boolean
i think the other values don t need to be stored because false is the default value for boolean and zero is the default for int

9334796
post	get
probably changing extension of static page from .html to .aspx is not enough and iis is still limiting it to only allow get requests but visiting application on facebook passing data to canvas url via post

9334809
inherited	subclassing
if you want to express that the fields you store sprites and bodies can be any subclassing of these classes just declare those fields with these types inherited will take care of the rest

9334850
division	multiplication
its important to notice that neither python or wolframalpha will not give you the mathematically right answer since in math we do multiplication before division and in python and have the same precedence so will evaluate left to right

9334891
udp	tcp
you sould also use tcp or another protocol which ensures that data arrives correctly i guess you already use tcp and not udp as you use ftp

9334895
pop-up	dialog
i took a different approach and created a wrapper native app that pop-up a dialog for javascript

9334966

uitableview	reloaddata
when the code reaches the reloaddata line it does not fire the uitableview reload methods

so far the best out-of-the-box filtering and sorting that i have found is the collectionview and collectionviewsource duo

9335012
super	self
i had intended on using self instead of super which was a typo on my part

9335012
super	self
ok so changing super to self does fix the problem

9335061
hide	show
i also have a button to show and one to hide using the above code method

9335061
hide	show
if i enter a value into a textbox and then click the hide button and then click the show button when the panel reappears the values are zero

9335061
hide	show
just the show hide buttons

9335077

alternatively you can use jquery filter method to filter all the images which have width greater than height and then add the required class at once

9335117
temporary	tablespace
i m trying to create a temporary tablespace that would be half the size the temp tablespace

9335123

if it isn t giving you a proper width height on the image then it could be that it is calculating the width.height before the image has been loaded

9335219
mouse	keyboard
it can include keyboard events mouse events

9335221

i obviously don t want to put a bunch of html into my pom.xml so i need a way to read my header.html as a maven property

i have seen a few post which suggest using something like the following inside the block which downloads the images asynchronously in order to invoke setneedsdisplay on the main thread and get it to display quicker

9335317
opera	firefox
p.s. i tested this in firefox 10 ie9 maxthon 3 and opera 11 with same error

9335321
coalesce	isnull
you can also use the isnull or coalesce functions like thus should the values be null

9335325
mouseover	mouseout
3.use mouseover and mouseout on the link to enable disable the blur event for the field

9335325
mouse	keyboard
this doesn t work with keyboard tabing since the mouse is not involved

9335463
mouseleave	mouseenter
instead of mouseenter and mouseleave function u cud use hover function more elegantly

9335532
setinterval	settimeout
and i think you want setinterval not settimeout

9335536
ingres	oracle
i m trying to replicate an ingres update tbl1 from tbl2 command which doesn t exactly exist in oracle

9335540
hide	show
show and hide button definition to show hide the panel is in java script

jobs	cron
if you use hirefire though don t schedule jobs to run in the future -- just queue them up when you want them to run perhaps inside a rake task run by heroku s cron addon

9335744
jobs	cron
then inside your cron task divide all the users into groups of the appropriate size queue up a background job for each group and let hirefire start an appropriate number of worker processes to finish all the jobs promptly

9335763
jtextpane	jeditorpane
examples for jtextpane and jeditorpane

9335805
post	get
for single pages post just request the url via an ajax get and then parse the content out you need from the returned html

9335823
qmainwindow	qdialog
usually qmainwindow is the main window and other spawned sub-windows by main window are qdialog

9335823
qmainwindow	qdialog
though it doesn t hurt to use the qdialog for main window you might find qmainwindow more convenient with all those menu bar status bar toobar etc

9335873
width	height
use javascript to remove the height and width attributes of your imgs and then use css to set their width and or height to 100

9335891
folder	directory
manually adding every single directory in the taglib folder to the include paths this changed nothing

9335934
uiview	uiwindow	uiapplication	uiwindow
in addition the uiapplication object maintains a list of all the windows uiwindow objects currently open in the app so through those it can retrieve any of the appâ s uiview objects

9335987
superclass	subclassing
i have a superclass and a subclassing in different packages

9336032
pthreads	fcntl
use file-locks fcntl or flock on pthreads systems

9336122

maybe i ll also give the user the option to select which of the available fields to display and then show hide those fields accordingly

9336166

it worked separately before i tried to implement my user system and now i can t get it to where the user can edit or remove his post and the admin can do it all

9336175
width	height
when it comes time to draw onto the canvas you will need an array that has the x y width height coordinates of each possible sprite in the larger image

9336204
portrait	landscape
in some cases screen.width is what the currently width is - in portrait it s a small value in landscape a large one

9336204
width	height	portrait	landscape
in some it works as expected in others it interchanges the values so that i get large width in portrait mode and short in landscape in others it gives fixed width and height all time in others it doesn t rotate at all..

9336228
put	get
then just send data to it with http put and or get and view the results over the interweb

9336233
superclass	subclassing
yes it is possible to do what you re asking although there are definitely better ways to accomplish it - the most obvious would be to create a default implementation of myinterface and then a tracing subclassing of it that extends and logs before invoking the superclass version

9336246
switching	screens
if the window is already in extended display mode when wm_size maximize is sent there is no problem because the max window size is set to allow full screens however if they attempt to maximize from the minimal mode i can t get the app to switching to take up the full screens during the message

9336251
daemons	systemd
the agentx protocol is a way for arbitrary applications to supply snmp services to a running systemd snmp daemons

out of frustration i even copied 7z.exe to the php script directory but i m still can t get it to work in this case 7z.exe complain that it cannot find archive even though everything is located under the same folder and the archive does actually exist

9336408
folder	directory
for links of the form pages page i want them to go to the root directory and pull up page.html from the pages folder

9336505
post	get
i want to get the # of circles that have huffington post for example

9336517
int	chars
the first one is a string with a particular hex value forced into the first chars position the second one is an int

9336556
google-chrome	firefox
it works on firefox google-chrome and ie8

9336584
rubygems	rvm
after reading and thrashing around for 2 days and trying many things found in other notes the following single line was the cure for me on ubuntu lucid 10.04 mixed with some maverick packages and rvm ruby 1.9.2-p290 rvm 1.10.2 rubygems 1.8.15 rails 3.0.1 postgres 8.4.10

9336616
post	get
look into mysql_real_escape_string to help prevent the horrible security holes in trusting _session vars get post or any others the user can spoof as well

9336631
portrait	landscape
i tried it on the ipas simulator and it return 264 in portrait mode for a qwerty keyboard but when you start the app or rotate to landscape mode it returns 1024

9336631
width	height
so you might need to ask for the width instead of the height in landscape mode.

9336639
folder	directory
you could set up an ssh key with no password and put it in the .ssh folder of the cron user s home directory so that it is used automatically

9336701
multiplying	addition
multiplying probabilities is equivalent to an addition and summing is done by using the formula

9336701
factors	matrix
solution after a discussion with jonathan dursi i decided to factorize each matrix and vector by its largest element and to store that factors in the log domain

9336701
factors	matrix
before additions i have to factorize one of the added matrix vectors by the ratio of the two factors

9336731
hide	show
if i understand correctly you want to hide the content div s offscreen and animate them in on a mouse-click while hiding any currently show div s

9336733
dbcontext	objectcontext
it will definitely break all your code using ef because you will change objectcontext api to dbcontext api with completely different public interface

9336741
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
note that shared workers are in google-chrome safari and opera but ie and firefox have not committed to supporting shared workers yet

9336759
uiview	subviews
i for myself would just add a uiview containing that shadow as a subviews and reposition it as soon as the view on the right side is animated

9336760
awesomium	berkelium
if you need a browser try using webkit chromium berkelium awesomium commersial or chromiumoffscreenrenderer lgpl fork

9336776

if you render it in google-chrome or safari or any webkit browser i could get my hands on the div will be numbered 1 2 3 4

9336810
int	chars
i have read that the method at int returns the reference to a chars and throws an exception in the case the index is wrong too long or negative

9336875
postgresql	mysql
you would store it in an sql database such as mysql or postgresql

9336960
consistency	acid
although consistency in cassandra is used in a slightly more specific sense than for acid databases in general

9336984
vertica	greenplum
cassandra greenplum and vertica all handle huge amounts of data but in very different ways

9336988
put	get
what this will do is put the top of the a still at the top of the page but allow the text to get bumped down

9337019
width	height
for this thumbnail when i render the image i want to put height and width attribute as it is recommended

9337019
width	height
what is the recommended height and width attribute for this case

9337043
width	height
the height and width attributes tell the browser the dimensions of the space on the rendering canvas to use for the image

9337053
setinterval	settimeout
otherwise you would need to do setinterval in a settimeout to make sure they were spaced evenly

9337059
width	height
if not you ll end up changing the height and width later anyway so the attributes with dummy values wouldn t really serve any useful purpose

9337063
width	height
no you should not put an incorrect width and height on an img element

9337063
width	height
then you can specify the width and height on the img and not incorrectly stretch any images

9337070
width	height
if you are building a uniform grid that contains non-uniform content you could set the height and width on the containing divs table cells what have you

9337125
ienumerable	iqueryable
in this case it won t because collection is ienumerable and i need it to be iqueryable in order where to work

9337127

my issue with this is while this is the first case where i found actual use for the isp interface segregation principles in my own code though i m far from sure whether this actually sensible use of the concept i m afraid that this class might do too much and violate the srp single responsibility principles

9337258
keydown	keyup
you do have to explicitly post a keydown and then a keyup event

9337280
openshift	cloudfoundry	openshift	engineyard
you should consider one of the new breed open paas such as cloudfoundry openshift cloudify these paas solutions as opposed to heruko or engineyard allow you to on board your own sinatra application on any cloud

9337292
range	minimum
the query below gives me the minimum and maximum times of a users transaction on each date in a date range

9337304
margin	height
this will add about 16 pixels to the height but won t add the margin 10 pixels padding another 10 pixels or border 1 pixel

9337318
hide	show
i have a toggle event that is being used to show and hide a div and it is hooked up inside a backbone view and called via an event delegate

9337319
put	get
instead you ll need to write your own ajax request to get the new html put it in the element then call fadein

9337319
post	get
i used get here but you could just as easily use post or ajax

9337355
submit	submission
your form submit event needs to return false to stop the form from actually submission

9337361
fadein	fadeout
the reason you need to do this is fadein fadeout changes the display value of the map container which effectively takes it in and out of the dom

9337395
apache	nginx
when i restarted apache or nginx i would get all the routing errors that i had caused since the first logged one then the log would fail to write anything new until i restarted the underlying server

implements	extends
all you need to do is implements the class that extends abstractthreadedsyncadapter and the service class that binds to it along with the xml files for the sync adapter

9337463
fadein	fadeout
you should also move your calls to fadeout and fadein into the success callback

9337470
firefox	safari
it shows in different versions of ie firefox and even older versions of safari 5.0.5

9337470
post	put
the html this is not the complete html there are a lot more images in the div i just didn t want to put too much html in the post

9337473
stdout	stderr
specifically r will output its normal output to stdout and its warnings and errors to stderr and you can deal with those streams separately rather than seeing them together

9337473
stdout	stderr
for example you can send stdout to a file and keep stderr in the terminal

9337475
trie	tree
in this case a general trie might be easier to deal than the more specialized radix tree but the requirements in space are a bit higher

9337475
trie	tree
note i m suggesting a radix tree instead of a trie because the space requirements for the former are much smaller

9337481
firefox	safari
everything works fine in ie 9 firefox and safari but the when i view the site in ie 8 or below the styles disappear

9337490
int	double
input from double to int

9337494
ienumerable	iqueryable
in this case it won t because collection is ienumerable and i need it to be iqueryable in order where to work.

9337549
range	minimum
this is applied as a scale to the desired range width of values and added to the minimum value

9337553

this could hide show the sale price behind another element

9337610
single-quotes	double-quotes
to prevent bash from doing this wrap your awk program in single-quotes instead of double-quotes

9337632
awt	swing
documentation is sparse right now but it s pretty solid except for awt swing memory leaks i haven t figured out yet

9337672
tax	shipping
you ll need to set up a script on your server which accepts a post with shipping address data from paypal and requires you to return an appropriate response as output including the tax shipping amount

9337672
tax	shipping
this will then be used during checkout as the shipping tax amount

9337672
tax	shipping
after which you must calculate the appropriate tax shipping amounts and return a proper callbackresponse message

9337672
tax	shipping
once paypal has received this information it will update the shipping tax charges automatically

9337689
pull	push
then each client will be able to make changes and push them to the server and pull changes from other users

9337724
vb.net	vb6
having worked with vb6 and vb.net it was straightforward to convert

9337734
client-side	server-side
backbone provides mv structure for your client-side development so it is complementary to and independent of whatever server-side framework or library you choose

9337734
ember.js	backbone.js
there are many options for client-side mvc or mvvm code organization such as knockout.js and ember.js but personnally i prefer backbone.js which has less magic but offers more control

9337739
hide	show
now i know i can simply assign the image to its own layer than manipulate the layer but in our case we have a 6 x 6 matrix of images that we just need to show or hide individually and creating 36 layers as opposed to a single layer with 36 images on it just seems crazy to me

9337755
accessor	properties
oddly modules also gets a warning about missing accessor for a simple properties that also has its dynamic in the .m file

9343852
width	height
though remember you should as a safe practice provide width and height whenever possible and remember float elements if you decide to use display block and float the elements which is a general practice in css have sometimes the need of a clearfix class you can google it but in your case i don t think it would be necessary if you provide width and height

9343868

i have been incredibly confused as a newcomer to this technology because in addition to all of similar sounding products released by couchbase last year couchbase couchbase single server membase couchbase mobile they now seem to be dropping combining all of them into a single project couchbase server

9343868
membase	couchdb
but that is actually membase not couchdb

9343868
couchbase	couchdb
i understand that couchbase the company no longer provides a distribution of couchdb

9343868
membase	couchdb
it does not implement the http api that couchdb uses it s using a binary protocol that evolved from membase

9343868
couchbase	couchdb
all of the recent information on couchdb mobile seems to point to couchbase mobile

im starting to use backbone.js and im trying to do somthing simple with javascript which is show hide divs

9344133
distance	polygons
if your polygons are most of the time far apart enough you can build the two convex hull and fall back on the easiest problem of finding the hausdorff distance between two convex polygons solution in o n+m

9344133
concave	convex
i just realized that in order of the postulate to work you also need to check that the closest features from the convex hulls belongs to the original concave polygon

9344133
concave	convex	distance	polygons
the updated postulate is then the hausdorff distance d between two concave polygons is the hausdorff distance between their convex hulls if and both closest features are part of the original polygons

9344151

cdr	cons
or you could use an extra level of indirection make l refer to a dummy cons cell which points to the real list and change the cdr of the dummy cons from inside your function

9344878
mouseleave	mouseenter
the problem is because when you only supply toggle with one function that function is called on both mouseenter and mouseleave events - further information

9344878
mouseleave	mouseenter
if you change your code to use mouseenter and add another handler to the .file-hover elements to hide them on mouseleave it should work as you are expecting it to

may using max and min heigh attributes be another solution somthink like

9345033
oncreate	ondestroy
personally i prefer to call bindservice in oncreate and after finish using it call unbindservice in ondestroy

9345039
.when	each
it depends how we design our class.while designing a class we should have the open-closed principle in mind .when we are talking about encapsulation we are talking about modification and when we are talking about inheritance we are talking about extending our application then we as designers should choose what we should protect against modification using private modifiers in our class thus encapsulate our class and what s the open side of our class that is reserved for future extension. protected membmers . think of it as partial concept in .net languages that each class can be separated to different files thus some of them can be extended by the programmer and some others are generated using code generation tools

9345054
apache	nginx
you need to configure a webserver for example apache or nginx to serve your site using fastcgi

for hex to binary reverse the previous example - it s not too bad to do in your head because you just need to work out which of 8 4 2 1 you need to add up to get the desired value

9345545
division	subtract
for decimal to binary it s more of a long division problem - find the biggest power of 2 smaller than your input set the corresponding binary bit to 1 and subtract that power of 2 from the original decimal number

9345545
hex	binary
for hex to decimal it s like binary to decimal only you multiply by 1 16 256.

9345545
hex	binary
for decimal to hex it s like decimal to binary only you are looking for powers of 16 not 2

integer	unsigned
getting a parser error when trying to serialize a ulong array looks like the json.net library isnt checking if the integer is signed or unsigned

9355131
multiplying	add
since you re taking in input as decimal then it s right for you to multiplying 9 by 10 and then to add the 1 in order to end up with the decimal number 91 or interpreted as hex - 5b

9355131
hex	binary
when you want to interpret the binary value of the register as hex for perhaps printing you d build up the string by repeatedly getting the remainder of dividing the value in the register by 16 as outlined here

it works for me if you change the height and width to 1px

9363408

leave those entities in your entity-relationship diagram because that shows which attributes in the parts table is required shouldn t be null for each part type

9363445
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
so now there is a discrepancy this implementation google-chrome mobile safari and opera all follow ecmascript-262 v5.1 whereas ie10 firefox desktop safari all seem to be following the more iso8601 compliant ecmascript-262 v6.0 specification.

9363445
google-chrome	safari
when google-chrome or mobile safari pull the trigger and move to the es6 implementation i think this implementation should go with it leaving es5.1 in the minority

9363978
sorting	grouping
if there is no built-in solution for problem one using scopes and grouping i can just implement a helper to do the late-stage sorting in-memory to solve this though it will provide some headache for complicated cases

width	height
my basic bitmap canvas paint configuration is this font size is 16 and the dimensions of the bitmap are 200x400 width x height

9364509
width	height
there is a convenience method for measuring the width of a text using an instance of paint and call measuretext mytext which works perfectly however i am quite at a loss when it comes to the height as the above given results don t make any sense to me

9364536
hide	show
you might also consider creating your table as an embedded excel document and using excel s hide show functionality

9364555
wicket	stripes
you could use wicket and stripes in conjunction with content control to extend functionality though not within the cms

the sources we have to allow authenticating against are things like active directory username password kerberos generic ldap external openid providers etc

9364648
action-filter	onactionexecuting

update the reason i am looking for an official way to integrate with windows 7 is because the custom keyboard should also replace the default touch keyboard that appears on the login screens of windows 7 on tablet pcs

9365234
onchange	onkeyup
in these circumstances i prefer to use onkeyup instead of onchange for the very reason you re describing

9365372
fadein	fadeout
instead of fadein and fadeout

9365372
fadein	fadeout
jquery remembers the start that the opacity is in when you use fadein fadeout and because you are halting the animation essentially you are jamming fadein fadeout to go to the stopped opacity

9365663
hash-collision	key
however if an attacker has control over the key inserted into a hash table and knowledge of the hash algorithm in use he can provoke a lot of hash-collision and therefore force linear lookup time

9365671
jobs	cron
you can use task queues instead of cron jobs to do deletions it all depends how fast you want to get back to the user

9365676
getter	setter
a derived class can then shadow the property with a non-virtual read-write function which calls the same function in its getter and a new abstract or virtual function in its setter

9365678
post	get
if you re getting information form a form use the post or get methods accessed with and

9365716
google-chrome	safari
these however dont fix the root of the problem which is that webview decides against all logic to suddenly missunderstand the html5 doctype and switch to quirksmode when all other webkit-based browsers safari google-chrome etc behave correctly

9365747
textinput	textfield
note that if you re using a textinput component and expecting its name when the user clicks on it you will actually get the instance name of the child textfield of the textinput which will have an arbitrary name like instance88 so you should use stage.focus.parent.name to get the right instance name of the textinput itself

9365759
japplet	jcomponent
don t use keylistener this listener is designated for prehistoric awt components for jcomponent japplet use keybindings

9365771

you can use s width to get a percentage i m not 100 clear on where the percentage should come from but using the width height and the x y coordinates you can calculate a percentage

draggable	droppable
i m not very familiar with jquery ui s draggable droppable but i hope this helps

9366189

and about that thing that image should not affect the size of the row i am not sure about your intentions on that but if i understood you right then you can provide a fixed width and height to your images in the tag

9366218
getter	setter
probably you can start with org.hibernate.property.basicpropertyaccessor and delegate to org.hibernate.property.directpropertyaccessor when no getter or setter found

9366224
pseudo-class	visited
for what it s worth there is in fact an indeterminate css selector it seems to be treated like other css pseudo-class like visited which also cannot be set through html directly so maybe that is another reason indeterminate can t be either

9366260
children	parent
if you animate the parent the children will get dragged along

9366260

kerberos	ntlm
from the available methods windows authentication is the most secure using either the ntlm or kerberos mechanism

9366540
illegalargumentexception	runtimeexception	illegalstateexception	runtimeexception	illegalstateexception	illegalargumentexception
in this case you should use a runtimeexception descendant such as illegalstateexception or illegalargumentexception and let top-level error handling take care of it

9366542
error-handling	exception-handling
more importantly this code will swallow all exception-handling even ones you weren t expecting and for which you haven t written specific error-handling logic

9366568
int	chars
one is an address a pointer to something doesnt matter if that is a chars or short or int or structure

9366568
int	chars
what they point to is a separate discussion longs are probably going to be 64 bits as well sometimes int shorts probably still 16 bit but not a hard fast rule and chars hopefully 8 bits but also not a hard fast rule

9366568
int	chars
the short answer is the language defines some data types chars short int long etc and those data types have a compiler implementation defined size

geocoding	geocode
depending on where you re getting your street addresses from all you mention is a datasource you might be able to do a big-batch geocode for all the locations in your datasource - move the geocoding from request time to a batch process and just use the request-time geocoding for the ones the batch process hasn t gotten to yet

knowing that your form borderstyle is set on none you can develop something based on the position of the mouse and the size of your rectangles so you must use the mouseenter and mouseleave event as said digvijay

mouseup	mouseenter	mouseup	mouseleave	mouseleave	mouseenter
the mouseup event seems to be firing a mouseleave mouseenter event

9367088
mouseleave	mouseenter
the mouseleave is trigging the animation to shrink the frame which queues a shrink storyboard event and the mouseenter is queuing the animation to expand the frame which queues an expand storyboard event

9367088
mouseleave	mouseenter
by shrinking expanding the frame the mouseenter mouseleave get fired again and the animations both get run again

9367088
mouseleave	mouseenter
you can view the delay in slow-motion by adding to your storyboards to add a 2-second delay and you can verify the mouseenter mouseleave events by attaching a method which writes a line to output in the mouseenter mouseleave events of the frame

9367088
mouseleave	mouseenter
perhaps try using the mouseenter mouseleave events to trigger the events manually after a 1-second delay providing the event should still process

9367088
mouseup	mouseenter	mouseup	mouseleave	mouseleave	mouseenter
for example if the mouseup event triggers mouseleave and mouseenter events then the mouseleave should queue the collapse animation but delay a second and check if the mouse is actually over the object a second later

as a workaround since you are doing the rtsp you know the incoming port numbers of the rtp and rtcp connections

9376147

in first image portrait mode my table is at extremeleft in second image landscape mode i want my table to be at extreme right

i need to use some of them like jintellitype itext docx4j etc

9377065
superclass	subclassing
if i understood well you want superclass to create not just initialize an array of floats when you re constructing any of subclassing

9377133
union	distinct
you can use union and distinct quite easy for this

9377165
mouseup	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown
what you re doing there is when the mousedown event fires on the holder element s you re adding a new handler for mousemove and mouseup to the document on top of any handlers that are already there

9377165
mouseup	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown
you should either only be attaching the mousemove and mouseup handlers once not on every mousedown or you should be sure to remove them on mouseup

9377180
google-chrome	firefox
you could always test it out yourself by reducing the width of the container to something you can test in your browser google-chrome and firefox s dev tools are useful for playing with css within the browser

versioning	upgrade
twitter boostrap has been recently upgrade to versioning 2

9377315
jar	war
parent src test resources logback-test.xml - this is the parent module which wraps all other modules jar files and packages into a war

9377323
mouseup	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown
problem was that basically every time you were pressing mousedown you were binding mousemove and mouseup again and again so after clicking few times all the computation was multiplied by amount of times you ve pressed mousedown

9377323
mousemove	mouseup
you could also namespace the mousemove and mouseup events to unbind by namespace rather then two events separately

9377341
superclass	subclassing
can for example both the method take an object whose superclass implements a subclassing of comparable

9377352
google-chrome	firefox
however if i dont want to go with http transfer i can use ftp4j as well and works well only when browser is ie because in other browsers like google-chrome firefox etc

9377357
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome there is an internal task manager which shows when websites is being pre-rendered in background is there anything similar for firefox pre-fetching

9377402
odoo	openerp
i m trying to insert values into a many2many or one2manhy relation table in odoo former openerp

9377412
svg	vml
i think the problem may be that you are using jquery s click function to bind the event to the dom svg vml that raphael has output when it sounds like what you want to get is the original raphael data object that controls this output rather than the actual output itself

9377468
getter	setter
it does mean you have to include all the setter getter on the top-level object which would then delegate to the respective setter getter in each of those component classes but at least you can isolate all the handling of them into separate classes without the complexity of an inheritance hierarchy

9377477
maven	pom.xml
but if all the modules belong to an single release cycle all the modules will be released togeter with the same version then it is may a better approach to use parent and child modules pom.xml -- because then you can run mvn test or mvn install for the parent pom.xml and maven will do it for all the childs in the right order

9377531
google-chrome	firefox
all dont work in google-chrome and firefox

9377621
folder	directory
if you are on a linux box then you can use a symlink to alias all the entire httpdocs folder to the https directory

9377643
post	get
the sends a get request not a post request

9377648
width	height
the only caveat is that you need to specify height or width for horizontal gradients but that should be fine for your td s

9377653
versioning	upgrade
my current versioning is joomla 1.5 upgrade using jupgrade to joomla2.5

9377661
addclass	removeclass
i have a quite a simple addclass removeclass function which i want to execute onclick like so

9377661
addclass	removeclass
not only does the addclass removeclass not work but also the quicksand plugin which filters and sorts the items in the subsequent list just fine without the short .click-function also stops working

9377696
super	extends
i use a super class that i extends all activity classes from

9377744
superclass	subclassing
from some brief fiddling about i find i get an error when overriding superclass methods in a subclassing when i do the following

9377744
superclass	subclassing
override a protected superclass method with a private subclassing method

9377744
public	protected	superclass	subclassing
override a public superclass method with a protected or private subclassing method

9377744
public	protected	superclass	subclassing
overriding a private superclass method with a protected or public subclassing method

9377744
public	protected	superclass	subclassing
overriding a protected superclass method with a public subclassing method

9377783
getter	setter
you can then implement setter and getter methods for that property in your controller that do the right thing in terms of displaying the blank item and handling the situation where the blank item is selected

9377819
inherited	properties
need give me a list of all properties names from b including those inherited from a

9377870

you see this error often when you attempt to open a folder on the webserver with the intention to get a directory index with a list of files but the server has it disabled and there is no index welcome file

9377988
width	height
what i want to do is the canvas s width and height properties linked to image

9378004
pop-up	dialog
and the browser won t pop-up a warning dialog if you refresh the page anyway

9378007
mouseup	mousedown
setinterval function is used because on single click i want to scroll one div at a time and on mousedown i want the div to scroll till i do mouseup

9378007
mouseup	mousedown
also when i do mousedown in blacberry playbook the div keeps on scrolling till end and does not stop immediately on mouseup and for ie8 the div stops and scroll seems like setinterval is not working properly

9378012

you can upgrade to the latest versioning of vbulletin 4 form any versioning of vbulletin 3 from versioning 3.6.0 and newer

9378023
button	checkbox
the advice for checkbox is eerily similar to that for radio button

9378023
button	checkbox
use addlocal and remove control events on the next or install button each of which condition against the property tied to your checkbox

9378064
superclass	subclassing
if a superclass exposes a method publicly then all its subclassing must also expose the same method or an overridden version therefore reducing the accessibility of a method is a subclassing is illegal in php and pretty much every class-based oo language

9378073
int	chars
the output to this is alright but at the end i am getting a weird chars with -1 since i am printing int value

9378088
getter	setter
super csv relies on the fact that you should have supplied a valid java bean a class with a default constructor and public getter setter for each of its fields

9378096
post	get
if you get stuck something then post a specific question regarding that on so

9378101

i have subtitle srt files with data being generated by the second

9378127
hash	hmac
i ve seen people use a hmac hash of the parameters using a secret key known only to the client and server but i see 2 problems with that

9378127
hash	hmac
some parameters seem odd to make an hmac hash of

9378147
folder	directory
create a _partials folder in the templates directory in your module

9378180
innodb	myisam
most of the documentation i can find points to innodb problems but we are using myisam

9378187
onclick	onchange
i ve replaced the onchange event handler by an onclick event handler

9378187
onclick	onchange
indeed onchange has a random behaviour on internet explorer whereas onclick works fine in most of the case

9378232
sorting	filtering
plus it would have to apply all the view sorting filtering in future .

9378268
sat	np-complete
sat is very important because it is np-complete

9378268
sat	np-complete
sat is so nice because it is np-complete you can solve it instead of any other problem in np and also the reductions are not so hard to do

9378275
inherited	properties
one way to do this would be to setup your datasource using system properties that can be inherited from a properties file and running your tests in a db2-test environment and an oracle-test environment

9378309
pem	pkcs#12
you can either use bouncycastle see this answer how to read a pem rsa private key from .net or use a pkcs#12 container instead for the username + password which you can create using openssl s tools from the pem files

9378345
width	height
what i m trying to do is limit images maximum dimensions to a 128px height or 100 width

9378360
put	get
i ve been playing around with the code up there trying to put more items in the queue but i never get it to work

9378361
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
the inotifycollectionchanged interface along with inotifypropertychanged were designed exclusively for use by the wpf framework

maven	pom.xml
the driver i m using is in my maven pom.xml file as

9378559
migrate	upgrade
however the client is likely to rewrite this code in about six months anyway with the introduction of some new business rules and just wants to migrate it as is during the upgrade

9378587
textview	imageview
each option contains a textview imageview and a radio button

9378598
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
while i really like it s simplicity i ve been continuing to use jquery.validate in all cases except if the user has google-chrome or opera - the firefox native validate is weak still

9378662
google-chrome	firefox
this happend in firefox and google-chrome

9378676
hide	show
in order to be able to react to the keyboard show hide in phonegap android we implemented the linearlayoutsoftkeyboarddetect which is basically a linearlayout but it reacts to changes in the screen size

9378676
width	height
if you rotate the device the width becomes the height and we can ignore the change but if the height gets dramatically smaller while the width remains the same it is safe to assume there is a keyboard being shown and we throw a show keyboard event

9378676
width	height
when the height gets dramatically larger while width stays the same we throw a hide keyboard event

9378693
highcharts	highstock
i need to output a plot on page and i m considering highstock or highcharts to implement this

9378699
post	get
following my comment on your original post here s some more information that will help you get through this

9378740
google-chrome	firefox
try using google-chrome inspector or firebug for firefox

9378787
width	height	portrait	landscape
the goal is to allow a mix of both portrait and landscape images but put some restrictions on the maximum height and width

9378787
portrait	landscape
the problem i can see is that if i resize to a width a portrait image may become too thin and the opposite it true for a landscape image

9378791
onclick	onsubmit
also since you re using jquery you may as well use it properly and separate out your html markup and javascript by attaching event handlers using the jquery functions and not onclick onsubmit etc attributes on html elements

9378825
config	ini
i have created an ini file and put it in the config folder

9378844
svg	vml
classes in svg aren t quite the same as classes in everything else - and in raphael which deals with svg and ie s vml things get even more hairy

9378859
children	parent
so i have a parent object of mytype with many children of the same type

9378878
submit	submission
if you want to validate the form or make any changes the before submission and only submit if the form is valid you can do something like this

9378886
rss	feed
i would like to find out if how it is possible to access read rss and atom feed from wso2 esb

9378891
ant	maven
before starting to use sbt i was doing this via an ant script that would fetch the zip artifact from a maven dependency and unzip it

9378911
post	get
passing information through a web request can be done either by the url in a get request which is what link_to does or through a post operation which usually requires a form

9378914
width	height
the end result both height and width will be with in your bounds

9378934
ant	maven
i have made an ant buildfile that will help me with maven goals

9378950
chunked	transfer-encoding
another pc received transfer-encoding chunked and no content encoding which if i read it right it should replace content encoding

9379004
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the slideshow appears to work in google-chrome 17.0.963.56 firefox 9.0.1 and safari 5.1.3

9379004
google-chrome	firefox
however when i comment out the #imax function the errors go away in google-chrome firefox etc

9379017
firefox	safari
i have the problem that i can not seek an audio file mp3 to a specific position if the file is not completely preloaded when using firefox 10.0.2 the position i want to jump is already preloaded in safari this works flawless

9379064
free	strdup
in the later case you should remember to free the memory allocated for the returned string by strdup

9379074
strcpy	malloc
you should use malloc or strcpy it to a string pointer passed as argument

9379166
maven	pom.xml
if you need to run unit tests in a local windows environment try using maven profile properties to set a version of 1.0.0 in you local maven config and in the pom.xml specify the remote config

9379196
width	height
if i could determine the width and height beforehand i could to it but i don t see how to do that with the event data

9379237
width	height
i want to get the size of this relative layout i.e height and width in my code.i tried it by using getwidth and getheight but it is showing 0

9379271
portrait	landscape
however if i put multiple instances of this control in a layout it results in weird behaviour when rotating a device from portrait to landscape

9379286
opera	firefox
it seems to work fine in firefox and opera

9379327
width	height
now to answer your question use the above link to store the original browser size and compare it to the changed width and height values to see if it was a vertical horizontal or both change

9379347
tunnel	packets
having said this and reading that your requirement is to tunnel the udp packets to the serial interface what you should do is the following

9379347
udp	tcp
so when we send it via the serial interface using udp or tcp whichever you prefer we are automatically again encapsulting the whole packet with one more udp and ip header

9379408
portrait	landscape
once in portrait and once in landscape

9379419
spaces	delimiter
if what you want to do is split the string using either spaces or commas as delimiter you can use preg_split

9379464
screens	tablet
because screens can have minor variations in their dimensions for example some tablet are 1280x800 and some are 1280x720 it s better to use specifications that can stretch and give a bit like match_parent wrap_content and layout_weight

9379491
x86	64bit
assuming you are running your application on a 64bit machine compiling for x86 target makes your program run using wow64 mode 32-bit process on 64bit and you re reading keys under the wow6432node

9379598
webkit	gecko
a way around this is to use pointer-events none which is supported in gecko and webkit but nothing else...

9379610
cpu	processors
i have a server with 32 gigs of ram and intel xeon cpu 2 processors at 2.4ghz

9379613
cos	sin
you shouldn t compute with integers since cos and sin are between 0 1 think about floats

9379617
google-chrome	firefox
works in firefox and google-chrome here at least

9379621
cpython	pypy
another poster said that the pypy compiler runs as a standalone executable separate from cpython

9379631
comparator	comparable
objects that implement the comparable interface like strings have a natural ordering as defined by its comparator method so you can just use arrays.sort

9379656
int	double
i have a program which creates a c structure which contains large arrays of various basic data types int double etc.

9379692
cpython	pypy
one of the reasons why pypy can be faster than cpython is because pypy is compiled to a completely separate native executable and does not depend on nor execute in cpython

9379754
profiling	instrumentation
i think your best best is the boring old diligent programming and profiling with instrumentation to guard against making these calls rather than trying to catch the error at runtime

9379757
post	get
whilst this may not be a better way an alternative approach to circumvent the need of j link would be to set up an intermediate cgi script to translate the request from get to post for you

9379757
post	get
this script file would sit on an accessible server it would take the specified get query make a post request on the target page then output return the result xml in the normal way

9379757
post	get
from the mathmatica stand point this is much simpler as you simply use the built in import method to make a standard get request on the proxy page but get the result xml from a post request on the login page

9379760
datagridcomboboxcolumn	datagridtemplatecolumn
i then came up with the following code to build the combobox in a datagridtemplatecolumn not a datagridcomboboxcolumn

hide	show
so i m looking for some way to either have the os show the window in such a way that it is not made visible to the end user until the owner is restored -or- a way to set a flag on the window so that the os thinks it hid the window using showownedpopups and then i will manually hide the window and set that flag

your span9 div is jumping down due to the animation of the toggle effect jquery adds it animates both width and height so your content that is around the div that is being toggled gets pushed down as the animation goes

the first-child pseudo-element attributes margin 0 to the first element which in this case is the sidebar that is being toggled so once the sidebar is hidden the second span tag the content div doesn t inherited this properties and stays with the default margin applied to the span tag

you should never inject a stateful bean sfsb in a stateless bean slsb

9384673
stateless	stateful
in general it is possible to access certain existing stateful session bean inside stateless bean

9384737
implements	extends
the lazytreegridstoremodel will call store.fetch with a query object parentid value and you can extends your store qrs for example and implements isitemloaded loaditem and getvalues to return the children items appropriate for your data

9384737
children	parent
view the source to see how the children in the json data are using a ref attribute to indicate their parent

9384974
min	max
it will be min 1 max 5 tags

9384990
pull	push
the reason i am choosing not to use a password is ease of configuration for scripting git pull and push events on a windows laptop with python

what you need to do is get the window height and width

9385109
getter	setter
after reading some articles i write the code using shared_mutex and getter setter functions

9385114
width	height
how about saving not only the x y coordinates of the click but also the width height of the view-port

9385279
oncreate	ondestroy
in the running application ondestroy is called and immediately followed by oncreate and the application starts again normally

9385282
folder	directory
therefore you need to add these search directory to your project folder

9385299
versioning	upgrade
my hosting provider manages the server and therefore i cannot upgrade to a later versioning

innodb	myisam
depends on whether your database stores any records to give you that information - mysql myisam does mysql innodb does not

9385409
innodb	myisam
in english - this is one lookup in myisam and n in innodb

9385440
post	get
however according to this post by blake it actually looks like you need both -- it s the only way i could get the example to work

9385461
getter	setter
if you want a two-way link between the values then you could declare a property getter and setter that use the static field as a backing store but that just scares me

9385469
children	parent
the problem is when i run a test using this runner i can see the failures in a row both parent and children instead of grouped together

9385496
post	put	post	get	put	get
the thought is to embed our protocol as application binary in http requests using the standard request methods ie. get put post but not delete and following the http specification

i m trying to stretch a background image to 100 width and height of the parent div

sorting	filtering
to improve performance collection views for ado.net datatable or dataview objects delegate sorting and filtering to the dataview

9385624
google-chrome	firefox
i am not allowed to install any applications on the viewing station but it does have a browser something like firefox or google-chrome

9385637
textmate	sublimetext
sublimetext 2 with the textmate stata bundle is quite good

9385662

most images that have the same height as width show up fine however images that have different height and weights are skewed

9385683
portrait	landscape
i ve implemented ad mob into my app but the banners are portrait size and my app is landscape

9385699
udp	tcp
this is some java code i had lying around thatâ s used for setting the stream encodings on a pair of byte streams but you could do the same with a singleton at least assuming youâ re using tcp stream sockets not udp datagrams

9385751
multiplying	subtract
you can multiplying that result by 2 and subtract 1 for a random double between -1 and 1

9385814
content-disposition	content-type
one way to do this is to set the content-type and content-disposition so the browser will know how to handle the request

9385849
maven	m2e
by using the m2e it is possible to execute maven as part of the build but that way you lose the project management and incremental build capabilities of eclipse

9385866
qmenubar	qmainwindow
don t use the default qmenubar provided with the qmainwindow

9385866
qmenubar	qvboxlayout
this proof of concept example creates a new qmenubar which is added to a qvboxlayout which was added to the mainwindow

google-chrome	safari
looks fine on desktop browsers including safari and google-chrome but not on the iphone..

9385890
qmenubar	qmainwindow	qmenubar	qwidget	qmainwindow	qwidget
qmenubar inherits qwidget so just add a qwidget at the bottom of qmainwindow then create a qmenubar specifying this qwidget as a parent widget

9385989
cakephp	yii	codeigniter	cakephp	codeigniter	yii
most php frameworks such as yii codeigniter cakephp seem designed around the reasonable assumption that the client app will be a browser-- using cookies to manage persistence redirects after posts etc

9386018
pull	push
i would rather have a passphrase-less one than try to use some hacky means of trying to script the push and pull

9386031
hex	binary
in my program i am trying to read data from binary file and then write it s hex representation to txt file

9386032
itextsharp	migradoc
i ended up using migradoc even though it definitely isn t as elegant as itextsharp

9386040
mouse	keyboard
the earth api however allows you to absorb or change any of those event behaviors since you can add a listener for mouse and keyboard events and prevent them from processing as usual or act on them in a completely different way

9386048
matplotlib	scipy
ipython doesn t read the libraries of scipy matplotlib but it does read numpy

9386048
matplotlib	scipy
i noticed that running python uses version 2.7.2 and does import scipy matplotlib and numpy but on ipython the version is 2.7.1 which doesn t open scipy or matplotlib

9386065
subtract	add
my thought was to use getelementbyattribute to find the only image with the style display block and then somehow add subtract one to the div

9386092
ppl	tbb
ms provides ppl concurrent_vector and intel provides tbb concurrent_vector

9386092

symfony	kohana	codeigniter	kohana
of the big ones codeigniter kohana zend cake symfony i think the newer zend has the best support for restful webservices but earlier versions of zend framework had woefully lacking rest controllers

min	max
key-value collection operators are built for aggregate operations count sum min max and not filtering

9386241

the groovy application uses shorthand getter and setter methods for things in the java api

9386289
onchange	onkeyup
the drop down list and text box are both required before i post so i default the submit button to disabled then i have an onchange event on the drop downlist and the onkeyup on the text box call the following javascript

9386291
pull	push
you could either set it up in the workspace and add a build step to commit changed files and push the commit to the server where you want to publish it which should work as long as you don t wipe out the workspace or build on several machines or add additional steps to clone pull the repo with the artifacts from the server you keep them on

9386302
maven	pom.xml	post	get
what you need to do first is get maven to store all dependencies in the build folder this pom.xml excerpt was cribbed from another so post

9386302
maven	pom.xml
then all you would need to do is include the top level jar as a dependency in your pom.xml and maven would handle all its sub-dependencies

9386303
pop-up	dialog
when ie8 is used the file download dialog pop-up i pick a location and the file downloads

9386353
jcomponent	bufferedimage
instead do your drawing in a bufferedimage and then draw the bufferedimage in a jcomponent or a class that extends jcomponent such as jpanel s paintcomponent method

9386385
getter	setter
classic examples are the setter and getter

9386434
getter	setter
as you can see there are no setter getter for count because we don t want users programmers of this class to be able to call mycounter.setcount 100 or even worse mycounter.count - 10

9386446
postgresql	mysql
no more need to extract rows from related tables when you delete records it is automatic no more need to write complex and chaotic scripts to ensure filesystem synchronisation you can migrate to almost any db engine at any time mysql postgresql simplesql.. and more

9386478
hide	show
show or hide control

9386481
base	fractions
a decimal number is a fractions whose denominator is a power of ten and similarly for any number base

9386545
lme4	nlme
more generally you may want to fit a single mixed model nlme or lme4 rather than individual models for each subject

9386647
rational-numbers	fractions
this algorithm is capable of finding the true fractions values of rational-numbers that are artificially terminated due to precision limitations .3333333 would be 1 3 not 3333333 10000000

9386661
uiview	calayer
this does not work because the uiview you are subclassing i assume it is a uiview already is the delegate of its own calayer it cannot be the delegate of more than one calayer at once

9386711
onenote	ms-office
for example the ms-office suite is going to be ran on desktop mode even on a mobile device according to steven sinofsky within the windows desktop woa includes desktop versions of the new microsoft word excel powerpoint and onenote codenamed â œoffice 15â

9386718
free	malloc
yes you can think of it as a malloc but you must deallocate it with munmap mptr 1024 1024 rather than free mptr

9386725
cakephp	yii
i am aiming to write up a web service program in either a php framework such as cakephp or yii or writing it up in ruby on rail

9386725
cakephp	yii
my question is which framework would i be better off - yii cakephp or ruby on rails

9386800
portrait	landscape
phone has a portrait orientation the tablet - landscape

9386804
opera	google-chrome
it works in ff10 ie8 google-chrome 17 and opera 11.61

9386861
folder	directory
trying to use the cleanup command in tortoise svn i get an error about one of my folder not being a working copy directory

9386887
width	margin
most of us are fairly familiar with a simple technique to get css colunms 2 divs side-by site which involves floating one and pushing the other over using margin width auto followed by one of many clearing techniques

9386887
webkit	gecko
once i put a clearing container inside the un-floated colunm exibit c d i notice some strange behavior in webkit gecko browsers

9386906
aptana	rubymine
you can use rubymine ideja or aptana the same as eclipe

9386906
vim	textmate	macvim	textmate
for ruby on rails i offer use textmate or vim gvim macvim

9386950
button	checkbox
it looks like you actually want radio button not checkbox

9386982
google-chrome	firefox
change one of the hidden field s input type attribute from hidden to text using google-chrome or firefox developer tools and watch the text field appear where you can change it and submit whatever value you like

9387003
integer	unsigned
i guess the biggest theoretical array would be the max value of unsigned long or whatever the biggest integer number the latest standard your compiler supports

9387029
width	height
size the webpage to 100 width and height to automatically fit any browser on any mobile device and resolution

9387076
ant	emma
it seems that those only work with ant builds in particularly i ve only read things for emma that seem to require major modifications of the default android files and build script to support the code coverage reporting

9387076
ant	maven
i m now hesitant to move forward on those because i don t want to destroy my android development base pursuing old advice and it requires ant not maven but my earlier work needs maven

9387087
.htaccess	httpd.conf
3 otherwise if you have access to the httpd.conf file try adding that line somewhere in it without the .htaccess

9387106
hide	show
you can simply establish all elements that are not part of the show me element to hide when clicked on

9387124
put	get
it sounds like you need to put the table component into the title band or summary band so you only get one table

9387131
post	get
tried both get and post with the variable in the post body

9387138
youtube	vimeo
in all of my testing it seems that facebook treats youtube vimeo s video embeds differently than our own

9387138
youtube	vimeo
this is in direct contrast to youtube vimeo embed shares which instead display the og description above full-width and the scaled-up og image below also full-width

9387138
width	height
listing multiple og images of varying sizes each with their own og image width and height specified does not seem to have any effect on displaying differently based on context

9387138
width	height
specifying image dimensions via og image width and height do not seem to have any observable effect compared to not specifying them

9387160
pop-up	dialog
in sharepoint this involves an activex control which pop-up a dialog and within this the user opens another dialog to select a certificate followed by ticking an acceptance checkbox and clicking sign

9387173
implements	extends
you could implements your own provider that extends the existing one to add support for groupname which brad wilson explains in his blog

9387181
cvs	svn	perforce	cvs	perforce	svn
if it is a big project you should really consider not editing your files live on your server but edit them locally and use some kind of revisioning system cvs mercury svn git clearcase perforce ...

9387201
switching	screens
you would probably want to switching off screens updating if this works else you ll get flickering as word moves around the document

9387255
children	parent
this example uses a simple two layer hierarchy of two parent foo and bar who each have two kids foox foox and barx barz respectively the outline view is the default one with just two columns and the identifier of the second column is set to children

9387269
children	parent
if the parent message deleted then the children that haven t been selected for deletion won t be accessible anymore

9387270
google-chrome	firefox
i highly recommend you use tools like firebug firefox plugin or at least google-chrome s development tools that offer similar experience

9387289
hash	salt
if you give out an api key store it salt and hash in you

9387289
hash	salt
passwords salt and hash in your service s database

9387289
hash	salt
the consumer should now calculate the salt hash of api key and password

9387425
mouse	keyboard
however i had to initiate the selection with a mouse drag and after that i could use a keyboard to enlarge or shorten the selection left or right arrow keys for a character by character selection and ctrl + left or right arrow keys for word by word selection - up and down arrows did not affect the selection

9387441
disk	ram
i ll need as many images as possible so i don t want to stop after a specific number - ideally i want to keep saving to ram until the user closes the program then i want to dump the images to the hard disk

9387443
ubuntu	debian
it compiles and outputs completely fine in both windows and the debian client i am required to use for school but i much prefer to develop in ubuntu

9387486
codeigniter	cakephp
i prefer ruby on rails first if you want to spend time on php frameworks try cakephp latest version codeigniter easy to use but my feelings - whatever technologies we used - some good principle comes with ruby on rails framework like

9387527
mouseout	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseenter
since you re using jquery you could use mouseenter instead of mouseover --it s designed to protect you from mouseout events when there are multiple items within your target

9387531
mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave
try using mouseenter and mouseleave instead of mouseover and mouseout

9387533
onmouseover	mouseenter
rather than using onmouseover i d recommend using jquery s mouseenter to avoid the multiple firing of the handler due to event bubbling

9387538
mouseleave	mouseenter
to solve your problem i would use the mouseenter event instead - this means when the mouseenter the element the code is executed and then you can use mouseleave to change the animation again when the mouse pointer leaves

9387572
getter	setter
when i was in university doing my cs degree we were told don t do getter and setter in second year and do them in fifth year

9387572
getter	setter
my personal preference is to use getter and setter where absolutely required only and to never ever have public variables

9387574
getter	setter
if you want the superclass attributes to be accessible without being inherited then you need to declare public getter and setter

9387574
getter	setter
if you want some form of validation you need getter and setter

9387591
google-chrome	firefox
i ve confirmed this behavior with several other users and amongst all the major browsers ie firefox google-chrome

9387593
uiview	subviews
you may use them wherever you would insert a uiview as a subviews including within a uiscrollview parent view or as an object to be inserted into an array

9387594
getter	setter
with tools that can generate getter setter at a click of the mouse i never felt the need to break encapsulation even between parent child classes

9387611
inherited	subclassing
furthermore uiwebview is a subclassing of uiview and inherited many of the same methods making view layout the same in both cases

9387612
libxml2	xerces
libxml2 offers a c-style interface if that really bothers you go use xerces though the interface is at least somewhat object-based and easily wrapped

9387612
relaxng	schematron
it provides a lot of features like xinclude support with callbacks so that you can tell it where it gets the file from an xpath 1.0 recognizer relaxng and schematron support though the error messages leave a lot to be desired and so forth

9387612
libxml2	xerces
xerces s sax-style api will work in this capacity but libxml2 is here because it s a bit easier to work with

9387612
put	get
i put tinyxml in this slot because it is about as braindead simple to use as xml parsers get

9387612
std	ostream
you just new up some objects attach them together send the document to a std ostream and everyone s happy

9387638
public	protected
speaking for the c# side if you have a data member field or property that is not public but is useful to child classes and should be available both to read and write then declare that member as protected

9387638
inherited	subclassing
this makes myvalue completely hidden from classes outside the inherited hierarchy and read-only to subclassing

9387638
getter	setter
this would be equivalent to a private field with a protected getter method and a private setter method

9387638
superclass	subclassing
in general as the designer of the superclass it s up to you to define how subclassing should be able to use what you provide

9387647
implements	extends
i have three tabs and each one extends activity and implements view.onclicklistener

9387663
junit	testng
the simplest would be junit which is where most of testng came from at least according to the book

9387665
accessor	properties
seems that in c# the standard practice is to use properties with get set accessor

9387665
put	get
one other benefit of using accessors instead of directly accessing a data member is that you could put a break point on a get set method and see who executed the method

9387680
hide	show
then when the mouse is moved over one of the top level anchor elements or one of them gets focus we hide any previous sub-menu that was visible and show the one applicable to the current anchor

9387686
stdout	stderr
you can use it to wait on multiple file-like objects including a socket and stdin stdout stderr

9387754
inherited	properties
these inherited types can then each have different properties

9387798
getter	setter
a java bean requires setter and getter and serialization

9387798
getter	setter
the tendancy to mix them up probably stems from the fact that many new programmers put setter and getter on every java object anyway so they tend to look identical

9387806
subtract	add
can anybody suggest how to add or subtract row value from grouped row

9387862
oncreate	ondestroy
it s just a suggestion but it would definitely solve the problem you re describing since you could register the receiver on oncreate and unregister it on ondestroy

9387890
scheme	racket
and finally as has been mentioned in the comments the built-in flatten procedure found in some scheme implementations like racket i don t know if it s available in bigloo

9387898
chunked	transfer-encoding
this should happen only when transfer-encoding chunked

9387917
range	minimum
nevertheless to quickly answer the problem you re facing it s a well studied one - range minimum query

9387933
portrait	landscape
so i ve been building myself a mobile webapp and am trying to hide the reshuffle of the layout after the user has rotated the phone i have a portrait and a landscape layout set by js

9387953
width	margin
i had to override the width property from 100 to a fixed width and then add the margin 0 auto

9388022
for-loop	loops
in this case you can use one of the other approaches suggested every or use a regular for-loop since it works the same as the groovy each it s null-safe and supports but doesn t require types but you can break out of loops or return and since you re in a real for-loop it will return from the method

9388032
mouse	keyboard
hold down the control key on your keyboard and drag with the mouse from the navigation controller to your first view controller presumably the one where you are displaying the alert view to create a segue

9388063
hide	show
onclick of hider i want to hide .container and show .shower that s located before closest .container

9388063
hide	show
onclick of .shower i want to hide .shower that was clicked and show next .container

9388071
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the problem works great in webkit google-chrome safari but does absolutely nothing in firefox

9388115
ubuntu	debian
this allows you to keep the two installations separate especially since debian and ubuntu rely on the system version of python for many system utilities

9388125
post	get
the difference is the method to access those methods is either get or post just like spring mvc handles it

9388125
post	get
what i want is when i access the url like this www.bla.com controller addfunction this is get the method that will be triggered is add1 method which is will load view form and then i have form that has an action to controller addfunction at this time because it is post it will trigger add2 method

it looks like i can override gethashcode and equals to do this for me

9401146
subtract	add
subtract step 2 with step 3 divide by 7 and add 1

9401149
websphere	ibm
i have a basic ejb 3.0 java ee 5 project in ibm rad aka eclipse 3.4 and websphere 7.0

9401150
post	get
i found it from another post it can be used to get one single record

9401168
width	height
the effect of this is when width or height of the image being shown in the picture box is smaller than the user control the picture box will expand to fill the user control and if not the size of the picture box is the size of the image so scrollbars are shown

9401177
rss	feed
dear stackoverflow readers currently i m working on a project that makes a request to a rss feed and tries to parse it if that succeeds i want it to post the gathered information into a database

9401193
dynamic-languages	typechecking
while working with dynamic-languages you just have to forget about typechecking and use the existing more general constructs to solve your problem

9401223
post	put
i know i need to for_each each selected product but i am having trouble figuring out how to related the correct radio button from the overall post to the product during the for_each loop to put the values into the mysql table

9401225
equals	gethashcode
the idea is that equals is the natural equality for that type and gethashcode should match that idea of equality

9401225
equals	gethashcode
the overridden equals gethashcode methods do case-sensitive comparisons

9401234
equals	gethashcode
equals and gethashcode provide the true implementation of whether two objects are logically equals

9401237
equals	gethashcode
if the majority of the time you want the dictionary behavior to work by default override gethashcode and equals

9401238
equals	gethashcode
you might not have the option of changing equals and gethashcode .

9401273
post	get
send the post data like this you will get proper output

9401276
ember.js	backbone.js
so started looking at current trending frameworks like backbone.js spine ember.js sproutecore

9401289
disk	ram
a majority of buffers are implemented in software which typically use the faster ram to store temporary data due to the much faster access time compared with hard disk drives

9401310
openrowset	openquery
you must read about openrowset and openquery

9401327
put	get
i think you get the idea or may be you can draw your custom image on canvas put on your framelayout and set 50 trasparent-background

9401348
firefox	safari
the site looks fine in firefox and ie but the form margin in safari is being shifted

9401394
hide	show
i know i can loop through all tag elements and check font sizes and hide them if smaller than 12px but it s not only inefficient but the text can be changed to be show again say after an ajax call which is prohibited

9401404
getter	setter
imho it s never a good idea to change behavior of default getter setter as those are managed by gorm

9401487
hex	binary
the opposite of unpack is pack which is what you re looking for to get this hex string back to binary

9401529
google-chrome	firefox
i ve managed to test it in google-chrome and internet explorer 7 8 and 9 so far and i suspect it would work in firefox too

9401559
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i am running into a problem in ie works fine in google-chrome firefox and safari where a var that i declared at the document scope is undefined and cannot be written to

9401644
int	boolean
boolean and int are wrapper classes for the primitives boolean and int

9401644
int	boolean
you should change your variables to boolean and int and wrap them up later if you must pass them by reference to a function

9401646
put	get
this isnt tested of course and you may have to work with it to put your exact variable names in but i think it should get you there

9401665
implements	sealed
i was going to implements a custom displayattribute in order to allow dynamic display values based on model values but i can t because displayattribute is sealed

9401696
min	max
then i want to find the min value in the same column as the max value

9401717
punctuation	words
turns out i don t need a list of words at all because i was only really trying to remove characters which in this case were punctuation marks

9401743
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i am using a uinavigationcontroller to push a uiviewcontroller onto the stack then when the user selects a row in the table view i allocate a new version of the view controller and push it onto the stack this works fine but then when i start pressing the back button the nsmutablearray that i am using to store the information seems to be keeping the value from the view controller that was just poped from the stack

9401802
oncreate	onstart
for example the order of some common methods called is oncreate oncreatedialog and oncreateview onstart

9401802
oncreate	onstart
so you can call getdialog and have it return something in oncreateview or onstart but not in oncreate or oncreatedialog

9401802
width	height
for example setting the width and height using getdialog .getwindow .setlayout ... ...

9401813

read data from stdout and stderr until end-of-file is reached

9401825
post	get
sorry i ve looked through most of the post that relate to this issue but i just can t seem to get this working

9401849
children	parent
here this modified node class holds only the names of the objects as strings in a node and gives you a set with full node objects when you retrieve either the children or the parent attribute of a node

9401870
avd	galaxy
i am using a database helper class to create the database and this works perfectly on my avd s through eclipse it works perfectly on my samsung galaxy ace mobile phone but on my samsung galaxy tab 10.1 i get an error

jar	manifest.mf
i then run the command jar cvf bg.jar blocktestgui.class manifest.mf and get bg.jar

9401963
jar	manifest.mf
this is my manifest.mf before creating the jar

9401984
spaces	delimiter
tab delimiter documents should be delimiter by the tab character not by spaces

9402002
width	height
enter in the height width or sprite multiple

9402021
dbcontext	objectcontext
you previously used objectcontext api and default code generator or entityobject t4 template but now you are trying to use dbcontext api with poco dbcontext t4 generator

9402033
for-loop	loops
the for-loop is currently running at about 5 loops per second and that seems insanely slow to me

9402123
post	get
i would not normally post all my code but i am desperate to get a solution to this problem

9402239
x86	mips
what you re looking for is a cross-compiler -- a copy of gcc which is compiled for x86 or whatever but compiles to powerpc arm mips whatever code

9402278
atexit	main
the system will maintain a stack of functions registered with atexit and call them each in the reverse order of their registration when either the exit function is called or the program returns from main

9402433
portrait	landscape
my iphone app includes 2 view-orientations portrait and landscape

9402433
portrait	landscape
it starts in portrait but includes 2 view controllers which should rotate automatically to landscape

9402446
folder	directory
make the about page a directory folder with a file called index.php or index.html in it

9402446
post	get
use the post method instead of get methods

9402468
folder	directory
hopefully something more reliable than detect latest file created in directory since i have independent processes necessarily using the same folder simultaneously including other webdrivers

9402475
pow	floor
i am using runc to write a simple function which requires pow and floor truncate

9402475
pow	floor
however once i try to make a separate int function suddenly runc does not have the pow and floor functions and gives me an error

9402524
postorder	inorder	preorder	postorder	preorder	inorder
your task seems to be to evaluate each of the functions postorder inorder and preorder when given this tree

9402537
stdout	stderr
presumably this is because capybara captures both stderr and stdout as part of its standard operation in order to keep things quiet with selenium drivers etc

9402543
jar	war
actually i have digged into all my jar files deployed inside the war file and found this class inside resteasy-jaxrs-2.3.1.ga

9402685
google-chrome	safari
i wanted to view custom events in the timeline of the web inspector of safari or google-chrome s developer tools

9402708
integer	unsigned
if you treat 0 as an unsigned integer the compiler will not perform a signed shift

9402726
ubuntu	linux
if your servers are not windows then you can use ubuntu or amazon linux cloud-init to perform the same task

9402739
valgrind	memcheck
i d like to use valgrind to memcheck my programs of course but valgrind always crashes

9402744
children	parent
i feel like the best approach might be to use 2 separate but mirrored objects one for storing the parent and child keys in the datastore and another for returning the parent and all associated children as a json representation

9402754
innodb	myisam
there are several advantages of using innodb over myisam but if you are using the myisam engine you can have an auto generated compound primary key

9402786
userprincipal	directoryentry
i m trying to load the attribute physicaldeliveryofficename from a directoryentry which is returned by the getunderlyingobject method of a userprincipal instance

9402789
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome it remains this way incorrectly but in ie and firefox they will revert to normal after i ve dropped the row

9402794
cout	cin
i m getting cin cout and endl as undeclared errors despite using

9402797
google-chrome	firefox
the following work in google-chrome and ie but not in firefox

9402819
cout	cin
they are members of the std namespace so you need to qualify them with std std endl std cout and std cin

9402836
cout	cin
after your #include s section or use std cout std cin std endl

9402842
cout	cin
endl cin and cout are in the namespace std

9402842
cout	cin
near the top of your file or to use std endl std cin and std cout

9402843
int	chars
i suggest you replace bool with another type such as int or use a typedef to alias it with int or unsigned chars or something

9402845
qstring	qbytearray
thus it s good practice to keep the unicode qstring world and the byte array qbytearray char world separated and only convert between those two explicitly clearly stating which encoding you want to use to convert between those two

9402845
qstring	qbytearray
wrapping string literals or in some cases qbytearray or char variables holding latin1 data for conversion is the main use for qlatin1string one wouldn t use qlatin1string as method arguments member variables or temporaries all qstring

9402862
folder	directory
after you find it move the .android folder to your user root directory

9402934
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i ve verified that both element.id and element.getattribute id work in google-chrome safari firefox latest and ie 6-8

9402936
google-chrome	firefox
this code works perfect in google-chrome half way in firefox its losing some css for some reason but that is probably a different issue but in ie9 i get nothing but this error

9402951
parsley	robotlegs	flex	robotlegs
i would recommend that you look at application frameworks for flex like robotlegs or parsley which definitely does stuff like this very easily

9402968
comparator	comparable
without generics you could cast the values to comparable or still use a general comparator .

9403010
keydown	keyrelease
ideally i would like it so that a keydown keyheld or keyrelease event is fired and only the controllers with the particular key s bound respond to the event and execute their associated methods

9403027
youtube	vimeo
i am offering users to share video links from various third party sites like youtube vimeo etc

9403031
client-side	server-side
you should keep most of your processing to be done server-side as most if not all client-side scripts can be edited and such

9403070
inline	inlining
although it is possible that inlining a method will improve performance there are several reasons that you might choose not to inline a method

9403070
inline	inlining
if it s only called once then your transformation is basically equivalent to inlining except with additional unconditional branches to and from the inline method

9403073
centos	linux
currently the server is centos linux with a mysql database

9403185
versioning	upgrade
also i just upgrade tortoisesvn svn to latest versioning to see if that would repair a damaged file but no-go

9403190
interpreted-language	dynamic-languages
first i m going to change the name dynamic-languages to interpreted-language which is what i think of with ruby javascript etc

9403208
mouse	keyboard
i want to create a program preferably with c# to lock the keyboard and mouse and show a full screen message saying face front to all the windows 7 pcs in my classroom apart from the tutors

9403227
std	ostream
however this is the place you want to implement the specific logic rather than in the class derived from std ostream

9403227
fflush	gets	std	ostream
just to explain what currently happens when you call the function f is called with the std ostream base which receives the output and gets fflush called

9403227
std	ostream
typically that s all a class derived from std ostream does

9403242
youtube	vimeo
vimeo and youtube both have embed apis that you can use

9403246
implements	extends
all you need to do is to add a small class extends urlstreamhandler and implements a urlstreamhandlerfactory

9403247
implements	extends
i was trying to implements the same using a class based view extends detailview and came up with this

9403249
wav	caf
i ve never found a comprehensive list of them all but google searches provide ones that work for the most common ones such as caf aac mp4 and wav

9403249
mp3	wav
i ve used this before to convert from mp3 to wav

9403249
mp3	wav
also from mp3 to wav to aac. note i dont think you can convert from one compressed format to another

9403258
width	height
i originally hardcoded my width and height of cells

9403337
ubuntu	linux
i have successfully installed spidermonkey js engine on my linux machine ubuntu

9403352
put	get
you don t want to do this directly but in your handlegesture method you could put in a call to aview setneedsdisplay and your view s drawrect will get called in the next drawing cycle

9403387
submit	submission
you will need to use an ajax request to submit at least one of the forms and some jasvcript to pause the form s submission while you send the ajax reques

9403404
put	get
i guess another way of doing this would be to first maybe do a put to mark the top most item as reserved in some way then do a get and delete

9403441
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
but basically finally finished my website but now i m failing at getting it to work in all browsers fine in google-chrome and firefox also checking on browser testing websites seems fine in opera as well but as per usual internet explorer refuses to play nice and the menu s just fail to load all together

9403472
textmate	sublimetext
sublimetext 2 uses textmate snippets so you could use this

9403488
multiplying	add
then to get the true count you multiplying fourbillion by 4 000 000 000 then add count

9403490
for-loop	arrays
having used a for-loop to build your arrays into a comma-separated string sent you down the wrong path

9403536
mouse	keyboard
i found another question with some info to get you started capture and send keyboard mouse input in c#

9403564
bluetooth	usb
as i was guessing at least how i understand it that was a problem with the two serials bluetooth and usb on the same board

9403564
bluetooth	usb
it sends all entries received from bluetooth on the default serial in my case usb

9403571
uisegmentedcontrol	uibutton
i m putting a uisegmentedcontrol and uibutton inside of a uitoolbar with the following code

9403571
uisegmentedcontrol	uibutton
with this code the uisegmentedcontrol and uibutton are static looking controls that don t change their appearance when touched

9403588
multiplying	add
both gems provide a way to create units and work with them aka multiplying add etc.

9403596
rss	feed
pipes to fetch the weather rss feed for you process it and return it in jsonp format

9403618
width	height
i resize the image width according to the browser size but i do not want to change the height because it distorts the picture

9403649
jqgrid	fullcalendar
i ve got a calendar fullcalendar and a grid jqgrid

9403667
ubuntu	linux
edit so i m running on ubuntu linux with gcc installed

9403667
x86	mips
how do i get a cross compiler setup so that gcc will recognize the mips assembly language instead of x86

9403675
inherited	properties
the events properties may also be defined as a function that returns an events hash to make it easier to programmatically define your events as well as inherited them from parent views

9403742
post	get
i m new to this and i m not sure how to get help so i m going to post the php page where it sends and where i cannot cant that it done so t.t

9403743
nsviewcontroller	nssplitview
i created three nsviewcontroller subclasses xcode automatically generated nibs and added to the main menu window nib view controller objects with each class specified hooking up each one s view property to one of the three custom view generic nsview objects i dropped into the nssplitview

9403748
versioning	upgrade
or if you have the unencrypted versioning of mootools12_all_p.js upgrade your moo 1.2 to 1.4

9403750
google-chrome	firefox
the problem only happens in google-chrome ie9 and firefox are fine

9403762
min	max
bounding box min -4.6 -40.3 -7.3 max 7.5 -23.1 2.6

9403814
folder	dir
so i go to iis and look up the application pool running the app and it tells me that the identity in use is networkservice then i go give networkservice full permissions to the entirety of the folder iis has set for the application which also happens to be the path to the project dir

9403843
accessor	properties
i fixed this by changing setcoordinate so that it uses the primitive accessor that are automatically generated by core data to set the latitude and longitude properties

9403859
width	height
as for any images you use you can include a regular and higher-res the same image scaled with double height and double width and the appropriate one will automatically be used

9403926
google-chrome	firefox
you should be able to run this on your system and it will tell you that there are no differences and it might actually produce results if your default browser is firefox or google-chrome or something.

9403963
google-chrome	firefox
i have found it to work in google-chrome but not firefox 10 still not sure what is causing it as i dont get an error - ok in ie9 also

9404005
implements	extends
but what i have to do now and am not sure how is to make the ball class extends component and implements mouselistener

9404025
factors	matrix
i have a correlation matrix corr with factors names a b c d e they are set as col names and rownames

9404025
factors	matrix
now i want to use this result to lookup col name and row name in the correlation matrix to get the related correlation factors

9404076
kineticjs	paperjs
i ve been playing close attention to my other two favorite libraries fabric.js and paperjs awesome libraries but they don t seem to handle events as well as kineticjs

9404076
mouseup	mousedown	mousemove	mouseout	mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseout	mousedown	mouseout	mouseup	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mousedown	mouseover	mouseup	mouseover	mousemove
with kineticjs you can make drawings and turn them into objects from which you can then bind event listeners like mouseover mouseout mousemove mouseup mousedown click dblclick touchstart touchend touchmove dbltap dragstart dragmove dragend etc

9404103
appkit	nsgradient
as a part of appkit nsgradient is sadly not available to ios developers. fortunately the documentation tells us how to get the starting gradient

9404103
width	height
using either the height or the width of the rect as the distance is only sufficient for certain angles. several sites out there tells us how we can find the ending point

9404161
mkdir	chdir
the key point is that for ftp commands including mkdir and the chdir that works in the op question a single open port - usually port 21 - is used

9404169
versioning	upgrade
if you are using gwt 2.2 or above try using a latest snapshot of gin 1.1 or higher versioning and also upgrade guice 3.0

9404173

your question s title and tagging say post but your example url would indicate a get request

9404267
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
as of this writing it only works well in google-chrome and safari with a shim for firefox

9404305
swt	swing
with its clean separation of the client ui model from the actual ui rendering you have the options to run your app with eclipse swt swing or web application based on eclipse rap this will come with the juno release

9404351
macports	homebrew	ubuntu	debian
i would use a package manager homebrew or macports for mac apt-get for ubuntu debian

9404429
post	get
notes on using get vs post with forms

9404485
google-chrome	firefox
i can use htmlentities or htmlspecialchars to convert the quotes to special characters and the special characters display fine in firefox or google-chrome

9404513
width	height
you may need to set the width and height to a specific size the width and height of the container or it may be as simple as telling it to take 100 of available space

9404519
mouseleave	mouseenter
i have two events on an element - mouseenter and mouseleave

9404519
mouseleave	mouseenter
so when someone moves in out - the event mouseenter will be fired after it mouseleave and after it nothing

9404535
nsxmlparser	nsurlconnection
you will need to have a nsurlconnection object and a nsxmlparser object

9404537
width	height
visualisation width and height variables the best way to do this is

9404557
wordpress	joomla
besides that you will find it very interesting to check out how other structure their databases and that can be easily done by inspecting some of the open-source projects available online like joomla wordpress and others

9404574
jar	manifest.mf
next to the class files there is only one file required in that jar meta-inf manifest.mf

9404619
post	put
put in a where clause to filter the results to items posted by any of your friend ids and also where the post is made on the page

9404637
ubuntu	linux
first establish that you do not have an entry for linux on the ubuntu box

9404650
post	get
i guess the reason why goes beyond the naming convention but still it s a nice reminder get for getting and post for posting putting

9404655
csv	tsv
right-click on the graph and select save data as... you can choose csv or tsv

9404735
daemons	launchd
daemons application should be launchd by upstart script

9404748
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
then you can use getelementbyid and getelementsbytagname to identify the checkboxes

9404750
min	max
min key1 min key2 --- max key1 max key2

9404750
min	max
and many often min key 2 max key 2

9404770
hex	binary
so far i have investigated the command xxd for a bit and i am able to save a specific portion of a hex dump from a binary file

9404789
width	height
update given that you re just using the built-in ellipse object and thus specifying height width rather than the general ellipse parameters it would be worthwhile to have a look at the source for contains here

9404807
rss	feed
mimicking a secure rss feed

9404816
post	get
google translate is meant to be used with a get request and not a post request

9404820
google-chrome	firefox
also i ve also successfully used socket.io.js in google-chrome for other tasks so i don t think the errors firefox are throwing are actually to do with socket.io

9404829
children	parent
you can also use the delegation programming pattern where the parent will get the events for itself and the children so you can avoid confusion and potentially can save memory with larger applications

9404847
post	get
to do this i am retrieving the oauth_token from the database to post the message but when i look at the response before the section of code that does actual status update i get an error saying

9404855
children	parent
have you considered having special offer items as children to the main item as then it encapsulates the entire offer together and deleting the parent deletes the child

9404855
children	parent
essentially you have methods that allow the items to be exposed as both a flat array and as a hierarchy of parent children and siblings

9404886
qobject	qwidget
note that findchild and findchildren are methods of qobject - so if your form does not have them it cannot be a qwidget because all widgets inherit qobject

9404911
crossover	mutation
only take the top 50 of chromosomes and move them onto the next generation where you create children chromosomes based on your choice of a crossover function and a probability of mutation- for this type of problem i recommend a very light crossover function or none... and a decent mutation rate

9404921
int	chars
i need a function that takes four unsigned chars variables as parameters and combines them into an unsigned int

9404921
int	chars
the first chars variable being the first byte of the int the second chars being the second byte and so on

9404933
stdout	stderr
0 ist stdin 1 is stdout and 2 is stderr

9404933
stdout	stderr
in this case i suspect they are used to capture stdout stderr of the freshly forked programs

9404933
stdout	stderr
this would mean that wc probably runs with its stdout connected to fd 3 and stderr to fd 4 so the main application can could the output of wc

9404955
put	get
you can get boost to print out the type of the value that boost creates from parsing by defining a functor that will take any parameters and tell you what they are the following code is adapted from some code sehe put on so chat

9404959
photoshop	paint.net
the icon files are perfectly valid - saved by adobe illustrator and show without problems in all browsers photoshop paint and paint.net

udp just has a smaller overhead than tcp but that comes at the cost of reliability

9409417

swing	windowbuilder
i know eclipse with windowbuilder pro plugin will be able to do that for me but i just want to check if this can be done using swing gui builder

9409459
udp	tcp
unlike tcp udp does not buffer data

9409459
udp	mtu
in udp it would be best to keep the payload at the size of the mtu 1500 bytes

9409473
textview	imageview
based on the time above check if you need to update the image or the text or both if you need to then update textview and imageview

9409495
postgresql	mysql
there is this rumor going around that mysql does not scale very well with the number of rows in a table and that postgresql manages large tables much better in terms of performance

9409554
width	height
you need to understand that the width and height are the bounds of the image viewport not the size of the image

9409554
width	height
if you don t set width and height they default to 0 which is why you aren t seeing anything

9409554
width	height
so the solution you re looking for is to set the width height to the maximum area you expect an image to fill and then set preserveaspectratio to the appropriate value to set the scale and position the way you want the spec provides an example svg showing some of the possible behaviours for preserveaspectratio

9409565

9410259
try-catch	exception-handling
i also wonder if the try-catch around the when call can be avoided somehow as the actual exception-handling is swallowed by the bean under test

9410307
background-repeat	background-image
the background-image property should just take the url of the image to use you need to remove no-repeat and add that separately using the background-repeat property

9410361
equals	gethashcode
in order for enumerable.distinct to work for your type you can implement and provide suitable definitions for equals and gethashcode otherwise it will use the default implementation comparing for reference equality assuming that you are using a reference type

9410361
equals	gethashcode
to compare a custom data type you need to implement this interface and provide your own gethashcode and equals methods for the type

the problem is when it loads the external div into the popupdiv the popupdiv s height and width are 0 so centerpopup can t center it right

9410417
margin	height
i m guessing could be wrong but my first thought... that the height of the element is 40px and then it has a 1px margin padding border wrapped around it

9410430
width	height
the trick to avoid overlapping in this example is setting a min height width on the wrapper div that is 3x s the height width of your fixed center div

9410435
subtract	add
if you re not allowed to subtract you ll need to build a subtract with xor increment and add

9410529
versioning	upgrade
i think there is always a chance that some gems could enter in conflict especially if you upgrade as soon as a new versioning is released

9410636
width	height
this will ensure that the content is in the dom before you try and show the popup which means that the height and width should be accessible

9410645
put	get
it is then used in handlers of put job create and get job status

9410647
filtering	grouping
what i would like to do is given two players i would like to be able to filtering the grouping that contain both of these players but i am unsure how to do this type of query

that way you can hide show everything you want with a simple selector whenever you want

9410979
onfling	gestures
also note that onfling is the callback method which will be called when your activity detects any gestures

9410986
packets	multicast
as for streaming it s better to use udp first because it lowers the load on servers but mostly because you can send packets with multicast it s simpler than sending it to each connected client

9411016
portrait	landscape
when drawing landscape content on a portrait display you should rotate the content yourself rather than using the caeagllayer transform to rotate it

9411019
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and the android browser along with safari and the blackberry browser are all based on webkit

9411035

9411324
uitableview	uipickerview
i have not long bin doing code xcode so i m a little rubbish basically i have created a .xib and would like it to be in a storyboard but i really don t have a glue where to start because i have a xib window that has uitableview and uipickerview in it and all the code is fine in the xib but do i need to add code in the storyboard .h .m etc and is it possible if not how can i do some kind of drop down menu for my app

9411377

the message to hash which it treats as a ucs-2 encoded binary string a optional 16 character salt encoded in the same way as the message and a boolean to say if you want the output in hex characters or just as a binary sequence encoded in the same manner as the message

9411740
hex	binary
returns the encoding of the binary sequence 0000000000000000 using the salt 000...000 in hex which is 0cd686174dc1451dcf2e54bcd55b868bf84f54e4f6454afd599abd0f3361fb85f09dda2c7c6cb9a97fa6dca2ed8068c8e8a69b66c4f8bd819cbfd5a0bd9d8e7c

min	max
i like to get min and max rate values and their dates on which they occurred for each month

9411812
dbcontext	objectcontext
if you want to use dbcontext or any other template you have to first turn off default code generation which produces objectcontext - in edmx property window remove custom tool for code generation

9411816
ant	maven
this is based on my experience with maven but i guess with ant it should be the same

9411855
mouse	keyboard
there are not many of them mouse and keyboard messages wm_input wm_timer wm_paint wm_quit

9411855

9411970
int	double
it seems it has some int double rounding issue

9411973
put	get
at the moment i don t think that structs destructors ever get run if they re put on the heap because the gc doesn t have the information that it needs to do so that should be fixed at some point in the future though

9411973
free	malloc	put	get
edit you could also use malloc and free with std.conv.emplace to put the object in a non-gc allocated chunk of memory like you d have in c++ but i think that you d have to explicitly call the destructor to get it run since free doesn t understand about destructors it being a c function

9411973
free	malloc
however you could then create a free function similar to new which does the malloc and emplace for you and then have a free function similar to delete which calls the destructor and free which would give you the same situation as c++

9412042
accessor	properties
so myview.frame is a properties accessor method being send

9412107

9412217
width	height
if x y is the center of the ellipse and width and height are the two axes then the equation should be

9412231
typedef	struct
a somewhat cleaner way would be to keep your typedef with the struct and use structure tags in the declarations like this

9412242
hash	md5
another way is to create an actual hash of the page md5 or the algorithm of your choice and base the structure on that with the top directory being the first 3 digits of the hash the one below it the second 3

9412337

9412597
google-chrome	firefox
ideally i d like them to look the same in google-chrome as they do in firefox

9412613
mongodb	dbref
dbref in my opinion should be avoided when work with mongodb at least if you work with big systems that require scalability

9412620
button	checkbox
i have created a class which extends jdialog where i have some checkbox and 3 button accept cancel and select all

9412629
folder	directory
the question is how i would exclude some directory from code coverage reports for example yii folder

9412632

also the confusion between inheriting from submenu misleading since you usually inherited from a base class or a super class depending on the terminology you prefer and the thing doing the inheriting is a sub class and having a properties also called submenu and that properties represents a set rather than a single instance

9412642

9412974
integer	unsigned
i know that u for unsigned and d for integer

9413060
int	chars
note that sizeof gives you the size in units of chars which is why the division by what is essentially sizeof int is needed or you d get a way too high value

9413076
integer	unsigned
z would store the value of the integer division but as z is unsigned all values will be positive and thus the sign bit will not be processed as such but as part of the number and also there will be no two s complement conversion

9413141
move	drag
the issue is that when the user drag with the mouse to browse to a page the panels and the pictureboxes jerks around when they are move

9413174

this is inherited - object b inherited properties of object a

9413799
inherited	properties
mixins can be viewed as a form of multiple inherited object c is inheriting properties from object a and b diagram for that might look like this

9413818
width	height
you will need this to make sure that your array contains necessary meta data e.g width and height

9413819
width	height
if your prefer height over width means that you want a given height 300 and the width should be calculated by the picture ratio you may use resize_to_fit 1000000 300

9413819
width	height
every times the height 300 will be reached before the width 1000000 is reached your picture will get the height 300

the first file also has some potential issues such as declaring a method that appears to be a getter without declaring a property for the ivar same with the setter would be better to just declare a property

sorting	filtering
in terms of query i use a filtering query and for some requests a custom_filters_score query to compute the score and use it for sorting

9416180

don t forget that with a dvcs distributed vcs the concept of branching is orthogonal with the publication push pull

9416197
superclass	subclassing
when we re calling from a subclassing super contains the reference to it s superclass.in the same manner the super in superclass itself has reference to it s superclass in this way upto java.lang.object

int	boolean
this method accepts an int variable by reference and returns a boolean indicating whether the conversion was successful so you don t have to do any error handling when calling tryparse

9416242
width	height
you cannot set width height of the background image

9416245
getter	setter
i have read in many places that getter and setter are evil

9416246
width	height
what you could do is create an absolutely positioned img and then using the image attributes set the width and height

9416309
getter	setter
i have read in many places that getter and setter are evil

9416367
put	get
connection with method put id number and get data list

9416373
google-chrome	safari
the problem occurs in google-chrome and safari

9416386
getter	setter
on the contrary the getter and setter help you to protect the consistense of the variables

9416386
getter	setter
the importance of getter and setter is to provide protection to private attributes so that they can not be accessed directly for this it is best that you create a class with the attribute item in which you include the corresponding get and set

9416456
width	height
the concept was that multiple portions of the page would be at 100 width but with predefined height

9416499
getter	setter
the following sample is a brilliant example of boilerplate setter and getter

9416499
getter	setter
my advice - don t write dummy getter and setter use getter and setter only if they guard the invariant of your class

9416504
int	boolean
just use boolean strait up rather than int 0 or int 1

9416504
int	boolean
if you really want to use int for the public property then you will need to use a converter as ischecked is boolean

9416504
int	boolean
if you want an int to represent the current selected then you could set that value in the set of the boolean public property

9416552
superclass	subclassing
so i have the class superclass which currently has a member variable o of object type which will take a single instance of one of the subclassing class subclassa and class subclassb

9416583
for-loop	loops
if i decompile the class file i can get see for-loop only but certain machines of certain developer s it becomes do while loops

9416599
superclass	subclassing
but i have a feel that you are doing something wrong with that o member variable - it s not a common situation when a superclass needs to have a subclassing as a member

9416619
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
after trying to figure out why it s being called twice i found out that the second call happened between viewwillappear and viewdidappear of the gameviewcontroller

9416662

int	chars
what you have is a string whose chars happen to represent an int

9416945
post	get
in addition you will probably get your question answered faster if you post this on their forum

9416955
versioning	upgrade
jdk is usually lagging in versioning of xml parser so most likely metro is using a newer versioning need to be checked and at least it would be under your control as a dependency - you could always test your app with a newer versioning of metro before deploying to production as opposed to jdk which might just change with system upgrade or from system to system etc

9416961
google-chrome	firefox
you can use something like firebug for firefox or google-chrome s developer tools to check your javascript

9416979

when i get the correct code and result i want to put the result of data into an uneditable text view

9417029

9417052
google-chrome	firefox
session userdata lost for google-chrome and ie but ok on firefox

9417202
hide	show
the jquery mechanism to keep track if a row status is show is to check if the clickable text is show or hide

9417202
hide	show
i get that this should work fine for regular links where there is actual show or hide text to check for and change but it also works on tags that do not have any text that could alternate between hide and show

9417202
hide	show
end result toggles the img alt property and keeps check on show hide status

9417239
clojure.test	midje
midje provides a migration path from clojure.test to a more flexible readable abstract and gracious style of testing

9417242
nunit	mstest
the above is an example for nunit but the same holds true for mstest

9417251
uilabel	nsstring
maybe this handy nsstring category can help you to display the text how you want in a uilabel

9417284
strace	systemtap
there are many tools do the function trace work either in userspace or kernelspace on linux ftrace ust ltrace utrace strace systemtap

9417319
super	self
one quick solution to this might be to subclass nsslider nsslidercell and override the mouse dragging machinery to call super then post a custom nssliderdidchangetemporaryvalue or whatever name you choose notification with self as the object

9417377
rtp	rtsp
i look for an open source rtsp rtp stack with c language because i want to connect from a micro-controller to media servers to play internet radio stations

9417381
implements	extends
you could extends splqueue implements serializable and then construct some appropriate serialization unserialization strategy for this purpose

9417387
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
better use synchronization mechanisms like autoresetevent or manualresetevent and wait for events to happen

9417390
google-chrome	firefox	ssl	https
my website links are forced to use ssl and when i click on any the browser shows ok for ssl on google-chrome green color on https safe site or identified certificate on firefox and the same ok working ssl on other browsers

now the problem starts whenever i rewrite the url using mod_rewrite and shorten the link a red sign shows up on google-chrome not identified on firefox and the same issue on other browsers

9417422
appendto	each
jquery documentation not each appendto

9417431

9417438
bluetooth	usb
rather i am looking to issue at commands from a pc to an android phone over a serial link such as rs232 usb bluetooth

9417462
int	chars
suppose i decided to typedef chars titem then the array contains chars if i typedef int titem then the array contains int

9417467
mouseover	mouseout
however when my cursor enters the inner div my mouseout function fires even though the mouseover event should bubble from the inner div to the outer div

9417516
put	get
if you have control over the flash you can put an actionscript event that will then get passed to the browser

9417591
prawn	pdfkit
prawn or pdfkit seem to be the two most popular right now

9417603
width	height
it seems the maths is off or i m setting the incorrect params with the width height x y values as when you draw the rectangle does not follow the cursor correctly

9417609
textview	imageview
i would like to define my own view class that consists of several textview imageview progressviews into one displayclass with these as elements

9417658
drive	createfile
createfile should be your starting point as it allows you to get a handle to the physical drive

9417658
drive	createfile
you can use the createfile function to open a physical disk drive or a volume which

9417670
getter	setter
having a getter setter somewhere that is updating data somehow can cause this

9417683
jar	war
to generate jar war etc look into file - export menu

9417687
rtp	rtcp
unfortunately i m still stuck with a little implementation of a rtp rtcp communication to access my ip camera properly

9417687
udp	rtp
a port on which i receive the data sent via rtp based on udp - handling this is none of my concern i even have absolutely no access to it i just wanted to mention it for the sake of completeness

9417687
rtsp	rtcp
i even looked at the communication rtsp and rtcp which is almost completely the same as in my application...the one thing missing i m gonna mention below

9417715
ubuntu	mint
i m no expert myself but i recall mint being a spin-off from ubuntu so it might be worth googling how to install opencv in that distro as a starting point

9417721
getter	setter
i think it s much more simple if you want juste get and set value of a field by using methods provides by java reflection api rather than trying to get getter and setter method s names manually

9417737
drive	createfile
then use setfilepointerex so you can move the offset where you want to read readfile fills a buffer with bytes read from the disk drive closehandle closes the handle opened by createfile

9417780
google-chrome	firefox
i have a small webm video that plays fine in google-chrome but not firefox

9417818
getter	setter
and else are setter and getter

9417851
background-repeat	background-position
the other solution is to put your style properties into separate data- attributes one for background another one for background-repeat and yet another one for background-position

9417912
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
safari 4+ google-chrome 1+ firefox 3.6+ and opera 11.10+ are now supporting css3 gradients

9417941
websphere	ibm
i have a simple project built with eclipse 3.4 aka ibm rad on websphere 7

9417967
folder	directory
in linux how do i check all folder in a directory and output the name of all directory that are empty to a list

9417971
children	parent
the problem is the way ef works since parent has a reference to children ef loads children automatically when the parent list is loaded but it gets active and inactive children also the children list is not ordered

9417977
pop-up	dialog	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
when i try and upload a file using asp.net mvc it works fine in firefox google-chrome but in ie and opera a dialog pop-up which asks me to either download save or cancel

9418096
firefox	safari
but it looks like normal tab not as mac osx safari preferences or vlc preferences or firefox preferences tabs with large icons and the text at the bottom of those icons

9418114
min	max
defines min and max as

9418114
min	max
interesting error messages if you define your own min or max

9418118
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
of course it works fine in google-chrome firefox safari etc

9418124
accessor	properties
for example an interface might declare a properties that has a get accessor

9418124
accessor	properties
the class that implements the interface can declare the same properties with both a get and set accessor

9418128
google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome and safari however the second image is not shown

9418128
google-chrome	firefox
this works in both firefox and google-chrome

9418128
width	height
this was true even when i wrapped the in a with an explicit viewbox height and width and referenced that with the instead of the

9418145
put	get
i have two rest classes for a simple web service jersey and glassfish that involves user resources - one to operate on all users a factory for posting and another on individual users get put delete

9418146
getter	setter
getter and setter are great for configuring or determining the configuration of a class or retrieving data from a model

9418146
getter	setter
you can also provide getter without setter

9418146
getter	setter
if you have data that is for all intents and purposes public but needs to be managed use getter and setter

9418146
getter	setter
if you have data that needs to be retrieved but under no circumstances should ever be changed use a getter but not a setter

9418146
getter	setter
if you have data that needs to be set for internal purposes and should never be publicly exposed and cannot be set at instantiation use a setter but not a getter setter presumably prevents a second call affecting the internal property

9418146
getter	setter
don t forget that setter and getter can be private and even for internally managed properties having a setter that manages the property may be desirable

9418146
getter	setter
allen holub s article why getter and setter methods are evil seems to be the source of op s reasoning but in my opinion the article does a poor job of explaining its point

9418150
int	chars
this unit test will fail because you have specified the pattern must have an int 2-7 at the 4th chars positionm where as file1 has 1

9418151
button	checkbox
for select boxes checkbox and radio button the event is fired immediately when the user makes a selection with the mouse but for the other element types the event is deferred until the element loses focus

9418151
mouse	keyboard
i want the event to fire whenever a text field has visibly changed accounting for the various ways it might change keyboard mouse copy-and-paste etc.

9418169
hide	show
i suppose you want to hide or show multiple tree items based on isvisible value in the specific key

9418175
implements	extends
besides extends beyond requirements of a contract you can add any other methods and or properties and also implements other interfaces in the same class

9418179
ready	each
pathfinding algorithm is ready just i need to generate the list or vector of target points one for each unit

9418200
ienumerable	ilist
i usually use ilist or ienumerable although i suppose you could also return object

9418212
filtering	grouping
i ve tried joins which just multiplies the sums and i ve tried subqueries that won t let me use a date filtering because it s not used in the grouping by clause

9418220
sorting	grouping
use observablecollection.add item and then refresh the collectionviewsource which will automatically sort and grouping the data if you have the sorting and grouping setup correctly

9418228
onclick	onkeyup	mouse	keyboard
onkeyup for keyboard and onclick for mouse might do the trick

9418249
client-side	server-side
i figured that it ll be more convenient to reuse server-side jade templates on client-side so i m ditching underscore templates in favor of jade

9418251
accessor	properties
as far as fooworker is concerned the foo parameter only has a get accessor for the name properties

9418274
accessor	properties
back to your example the interface defining the properties is stating that it must have a public get accessor

9418274
public	protected
the set accessor could be public internal protected private or nonexistent

9418321
width	margin
i know i can do this if i was to split it into three tables and set each one to have a width xxxpx and margin 0 auto but would rather not do that

9418344
mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave
the problem is that you only bind the hover event technically mouseenter + mouseleave when in the mouseover event for content

9418344
mouseover	mouseleave
- why do you only bind your events click or hover under mouseover and mouseleave

svg	vml
forcing custom attribute into the svg or vml markup in the browser

9418963
svg	vml
but if you really do need something in the markup that raphael just doesn t support you can create a rudimentary control for manipulating it using attr and animate by using paper.customattributes and element.node note that the documentation for element.node is pretty much just the highly unhelpful don t mess with it - the reason you shouldn t mess with it is it gives you the svg or vml element directly which means raphael doesn t know about any of the changes you make to it which may put your raphael object out of sync with the element it controls potentially breaking stuff

9418963
svg	vml
here s an example assuming jquery is also being used jquery isn t essential but is more convenient that sets the svg property dy which allows you to control line spacing of raphael text note - example code not yet tested in vml ie

9419146
put	get
there are many existing implementations of ode solvers which people have put a lot of work in to - while it is good that you are interested in knowing how they work these solvers can get pretty complicated so if you aren t satisfied with the results you get from your own attempts it might be a better idea to look into existing routines such as those in the gnu scientific library

9419214
post	get
edit you should always sanitize variables that come from the get or post arrays before assigning them to variables

9420697
requestfactory	gwt
from gwt 2.1 requestfactory is better counterpart than gwt rpc when you use db4o together

9420708
screens	hdpi
i d advise just starting with a common resolution like 800x480 and hdpi which is a common density now but you ll want to test with a variety of resolutions and densities and in fact for a complicated application you might end up developing layouts for multiple screens sizes densities at which time you ll have to create appropriately different emulators or find appropriate devices to develop and test on

9420722
hash	salt
i read numerous articles stating that a salt should be as random as possible to add entropy to the hash and it looks like a great idea

9420722
hash	salt
you need to store the random salt along with your hash

9420722
hash	salt
given that an attacker somehow got access to your hash passwords and is trying to reverse the hash to plain text it means he probably dumped your database then got access to your random salt also

9420722
hash	salt
if the attacker can access the salt along with the hash value how is that more secure

9420753
folder	directory
i would advise against renaming the folder inside the assets directory but rails may let you do that

9420771
scrypt	pbkdf2
nowadays you want to store your passwords using something like pbkdf2 or scrypt

9420779
hash	salt
as long as you generate a new best cryptogrpahically strong random salt for every password you want to store the hash of there is no problem

9420784

using pypy instead of cpython might also yield significant improvement

9420835

i should also make a note that i have a wrapper div that holds everything and it has a fixed width and height

9435907
tabcontrol	tabitem
i would like to call a command when a tabitem of my tabcontrol is selected

9435927
portrait	landscape
also check the autoresize settings on those views--if one of the containing views isn t set to resize horizontally and it s sized to portrait width in the nib it won t expand to landscape width when you rotate the device

9435946
spweb	spsite
i m reviewing some code and i thought it would be useful for visual studio to throw a warning anytime an spweb or spsite object is initiated without using using spsite x ...

9435988
carrierwave	paperclip
the only problem is that we re not using the rack gem carrierwave or paperclip and i don t want to have to add any of those with their dependencies just to get this to work

ember.js	sproutcore
as someone who has both a sproutcore app and an ember.js app close to a production launch i ll take a stab at your questions re-ordered for clarity

9436012
ember.js	sproutcore
tilde decided to continue to develop sproutcore 2 but change the name to amber.js and then ember.js and goals of the project

9436012
ember.js	sproutcore
in that scenario sproutcore would use ember.js s metal library and perhaps other core libs

9436063
google-chrome	firefox
when the google-chrome protocol is used in firefox

9436063
google-chrome	firefox
example if firefox is loading a script like google-chrome package content

9436072
imperative	declarative
they typically use a higher level declarative language in contrast to the typical imperative paradigm of languages like java and c++ and use specific algorithms for scalability and high performance

9436084
heroku	engineyard
heroku seems to be more focused on total convenience while engineyard functions more like a service that sets up servers for you that you can work on yourself

9436109
clang	llvm
edit as requested the arc documentation from llvm s clang

9436120
uiview	subviews
i wasn t really sure if each reportobject should subclass uiview instead and then add each of these objects to the uiview in the scrollview as a subviews and then have it draw itself that way

9436175
dbf	dbase
has a library and a dll solution for dbf dbase file management

9436177

of course if you re using the mvvm design pattern and binding selecteditem or selectedindex you could also run the command in the propertychanged event

9436201
int	double
i need to match int and double

9436226
ati	nvidia
if you are using professional hardware like the nvidia quadro cards or ati fire gl you know and appreciate the windowed mode already for a very long time

9436313
websphere	ibm
i m using ibm rad 7 aka eclipse 3.4 and websphere 7

9436313
put	get
but if i put an ejb stateless entitydao in the testjpa project it doesn t get injected in the entityservice

9436328
int	double
this would match positive and negative int double that start with a digit and double start with a dot

9436339
post	get
imo it is better to use post then get because someone might come to know about your url pattern and might try tweaking it

9436352
public	protected
i thought inherited methods public or protected were somehow copied from the base to the child class

9436369
put	get
if it does something else like put the name somewhere you can get it later then 1 this shouldn t be named getname and 2 you definitely need to document that fact in your javadoc

9436399
width	height
height width background-color whatever you want to find the default for

9436401
rss	feed
for example a web browser might use one interface to render an rss feed another to render an html web page and a third to display a pdf

9436464
stdout	stderr
in tcsh you don t use to redirect stderr you use that will redirect both stdout and stderr

9436488
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
i need to populate a dropdownlistfor html with checkbox

9436512
inherited	properties
if they are meant to be value properties then you can create a base model and inherited that in your model classes which then will be available to all of your views using those models

9436547
sqlcommandbuilder	sqldataadapter
what s happening is that i have a datagridview using a bindingsource sqldataadapter sqlcommandbuilder and a datatable

9436558

9436676
mapping-by-code	fluent
i d like to suggest you to read my blog series comparing mapping-by-code to fluent nhibernate - here is the table of contents and my final conclusions

9436681
superclass	subclassing
i would like to know in the init of my superclass if the subclassing has overridden a specific method

9436890
decoder	encoder
so my idea was to strip the png format to the minimal information i needed and write an encoder decoder to support idat sections with 3 5 6 or 7bpp

9436904
post	get
in those situations myopenid sends back a post request where such characters get mangled

9436912
put	get
if you re willing to put up with some potential instability to get pure poco messages you might give it a try

9436931
nowjs	node.js
my current project uses node.js + nowjs + mongo-db

9436940
post	put	post	get	put	get
my issue is that i need to put the parameters in a post instead of encoding them in the url but this method results in a get with the form parameters in the url

9436955
put	get
now when i put the app in the background each time i get my login screen yeah with the exception of one

9436984
setinterval	settimeout
since you re running settimeout on timer every time you run the timer function which is every 1 second instead of using settimeout you should use setinterval

9436984
setinterval	settimeout
so now instead of running settimeout every 1 second you re running setinterval once and it will process every 1 second

9437008
.htaccess	httpd.conf
everything is done in my httpd.conf and not in .htaccess

9437009
opera	firefox
i tried ie firefox and opera

9437012
getter	setter
interface - abstract class that defines getter setter - implementations

9437012
getter	setter
the only benefit i can see is that classes extending abstractfoo don t need to re-implement their getter and setter

9437046
getter	setter
you would not just put getter and setter into the abstract class but anything that all implementations of the interface would likely have in common

9437046
implements	extends
implementors might still choose to not extends the abstract base class if they want to implements stuff in a completely different way

9437068
subclass	abstract-class
remember the person who writes the abstract-class is likely to provide at least one concrete subclass so the benefits accrue to them

9437068
getter	setter
getter and setter are not the point

9437106
spine.js	backbone.js
i have just about got my head around how javascript frameworks like backbone.js and spine.js deals with the client-side state of a data model in regards to updating views etc

9437118
google-chrome	firefox
what s odder is that google-chrome still seems to behave nicely and respect my 0 padding but firefox and ie appear to be adding about 4 or 5 pixels of vertical space

9437136
google-chrome	firefox
this works in ie9 google-chrome and firefox

9437165
put	get
will get the length of each one and put it in an array for your viewing pleasure

9437197
gridview	rowdatabound
this is all done via the gridview rowdatabound method

9437208
exponent	modulo
if you only care about the least significant digits of the result for a programming contest then you can calculate the exponent modulo some value m

9437229
scheme	racket
to follow up from the scheme racket side of the fence

9437229
scheme	racket
racket and some other scheme implementations use a richer representation for syntax objects so that they can have properties attached to them indicating in racket at least what context they re bound in what source location they come from what pass of the compiler inserted them and any other information you might want to store cf

9437242
button	right-align
i want my button to be right-align and inside the tab border

9437243
tablet	mdpi
i have a tablet and i have tested that it picks resources from the mdpi folder

9437275
post	get
i guess its out of my hands now i will update this post when i get an answer

9437285
hash	salt
when someone logs in you redo the same thing salt encrypt and then compare to the other hash stored in the database

9437285
hash	salt
the reason why two identical passwords may yield different hash is the salt

9437288
cpu	processors
the local apic timer sends an interrupt only to its processors while the pit raises a global interrupt which may be handled by any cpu in the system

9437289
rss	feed
my approach would be to use a tool to generate an rss feed for each of the urls containing your table data and then display the data in your ui be it wpf winforms or asp.net

9437289
rss	feed
this way you can easily set up additional channels when you find acquire a new website to pull data from and your work will be to normalize the new site into your standard rss feed format configurable in one of these tools and you could even configure your ui to pull the additional feed based on a config setting so no need to recompile when adding a new site

9437289
rss	feed
edit here is a link to good info about several tools that can be used to create the rss feed from any website

9437363
int	double
the first thing that comes to mind is that you shouldn t be using double but rather int arithmetic

9437373
hash	salt
two identical passwords can result in different hash because encrypto appends a random salt to the end of the password before hashing it

9437373
hash	salt
they basically use the salt to do the hash and then append the salt to the end of the hash

9437373
hash	salt
again if you look at the source code hasher.comparestringtohash you will see that the random salt is recovered from the stored hash and then used to compute a new hash from the entered password

9437377
width	height
i need two div layers with height width 100 each and when i click on div1 it has to slide from left to right to load div2 and when clicked on div2 it has to slide from right to left to load div1

9437381
google-chrome	firefox
this works in ie and firefox but not google-chrome

9437386
mouseup	mousedown
i can repeatedly mousedown and the window stays topmost as long as my mouseup doesn t come too quickly behind it

9437401
setinterval	settimeout
it would be better to use setinterval instead of settimeout

9437470
int	chars
there s no such thing as utf8 chars codes which should also be in int

9437503
devise	cancan
i have followed video tutorials and read docs on github for both devise gem and cancan gem

9437509
puts	gets
the second task gets the lines from the queue formats them and puts the result in another queue

9437519
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade hibernate in a project from versioning 3 to 4

9437532
superclass	subclassing
there are more complicated ways of doing this say if you wanted the subclassing to be created dynamically and automatically registered with their superclass upon creation but there s no need to employ them in your situation

9437615
put	get
edit i can get my script to work if i put a sleep command before it starts and then click on the command prompt window it has to type into

9437635
min	max
the min and max prefixes as implemented by gecko are named min--moz-device-pixel-ratio and

9437665
folder	directory
when i run the app again my saved changes to this plist file are not seen since it loads the data from the project directory then saves it again to the temp simulator folder

9437670
clang	icc
note that these are intel s sse intrinsics and will work in gcc clang msvc and icc

9437680
mouseleave	mouseenter
i suspect you could manage it with the jquery mouseenter and mouseleave functions

9437716
maven	pom.xml
when packaging a project as a jar file maven includes the pom.xml file of the project inside the jar

9437730
pop-up	dialog
i m trying to create a simple dialog pop-up but it refuses to appear

9437774
width	height
you haven t done any scaling - if you want to have a fixed thumbnail width and height it will be distorted

9437775
opera	google-chrome
if i open it with google-chrome it only remembers the data from previous sessions in google-chrome and if i open it with opera it only reads the data from other sessions in opera

9437786
hide	show
after calling gtk_set_sensitive i d hide the panel with your widgets and show the panel with the label saying something like processing...

9437797
textview	imageview
the gallery contains multiple linearlayouts containing a textview and imageview in a framelayout

9437798
post	put
once i changed it out and put an input control on the form for the post i got all my data back from the parent and partial view in the controller

9437806
ant	maven
you can use ant s zip libraries from your java code maven dependencies can be found here

9437845
execvp	fork
also you should avoid using fork with execvp and use system instead

9437856
vb.net	vb6
this is in vb.net but it should be translatable to vb6 or whatever this basic language is that you are using

9437969
maven	pom.xml
i assume that it works by parsing all of the elements out of the project pom.xml and uses a service to query maven for each transitive dependency

9438036
post	get
so i get in the post begindate enddate and type

9438055
folder	directory
the problem that i am having is that the zipped file will create folder for all the parent directory

9438133
websphere	ibm
if you are using a jdk thats shipped with websphere application server v6x 7x 8x or any other websphere server tools in rational application developer then those require ibm com.ibm.websphere.ssl.protocol.sslsocketfactory specific class from websphere application server runtime

9438137
jcarousel	caroufredsel
i have found scripts such as caroufredsel and jcarousel that support circular scrolling but carousels like these rely on jumping from one item to the next

9438156
ready	each
the result resource is essentially an iteratorâ each time you call php asks the database driver for the next row i don t know the specifics of the implementation but presumably this is to avoid loading potentially thousands of rows of data into memory all at once and let the database worry about holding on to the results until you re ready to use them

9438165
subtraction	addition
higher latencies and only single-issue addition subtraction on sandy bridge

9438184
button	checkbox
in the click event of a button on this page i want to read the value of the label if the checkbox adjacent to it is selected

9438208
strcpy	strncpy
the built in functions strcpy and strncpy do what your copy function does there s no need to reinvent the wheel

9438212
bash	zsh
you might also need to check that shell-file-name is customized to the location of your zsh binary instead of the default bin bash

9438262
google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari
again - as written below it works perfectly - in ie9 ff10 opera 11 safari and google-chrome

9438315
respond.js	modernizr
i cannot speak for yepnopejs but since respond.js is listed in modernizr it seems redundant

9438315
respond.js	modernizr
modernizr if used should determine whether or not respond.js is loaded

9438315
respond.js	modernizr
modernizr will conditionally load the scripts including respond.js client-side based on feature detects

9438319
implements	extends
and because crossedblockbrush doesn t implements or extends a defaultblockbrush you are getting a cast exception

9438326
rss	feed
i am using simplepie to parse multiple rss feed just fine and am able to put one on the html page

9438326
rss	feed
it would be displayed in a different column or box and pull from different rss feed than the other

9438334
setinterval	settimeout
the function constructor and settimeout setinterval with a string argument - eval in disguise

9438370
width	height
the dialog box must be able to withstand changes in width and height

9438370
width	height
but the div in the middle is only the size of the content inside of it even though i have set the height and width

9438383
post	put
benâ s post put forward the point that when pushstate is more widely adopted then we can leave hashbangs behind and return to traditional urls

9438388
mouseleave	mouseenter
you are re-binding the mouseleave event every-time the mouseenter event fires try moving the mouseleave event handler outside the mouseenter event handler

9438392
hide	show
i am trying to use a toggle script to show and hide certain elements of a page.

9438395
awt	swing
jpanel because it s a swing component has builtin support for double buffering awt does not and has better performance so i hear but i have no first hand experience with this

9438396
listboxitem	textbox
i tried using the isfocused property but then i wasn t able to edit the textbox because when i got into the textbox the listboxitem would go out of focus and thus turning back to a textblock before i had a chance to edit the text

9438405
hide	show
i have a function called showhide that alternately show and hide a text input field and a button button2 when another button button1 is clicked

9438436
inherited	subclassing
the best thing to do is impossible of course have a uiscrollview inherited from your uiview subclassing

9438487
width	height
besides being useless in this case the inline behavior is already working because of the floats inline property doesn t allow you to set the element s width or height

9438542
salt	md5	hash	salt	hash	md5
i would add some salt and produce an md5 hash delivered right with the plaintext

9438571
width	height
so i need to use javascript to get the image height width and change it s left and top positioning as needed

9438583
hide	show
i have looked around on this site and there are various solutions for this problem but every one i ve tried show and then hide my div instantly

9438588
std	ostream
you could then create an std ostream with a pointer to an object of this class

9438595
post	get
i realize i haven t posted much code but i get frustrated by people who post mass blocks of code on here

9438622
versioning	upgrade
get the last working versioning just before you did the upgrade from source control

9438645
tinyint	boolean
i have a table in mysql databse with a boolean column or tinyint 1

9438690
move	drag
but i m still at a loss as to the math involved in checking the coordinates of the rectangle as the user drag it and testing at what point they have move the shape to the edge of the bounding polygon

9438703
for-loop	while-loop
this will give you the flexibility you need you can use print statements to put comments at the top of the file and then use a for-loop or while-loop to print name value pairs for however many properties you want the file to contain

9438733
inherited	subclassing
you could create a base controller which is inherited by a subclassing per language and define a language specific action name for each base controller action method

9438736
keydown	keyup
keypress is not the best thing to use because it don t return on every character the same as keydown or keyup

9438741
ubuntu	debian
on some packaged installs of mongodb for example ubuntu debian

9438761
concave	convex
if your polygon is concave you ll probably find it easiest to first decompose it into multiple convex polygons which will simplify the available collision detection algorithms

9438774
width	height
because i have to set the width and height both to 200px to get the correct shape

9438774
width	height
i have to set the width and height of the rotated text which does not make it very flexible to work with and this also causes problem number 1

9438774
width	margin
i have to set the margin to 0 -100px because i have to set the width to 200px but once rotated its width is still 200px which would make the table incredible large

9438774
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i need it to work and have gotten it to the same point in ie7+ google-chrome firefox and opera

9438793
pop-up	dialog
in this when i press one of the options in the menu i need to pop-up a dialog and in that dialog a listview of string values wich i get out of an string-arrays xml

9438811
width	height
so if you need to use pixel measurements then you will need to encapsulate all of the elements in another container with the max width and height that your layout will be

9438900
nscoding	nscopying
but now i am working on archiving all of the objects in my app when the view disappears or closes to then unarchive it and uibutton doesn t conform to nscopying or nscoding

9438916
strlen	substr
substr realpath 0 strlen basepath cant go above basepath cant go above

9438928
post	get
there is an abundance of forum post solutions as well as articles on this exact issue but i haven t been able to get anything i ve found thus far to work

9439013

9439034
addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition
for example subtraction and multiplication may be simulated by addition operation

9439034
subtraction	multiplication
multiplication is possible if microprocessor supports jumps and conditional instructions and subtraction is possible by adding negative number

9439046
onclientclick	detailsview
now instead of attaching the post_back to the insert with an onclientclick we are going to attach it to the detailsview with the oniteminserted parameter

9439069
width	height
return resize.resizetofill width instance.width height instance.height

9439132
min	max
edit you said in the edited question that min and max will actually be passed in by a subclass of searchmanager

9439159

save the image in a format that java supports like jpg gif or png

9439179
post	get
remove get or post attributes from controller

9439202

9439218
ivar	subclassing
in this subclassing i have an ivar named title

9439218
ivar	subclassing
in the init method of this subclassing i set this ivar like this

9439218
ivar	subclassing
so the solution is simply to retain my ivar in the subclassing like this

9439232
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome the image is expanding to the full height of the screen in google-chrome but not in firefox or ie

9439256
multiplying	add
the problems of 1 and 2 multiplying because every time you write a function that returns a plot element you have to add a confusing nulling statement

9439331
int	chars
the lotusscript uni function returns a long containing the int value of the unicode chars

9439336
listboxitem	textbox
this doesn t answer your question but gives an alternative solution by making a textbox look like a textblock when the listboxitem isn t selected

9439350
maven	m2e
this is a well known behaviour of the new maven eclipse integration plugin m2e since eclipse indigo

9439358
getter	setter
as an alternative i suggest you map the data from the database to private members of your class and you provide getter and setter for access to them

9439400
hide	show
easy way would be to hide show views etc based on 2

9439429
calloc	malloc
if portability is important the library presents a wrapper around malloc or calloc to grab chunks of memory and then apply a more efficient implementation as measured against the particular goals the library wants to achieve

9439434
background-repeat	background-size
don t think background-repeat repeat-x will be needed if background-size 100 100 is used

9439461
uiview	subviews
i ve a subclass of uiview with a uilabel with is added as subviews to the view

9439539

in my listview there is a checkbox textview and an imageview

9439593
udp	tcp
tcp tunneling udp to tcp and vice-versa

9439647
try-catch	exception-handling
you could use try-catch to catch the exception-handling and just ignore it or better you could respond to that exception-handling

9439727
express	node.js
i have a node.js app built using coffescript on express connect jade less

9439743
textmate	sublimetext
however you can map textmate s txmt to sublimetext using this app

9439760
post	get
i have a filter that if the session has expired and the method is post then adds the faces-redirect param to the url and makes the browswer not to cache the page in order to avoid the viewexpiredexception but doesn t work i still get that exception

9439764
pop-up	dialog
my handlers for the second dialog tab is below and contains a pop-up to confirm the button was clicked which works ok

9439768
children	parent
even if there were a thread-creation event .net can t tell you the parent or children of a given thread

9439768
getter	setter
i m often been bitten by the needless coupling between property getter and setter in a derived class or derived interface you can t simply add a setter when the base class or base interface only has a getter

9439768
getter	setter
if you override a getter then you are not allowed to define a setter

9439768
getter	setter
and you can t define the setter as virtual but the getter as non-virtual

9439792
hash	salt
add salt to your hash

9439806
primes	modulus
they told you that the modulus was a primes for a reason

9439809
hide	show
now there s two ways to interpret this you either want to grab specific data from a webpage and present that in native views textview or you re looking for a way to manipulate the original code and hide show specific elements

9439809
htmlcleaner	jsoup
hence you ll probably want to use some html parser jsoup htmlcleaner etc

9439809
hide	show
that way you ll be able to grab data from specific elements or even manipulate the original page to show hide what you want the user to see in the end

9439859
pull	push
the following is immediately after a git pull git merge mybranch git push

you can re-run chef by pressing the apply button on the dashboard to have these cron jobs restored

9440257
ubuntu	debian
debian and by extension ubuntu handles postgresql fairly cleverly

9440282
for-loop	arrays
basically inside your for-loop where you are printing the names you should be loading an arrays list containing the values you would like to insert to the list later

9440294
put	get
make gooom static and put a call to it in main and you should see the object get collected

9440304
children	parent
i have to simultaneously insert data in the parent table and the children table so i thought on making a procedure that inserted in the parent table and another one that inserted in the child one which can call the former one

9440317
navigationcontroller	pushviewcontroller
they aren t loaded automatically unless the view is shown or does pushviewcontroller onto a navigationcontroller

9440327
mouseevent	mouselistener

getter	setter
you are much better off testing the externally visible behaviour behaviour not getter and setter

9440756
accessor	properties
the attr_accessor s will overwrite the accessor generated by activerecord causing them to not be persisted in the db--they ll be like plain old ruby properties members instead of the meta-programmed magic of activerecord

9440849
ubuntu	linux
we have a java process on linux ubuntu that runs as a http server

9440852
multiplying	multiplication
you do not need to multiplying the number of elements you want by sizeof char because sizeof char is defined by the standard to always be 1 and multiplication by 1 yields the other operand

9440855
filtering	grouping
just add who to the grouping and then use where to filtering out id 3

9440862
union	distinct
if g is connected and you can run saucy on a different graph prepare a colored graph h consisting of the disjoint union of g with itself and for each i recolor vertex x i in the first copy of g and y i in the second copy of g to be color i distinct from the existing colors in g

9440941
width	margin
it s a menu bar home connect friends account and a login button and all is dynamic to the browser width so i can t put it margin auto

in windows i don t have this issue as much as i don t work from the terminal as often but i would really like to fully replace gedit with sublimetext in my ubuntu 11.10 install

9441026
superclass	subclassing
which means that another function that can take more arguments counts as a subclassing since it can process anything that the superclass can process and if it produces a smaller set of results that s okay since it will also obey the superclass construct that way

9441051
for-loop	loops
as for loops i have tried using a for-loop while and do while

9441092
int	chars
# returns false if the chars is not an int

9441096

margin	word-spacing	margin	letter-spacing	letter-spacing	word-spacing
these selections can only have the following properties applied to them font properties text-decoration text-transform letter-spacing word-spacing when appropriate line-height float vertical-align only if â floatâ is â noneâ margin properties padding properties border properties color property and background properties

9441116
sorting	filtering
i think the best way to structure an app like this is to have the data inside a custom object which has its own methods to modify the data later for example sorting and filtering so if foo is my object with the stock data i can do something like foo.sort or something like foo.render to create the html representation of the data

9441130
stringbuilder	bufferedreader
use bufferedreader and youll get 70 + improvement use stringbuilder instead of string buffer unless you need syncronization

9441130
stringbuilder	bufferedreader
stringbuilder and bufferedreader line by line 211 ms

9441130
stringbuilder	bufferedreader
stringbuilder and bufferedreader char by char 348 ms

9441130
stringbuilder	bufferedreader
so use stringbuilder + bufferedreader and make it read line by line for best results

9441138
multicastdelegate	delegation
there are actually two delegation types delegation and multicastdelegate

9441138
multicastdelegate	delegation
similarly multicastdelegate hold multiple delegation objects which each point to an individual object methodinfo combination

9441138
multicastdelegate	delegation
going back to implementation details when you define a delegation it creates an inherited class from multicastdelegate with an invoke method also the object can be null for static methods

9441146
post	get
remember that functions like get post and getjson will defer to this function so they will behave similarly

9441156
single-quotes	double-quotes
you re using single-quotes for your html attributes so within the inline onfocus handler your js should use double-quotes but because the whole string is in double-quotes you have to escape those double-quotes

9441159
calloc	malloc
instead of allocating the string this way you need to allocate fresh memory on the heap for it using malloc or calloc and set newstr to point to it

9441165
width	height
specify layout width and height attribute to the ur textview

9441172
uilabel	uitextview
i m thinking that i ll need to use uitextview or uilabel but i m having trouble making it work

9441182
multiplying	add
as i understand it you have a software implementation of a transcendental function like sin x expressed in terms of ieee standard operations such as floating point add and multiplying and you want to ensure that you get the same answer on all machines or at least all the machines that you care about

9441182
multiplying	add
to get that exact you would need to have a software implementation of the ieeee standard operations like fp add and multiplying

9441182
x86	64bit
1 shows how to change the x86 x87 precision control from 80 bit to 64bit using inline assembly

9441182
multiplying	add
-ffp-contract off --- disable fused multiplying add since not all of your target machines may have them

9441217
multicastdelegate	delegation
also i didn t discuss various other topics related to delegation such as chaining that s a feature provided by the multicastdelegate base class but hopefully i ve addressed your question

9441256
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i use google-chrome but i also need to make it work for firefox and safari

9441319

then i get stuck i cannot seem to figure out how to draw the arrays i know i need to use a for-loop to check through the arrays but this is my first time working with 2d arrays

9441419
filesystems	ntfs
outside of that i know system.getproperty and runtime have methods to grab information on the disk being used but nothing that specifically calls out the filesystems type ntfs fat32 etc.

9441449
wav	ogg
you should try to convert the wav file to an ogg file then you will get the best compress rate for sound file

for your reference when i get confused with views and the sequence of the methods i input nslogs in viewdidappear viewdidload drawrect and viewwillappear to clarify what is happening

9441488
viewdidappear	viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewdidappear
the sequence should be viewdidload - viewwillappear - drawrect - viewdidappear

9441495
button	checkbox
assuming you have a button or something on click of which you want to create a url with all the checked loctype checkbox values appended to the url seperated by or

mongodb	dbref
note that at the time of writing joins and relationships will only work with a relational database not for things like mongodb s dbref

9442211
uitapgesturerecognizer	uigesturerecognizer
i think the best solution for you would be to implement with uigesturerecognizer where one would be the uitapgesturerecognizer and the other a uilongpressgesturerecognizer

9442222
jobs	cron
i set my php file in cron jobs with command home findia public_html ifs ifs-admin reminder_mail.php

9442249
punctuation	words
i need a regex for removing all words from a string which contain at least one character which is not a utf-8 letter or number or punctuation in the middle of the words but not at the end

9442249
punctuation	words
is here would not contain any bad words as the punctuation is at the end of the words

9442250
getter	setter
avoid calling the getattribute and setattribute methods of element objects in favor of accessing attribute properties that have getter and setter

9442269
google-chrome	safari
i ran into this problem and from some google search i realized that this is probably a bug in google-chrome and safari browsers

9442273
width	height
height width are #define constants

i tried to simply duplicate this technique but in firefox and google-chrome if i set a column of tds border-right attributes to solid there are gaps at the vertical divisions of the table

9442524
box-sizing	margin
padding border or margin unless the box-sizing css property is

if the parent of that is the document body as in your snippet then that will have the width of the browser window sans margin border padding of the element if any

9442542
submit	submission
the fake form could post to a non-existant url but you could then use javascript to intercept the onsubmit of the fake form copy the username and password into the invisible real form invoke submit on the real form and return false to prevent the original form submission from going through

9442546
inherited	subclassing
if you don t need a polymorphic query you will want to use mappedsuperclass which means that your base class contains annotations for mapping meta data which are inherited by the subclassing but the base class itself does not have an identity and therefore is not queryable but you can query for the sub classes

9442604
width	height	min	max
you can get get min and max width height to work in older ie

9442611
centos	linux

membase	couchbase
membase stats couchbase because we upgraded to 1.8.0

9442614
width	text-align
the first idea i had was to override dijit css to align tabs with text-align right but that would not work because tabs domnodes are children of div which width is over 50000px so tabs won t be visible

9442627
min	max
if this is not what s required then you can do an appropriate aggregate meaning min or max most likely on the dates within the month

9442627
min	max
i will say that most dbms i m familiar with would probably baulk on the max t3.rate and min t2.rate terms

9442628
min	max
if your chart is static you could try tweaking with the x axis max and min

9442629
unix	solaris	unix	bsd	solaris	bsd
linux is as good a choice as any but the books and documents that you need were likely written using solaris or bsd unix

9442856
mouse	keyboard
i m giving it keyboard focus and mouse focus

9442917
margin	height
in older versions of ie and height can return the wrong values because it does not account for margin padding or some other reason

9442917
width	height
the main point is that it s broken in older ie s so you need to set the width height to something big enough for it to display right

9442920
super	extends
the mixin implementations can be overridden either in higher sub- interfaces as the seek order for implementations happen per method and goes from the declared interface left-to-right and then to each of the super interfaces also left-to-right in the extends clause

9442986
post	get
so inside your post controller action you will get the settings list property initialized but don t expect to find any values for the other properties in this setting class unless of course you include input fields for them in the form and more precisely in the editor template that i have shown

9448060
crypt	hash
then i searched for words stings like crypt hash aes encrypt sha etc etc. i came up with a bunch of things most notably blowfish64 which seems to go nicely with the fact that mydata occasionally is 4 bytes too long and since it is guranteed to be mod 12 0 this to me looks like padding for 64 bit block size odd amounts of vertices result in non mod 8 amounts of bytes

note that inside the min function i cast the color value from double to int otherwise min double double overload is called and 255 gets first converted to double and then possibly back to byte involving an extra rounding

9448643
super	implements
for the 2nd part i have implements a message inspector along with an extension method which makes it super easy to attach the saml with outgoing messages

9448673
hash	salt
as for accessing an api all you really need to do is hash and or salt user information and then save the information if necessary in the keychain you could add extra security by encrypting the passwords before pushing them into the keychain

9448678
width	height
so if sencha is setting the width and height to 100 it won t expand vertically but should fill the parent horizontally

9448747
margin	height
jquery has 3 height calculating functions that take the margin padding and border values into account differently

9448748
free	malloc
incorrect checksum for free object - object was probably modified after being free often comes from smashing the memory contents around the memory you malloc d that is index out of bounds or doing exactly what it s telling you - modifying the memory contents after freeing them - and that s my best guess as to what s happening

9448785
jar	manifest.mf
with this configuration all jar files project and dependencies are listed in the manifest.mf s classpath and their entries files at directory level and package names according to the jar index doc will occur in index.list

9448785
maven-assembly-plugin	maven-jar-plugin
note #3 do not use both the jar-with-dependencies maven-assembly-plugin and addclasspath maven-jar-plugin or you ll double all entries in the resulting jar

9448785
jar	manifest.mf
note #4 the java jar command line tool does also evaluate the manifest.mf s classpath besides explicit listing of jar files when invoking the tool as shown in my initial example see the index example of the jar doc

i have a layout containing two textview and one imageview

9448799
inherited	properties
you can also set it to inherited or none to set all three properties to inherited or none

9448820
hide	show
one work-around that hasn t yet been mentioned is that you can continue to use display block none to hide show the element but set its opacity to 0 so that even when it s display block it s still invisible

9448841
post	get
you can simply get post an url like tz time_zone where time_zone is whatever timezone you want to set

9448856
width	height
i want the outer div to take 100 width to fill the container and a height of say 250px

9448927
uinavigationcontroller	uiwindow
the application has a rootviewcontroller of the uiwindow that is a uinavigationcontroller

9448941
implements	extends
if you only want the enumerable keys of an object i would consider extends the object when object.keys if not implements instead of using the json object which isn t available in all major browsers either

9448985
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
so right now i have a server that is running with objectinputstream and objectoutputstream

9449006
packets	pcap
i m writing network analyzer and i need to filter packets saved in file i have written some code to filter http packets but i m not sure if it work as it should because when i use my code on a pcap dump the result is 5 packets but in wireshark writing http in filter gives me 2 packets and if i use

9449006
ftp	telnet
and or if i m filtering it wrong then how can i do it right also is there a way to filter http or ssh ftp telnet ... packets using something else than the port numbers

9449014
int	chars
void stroccr chars inputstr 100 chars outputstr chars delim int occrno chars stringside

9449091
hide	show
every submenu is an children of and at the same time children of a so you can easily create a function to show or hide a menu which accepts a jquery object as parameter

9449173
pascal	delphi
my coding is free pascal but delphi solutions will work probably

9449197
submit	submission
iâ m utilizing ajax to submit the form and php to process add to db a valid form submission

9449218
onmousedown	mouseup	mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	onmousedown
i basically have a onmousedown followed by a mousemove this lets me find a way to work out the offset amount with the mouse but if i mouseup - it still keeps following the mouse

9449241
clang	llvm
but when i do so my compiler clang llvm on linux issues the following error

9449243
for-loop	arrays
it looks from your server implementation that the arrays variable is never instantiated so if your list were not empty it would likely npe in array.add but in this case it look like your list may be empty so the for-loop is not iterated up and getoverviewentities method returns null hence the 204 result

9449247
min	max
it s easy to swap out the max with min avg or sum

9449252
mousemove	mouseup
add an event listener for mouseup and there remove the event listener for mousemove

9449328
width	border-box
the border-box value as opposed to the content-box default makes the final rendered box the declared width and any border and padding cut inside the box

9449378
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this is how the form looks in safari firefox and google-chrome

9449378
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the only fix for safari google-chrome and firefox is adding a margin-top or padding-top to the labels but this destroys the form in ie8 and ie9

9449387
width	height
and since your aspect ratio will be 4 3 or 16 9 width height you get an oval instead of a circle

9449471
getter	setter
in the class constructur i query the database and stores all info in instance variables inside the class and retrieve them with getter setter

9449473
int	chars
i cannot imagine why you are doing this by converting the timestamp to a string extracting some chars out of it then converting it to a float and then converting again this time to an int

9449538
interpolation	splines
on a different subject i have used interpolation splines in scipy with success in the past

9449563
children	parent
once all b child nodes are calculated the parent score is calculated based on the children and at that point the child nodes can be removed from storage

9449591
mousemove	mouseup
then in the mouseup listener remove the mousemove listener

9449604
width	height
the likely problem is that you assume that the body and html containers default to 100 width and 100 height

9449604
width	height
by default the width is 100 but the height adjusts to the content inside the html body containers

9449622
hide	show
to show hide a link depending on user role i get the following

9449664
int	double
for example i have four int two and two double

9449739
width	height
ideally the div should have no width and height declared meaning let the content decide it s dimensions

9449739
width	height
additionally you can add this to make sure the image is snug in the div and again it s idea you don t set width and height to the div

9449775
folder	directory
i create 2 folder php and cache in my root directory and put the simplepie.inc file in php

9449791
stdout	stderr
but if you need to capture both stderr and stdout

i have the following code to call the onload and onbeforeunload event

9449817
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i ended up with a somewhat interesting solution that worked for me in at least google-chrome firefox and safari where i tested it

9449817
width	margin
the left margin needs to be set to half of the div width

9449858
superclass	subclassing
here s another alternative assuming you have control of all the classes involved abstract out the fields in the superclass and declare them in the subclassing sort of like this.

9449879
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
if i use a cdn edgecast but also another one i tested on then my google maps embedded in the pages don t show up in google-chrome and firefox but do show up fine in safari all latest versions cannot test it on ie

9449879
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
if you want to have a look at a page working fine in safari but not in google-chrome firefox you can have a look at

9449982
for-loop	arrays
also you should use the vanilla for-loop when iterating arrays

9450006
client-side	server-side
try both client-side and server-side cursors and see what happens

9450147
google-chrome	firefox
people tell me to use async on then it fails on every browser status 0 when i run it with async off it works 100 fine on google-chrome but with firefox it flickers the error code but still changes the width of the progress bar

9450176
put	get
i would like to be able to get just the formatted text from every part and put it into one html file

i am able to download and play the audio files just fine on firefox google-chrome and safari but not on internet explorer

the attribute will be saved in memory untill the user-class gets fflush sent to garbage collector

9450229
typedef	struct
you can access sample x the same way you could access a typedef or a struct class declaration inside the class

9450250
comparator	comparable
i am searching up on the internet and trying different ways of going about this including using comparator comparable etc

9450314
g++	gcc
also make sure you use g++ and not gcc

9450314
g++	gcc
since gcc is compiler for c and g++ is for c++

9450367
put	get
one way to get around this is to do or to put the encode method after .read to force ascii and ignore unicode though this is a lazy fix

9450389
mouseup	mousedown
you will have to use the mouseup or mousedown event instead of the click event to capture right click

9450394
dpkg	apt	rpm	yum
typical developers will likely want to install gcc the typical way use your package manager yum rpm apt dpkg port brew etc. or follow the instructions here

9450396
mvp	presenter
however i am not sure how to deal with models using this gwt platform in the common mvp i know there is a go method in the presenter which fetches data say from server via rpc

9450410
getter	setter
let s say i create some custom version of displayobject that overrides some functions setter and getter

9450414
setinterval	settimeout
it happens with setinterval but not with settimeout

9450422
mpfr	mpc
it depends on gmp mpfr mpc and elf

9450426
min	max
i am trying to access a variable in the first object of the array and the last object of the arraylist which will give me the min age and max age from the arraylist

9450444
pull	push
since i believe sync does both git pull and git push it s trying to pull and merge changes from the remote repository to your local branch

9450444
pull	push
edit under repository you can do push cmd + p or pull shift + cmd + p

9450515
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
the font is displayed properly in ie opera but in google-chrome firefox safari it looks small and something totally different.

9450549
hash	salt
a salt is a sequence of characters added to a string about to being hash so it s harder for an attacker to obtain the original string

9450549
hash	salt
however for a cipher algorithm that is not based on hash a salt isn t necessary because the attackers will obtain anyway the original string with the salt and it s just needed logic to remove it

9450550
hash	md5
i prefer one-way hash like md5 or sha but many like decryptable passwords like you re storing

9450552
ember.js	backbone.js
would backbone.js or ember.js handle this better

9450556
superclass	subclassing
one way would be to add the category to their common superclass nsmanagedobject but that has the consequence of adding the category s methods to all nsmanagedobject subclassing when i want to add the methods to three nsmanagedobject subclassing book chapter page

9450556
inherited	subclassing
another solution would be to subclassing nsmanagedobject and then have book chapter and page inherited from that nsmanagedobject subclassing

9450620
pull	push
whoever pushes second will have to do a git pull first and resolve any merge conflicts that occur before being able to push their changes to the remote repository

9450650
post	get
this works for get post and delete

9450656
width	height
question i assume that both width and height are positional arguments

9450658
width	height
the width and height of the overlay can be adjusted as needed or made dynamic in js

9450660
post	put
there is an interesting post on the rails blog about put patch that adds a lot more to this

9450708
cout	cin
then you can interact with std cin and std cout

9450716
consistency	acid
this strategy gives you the atomic and durable in acid but you do not get consistency and isolation

9450723
google-chrome	safari
using a tool like safari or google-chrome s web inspector check the headers being returned with the zero-byte image

9450736
onbeforeunload	onload
i have already created a javascript and php to check the visitors ip address when they open one of my page using onload and onbeforeunload event

9450742
post	put
basically i want non-authenticated users to be able to submit post and put requests to the create and update actions of my devices controller

9450745
filtering	grouping
you are filtering the source dataset with the having clause which is inefficient because all the data would have to be pulled grouping and only then filtering

9450760
for-loop	loops
but in that loops a continue statement will not have the same effect that a continue statement would have in a c for-loop

9450760
for-loop	loops
there is a complicated answer that lets you use a normal python for-loop like a c-style loops and allows updating loops variable by writing a custom iterator

9450778
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in google-chrome and firefox

9450887
width	margin
by setting a negative left margin on the textblock -20px equal to the difference of the textbox width 50px and the parents width 30px the full text is displayed vertically

9450893
phpfox	vbulletin
i tried to drop all the vbulletin tables as well as any other tables that doesn t have to do with phpfox but looks like site is still blank

9450913
mouse	keyboard
an enabled widget handles keyboard and mouse events

9450924
implements	extends
and then implements it into both mydisplayobject extends from displayobject and mymovieclip extends from movieclip using the technique described on the website above

9450942
width	height
i can adjust similarly by checking if they are outside the canvas width and height

9450977
getter	setter
for me the rule of thumb is to first prefer constructor injection and jump off to setter injection if constructor inject requires me to bend my back when working with legacy code with oop getter and setter methods

9451082
int	chars
each enumerated type shall be compatible with chars a signed int type or an unsigned int type

9451082
int	chars
so in your case 4 will certainly work since it fits in a chars and in any signed or unsigned int type on any machine i ve ever heard of

9451106
range	minimum
to set a minimum or maximum range in a regular expression you can use the syntax

scons	autotools
edit i was hoping not to turn this into another flame war but i guess that s inevitable so i will just say that i have considerably more experience with autotools and no desire to learn cmake or scons or imake or ant although i seem pretty much stuck with the latter when working with java these days or whatever new tool is invented next year or the year after

9451578
google-chrome	firefox
the rest of your question sounds like maybe you re trying to deal with the problem where google-chrome and firefox slow down timers when a tab goes to the background and then speed them up almost in a catchup mode when it comes to the foreground there are solutions

9451611
performselector	delegation
that said a lot of people do and to achieve this result your app delegation needs to put the same image on screen as you launch image and then you can delay launching your main app with performselector withobject afterdelay

9451682
button	checkbox
now each of my has multiple controls like select checkbox button but not fixed for every row and column

9451747
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
if you want to present a view to the user which is not part of a view hierarchy like a uitabbarcontroller or uinavigationcontroller or anything like that you must do so programmatically without using a view controller as a manager object of this class

9451777
post	get
i saw one post that suggested to input the results in inches for example 10 11 131 10 1 121 10 4 124 and use a parser to convert it into x y format but i couldn t get it to work

9456758
free	malloc
worse modern operating systems often over-allocate malloc and new will always return a valid pointer even if there is technically no or not enough free memory left â â so std bad_alloc will never be thrown or is at least not a reliable sign of memory exhaustion

9456758
disk	ram
in certain cases the program may attempt to free some memory and try again or use secondary memory disk instead of ram but these opportunities only exists in very specific scenarios

9457490
inherited	subclassing
my subclassing work great as individuals getting class circle to set the ivars using shape methods in shape and inherited them then calculate area using those

9457490

-creating an object in shape that then performs each of the functions of its subclassing - this sounds bad from what i ve read superclass shouldn t know about what their subclassing do.

in oop subclassing inherited all attributes of their superclass

this happens all the time when you connect to a webserver for example running apache backed by openssl from a browser which tend not to share their ssl tls stacks ie firefox and safari use different ssl tls libraries

9457769

9457851
min	max
i know and you know that the min will rarely if ever change and the max will change at most once per year

i m assuming that sql will cache that min and max and as long as the underlying tables are not modified it s smart enough to return me cached information

9457886
thin	webrick
i switched to using thin in local development instead of webrick

9457897
photoshop	fireworks
other adobe applications supporting fxg include fireworks flash illustrator photoshop and flash catalyst

9457908
min	max
caching the absolute min and max of a column wouldn t make sense because they are dependent on any filtering done in the where clause

9457938
width	height
what you need to do is check the height width calculations and if they are outside of the minimum requirements then replace them with a fixed value

9457956
range	minimum
so for instance if you re coding up a ga just for practice to find the minimum of say f x x 2 you know pretty well that your range should be + - something because you already know that you re going to find the answer at x 0

9457971
accessor	superclass	accessor	properties

i agree with the others that compiling to machine code does not make much sense mind that c free malloc have same or higher costs than java new garbage collection

9458052
post	get
my understanding is the php sets up _request for both post and get request types

9458052
post	put
i ve read overwriting _post for put or delete requests but that would overwrite _post with put data that to me would be wrong as _post is describing post data not put data in the name of the variable

9458055
width	height
i ve tried to set style height xxxpx but it looks awful with width too

9458067
daemons	systemd
the ssh daemons checks for file systemd permissions and will refuse to use the contents of .ssh if it or its parent is writable by other users

use strstr to locate the substr and strncpy with a bit of pointer arithmetic n startofprefix - startofstring to copy the prefix to a new buffer don t forget to null terminate the new string

9458120
strstr	substr
if you just want to throw away the substr and everything after it you could just set the location returned by strstr to 0 to terminate the string there

9458121
put	get
how can i get excel to put all the months and years between two date ranges

9458125
width	height
you could also just set the width to a pixel measure in the html or the css and leave the height or vice-versa depending on whether you need them the same height or same width

9458125
width	height
obviously if you need to crop to a set height and width this won t work but it will give you columns or rows that match in width or height

9458127
filtering	grouping
you want to join on the group_ref table twice once to filtering regular join and once to get the related grouping left join

9458132
strstr	substr
you can use strstr to find the occurrence of the substr

9458140
rar	zip
beware that this approach has serious caveats if your data can be real pseudo random or compressed data then it will also look like than a pile of random bits so for example you won t be able to distinguish between a simple and an encrypted rar zip file

9458158
hash	salt
a further improvement would be to salt the password before you hash it

9458160

9458172
google-chrome	safari
i m using safari but i have tried in google-chrome

9458173
fgets	strtod
if what you mean by command line input is reading input from stdin then that has nothing to do with argv and you should instead be using scanf or fgets + strtod

9458173
atof	strtod
note that there s also the function atof which is essentially a version of strtod that doesn t give you the extra error checking capability

9458215

post	get
i want to test api so i don t really care about functions and objects i just want to make sure that when i send post to api users.json i will see that user in json array from get api users

9458410
int	chars
basically rather than writing a linked list for int and one for floats and another one for unsigned chars you realize that all those data structures look formally the same and so you create one single list template which you can then instantiate on int floats and unsigned chars and perhaps a lot more

9458544
public	protected
i m confused on when you have to include public private protected and refer to the variable with this- and when you can just create a variable

9458547
min	max
assuming that max is the second array and min is the first

9458576
public	protected
public protected and private provide scope resolution for class functions methods and member variables

9458607
jruby	rubinius
rvm allows now building jruby rubinius with default mode set by default

9458607

the --1.9 mode will become the default in next major releases of jruby rubinius so you can make sure you will use 1.8 with --1.8 rvm switch

9458638
put	get
but i get the info two times and the orderingtext is filled x2 so to prevent the second iteration i put a break to stop it but i think is not the way how it works htmlagilitypack or i m doing something wrong

9458747
folder	dir
you must copy just the zend folder from the library zend in the unzipped dir into some location

9458791
int	chars
the reason reader s read doesn t just return a chars is that using an int lets it use -1 to represent end-of-file

9458820
awt	swing
there s a long article about how painting in awt and swing works

9458838
ssl	https
you still have to ensure it goes thro ssl https

9458844
int	chars
fr.read is returning an int and not a chars although that int returned is the equivalent ascii code for that chars

9458844
int	chars
when you call string.valueof on that int the string.valueof int i method gets called instead of the string.valueof chars c method which you are expecting to get called and therefore it returns the ascii value as a string instead of the chars value as a string

9458904

view this in google-chrome or firefox it displays

9459327
post	get
most browsers interpret this as if the first request was a post don t re-send the data for the redirected request but make the second request a get anyway. this would explain why you lose any posted body for the second attempt

9459350

until now i ve been using indy 10 without issues but after recent problem with installation of tms component pack i am looking for alternative way to upgrade indy

the problem is that when i start a thread with iresource.request and give it a subclassing as the first argument it ll call the superclass method

9459605
getter	setter
since you re implementing the getter setter yourself the synthesize isn t helpful

9459605
getter	setter
the second job is to synthesize the getter setter

9459605
getter	setter
if you don t need the backing ivar and if you re providing implementations for the getter setter yourself then you don t need the synthesize at all

9459949
google-chrome	safari
i tested this on google-chrome safari and internet explorer

9459950

post	get
i made a commenting system and i am trying to get it to post under a micropost but i constantly get this routing error

9460084
min	max
however you should take into account that i don t get why for id 1 in tablea you choose the 16 to match against table c which is the max and for id 2 in tablea you choose the 10 to match against table c which is the min

9460093
post	put	post	get	put	get
what s weird is that all of the http verbs post get and delete are working with an exception for put method

9460097
width	height
you can use ready and resize events to trigger a function which will set the height appropriately based on the width of the window

9460097

children	parent
1 kill the parent and keep the children in this case you remove the parent entity and send all the fields from that entity to each of the children

9460541
children	parent
in other words if a parent row can have more than one children when sending the fields to each child the parent data will be duplicated in each children

9460541
children	parent
2 kill children and keep the parent in this case you remove all the children and send all of their attributes to the parent

9460541
children	parent
as the parent is now a mix of itself and all of its children it needs a way to determine what row belongs to what type of children

9460541
children	parent
disadvantages again if a parent can have a row that relates to more than one children data will be duplicated as there will be one row per each of them so there is a limitation in this solution

9460541
children	parent
null values will have to be assigned to the data that children have and the parent nor other children have

9460541
children	parent
3 keep all the least bloody solution is not to kill anything in this case the hierarchy is replaced by a relationship between the parent and each of the children

9460541
children	parent
in this case a parent row can be linked to more than one children without duplicating data

9460541
children	parent
if the most queries will require data from parent and children this schema will be the worst in terms of performance

however there is no implicit or explicit conversion between an int and a string because obviously a string is not an int despite the fact that a string can contain chars for an int

int	boolean
however convert is written specifically to be able to convert from one type to another for example convert.tobool x can parse true or false to boolean and as you have shown it can convert an int to a string - again this is really a convenience that probably just calls int32.tostring under the hood

serializable	deserialization
also datacontractjsonserializer allows you fine control over the whole process of serializable deserialization by altering types resolution logic and replacing the types you serializable with surrogates

9465083
serializable	deserialization
but if it s persistence logic where i want to save objects into a data store usually no-sql storage to load them later i prefer using datacontractjsonserializer because the overhead of putting attributes is worth of flexibility in the serializable deserialization process tuning especially when it comes to loading of serializable data into the objects of the newer version with updated definitions

put	get
to demonstrate the problem let s say that i have a resource that i can perform standard read change delete methods on and that i use the http idioms of get put and delete respectively to implement those methods

9466559
put	get
in this way the user-agent can understand that a link with a edit relationship will allow the resource to be get put and deleted

9466559
put	get
alternatively option c i could leave the edit relationship in place and accept the lack of precision the link would convey the get put delete semantics but a user-agent attempting a put would be met with an http error 405 - method not allowed

9466619
folder	directory
this is really simple loacte the file eigenobjectrecognizer.cs it is locates in the emgu installation directory emgu.cv or where ever you extracted the files you should be able to lacate it as it s in the same folder as the bin folder with all the .dlls you use

what you could do is listen to mouseenter mouseleave of the underlying line and if you get a mousedown within a certain radius of the initial mouseenter leave count this as a hit

9467853
hmac	md5
it s safer than sgp in that it s based on sha-2 instead of md5 hmac instead of simple concatenation of domain and master password base94 all printable characters instead of base64

9467853
hash	salt
besides it supports customizable salt and hash iteration for key stretching

maya	3dsmax
at this point i suspect you re trying to make custom render farm from scratch and if i m right about that correct solution would be to use existing software - maya 3dsmax had some render farm support and it should be possible to make blender-based render farm as well

9468133
maya	blender
from those packages maya definitely had scripting support mel python i think and good portion of blender is written in python

9468133
maya	3dsmax	maya	blender	3dsmax	blender

9476188
rubygems	bundler
as for why this isn t even conceivable to achieve with bundler at least now what happens if the dependency versions for the gem are different in the rubygems version vs

9476194
division	modulo
also you re looking for the modulo not division

9476278

is there anyway to get image width and height without downloading from original location in python

9476336
int	chars
the raw data is just prepackaged as unsigned chars though with the user basically knowing which of the signed int formats should be used for reading we know how many bytes to read at once

9476336
int	chars
even though data is stored as an unsigned chars array data are meant to be read signed as two s-complement int

9476341
requestfactory	gwt
requestfactory changes in gwt 2.4

9476356
mouse	keyboard
this example shows one way to select multiple objects using keyboard or mouse and drag

i know the equation for distance is slightly off but what i m more concerned about at the moment is that the program does not print out an altitude of 0 when the object hits the ground

9476375
min	max	range	min	range	max
anyway once the dates table is created do a left join from your dates table to your streak table using your min and max dates from your streak table as your range limiter

9476389
rss	feed
here is my rss feed url

9476483

restrict the range of dates that can be selected max today min 100 years ago

9476569
min	max
with the following javascript the datepicker works the text field is properly formatted but no max min date is set and no initialization with the stored date occurs

9476569
min	max	range	min	range	max
i added to this functions that i though would set min max range and initialize as follows

9476569
min	max	range	min	range	max
this is initializing the date picker correctly but is not setting a min max range

9476573
ssl	https
i do not get any ssl errors on loading https but rather i get a white screen with no load

if you put an id on the table tag itself you can get all cells in the table into an array like this

9476785
put	get
i ve put logger statements in the controller code and they never even get printed

9476790
hash	salt	hash	hmac
it looks like the php code you re referencing is using the sitesalt as the key for the hmac function with the password and salt concatenated specified as the value to be hash

9476800
getter	setter
in above apprach you can use app delegate to store the dictionary with setter getter and access it using uiapplication sharedappliation delegate object

9476803
button	checkbox
i have a datalist inside that i am using a checkbox i have 1 asp button and 2 image button which is outside of datalist something like this

9476954
printing	pdf-generation
printing eclipse-plugin pdf-generation itext google-cloud-print

9476988
for-loop	arrays
there are a few ways i can think of but the easiest would be to wrap it in a function line your data up in an arrays then call the function in a for-loop

9476999
plural	inflection
however for english a plural inflector is just a few lines of code plus a dictionary of exceptions base form and inflection for words with an irregular plural form

9477084
getter	setter
defining it as a property creates getter and setter methods under the hood

9477103
mouse	trackpad
you may get slightly different values based on the dimensions of the device native trackpad vs magic mouse you re using with the multitouchsupport.framework

9477103
min	max
based on the width s observed min max values from mm -47.5 52.5 the trackpad is 100 units wide 75 units the other way

9477104
getter	setter
on your second example you create a setter and a getter method for the property thestr and by adding the nonatomic attribute you make your property not thread safety meaning that a thread can begin to modify your property while another one is already editing it

9477109
fadein	fadeout
i used avplayer to support fadein and fadeout effects for the background playback of mpmediaitems

9477162

9477240
mvp	presenter
for instance for mvp i could have a view project a presenter project and a model project with in a solution

9477240
mvp	presenter
so for an solution organised in an mvp pattern the presenter project would generate it s own .dll

9477240
mvp	presenter
the problem i see with this approach is for an mvp layout i would miss out on being able to have different views using my presenter project

9477271
outputstream	inputstream
in stead you ll have to use an inputstream and outputstream to copy the data across

9477333
textview	imageview
i am having an activity in which i am having some view that is textview imageview and mapview and last is listview on the page

9477334

according to my logic tablet must be with screens size 6 inches

9477421
screens	tablet
one another logic is also added which considers device as tablet with screens width 600px

9477435

i would just hide the content from the first tab when selecting the second tab showing up the hidden content with a show and changing the css properties of the buttons but i don t think this is the practical way of doing it

9477488
post	put
i ve put my configuration in environment.rb post initialisation but i think it s a hack

9477499
mouseover	mouseout
if i mouseover and mouseout .activate_tooltip once it continues to work thereafter

yacc	bison
generally you want to use error recovery rules sparingly in a yacc bison file

9477522

i can then send a post request to users 1 comments.json with some request parameters and the comment will get created like expected

9477734
uilabel	nsstring
is there any performance or memory overhead using uiimage or uilabel or nsstring in quartz2d

9477738
calloc	malloc
if you re really curious you could look at the calloc zero-filled allocation implementation in doug lea s malloc

9477756
ffmpeg	libav
older ubuntu versions used libav which is a fork of the ffmpeg project

9477756
ubuntu	debian	ffmpeg	libav
it is worth noting that the maintainer for debian ubuntu switched from ffmpeg to libav on his own accord due to being involved with the libav fork

9477756
ffmpeg	libav
for a while both libav and ffmpeg separately developed their own version of ffmpeg

9477756
ffmpeg	libav
libav then renamed their bizarro ffmpeg to avconv to distance themselves from the ffmpeg project

9477756
ffmpeg	libav
this message was removed upstream when the fake ffmpeg was finally removed from the libav source but depending on your version it can still show up in ubuntu because the libav source ubuntu uses is from the ffmpeg-to-avconv transition period

9477756
ffmpeg	libavformat	ffmpeg	libav
to further complicate matters libav chose a name that was historically used by ffmpeg to refer to its libraries libavcodec libavformat etc

9477756
ffmpeg	libav
for example the libav-user mailing list for questions and discussions about using the ffmpeg libraries is unrelated to the libav project

9477756
ffmpeg	libav
if you are using ffmpeg you could be using ffmpeg or libav

9477756
ffmpeg	libav
refer to the first line in the console output to tell the difference the copyright notice will either mention ffmpeg or libav

9477756
ffmpeg	libav
each of the ffmpeg or libav libraries contains a version.h header which shows a version number

9477756
ffmpeg	libav
for an interesting blog article on the situation as well as a discussion about the main technical differences between the projects see the ffmpeg libav situation

9477789
maven	pom.xml
i am attempting to make a maven parent pom.xml setup where i don t have to declare any plugin information in my child pom.xml everything is taken from the parent pom.xml

9477830
google-chrome	firefox
on firefox varnish is in play but not on google-chrome

9477834
for-loop	loops
the strategy is just wrap your while loops with a for-loop that takes care of processing each of the files one at a time

9477908
put	get
please note that we have access only to one node in the network from which we are transmitting packets and as such we cannot get to know the load being put by other nodes on the network

9477916
put	get
i am trying to put my app to the amazon store but i get the following error

9477932
for-loop	loops
if you craft the for-loop correctly you don t need the do-while loops

9477949
memcached	apc
memcached is a very good suggestion but if you only have a single webserver you can use apc just as well

9477968
maven	pom.xml
you can t avoid naming the plugin in the child pom.xml cause how should maven know which plugin are you using

9477969
innodb	myisam
change your table s storage from myisam to innodb

9477971

9477980
post	get
visitors click the url and will open the page and get the right post

9477980
post	get
however if anybody want he can input this url in browser and get the post he can even get a lot of different post if he knows other ids

9478037
hash	md5
this might look a little nicer than md5 hash but you would have to ensure url strings are not used several times

9478055
touchesmoved	touchesended
the reason i ask is because i am using touchedbegan touchesended and touchesmoved to keep a uiview under a user s finger

9478100
post	get
however if anybody want he can input this url in browser and get the post he can even get a lot of different post if he knows other ids

jobs	cron
was planning to move from setting up cron jobs to quartz scheduler

9478161
post	get

hash	md5
you can use md5 hash of random value + timestamp + page id saving that random value to cookie

9478192
portrait	landscape
it works for portrait images and almost works for the landscape ones but scales them too much

9478225
jar	war
it can simply include this xml file in your project output as war or jar or etc

9478250
udp	tcp
nats keep a table of active connections sometimes known as a port mapping table that keeps track of how to translate the ip port pair for active tcp connections and observed udp sessions

9478252
free	malloc
for the second solution you can keep the text variables as pointers and use malloc to allocate memory for them but then you have to free that memory when you are done with it

9478265
google-chrome	firefox
its shows the selected image in google-chrome firefox

9478282
min	max
however that doesn t seem to allow me to reinitialize change the min max from to in this case of the slider after i get back some new data through ajax

9478295
folder	directory
for example if you have a folder compile in the same directory as your .fla and it contains a class myclass the import statement would be

9478312
mkmapview	mkoverlay
you will need to create an mkmapview for your map then an mkoverlayview for your overlay view and some object of yours will need to implement the mkoverlay protocol

9478352
for-loop	arrays
the basic for-loop was extended in java 5 to make iteration over arrays and other collections more convenient

9478441
instances	transient	persistent	transient
persistent the given transient instances first assigning a generated

9478487
post	get
it works fine when i use get instead of post

9478540
mousemove	mouseenter	mousemove	mouseleave	mouseleave	mouseenter
as far as i understand the problem is mousemove mouseenter and mouseleave events are not fired when mouse left button is down

9478568
lwuit	lcdui
because i created a sender application in lwuit format and now i don t want the receiver to be in lcdui

9478595
width	height
i need read the content of the usercontrol using the style and adjust the width and height and display the content

9478683
post	get
or for just the post data the above also includes get parameters

9478693
union	distinct
if you want a union that means that the values are distinct between the statements

9478695
folder	directory
there are two surefire directory in the target folder

9478718
post	get
the problem is that your get action deletecategory doesn t have the same as your post action delete

9478718
post	get
or if you don t want to do that you should rename your get method to be he same as the post method

9478718
post	get
now since both your get and post actions are named the same way you could use the beginform helper without arguments because the distinction between those actions will be based on the http verb used to invoke them

9478718
post	get
so don t expect to get anything out of this category that your post action expects

9478740
google-chrome	firefox
the most likely cause is normalization of the accept-encoding header both firefox and google-chrome send a different one

9478746
width	height
i want to set only a minimum height on my jpanel and leave the retrieval of the minimum width to the panel s layout manager as i want to leave the minimum width to be whatever the layout manager decides

9478780

9478919
draggable	droppable
everything you want to achieve is doing able with jquery ui and the draggable droppable extensions provided within

9478950
width	margin
then for some reason when i use a width of 96 or even 100 and a margin of a few percent it doesn t stretch to the right end like it normally should so there s always a bigger margin on the right hand side of the viewport

9478951
post	get
but to send the data you will have to use get or post method of http

9478951
post	get
for sending text only get is enough but for sending images video its better to go with post methods with base64 encryption

9478971
min	max
and i was wondering how to read the min and max values from property file please advise

9478976

i switched to 1.7.1 and it works on firefox and google-chrome can t test it on ie

9479203
int	double
apparently when php encounters a number that exceeds the upper limit of 2 147 483 647 for an int it automatically converts the numberâ s type from int into a double

9479261
implements	extends
if you re talking about a scenario where your components always implements both interfaces - well in that case you should create a third interface - not an anonymous on-the-fly construct - that extends both of these to a single composite whole

9479282

9480223
post	get
i think i see also the advantages of rest using of simple http verbs get post delete etc... but that s not the main point here.

9480224
screens	hdpi
i would also rather not have to do this because if i make the images 4 times smaller there is little point in accounting for hdpi and xhdpi screens at all - quality will be a lot worse on these

9480263
prepare	execute
beacuse to achive update i would have to build a query prepare it that would return pdo statement object and then i would have to bindvalues and then execute

innodb	myisam
having done some research on stackoverflow i m looking into creating the table again as a innodb table and then creating a copy in myisam

9480790
innodb	myisam
then i will create triggers which will replicate any changes in the innodb table to the myisam table

9480790
innodb	myisam
my question is will i see much benefit in the myisam table as surely it is going to be written to as often as before because every write to the innodb table will result in a subsequent write to the myisam

9480791
for-loop	arrays
try it in the other way pass your arrays to mapoverlay and make the for-loop inside the method draw in this case you will create only one mapoverlay instead of 500 and draw 500 lines with one mapoverlay and you will get the same result

9480803
width	height
the outline is not a part of the element s dimensions therefore the element s width and height properties do not contain the width of the outline

it worked for my radio button code but not my checkbox

9480826
google-chrome	firefox
the following code doesn t work in firefox and google-chrome but works in ie

9480855
for-loop	loops
in the for-loop this data line also results in an error message but loops continues and all the other t-tests give correct results

9480872
innodb	myisam
using triggers to copy from myisam to innodb has the risk of creating inconsistent data when transactions are rolled back

9480872
innodb	myisam
another idea would be to synchronise myisam with innodb periodically using event scheduler

9480886
rvm	bundler
suggest using rvm the ruby environment manager bundler and gemsets

9480886
rvm	bundler
rvm for managing ruby versions and for allowing you to use gemsets - bundler to specify the versions of the gems you want to use in the project

9480911
post	get
the form can pass parameters in 2 ways get and post

9480911
post	get
the only difference between them is that get parameters pass are visible in the url where are post parameters are passed by the browser internally

9480918
width	height
this should work until things are resized.if you want to handle things on resize too you can add a resize handler and recompute the width height

9480929

the situation is easy to reproduce both locally using cassini and on our test server windows 2008 r2 x64 running iis 7.5

9481238
mouseup	mousedown
imo the best way to simulate this effect would be to work with some kind of timer - where you log the time from mousedown to mouseup and calculate what this means in terms of pressure

9481288
hide	show
when either one is selected it will hide or show certain data boxes below

9481292
int	chars	factors	matrix
this will work for a data frame that contains only numeric int factors or other variables that can be coerced to numeric but any chars strings chars will cause the matrix to become a chars matrix

9481382
int	chars
please note that data types like chars int float are not initialized

9481407
mouseup	mousedown
but as dennis flood said you can use a timer to calculate how long it was pressed on mousedown start a timer then on mouseup stop the timer and calculate the time

9481420
getter	setter
the first is particularly clever being that valueforkey will always return an nsobject even when the value is actually a primitive so float int bool types will be wrapped in an nsnumber automatically by the kvc getter and unwrapped in the kvc setter

9481480
filtering	grouping
you might be able to ask for the exanded entities separately with additional queries with the right filtering and possibly use batch to grouping all the queries in one request

filtering	grouping
this explains the existence of the rather odd having clause in order to do further filtering after grouping by summarization has been applied

9482105
children	parent
in ef you also need to create a parent-child relation on reportdefinition linking the children to the parent using parentid

9482150
width	height
the legends are static and wont change but the corressponding labels will vary in width and height

9482180

versioning	upgrade
it is possible to run nodes on different versioning of the software but this is normally only done in the context of an upgrade of the cluster and so i d recommend upgrading your cluster to the latest release 7.2 if possible before starting the process

9483056
versioning	upgrade
for reference you can see the upgrade compatibility between different cluster versioning at

9483059
width	height
the image element is trying to keep its aspect ratio since you only specified a height and not a width

9483067
width	height
x and y should be greater than 0 and less than 1 and there is no gradient because height and width should be less

9483071
width	height
but i think because you slidetoggle the image tag directly the width is changed along with the height to keep the ratio

9483087
width	height
the ratios of the x frustrum and y frustrum should be equal to the ratios of the width and height of the screen.

9483094
free	malloc
on a number of processors you are free to re-write malloc or create your own and have the stack grow up some instruction sets can arbitrarily go either way some cannot without extra effort and the heap down

udp	tcp
which protocol performs better in terms of throughput - udp or tcp - really depends on the network characteristics and the network traffic

9483266
udp	tcp
now consider a scenario in which the network is congested and has both tcp and udp traffic

9483266
udp	tcp
gradually tcp senders would reduce their sending rates to bare minimum and if udp senders have enough data to be sent over the network they would hog up the majority of bandwidth available

9483266
udp	tcp
in fact this is an active research topic - how to improve tcp throughput in presence of udp traffic

9483266
udp	tcp
that way even though each tcp connection s throughput might be limited the sum total of the throughput of all tcp connections may be greater than the throughput for an application using udp

width	height
i couldn t pinpoint what was creating the problem but the override is to add height and width to the span element that contains the image

9483945
width	height
the problem is that although gltexsubimage2d accepts an offset width and height as parameters they re only used when painting to the texture while i still need my buffer data to be linearly layed

filtering	grouping
since i m needing to filtering by categories from 3 different category grouping i do 3 left joins

9484062
put	get
in other ftps i could do it using lcd get put etc but these commands are not working here

9484069
post	get
as i can see the problem is that your delete request goes as get but as per the rest conversions it should be a post request

9484095
pull	push
you need either to update client before pushing git pull for example or use forced push git push --force but that case commits can be lost on the remote side and trigger non-fast-forward messages on other clients

9484117
for-loop	arrays
i am not sure how this is possible but i have a for-loop not incrementing properly through an arrays

9484133
freemarker	velocity
you can use freemarker or velocity for templating in java -- or even just add php tags to a sample xml to generate from a template

so a div that is 100 height and 100 width of the browser window

9484236
width	height
within this div i have an image that fits 100 of its parents width and height

9484294
hide	show
i would hide the default textbox border and place it on top of an image containing the border image you want and show the image when the textbox is selected

9484296
post	get
i ve done such things fairly easily in python where i could basically map a procedure its name was the suffix or the url and parameters the arguments of a get or post method indifferently

9484297
jboss	glassfish
glassfish 3 and jboss 7 are neck and neck now with their implementation either would be a good choice though jboss is my personal preference

burn	uninstaller
then use burn is a bootstrapper to handle chaining these together and uninstaller them together

9484315
put	get
it would be nice to let owner imply get and put since those are both valid actions

9484354
post	get
through my testing it seems that servicestack is automatically url decoding any parameters sent through the query string of a get request but does not automatically decode params sent via a post request

9484360
ready	each
when each iteration is done the inc functions advances the pointer on to the next item ready for the next iteration

9484369
width	height
when you set the width height of the movieclip object flash internally also adjusts the scalex and scaley properties

9484369
width	height
the way to remedy this as suggested by another poster is to avoid setting width height on the blank object or alternatively to reset scalex and scaley to 1 after your drawing is done

9484420
ocaml	prolog	lisp	prolog
of course the student argument also works against languages like lisp and ocaml or prolog

cpu	hyperthreading
saturating your cpu network or disk i o with multiple threads of execution won t make things faster and usually hurts performance especially on hyperthreading intel cpus

9484600
getter	setter
the basic idea to correct this is to let nhibernate put the base class object into the graph and then you deal with the casting note that this setup would use some slightly different mappings - ive done this to simplify the code but it can obviously be done by keeping the properties as full getter setter

9484666
google-chrome	safari
on ios safari the iframe is cut can t be entirely seen while on desktop google-chrome the iframe is not cut

9484834
width	height
you cannot scale to window height and width at every time and keep an ratio of 16 9 that is mathematical not possible

9484834
width	height
if you want to keep a ratio of 16 9 constant you can take the window width or the height and then scale the opposite site to the right value to keep your ratio

9484834
width	height
your window get resized to 800px width and 600px height and you want to keep the width of the window in full then you must scale the height of your box to 450px to keep a ratio of 16 9

integer	fractions
but the hibernate validator docs seem to indicate that it verifies if the number is using the expected amount of integer and fractions digits

pull	push
it allows you to stream reading though i would suggest a pull parser rather than a push one but that s not going to allow you to insert data into the file

9485010
dlsym	dlopen
their source is easily obtainable so you could probably taloir them down into simpler tools for the task at hand or directly import their code base not that you really need to you could just load the binary with in question with dlopen and use dlsym to check if the symbol is there

9485092
fgets	getchar
java is able to read in the entire string a but the c++ functions like fgets sscanf getchar ... and their equivalent family of functions all fail to detect this space rather than ignoring it so instead i m returned a zero-length string

isnull	nullif
you can also see that i m using isnull and nullif here to replace 0 with a custom text

scaledown is a percentage of the original size you want to scale down to on mousedown and scale up is a percentage of the original size you want to scale up to on mouseup

9485123
apache	nginx
even using nginx under the hoods you can still choose apache or nginx to maintain your webservers domains using sockets

9485138
post	get
if you still get conflicts then i would post the output here

9485158
spaces	linefeed
fgets really should work it s not documented as eating white spaces it even includes the linefeed in the returned string

9485177
mouseover	mouseenter
i am assuming you are adding a css class that handles the transition either on page load or on some type of event mouseover click mouseenter etc

9485196
calendarextender	detailsview
i have a detailsview with a date field that i d like to use the calendarextender on when a user edits

9485245
width	height
note this doesn t make the iframe 1600 pixels wide it simply makes it the full width and makes the height to the width multiplied by 9 16 ie maintains a 16 9 aspect ratio

9485303
portrait	landscape
when a child view controller is embedded that only supports the portrait orientation and the device is currently in landscape orientation i want to force a rotation to portrait

9485303
portrait	landscape
it actually works the opposite way so that if the child view controller is embedded and the device is in portrait orientation i can rotate to landscape but the view controller will remain portrait then dismiss the embedded view controller and it will automatically rotate to landscape

9485370
width	height
the problem was solved by adding a 1x1 transparent 100 width x 100 height png onto the divs

9485373
portrait	landscape
two views with content one landscape one portrait

9485397
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
results between opera and google-chrome are identical results on firefox and ie are also identical so there is definately something very special that does work on browsers in the first group and does not work in the browsers from the second group

9485397
opera	firefox
i already checked that output from the json on firefox and opera is the same using this tool so it is not a problem with an actual json feed

9485398
printf	strtod
one sticky issue that i haven t yet touched on is the decimal separator in relation to functions like printf and strtod

9485432
width	height
every post has an image and all images would be identical in width but would vary in height

9485495
google-chrome	firefox
this solution works cross browsers google-chrome firefox ie all versions mobile etc. and cross domain

9485502
capistrano	rvm
i m running rails 3.1.3 ruby 1.9.2-p290 capistrano 2.1.12 apache 2.2 rvm 1.10.2 and whichever version of passenger would have been installed by the install script about a month ago

i want to be able to toggle the bold on off for a uilabel all previous questions in this area use uifont boldsystemfontofsize

9485641
free	malloc
i have a programming project with highly intensive use of malloc free functions

9485641
free	malloc
by this way malloc and free are heavily used called thousands of times per second

9485691
int	double
there s also a slight complication with maps of primitive types - you ll need to arrange for the java side to use double int instead of double int autoboxing i believe is the term unless you decided to wrap pairs already in which case you could make a pair with primitive members

9485840
salt	md5
the user is moe and the password is howard so we use md5 moehowardblah or md5 username + password + salt

9485841
boost	allocator
if you only have three different then you would greatly gain by using a pool allocator either custom made or something like boost pool but for c

9485863
free	malloc
when programming in windows i find calling malloc free is like death for performance -- almost any in-app memory allocation that amortizes memory allocations by batching will save you gobs of processor time when allocating freeing so it may not be so important which approach you use as long as you re not calling the default allocator

9485892
width	margin
whatever you are trying to center using the margin technique needs to have a width defined

9485892
width	margin
try setting a width for the wrapper or simply apply the margin 0 px to #ob

9485918
dictionary	map
in the question you don t define banana and apple anyway i would use a map or a dictionary to store key value pairs with the key being the string object you want to count and the value being the counter of the object occurences in your array

9485962
splinter	selenium
a splinter doesn t use selenium and doesn t have an ie driver

9486012
post	get
gstreamer has bindings for python and this interesting post will help you get started

9486014
width	height
it surprised me just how difficult it was to search around for a clear-cut way to validate image width height with carrierwave

9486014
width	height
i didn t want to have to store width height in the database so in my model i said

9486014
width	height
so now i have the width height of my image stored in the model object

9486081
distance	pdist
now using pdist i have tried to calculate the euclidian distance between each point using and but both just return an empty matrix

9486092
websphere	ibm
i have a simple jpa project running with ibm rad 7.5 on websphere 7

9486099
free	malloc
i recently implemented my own userspace slab allocator and it proved to be much more efficient speedwise and memory-wise than malloc free for a large amount of fixed-size allocations

9486172
installation	upgrade
instead of going into each installation and manually upgrading it i would like a way to upgrade each installation at the same time

9486211
mouseleave	mouseenter
if so instead of hover use mouseenter and mouseleave

9486218
screens	tablet
one approach that comes to mind as potentially viable would be to overlay another touch screens on top of the tablet

9486236
google-chrome	firefox
needless to say this doesn t happen in google-chrome or firefox

9486292
bazaar	perforce	bazaar	git
so far i ve looked at the usual suspects git mercurial and potentially bazaar as i have good experience with it but our main hurdle currently is to get the version history out of perforce and imported into the various dvcss so we don t lose the history

9486292
perforce	svn
i then had this brilliant brain fart of importing the perforce repo into svn with all the branches mapped to appropriate svn branches as every version control system under the sun can import from svn

9486312
aggregate-functions	sum
here i am using sum choose any aggregate-functions of your liking

9486357
width	height
i can do a server control extending image that would query the image size using gdi+ and assign those values to its own width and height properties

9486357
width	height
i would like to cache the height and width values across all pages for each image

9486368
textview	imageview
i m populating a listview which contains an imageview and a textview

9486383
put	get
so the configurationmanager will get the values that you put in the app.config and you don t need to mock anything

9486406
inherited	properties
that is a static properties and moq is designed to moq instance methods or classes that can be mocked via inherited

9486470
button	checkbox
i have built a function using jquery to insert into a table a new row including some inputs like textboxes checkbox and one button

9486482
mouseup	mousedown
for instance some controls respond to a mousedown followed by a mouseup but not to a click

9486496
filtering	grouping
i tried making the linq grouping by syntax work but it kept putting the filtering as a where not a having clause

9486503
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
i m having some problems getting this to look good in ie firefox opera google-chrome and safari

9486503
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
opera and firefox are the same but ie google-chrome and safari has a bit different look

9486530
inherited	properties
i suspect this is the problem and then the browsers are not letting the table inherited the font properties due to the invalid structure and thus are defaulting to the browser settings

9486532
rss	feed
i m building a rss reader and i got a singular problem when i do a feed request it just returns me 10 elements even if there are lots more to download

9486541
post	get
get and post are two different methods to send data get is in the url path a b c while post is hidden in the html headers

9486541
google-chrome	firefox
and in your browser use google-chrome or firefox + firebug and press f12

9486588
rss	feed
i get only 10 items from the rss feed you show no matter what i specify in limit

9486607
implements	extends
public class imageadapter extends baseadapter implements listadapter

9486650
division	modulo
this way you do not need division so you can take the remainder of the sum and of intermediate results modulo any number you want

9486664
getter	setter
dave newton is right but also note that jython exposes java setter and getter as properties so self.size 350 300 works as well and is a little prettier to the eyes of a python developer

9486704
mouseevent	mouselistener
i suppose you can register your own mouselistener or mouseadapter and check the click count getclickcount of the mouseevent

9486738
width	height
i m attempting to create a video element as a string set the height and width from variables also strings and i m finding that ie9 is dropping the from the dimension values

9486740
button	checkbox	checkbox	dropdownlistfor
manually check values passed from dropdownlistfor radio button checkbox etc are valid for the user session for the current page and state and don t rely on the asp.net event architecture to validate user input

9486763
jobs	cron
i am little confused because on server side we use cron jobs to execute the scripts but this push.php should never exit so i am confused here what to do

9486780
maven	pom.xml
in the second project s pom.xml file specify the first projects maven co-ordinates groupid artifactid version packaging under the dependency section

9486806
width	height
width and height are not how you should be styling an element for size

9486866
pylons	pyramid
pylons one of the two frameworks that joined together to be pyramid the other was repoze.bfg was close to an mvc system

9486866
pylons	pyramid
pyramid and pylons both have a dispatcher functionality to set up the mapping for a request

9486866
pull	push
under pyramid it s a little different -- the default scaffolds have the routing in app init .py but you re free to break it out into app routes.py or use config.include to push it into you handlers or config.scan to pull it from your views

9486933
post	put
i wanted to post this as an answer but this is not really based on polymorphism or overloading so decided to put as an edit instead

9487011
jar	war
i have generated the jar file correctly project.artifactid - project.version .jar but when i check the jar file in .m2 folder it has same structure as war file

9487033
subnet	packets
which is basically what bonjour mdns does but less general to send a broadcast udp packets open a udp datagram socket and send a packets to the local subnet s broadcast ip

9487044
hide	show
the possibility to hide show the window without destroying the instance

9487060
google-chrome	firefox
of course somethings work only in firefox and google-chrome and ie decides it hates everyone and doesn t work with the solutions that work for other browsers

9487077
pull	push
this is because i recently encountered a connection problem in which i couldn t push or pull from my git

9487095
pbkdf2	salt	scrypt	pbkdf2	scrypt	salt
they discuss hashing salt pbkdf2 bcrypt scrypt and a few other things

9487095
hash	salt
in short answer to you question a salt is a safeguard that makes it take a long time to recover a password in the event of compromise just as a hash is

9487129
setinterval	settimeout
you can use setinterval or settimeout to call a function which would replace the source of an image with another

9487129
setinterval	settimeout
you would then use the css background-position again within a setinterval or settimeout function to change the position of the image

9487143
profiling	debugging
perl regexes also offer substantial improvements in debugging and profiling

9487144
post	get
sending post get requisitions into a servlet and i didn t got any sucess on that either

9487231
tinyint	varchar
all the information is exactly the same so you should use a single table with an additional column call it whatever you want and make it a tinyint 0 or 1 if there are only two possible values or perhaps varchar if there could be more values in the future

9487242
post	get
my idea is after i create a post i d like to get it s tags

9487264
profiling	debugging
and it doesn t even bother xdebug - profiling and debugging still works like a charm

9487289
centos	linux
i m fairly new to linux and i m trying to install chiliproject on a centos 5.5

9487337
width	height
consider i have a qml rectangle of width w and height h colored all black

9487337
width	height
i also have an image of black color having same width and height

9487339
acs	adfs
if your applications live in an ad domain for example adfs 2.0 would be an ideal choice because of it s close integration with ad and acs and it s powerful claims transformation capabilities

9487347
width	height
i learned that i should not size the canvas inside css and should instead define explicit pixel width and height

9487347
width	height
i ve been trying to set everything up so that everything resizes on the fly when the browser is resized so i basically have a 5x5 table with rows 1 3 and 5 as a height of 5px and columns 1 3 and five with a width of 5px

9487347
width	height
i don t specify a width or height but i ve tried it with 100 as well

9487347
width	height
afterward i read the width and height of one of the table cells and set the size of each canvas according to that

9487347
width	height
the second problem is that because each canvas has it s width and height defined all other components on screen resize automatically with a change in windows size but the canvas elements remain fixed

9487347
hide	show
ideally since a resize while they re visible is kind of slow i would like to hide or remove the elements when the resize begins and rebuild and show them when resize is complete

9487371
width	height
what i d like to be able to do though is have the scrolling limited to a specific div that has a height of 450 width of 910 and overflow-y scroll set

9487394
put	get
it can upload it just fine put i cannot seem to get it to replace the data it returns an error i cannot find reference to

9487488
versioning	upgrade
if your rubygems versioning is 0.8.5 or later you can upgrade to the latest versioning with

9487510
multicastdelegate	delegation
all delegation even those with only a single object method pair are stored as a type derived from multicastdelegate

9487510
multicastdelegate	delegation
most objects will take the passed-in delegation and add it to a multicastdelegate which the object will then invoke when the circumstance arrives invoking the multicastdelegate will invoke all its members but objects are free to implement the event add and remove accessors however they see fit

9487510
subtraction	addition	subtraction	add	multicastdelegate	delegation	subtract	addition	subtract	add
one should avoid passing a multicastdelegate produced via delegate.combine to an event add handler if there is any possibility that any of the constituent delegation or other delegation equivalent to them may also be passed because many event implementations use multicastdelegate addition and subtraction and thus suffer from weird subtract semantics

9487538
hex	binary
encode it as either base64 or as hex before saving or save it in a binary field

9487562
hide	show
i would then like to close the popup and fire off some jquery hide show events without refreshing the page

9487583
ant	maven
clean your builds if using ant or maven â clean your builds

9487589
children	parent
then test tweak anything that needs tweaking delete children links in parent poms for example

9487657
width	height	int	double
i am surprised to see that getters of height and width members has return type double albeit they are int

9487666
ubuntu	linux
on ubuntu linux 10.04

9487668
udp	tcp
typically this kind of thing would be dealt with in streams where you have a stream of tcp or a stream of udp

9487668
udp	tcp
this page appears to illustrate the ip header and that 6 would be the protocol number for tcp with 17 being udp

9487696
width	height	int	double
the class is storing height and width as int it just provides a method that accept double too so you can call it with double values but they are immediately cast to int

9487781
bash	zsh
in bin bash shell the command works fine however in bin zsh it does not

9487814
ant	maven
visual studio lets you do that with the push of a button where with spring you can use ant maven to generate your proxies adapters

9487830
pull	push
i m looking to pull down the lucene.net trunk as a fourth project within my solution so that i can get some of their fixes sooner than when they push those changes to nuget.org

9487832
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox it looks like this as expected

9487848
prepare	execute
i can t see any concurrency in your code if you want a better performance set batch size on your prepare statement and execute statements once a while for example after 20 records

9487863
children	parent
the children know to raise a signal to the parent via kill and they have his pid sent to them as an argument and actually the father also has the children pid stored in the shared memory here is some code -

9487873
mouseover	mouseout
it s designed to only trigger when the cursor enters the region of an element not for instance when you mouseover a sub element and then mouseout of that sub element

9487911
int	double
being limited to int fields only a subset of double s can be represented

9487949
setinterval	settimeout
to delay javascript execution you can use settimeout or setinterval

9487961
pop-up	dialog
if you still need to know how do pop-up a modal dialog it can be done in ie using

9487984
hide	show
i have 2 divs which i show or hide depending on a button click event

9488038
aggregate-functions	sum
once we have a group we can use aggregate-functions on each group and in this case we use sum to count the number of helmets that are safe

9488073
google-chrome	firefox
this is a version of watir that uses webdriver to drive the browsers and offers cross browser support including latest versions of ie firefox and google-chrome

9488098
getter	setter
that means i can not change way of field is accessed add getter and setter

9488112
portrait	landscape
however i want to somehow include a custom parameter that allows me specify whether the test is to be run in portrait mode or landscape mode

9488157
hide	show
seems like jquery and do not modify the dom to hide show the element and hence do not fire domsubtreemodified event

9488258
hide	show
check this fiddle - the value of radio group stays the same after hide show

9488446
pop-up	dialog
pop-up dialog are typically modal forms that require user-intervention before being allowing the user to refocus on the calling window

9488447
pop-up	dialog
pop-up refers to a window or dialog box that is presented or called by another program or window

9488503
pop-up	dialog
the feed dialog has a display property which i set to pop-up

9488511
width	height
window.open url select width 600 height 600 status 0 resizable 1 scrollbars 1 toolbar 0 location 1

9488511
button	checkbox
so what this is actually doing is user click on a button under page1 a new windows opens with page2 page2 contains checkbox for user to select once the user has made the selection on page2 the selection id is passed via javascript back to page1 chanageteam function where that function should populate a hidden label label4 and then based on that population of the label ajax panel should trigger and update a grid with the id selected

9488512
post	get
i answered my own question again part2 about making the buttons and options have a current class i believe they were both related enough to be in one question because they both were about how to get the var values in the url to use them within the same overall function - but this was my first post in this site - so maybe i misunderstood

9488516
google-chrome	firefox
it shows up in firefox and ie but not in google-chrome

9488546
sorting	filtering
we have a lot of data to display and we do so via grids which all have a standard set of paging sorting and filtering features

9488546
sorting	filtering
filtering can come in the form of comparisons is null or lists in and sorting is simply a single column with a direction

9488546
sorting	filtering
since we are talking about potentially tens of thousands of records and we need pagination pulling things back to the server and doing java-based filtering sorting isn t really an option

9488554
google-chrome	safari
this works fine in ie9 and ff10 but in the webkit browsers google-chrome and safari specifically the event is called but the ajax request is never completed

9488568
versioning	upgrade
but after i upgrade node and npm to the latest versioning and mongo to 2.0.2 then if i put express.session store new mongostore then it will run a infinite loop

9488593
versioning	upgrade
you should upgrade to a much much newer versioning and almost certainly all your problems will go away

hash	md5
generate an md5 hash for each file and compare them then pass or fail accordingly

9488638
installation	upgrade
the manual steps for a wordpress installation upgrade found here are pretty clear

9488686
pull	push
you have to pull updates merging them with your changes possibly resolving conflicts before you can push your changes to the remote if it has diverged someone else has pushed from the last time you pulled

9488686
pull	push
this is not unique to git every vcs requires you to pull changes deal with merging and conflicts before you can push to the central remote repository

9488711
width	height
basically they are calling the data-source tag located on the canvas which returns some json that represents the amount of work participation watches or whatever metric they are calculating and then they go through each returned value and call this.canvas.fillrect with the predefined width screensize.width 52 - paddingleft + paddingright and the height from the json returned

9488778
userprincipal	directoryentry
the userprincipal class doesn t appear to expose any members that would allow you to determine if a user is and or has a manager but you can still do it by obtaining the directoryentry for the user

9488785
metaclass	abc	metaclass	isinstance	abc	isinstance
also isinstance is compatible with abc metaclass so you could be more straight and clear in your choises

9488837
hash	md5
if there an equivalent key in each hash check to see if the md5 checksums agree

9488866
jar	war
i understood you are not sure about deploying your entire application including its dependencies in a war file versus deploying your application as a war plus a jar containing some of your dependencies

9488889
width	height
but when i try to run this i get the following error non-positive width or height in function cvcreatematheader in opencv

9488926
subtraction	addition
when i try it with just addition subtraction operators it works perfectly

9488940
wordpress	joomla
but i found this plugin which works for wordpress and joomla by asking google which most probably is the answer to your question xcloner

9488940
jobs	cron
otherwise i suggest you move to a lamp stack hosting environment where you can at least have cron jobs setup to backup your databse and files regularly

9488960
division	multiplication
it s quite likely your multiplication is overflowing for some characters meaning your division will never be able to recover the original

9488964
hide	show
i am trying to show and hide div sections based on click events off the area tags which have matching ending id s coded like this

9488964
hide	show
so to show the exact match but hide all the div sections which have id s that start with div_ but don t otherwise match without hiding every other div on the page i tried this

9488975
google-chrome	firefox
it works perfectly for firefox google-chrome and ie9

google-chrome	firefox
when you navigate trough the website sections you ll get a nasty flicker on firefox and ie i don t have this issue on google-chrome anymore but i did have it until i changed the swf object background from opaque to transparent

9489003
google-chrome	firefox
edit#2 even though using the swfobject fixed the issue on firefox i noticed i could see once in a while the flickering on google-chrome not always but still there so to fix this i detect the users browser and serve the swf object script if they are using firefox else do nothing and everything is perfect

9489012
jwindow	jdialog

9489258
multiplying	add
in your encryption step you add first then you multiplying

9489276
ant	maven
this affects all self-installed tools ant java etc. and results in little side-effects like the version field under jenkins configuration - maven - install from apache being a text field instead of a drop-down

9489280
folder	directory
after that the virtual directory behaves as a root so i can put the bin folder here and everything works fine now

9489306
children	parent
you experience this problem when you end up iterating a set of parent entities and trigger lazy loads on every child entity thus resulting in n+1 calls to the database to load a set of entities 1 and their children n

9489693

i chose to name my ofstream operator fout because while this is not always good to do this way you can quickly change all of your cout s to fout s or replicate them

i looked into the code that sets up the layout and the margin on the left side is calculated from the width of the labels so joran s idea is probably the only thing that will work based on the printing using split unless one were to rewrite the plot.trellis command

9489976
put	get
or you can work with the bytebuffer directly using get put as appropriate to read write data

9489980

9489988

9490344
nginx	lighttpd	apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd
another option you might find useful is installing a lightweight web server proxy like nginx lighttpd or varnish i personally prefer the first one and serve compressed static content with that leaving heavier apache processes only to handle the dynamic content

width	height
my web application is using some of the css3 transformations and i was wondering the best way to do these based on the window s width and height

9490395
width	height
however one of my transformations is hardcoded to move the element x pixels which i want to make dynamic based off the window s height and width

9490399
iboutlet	ibaction
the iboutlet is not needed as much as the ibaction

9490445

the driver however needs to be upgrade to a versioning that supports the latest cuda in use

in case of jquery the show and hide function do the magic for you

9490592
int	chars
the memory for intermediate a is being reused my bounding calculations makes the assumption that c+d+e+b initial + a + b which is true by virtue of the fact that a b are 1-byte chars of the same dimensions while c d e are int and such i only need to ensure there s enough space for b + c + d + e

9490973

if your directory is full and the program is trying to write to your tmp directory try renaming the tmp directory to something like tmp_old then create a symbolic link to your new tmp folder like ln -s mnt tmp tmp

9491025
gif	png
but a png image will not work so use a gif

9491025
gif	png
if you process a gif with smush.it to losslessly remove overhead you might get a file size smaller than the corresponding png

9491035
margin	font-size
since the browser-supplied font-size of h1 is 32 pixels the resultant margin is 32 pixels

9491042
margin	font-size
so when using it with margins it will be equivalent to the font-size of the element you re applying the margin too

9491071
width	height
use the autoresize and set flexible width and or height

9491125
icmp	tcp
tcp packets are handled differently than icmp packets so being able to ping does not necessarily imply the ability to route any random tcp stream

9491141
submit	submission
hitting the enter key triggers the default form submission is behavior as expected even when other non-default values are present and precede the default submit button in the dom

9491141
mouse	keyboard
bonus for mouse keyboard interaction with explicit user inputs while avoiding javascript handlers

9491222
textview	imageview
i would recommend that instead of using a separate imageview for your textview s background you actually set it as the background

9491223
ddms	adb
the tools emulator adb ddms in eclipse use these settings to pick up stuff from android_target_out instead of getting them from the prebuilt copies inside the sdk

9491294
pull	push
xxlib in my workspace has two remotes origin and mygitserver that i use to pull origin and push mygitserver

lisp	smalltalk
i m coming to javascript from a background in python and smalltalk and i appreciate the linage of self and lisp in the language

avasset	avurlasset
you must use the concrete subclass avurlasset to instantiate an avasset for ios 4.0 and 4.3 using its class method

9491310
folder	directory
in eclipse it will be your project folder unless you set it to something different in your launch configuration in webapps it will be the webapp s root directory in a command line app it could be anything

9491317
int	double
other valid types are for an object nsstring nsdictionary nsarray etc. f for double u for unsigned int etc

9491342
draggable	droppable
i m trying to use jquery draggable and droppable to compare results of a search

9491342

9491344
textmate	sublimetext
i am trying to create a tmsnippet for textmate sublimetext

9491354
hide	show
it may be convenient to use the button s selected state to indicate whether to show or hide a card then you can use the enabled state to indicate that a pair has been matched and is out of play

9491374
multiplying	add
i googled around for some time now and have found ample examples how to add multiplying divide etc with the use of registers but as i am not the slightest familiar with sse mmx etc

width	height
i have an image of width x height 1 x 44 that i want to transform on the x horizontal for the purpose of generating a background for my nav bar

9491401
draggable	droppable
to make it so you can only place a single draggable in a droppable element you can disable each droppable element as something is dropped into it

9491401
width	height
to only change the height width of the cloned draggable helper you can target it with

9491406
public	protected
that s simple all non-static data members must all be public private or protected

9491431
put	get
also your links need to perform a put instead of a get which is the default action for a link

9491445
versioning	upgrade
i used setup.exe to upgrade perl to versioning 5.14.1-2 which works fine

9491463
getter	setter
i have a class that will validate a selection and a class that has my setter and getter and a class that the professor coded with the io for the program it s an addres book

9491463
int	boolean
if you look at my if statement i get a red line that tells me i cannot convert an int to boolean

9491467
post	get
that will replace the content s of the form s container with the response that you get out of your post call

9491475
int	boolean
the reason you get cannot convert an int to boolean is that java expects a boolean in the if ... construct - but menunumber is an int

9491482
int	boolean
i get a red line that tells me i cannot convert an int to boolean

9491488
listview	gridview	gridview	repeater
gridview listview repeater or another templated control will probably be your best bet

9491525
maven	pom.xml
your maven pom.xml files should be the source of truth for your project configuration

9491525
maven	pom.xml
minimise intellij-specific configuration you do in the project settings- some of it will be liable to get wiped the next time settings are re-imported from the maven pom.xml - and try to avoid committing intellij project files into source-control

9491552
navigationcontroller	modalviewcontroller
i ve also tried topviewcontroller and modalviewcontroller properties on navigationcontroller

9491568
hash	hmac
you need to use a hmac instead of a plain hash

9491584
int	double
the compiler is going to call foo int x because it looks for the better function member rules which look at amongst other things what conversions are involved in going from each argument to the corresponding parameter type int for the first method double for the second

9491587
rtp	rtsp
a number of open source clients for rtsp rtp exist such as mplayer xine gstreamer vlc etc

9491587
rtp	rtsp
-- all of them have client code for rtsp rtp within them

9491632
google-chrome	firefox
i have a problem with my frame with google-chrome that working in firefox and ie google-chrome ignore my frame and open the link in a new tab

furthermore you re using cout and cin which are both defined in the namespace std

9491667
put	get
i don t get the in the immediate window and if i put it before the command i get

9491743
behat	mink
so far there are no customizations in featurecontext except that it extends behat mink behat context minkcontext

9491754
inherited	properties
ideally i would like for the webform to have access to those inherited properties however when i change my webform s code-behind class from system.web.ui.page to nestedmasterpage1 i m getting an rte saying that i need to extend class system.web.ui.page

9491771
stdio	fflush
for output to a terminal the c stdio system has a feature that it fflush the buffers whenever it sees a newline n

9491771
stdio	fflush
but when output is to a file to increase speed the stdio system does not fflush the buffer

9491798
fflush	gets
i don t think this kind of behavior is mandated by any standard edit actually this is mandated by c99 see jonathan s comment and in the second example even with buffering enabled the library may decide to do a fflush anyway if the buffer gets filled by your printf

9491805
put	get
first you must note that you cannot put a jalali date in a datetime object you will get an exception in dates like 1392 02 31

9491810
uilabel	uibutton
i have a uiview in which inside of that i have a uiimageview and a uilabel and a uibutton

9491845

however when i try to post info to their fb account i get this error

9491862
getter	setter
the response object has a private throwable with its getter and setter

9491877
for-loop	arrays
what i want to do is parse this so i can make an arrays out of it then do a for-loop with that arrays

9491950
google-chrome	firefox
some set up information we re using jquery for ajax and other things but ajax relates to this question node w express for the server and google-chrome 17 firefox 10 for testing we don t need compatibility with ie

9491950
post	get
i have the app.enable jsonp callback set up on the server which works wonderfully for our get routes however it doesn t seem to work so well for our post routes this is all in house right now but better alternatives are welcome as suggestions

9491950
google-chrome	firefox
the request works fine and succeeds in google-chrome however fails in firefox

9491970
getter	setter
my guess is that the signatures for the getter and or setter methods do not precisely match the name and type of the private field

9492023
subtraction	addition
for example with a 32 bit word size and say an input of 6 bits i d be interested in checking bits 19 and 3 for addition carries and bits 31 and 15 for subtraction more generally the interesting bits are word size - 1 word size 2 + input bits 2 word size 2 - 1 and input bits 2

9492029
google-chrome	firefox
i m having a small problem with x-browser compatibility google-chrome and firefox for a textarea and margins

9492029
google-chrome	firefox
the textarea under message as you can see is different in firefox than in google-chrome

9492029
google-chrome	firefox
you can see if you look at the bottom and right hand edges of both google-chrome lines up perfectly but firefox seems further in both directions and i cannot work out why either in firebug or google-chrome dev tools

9492029
webkit	gecko
it seems to be a webkit vs gecko problem as espresso shows the same as chrome

9492054
multiplying	add
read a character multiplying variable by 10 and add new digit

9492084
touchesbegan	touchesended
another thing is that i am implementing touchesbegan touchesended methods on my uiview class

9492090
post	get
the widget handles the rendering of the html and the extraction of data from a get post dictionary that corresponds to the widget

9492117
punctuation	words
this works fine except when a words contains some form of punctuation such as jack s and merry-go-round

9492130
getter	setter
it seems that during reflection it finds a getter for a serializable but not a long and it does not find a setter for the serializable

9492140
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this works in firefox google-chrome opera ie9+

9492143
width	height
this fixes the math to scale to the max size in both width and height rather than just one depending on the width and height of the original

9492144
nsdata	nsfilewrapper
but apple s document-based apps programming guide for ios regarding custom formats instead of nsdata or nsfilewrapper states keep in mind that your code will have to duplicate what uidocument does for you and so you must deal with greater complexity and a greater possibility of error

9492144
getter	setter
per document defaults are declared as properties the setter modifies the nsdictionary that maps the plist and marks the document as updated and the getter accesses the dictionary with the proper key

9492170
min	max
i derive min max value in the widget_info.xml from these values

9492178
getter	setter
i don t care much for this design - i don t like interfaces merely for getter and setter

9492192
google-chrome	firefox
the button responds to clicks only in ie but not in firefox google-chrome

9492238
hash	salt
while you use a good encryption unless you re adding a salt to the password it is likely easily looked up in a pre-computed hash table rainbow table and you can probably find it online within a matter of seconds

9492256
webkit	gecko
gecko and webkit support the style pointer-events none

9492310
serializable	deserialization
ignoring custom serializable methods that you can write for your own classes to precisely control the serializable and deserialization behavior yes the system will effectively traverse the object graph in order to generate a stream of bytes

9492358
children	parent
you are removing the parent element before the children have faded out

9492415
hide	show
how can i possibly alter this code to show hide this link depending on whether or not the user has casted a vote

9492416
pbkdf2	hash
first is i saw lots of pbkdf2 online using hash like hmac-sha256

9492441
dictionary	map
i have a dictionary with integer keys and the value for each key is a map with integer keys and set of integers as value

9492479
google-chrome	firefox
if you want to just watch javasript i suggest firebug plugin in firefox or google-chrome developer tool bug f12 or ie developer tool bar f12

9492502
client-side	server-side
the issue was with how the server-side code provided the client-side code javascript with the json string

9492516
hash	hmac
hmac uses a hash function internally

9492516
hash	hmac
hmac-sha256 means hmac using the sha256 hash function

9492516
hash	salt	hash	hmac
you still have a salt and the hash function is invoked twice see any reference on hmac but it is nevertheless a lot faster to check lots of passwords

9492542
width	height
my approach is to have a parent div viewport of fixed width height and overflow hidden then to slide its child div slides which has the actual contents in its child divs to the left or the right

9492557
html5lib	elementtree
i ve tried also html5lib with elementtree but that doesn t even seem to run parsing that would comply with documentation

9492615
cstring	bstr
compare the vt_bstr case it maps bstr to cstring

9492682
inherited	properties
since grid is a panel it inherited the panel.zindex attached properties

9492717
put	get
once version 1.3 is released you should be able to put the following in the reporting section of your pom.xml file to get the full range of output formats

9492779
for-loop	arrays
each arrays within the 5 index will need to be as many indexes as follows 10 100 1000 10000 but i dont know how to fill an arrays like this inside of my for-loop that is typically used with an arrays without it running into infinity because where i have

9492833
post	get
until now i have always just used post and get on my controller actions

9492833
post	get
i d like to use all of the major verbs in my app in order to a adhere to standards for rest and b well not use get and post exclusively

9492884
children	parent
so i want to be able to click a button within the element and create another but because the rowspan already equals 2 i need another element to appear at the end of the table cause it needs to count the current parent element as 1 in the list of children of the element and the next element after that should be counted as 2 so it needs to add in a element at the end cause there are 2 rowspans in

9492884
children	parent
so basically i need to capture all children elements starting with the parent element and increment down the element list within the and count them with the rowspan if or rowspan does not exist than it should create another element directly after the parent element of the element.

9492919
textarea	textbox
the first one is a textbox and the second one is a textarea

9492919
google-chrome	firefox
when i load up the page on google-chrome and firefox the accordion control appears as expected

9492936
soaplib	suds
python soap using soaplib server and suds client

9492978
width	height
we declare 3 variables width height and stride width

free	malloc
ideally malloc calls and free calls should appear on the same design level inside the same implementation file for the same module for example and they should match perfectly one free for each malloc

what i d like to do is protect the images so that a user can t go to the root images in this case and see a directory listing of all of the files in the folder

9506081
packets	multicast
the very same device is also a listener on the same multicast address so he can discover other androids as they send a packets

9506134
post	get
if needed perform a get first collect the cookies and then do the post

9506162
bmp	png
list of single images jpg png bmp jpeg-2000

9506162
icns	ico
the only difference between an ico and icns is that one is a single image while the other one is multiple-images in one file

9506162
writetofile	nsdata
when you get the nsdata object do as you want with it such as writetofile writetourl or heck create another nsimage if you want

9506189
for-loop	arrays
is there anyway to use a for-loop to change to #name so that i don t have to write out a line of code to set each arrays element

9506208
subobject	instances
if you want folder semantics with btree storage semantics look at products.btreefolder2 and add-on that implements the folder interfaces but stores subobject in a oobtree instead of as attributes directly on the instances

9506210
onkeyup	onkeydown
when i touch screen and then press a button onkeyup and onkeydown methods aren t called

9506274
children	parent
but your sql implies that authentication is the parent here with zero-or-more authorization children not the other way around which would be more like

9506279
client-side	server-side
regarding the project you described as you know php is server-side and jquery is client-side

9506281
debian	linux
primarily linux debian but also mac osx.

9506336
firefox	safari
1 the footer s vertical bars | disappeared between the links in both firefox and safari

9506371
srp	principles
apply the single responsibility principles srp and make two classes for two represented concerns

9506387

currently i have a custom list adapter that has some logic that hide show a certain imageview in a row depending on a variable

9506389
vsto	add-in
i m trying to upgrade an excel vba workbook to a vsto excel add-in in vb.net using vs 2010

9506389
vsto	add-in
the problem is that in the new vsto add-in i can not get the windows form to mimic this same behavior

9506460
width	height	actualheight	actualwidth
immediately before writeablebitmap creation in rendertobitmap the width height of the element is 7 7 the desired size is 7 7 but the actualwidth actualheight is 0 0

9506470
put	get
the point is that someone somewhere will get around any measures you put in place but if the math holds 96 of your users will just give in and pay you for full access when faced with a shift-ciphered registry key and obfuscated program code

9506487
move	drag
so far i can record every movement and touch events however when using drag and drop the drag shadow overrides regular move event

9506510
g++	gcc
compile using g++ instead of gcc so you get the c++ library linked in

9506521
division	modulo
note that the generic way to check whether a number is even or odd is modulo division with the operator

9506528
post	get
will post more as i get into this

9506533
floating-point	integer
the operator performs integer division in python 2.x while it does floating-point division in python 3.x

9506570
int	chars
will work since a is of type chars which can be implicitly cast into an int

9506579
post	get
i have thought about forcing the methods to be called using post rather than get so that a person can t just paste the url in the address even though i could just check the user id of the person doing it

9506579
post	get
one way i have thought about is allowing the get method and then checking the user id of the post compared with the logged in user id like so

9506619
inherited	properties
you can setup a style.xml in res values and inherited from holo and override the properties you need to

9506625
twig	smarty
the best approach in my opinion would be to use an existing template system such as twig or smarty

9506625
twig	smarty
twig and smarty also provide caching options so you aren t rebuilding your template on every request

9506673
google-chrome	firefox
i ve been doing this in google-chrome because firefox doesn t natively support the html5 audio tag

9506755
for-loop	arrays
to give an example lets say the first for-loop dynamically generated the associative arrays with four values

9506773
client-side	server-side
it sounds like you might be blending the server-side and the client-side together in your head

9506773
submit	submission
user clicks the submit button or hits enter or alternatively you could add an onblur handler to the file input to have it trigger the form submission

9506788
width	height
you must divide this by the width and height of the viewport to get the texture coordinates for lookup

9506793
post	get
i can get the post data i tried with a simple string it worked fine but with a heavy file the data seems corrupted

9506795
accessor	properties
__attribute__ nsobject on the properties only causes it to retain release the properties when using the properties accessor

9506798
oncreate	onstart
that case i imagine it would go through oncreate onstart

9506799
width	height
there are other parameters you can pass in the specs parameter besides width and height

9506826
actualheight	actualwidth
i found this link which suggests actualwidth actualheight are evaluated asynchronously hence a well-place begininvoke can solve the problem

9506827
getter	setter
there can be static local variables with getter and setter

9506827
getter	setter
using getter and setter allows one to slide in patterns to prevent multitasking issues from arising

9506836
google-chrome	firefox
borders showed up in firefox ie8 and google-chrome

9506837
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the site and my font-face are working perfectly in safari google-chrome ie9 firefox 3.5+ etc

9506871
width	height
i know i can compress by height and width but i would like to compress the images by size to a fixed size 200 kb only and keep the original height and width

9506988
sorting	filtering
interactive sorting and filtering are more recent but they are there too

9506990
hash	salt
if wordpress salt their hash then you d have to gain access to their salt table or single salt phrase to alter their hash -- but i doubt you ll get that

9507028
redmine	mantis
you can also download redmine and mantis from bitnami if you want to try them out

9507044
int	double
regarding your specific implementation i would be much more inclined to use a 64 bit int as the accumulator rather than a 64 bit double

9507044
int	double
the double only has 53 bits of int precision compared to the 64 bits of a long

9507062
super	self
super mymodel self .save args kwargs

9507080
pjax	history.js
i am attempting to build a treeslider to navigate on a site s content and have had some success i have a test page utilizing pjax a separate version using history.js and a third version using jquery functions calling pushstate replacestate html 5 api

9507087
pop-up	dialog
if it s to initiate the adding of an event or something like that have a look at one of the demos which shows an dialog box pop-up when you click on a day

9507092
javadoc	onejar
s javadoc in onejar zip file

9507115
dbf	dbase
as far as i know microsoft access still supports dbase dbf files which should be compatible with vfp dbfs

9507123
google-chrome	safari
this only happens with safari and google-chrome

9507123
opera	firefox
works fine on firefox and opera

9507124
put	get
i am not saying that this is the way to go just that because of the nature of couchdb this configuration is actually a viable option and will give you benefits of scaling and replication that you would not get if you put node in front and couchdb in back

9507128
voltdb	acid
voltdb supports sql and i think it supports acid transactions as well

9507151
apache	nginx
and make sure to enable ssl on the server nginx apache etc.

9507197
getter	setter
it s a shame to see a small vocal minority take a back lash against the whole getter and setter are evil debate

9507197
getter	setter
getter and setter accessors are not evil

9507200
google-chrome	firefox
it works in firefox google-chrome opera.

9507211
post	get
using post method instead of get or pass random dummy parameter like current timestamp is only robust method to prevent caching in ie

9507220
width	height
and set the height and width

9507229
mamp	wamp
also web apps can be developed via a local environment research mamp or wamp depending on the dependencies in which your app require

9507274
width	height
then on hover you animate the height and width of the image at the same time you animate its left and top properties by negative half of the position values

9507300
width	height
if the linter tool does not recognize the new thumbnail make sure it is compliant with the height and width requirements 50x50

9507300
width	height
also be sure the width to height ratio is also not too high ratio 3.0

9507333
qlistwidget	qdialog
ensure the parent of the qlistwidget qdialog has the following

9507335
matlab	simulink
simulink is part of matlab and works great for engineering problems

9507365
single-quotes	double-quotes
the triple double-quotes prevent single-quotes double-quotes and double double-quotes from prematurely ending the string

9507388
button	checkbox	hide	show
when i first check or last uncheck a checkbox i want a linearlayout with some button to show hide

9507388
post	get
i ve already checked this post listview list is reversed when selection made but i could not get my code to work

9507410
width	height
get the width height aspect ratio less than 3.0 and your image should appear

9507412
width	height
lets draw the same amount using the same positioning and only change a few attributes that will not affect render times width and height

9507415
post	get
if i can get it working i ll post the code when it s done

9507423
hide	show
ideally i ll be able to have these products listed by category and will put in some javascript to hide show products of a given category

9507433
width	height
obviously you will want to adjust all the height width top and left values but this should do what you are looking for.

9507468
hide	show
i dont want to grab the default value enter keywords address.... which is controlled to show or hide by the following

9507473
nettcpbinding	net.tcp
could not find a base address that matches scheme net.tcp for the endpoint with binding nettcpbinding

9507484
ubuntu	debian
oracle java 7 has a list of certified platform popular server operating systems such as debian and ubuntu are not certified

9507511
pem	pkcs#12
if you extracted a public key from pkcs#12 file openssh should be able to use it as long as it was extracted in pem format

9507515
post	get
advise useful python library for work with http with cookies and different methods get post etc like requests

9507515
eventlet	gevent
would very much like to work with library asynchronously by gevent or eventlet

9507524
textview	simplecursoradapter	textview	imageview
i have a listview populated from a simplecursoradapter each row containing some textview and an imageview

9507559
width	height
according to microsoft documentation if you specify a width height it will open in a dialog but this is not the case when using gcf

9507576
eventlet	gevent
eventlet and gevent are both compatible with urllib2 and cookielib which both depend on the automatically patched socket module and should be able to work with different request methods and cookies

9507583
getter	setter
if you declared an ivar instead of using property and synthesize you have to create the getter and setter yourself

9507602
packets	pcap
really simple code that just fires one pcap packets using scapy

9507605
int	double
so if you know how to skip bytes and read short int into double you should be good to go

9507621
google-chrome	firefox
after having some other strange things happen related to google-chrome i tried to use dapper.net on firefox and ie and the same thing continues to happen

9507621
rss	feed
about a month ago dapper.net a popular online software that scrapes web pages to create rss feed and other types of files from different web data went down for a while other users noted it on forums and then the site went back up

9507624
google-chrome	firefox
works fine for me in firefox google-chrome and ie 7-9

9507632
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
further investigation shows that it works fine in google-chrome firefox and safari and fails in ie9

9507634
clang	llvm
compiler apple clang version 3.0 tags apple clang-211.12 based on llvm 3.0svn

i want to extract say 4096 elements from the front of the queue i m using it as a kind of fifo

9507641
put	get
i put up a github repo with instructions on what i was able to get working

9507699
int	chars
the int values stay correct but its like their chars pointer gets reassigned

9507785
filtering	grouping
for gettallpeople to be called within a transaction it must use an ancestor filtering in its query to limit its results to members of the grouping

9507801
valgrind	callgrind
i need something like valgrind callgrind on linux.

9507838
background-image	background-size
most modern browsers have support for css background-image options like background-size so you may really use something like this

9507862
post	get
this post is intended as an extension to matt howells answer specifically for those who run into problems with using job objects under vista or win7 especially if you get an access denied error 5 when calling assignprocesstojobobject

9507869
maven	m2e
i m trying to install m2e plugin to enable maven integration but it looks like plugin is not installed

9507871
width	height
you could first find height and width and guess the compression factor larger image more compression then after you compress it check the size and split the difference again

9507883
background-color	transparency
perhaps try adding position relative and background-color transparency to the button s style then use a div inside the button tag setting the top and left to 0px

9507883
width	height
inside this div please a tag for the button graphic with the style set to the new width height 40px

9507944
post	get
firstly rather than calling die on a post get check

9507982
post	get
i do not want to send the value over the url and i do not wish to change the url as it is now or by extension change from get to post to hide the value

9507988
super	extends
i found that if you extends the horizontalscrollview and override the onlayout you can cleanly scroll after the super call to onlayout

9507990
toupper	uppercase
that said the two versions of the code are not equivalent the version onot using toupper isn t writing the characters all the time while the latter version is once everything is converted to uppercase it always takes the same branch after a test and then does nothing

9508000
post	get
it looks like you re sending the request via post and then trying to access it via get

9508027
valgrind	callgrind	valgrind	gprof	vtune	gprof	gprof	callgrind
gprof valgrind with cachegrind callgrind massif and vtune will do what you need

9508041
post	get
it permits to read parameters from request in any case post or get

9508087
post	get
- i referenced this very helpful post to get where i got

9508149
gif	png
remember that ie6-8 will not capture clicks on an element that is transparent though - so you d need a color + alpha 0 - or a transparent png gif - for the background of the element

9508152
folder	directory
i am trying to write a script that takes in one parameter and then copies a folder in a different directory naming it using the parameter

9508153
floating-point	fractions
thats normal due to float imprecision - floating-point numbers are imprecise if you need to compute with precise numbers use integers and emulate fractions parts on n places

9508162
tapestry	wicket
for a new project i want to usa a component-based framework thinking of wicket or tapestry

9508163
width	height
and casting the width and height to nsinteger also didn t work

9508191
width	height
and append a div to it which is set the width height using the css method in jquery

9508191
width	margin
do i have to compute the the width + margin of the appended and set the dimenstion of the parent div

9508191
children	parent	width	height
and a supplement would what happens to the when you set the parent width and height does it make the child width and height same...i would like to how the appended div setting height affect the children parent...if there is some link which would explain this

9508204
post	get
i don t remember us having to do anything tricky to get this to work so if you re getting errors post them here and maybe we can help

9508210
mouse	keyboard
i have told the keyboard via keyboard.focus mycustomtexteditor to focus on my control when i click on it with my mouse and when i intercept it using a gotkeyboardfocus event handler i can verify using debugging messages that the focus was passed successfully

9508211
width	height	hide	show
would the jquery hide method make the width and height 0 of div s and if i say show what will be height and width of div

9508212
mouse	keyboard	mouse	joystick	joystick	keyboard
the program did nothing special just moving a sprite around the screen with different joystick types such as keyboard and mouse for desktop click and touch events for ios

9508221
tostring	gethashcode	equals	tostring	equals	gethashcode
when i invoke typeof a .getmethods i get foo along with the methods in system.object equals tostring gettype and gethashcode

9508244
width	height
it does not affect the height or width of an item

9508251
put	get
i know there are similar questions problems out there but i have not been able to put 2 and 2 together in order to get this to work

9508252
width	height
it doesn t do anything with the height and or width

9508262
box-sizing	border-box
it has 8px black borders and box-sizing border-box

9508263
hide	show
hide and show store the display property and change between display none and previously stored value

9508263
width	height
so it doesn t change the width or height of an element

9508270
int	double
define a function which takes an input x which is a float or double and returns a triplet of int each in the range 0-255

9508271
width	height
if anyone could assist me in my journey to have a script that makes images without a height but a width of 500px greyscale on page load but change to color on hover it would be awesome

9508273
width	height
as far as what the real w h should be set to on the first line that s a matter of looking at infowindow.b.contentnode and getting a real width height either through the standard properties or jquery s methods

9508275
int	double
then you just need to define an mpi datatype that describes the struct s memory layout lots of double and an int

9508346
filtering	grouping
it start to make sense if you use it to grouping all your filtering function here you could have filtering filterdeliveryadress and then anytime you have to filtering something you might remember that you already have a function for this

9508364
google-chrome	safari
my xml tables on the following page do not show up not even an error message in google-chrome or safari

9508372
getter	setter
first i planed to set an element s innerhtml a getter and setter

9508392
hide	show
the most simple is to use a sprite or two different images superposed and animate | hide | show

9508400
width	height
relative or absolute positioning would change the positioning but not the height or width check this

9508431
ant	pom.xml
the ability to restrict to a particular filename would be really useful for me as there are numerous xml usecases ant build.xml or mvn pom.xml that it would be perfect for

9508444
post	put	post	get	put	get
put your post data in the optional data argument and it will use post instead of get for the request

9508512
getter	setter
also note that i am not looking for a tool to generate getter setter methods for class members

9508528
getter	setter
all of the validation code is already in each component via their getter and setter so ideally what i d like to do is try to create a component with the settings provided by the user and see if there were any errors

9508538
int	double
i would think that instead of casting you need to apply an int not double round-nearest function to the double result of floor

9508538
ceil	floor
the c library versions of floor and ceil are very slow anyway

9508558
decimal	ieee
since not all numbers can be represented exactly in ieee floating point arithmetic the standard that almost all computers use to represent decimal numbers and do math with them you will not always get what you expected

9508558
hex	binary
if we look at them in binary well hex which is equivalent we get a clearer picture

9508576
ggplot2	lattice
another option is to use a grid graphics function to create the histogram such as something from the lattice or ggplot2 packages both can do histograms then create a specific viewport using grid graphics functions and use grid.table to put the table into that viewport

9508589
swt	swing	awt	swing
the image.getbounds function returns the bounds within the parent container and getlocationonscreen used in awt swing is not available for swt

9508625
coldfusion	railo
the code examples should be accurate for adobe coldfusion 9+ and the open source cfml engine railo

9508626
rjava	jri
the jri homepage says that the package is bundled in rjava

9508626
rjava	jri
so i downloaded rjava-0.9.3.tar.gz from the rjava files section and unzipped it getting among other things a lot of java source files and their corresponding classes in the src java folder plus 2 jars jriengine.jar and rengine.jar in the inst jri folder

9508672
width	margin
remember to change the margin to percentage too else width could start to exceed 100 +

9508734
qthread	qobject
you want qobject thread not qthread currentthreadid - the second one returns the thread that the function was called in

9508736
button	checkbox
i have implemented a control that contains some checkbox that have a list of radio button near to them

9508741
put	get
i then put the xerces jar in its own play module called xerces so that when running play deps --sync the xerces jar would not get wiped from the lib directory

9508765
rjava	jri
use install.packages rjava in r - that will install rjava which includes jri

9508765
rjava	jri
you may want to scan the stats-rosuda-devel mailing list which is the canonical place to ask about rjava jri

9508767
getter	setter
you should be using the setter and not the getter of the property counter on the left side of the assignment

9508793
post	get
next do the post request to authenticate and get the auth cookie

9508793
post	get
also check this question it doesn t show the entire class but the idea is to keep the cookiecontainer in the same class add the new cookies from post get requests and assign them to the each new request like krizz answered

9508840
couchbase	couchdb
there s a big difference between couchdb and couchbase if i m right couchbase use couchdb to store the data but do not offer present the views and others nice functionality of couchdb

9508840
couchbase	couchdb
couchbase looks more like a memcache server with a persistence layer powered by couchdb and maybe it does not fit your needs

9508840
couchbase	couchdb
from the comment i understand that damien katz is now working on this new project called couchbase but it s not couchdb s last version but just another nosql database

9508864
hex	binary
when loading a binary executable into memory it can be disassembled or even looked at with a hex editor and symbols from the assembly code

9508876
udp	tcp
giving those very optimal network conditions i d say udp is perfect for that task data loss should be so rare that tcp is an overkill

9508915
return-value-optimization	nrvo
most likely return-value-optimization and nrvo ate your code

9508934
versioning	upgrade
the key issue is nsinfermappingmodelautomaticallyoption since i was using this option i was not noticing that when the database upgrade versioning and does not find a mapping model it tries to infer it

9508969
pop-up	dialog
the mvc4 default app uses a pop-up login dialog that includes validation and does not go away if the validation fails

9509002
google-chrome	firefox
i only need this to work in google-chrome and firefox 4+ though others would be nice

9509005
daemons	launchd
i then created a launchd plist instead of using your daemons script

9509005
daemons	launchd
launchd is the osx daemons process manager which does seem to launchd programs in a way that they have complete access to the windowserver

9509048
children	parent
however while getting a tree from the parser works for expressions where the variables are just one character ie a || b and c i am having a hard time adapting this to my case in the example i d expect one and parent and two children x eq 1 and y eq 10 see the test case below

9509055
updatepanel	scriptmanager
the scriptmanager control and the updatepanel control allow your form to post back to the server asynchronously

9509089
codeigniter	kohana
people also seem to like kohana and codeigniter

9509113
abstract-class	superclass
i just want to know about tricks and shortcuts and make the most of our knowledge about class hierachies abstract-class superclass overriding etc. we know everything about this terms but just don t know how to use them to design a project

9509139
post	get
and when you submit this form you get a complete array ready for you to save the comment with the post foreing key

9509209
webclient	webrequest
it contains webclient webrequest webresponse .

9509267
subtraction	add	subtract	add
i find the easiest way to do subtraction in two s complement is by the method of complements which is instead of trying to subtract the positive 18 from the positive 15 +15 - +18 we instead add negative 18 to positive 15 +15 + -18

9509313
put	get
i trying to put the text of a jlabel under its icon centered at the momemnt i can get this

9509334
width	height
you need a container div that wraps all the divs inside it and set its properties width height etc

9509409
post	get
the form is created dynamically on client end first then get post to server

9509466
accelerometer	gyroscope
i also noticed an incredible battery drain while using metaio sdk for ar i m not sure if what i m describing is even feasible from the battery life point of view - running accelerometer gyroscope magnetometer and receiving constant gps updates may kill the battery very fast

9509502
ord	chr
chr and ord and unichr don t seem to be working

9509521
int	chars
you need to first convert it to an int and then you can use chr to get the ascii chars coresponding to the value

9509540
move	drag
i have subclassed qmimedata and drag drop works perfectly fine within my widget â for both copyaction and moveaction data gets copied and move as needed based on shift ctrl keys etc.

9509540
move	drag

addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	division	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction
floating point numbers are probably most accurate for multiplication and division while integers and fixed point numbers are the best choice for addition and subtraction

9514416
addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	division	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction
this follows from the fact that multiplication and division changes the order of magnitude which floating point numbers handle better while addition and subtraction is some kind of step which integers and fixed point numbers handle better

9514574
cpu	processors
it might be horribly inefficient to do so but the c implementation could use 33-bit pointers which would therefore require at least 5 bytes of storage and wouldn t fit in a cpu register enabling it to use a value for null pointers that isn t one of the 2 32 addresses the processors can handle

9514621

9515367
stdout	stderr
my problem is i need both the stdout and stderr and the both have to be processed through different things simultaneously

9515417
stdout	stderr
if you need to redirect stderr to stdout so that the following command in the pipe gets it as its input then you can use

9515417
stdout	stderr
in find command stderr is redirected to stdout

9515469
inherited	subclassing
if all the subtypes share the same public interface the public members inherited from the base type overwritten for different behavior in each subclassing then outside client types can treat them all the same as if they were the base class

9516273
rvm	bundler	capistrano	bundler	capistrano	rvm
while i don t use capistrano i deploy to heroku so git is all i need i d imagine it probably uses the current recommended best-practice of calling bundle install --deployment on the production server which according to the bundler documentation installs all of the gems locally into your app s deployment root instead of your gem_home which would be your rvm gemset in this case

9516273
rvm	bundler	rubygems	rvm	rubygems	bundler
while an rvm gemset does the same thing bundler doesn t assume the presence or absence of rvm it only assumes ruby and rubygems are installed and working

9516912
folder	directory
and that directory already exist all subsequent commands won t execute all the put and other mkdir for deeper folder that already have been started

9516915
hide	show
you should use jquery s hide and show like this

9516919

9517349
width	height
important to your resizable class width and height

9517402
width	height	firefox	safari
if i use the code below to set an images width but not height instead of scaling the height proportionally like safari and firefox ie is just displaying the images actual height causing it to stretch my width setting is to display the image at a smaller than original size

9517436
width	height
if you want just to set the width than add the width but not the height

9517436
width	height
always specify both the height and width attributes for images

9517436
width	height
height and width are set the space required for the image is reserved

9517464
subtract	add
for example the datetime class supports various calculations to add or subtract specific periods etc. if you want an example post your exact requirement and i ll add it to the answer

9517479
int	chars
the problem is that you re not checking the return value from ifs2.get which returns an int not a chars

9517488
textview	imageview
the problem is that i want the all imageview to be always visible and force textview to adjust their widths and the texts to break into multiline correctly

9517495
mouseup	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown
you need to replace the logic related to mousedown mousemove mouseup with touch events

9517512
int	chars
note as has already been stated get returns an int not a chars

9517558
java.util.date	simpledateformat
you ll need to use simpledateformat to get any java.util.date into the desired format you want

9517604
min	max
is there a better way to add simple validation aspects - max and min length and not null ought to cover my use cases

9517635
textview	imageview
use a relative layout for the main root layout of the list row and first set the imageview at the right and one imageview which you are displaying folder icon place it to the left side of the row and now set the textview s to the left of the imageview s and right of the imageview folder

9517674
fadein	fadeout	fadein	hide	hide	fadeout
fadein works only if element is not visible to hide it use fadeout or hide

9517732
dictionary	map
1 works because map is a dictionary the values of which are functions so retrieves a function from map and stores that function in the variable room

9517745
sorting	grouping
i ve solved it using what seems to be the typical way that you would which is by sorting the words and grouping them into a hash based on their sorted characters

9517754

i used to check if magic_quotes_gpc in on and stripped all slashes if that was the case right at the beginning of my script for all post get and cookie variables so that i don t get confused

9517763
config	ini
one solution can be implemented using ini -style config files with the configparser class

9517782
portrait	landscape
the login interface oauth comes in portrait mode and the keypad comes in landscape

9517785
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
performance is quite similar while searching an element with sortedlist or sorteddictionary because they both use a binary search

9517785
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
sorteddictionary offers same advantages than sortedlist but performs better if values to insert are not already sorted

9517787
single-quotes	double-quotes
just like brackets and parentheses every quotation mark must either open a new quotation or close an already-open quotation of the same kind double-quotes close double-quotes single-quotes close single-quotes

9517929
dictionary	map
where categories_data_map is dictionary with category model relation map

9517953
filtering	grouping
in general yes but note that many fir filtering are symmetric gives linear phase constant grouping delay so in practice you may only have n 2 distinct coefficients for an nth order filtering with each coefficient being used for two corresponding filtering stages

9517965
post	put
you can however store the value in a hidden field put this hidden field in a form and process it during a post operation

9518056
gridview	sqldatasource
it is able to show sort the items in my sqldatasource but when i change the sqldatasource as it can be seen in the below code it displays the error the gridview gridview1 fired event sorting which wasn t handled

9518099
min	max
a min max and value 10 15 3 and you need to find the maximum xor value between the values in the bst and the given value that are within min and max of the tree

9518099
min	max
if min and max didn t exist my approach would be

9518099
min	max	range	min	range	max
the problem i m running into with min and max is when i place the checks for node min node max the tree will traverse fine but when i m within range it s possible that i may be taking a bad branch to a number outside of the range

tabcontrol	tabitem
when my tabcontrol gets resized so that the tabitem is too small to display all the content no scrollbars are displayed

9518895
hash	md5
md5 is a hash algorithme so it allows two words to have the same hashcode

9518895

9540587
subtraction	addition
addition and subtraction are easy

9540587

of course it s going to be at a minimum o n but how much does the multiplication and addition add to the complexity

9541166
getter	setter
and in most of the examples and tutorials i have seen that a simple model class is created by defining private variables and providing setter and getter methods for them

9541166
getter	setter
but i can define the above class by just defining public variables as i am not doing any processing in the getter and setter method like below

9541166
getter	setter
i understand the approach is not very dynamic in the sense if at later point i decide to put some processing logic in getter and setter methods then i may have to change all my client objects to change to use the getter and setter

9541225
getter	setter
stick to private fields and public getter setter

9541225
getter	setter
most frameworks depends on getter setter jpa is a notable exception in field mode as per the javabeans standard

9541226
google-chrome	firefox
i have tested with firefox and google-chrome

9541231
getter	setter
the main argument towards creating getter and setter is for improved encapsulation from an object oriented sense

9541231
getter	setter
a getter setter method may go out to a database or a filesystem or a local instance variable to retrieve the model data

9541231
getter	setter
if those underlying data sources change in some later update you will only have to change the getter setter methods whereas if you access the variables directly you will have to refactor your entire code base

alternatively you could implement this in a custom subclassing of uiviewcontroller and then have all of your app s view controllers inherited from your custom view controller

9541331

i m going to answer this question by changing the standard rss feed of a wordpress installation to respond to limits passed by query parameters

9541740
rss	feed
reading page and are unpaginated as that wouldn t generally make sense for an rss feed

9541740
rss	feed
so the following code in a plugin -- or even in your theme s functions.php -- will completely unlimit the items returned in your rss feed

9541740
rss	feed
for this example you ll get the normal rss feed but with 25 items starting from item number 30

if i create a property and synthesize it and create a getter and setter as well like so

9541852
margin	height
all that happens when you mouse over one of the menus items is the menu item gains 2 pixels in height and it s top margin becomes -2px which is why it is so strange that this would cause a seemingly unrelated scrollbar to appear

9542007
min	max
anarray min or anarray max in this case are useless as you get the value of the min max index

9542040

technical answer is you don t as one is a server-side language and one is a client-side language

9542345

what i have in mind right now is to dynamically change the width height properties of the video to fit the viewable area using javascript but also set a minimum size such that the video doesn t get distorted

decimal 255 is equal to octal 377 use windows calculator in scientific mode to confirm

9543181
portrait	landscape
i ve found this answer which makes it seem like what you want to do is just not possible without doing code workarounds like running your game in landscape and rendering it as portrait and vice versa

9543186
hash	salt
only the salt and hash are stored

9543205
matplotlib	colormap
i am new to matplotlib and have get stuck in colormap

9543205

in matplotlib how do i get the whole array of rgb colors for a specific colormap let s say for hot

9543324
width	height
this means there is currently no way to dynamically adjust the cell height based on the div width at least until css expressions start being implemented

9543330
getter	setter
in the case of readonly attributes they just map to a setter and for non-readonly attributes there s a setter and a getter implicitly created for you when the idl gets compiled

9543330
getter	setter
given the dynamic and non-deterministic nature of the values they can return and the fact that client orbs might behave differently from each other and still remain compliant to the corba spec you can only reliably expect idl attributes to map to getter and setter that can be used to retrieve or set a value

9543384
asp.net-mvc	html.actionlink
when using url.action or html.actionlink with areas if you don t specify the area route value asp.net-mvc will only look for a match in the current area

9543390
textarea	textbox
does anyone know of a regularexpression validator or website thats stops script and html tags being used in textbox and textarea

9543416
portrait	landscape
plugging into a car charger usually forces the phone to landscape mode thus rotating it from portrait most likely and calling ondestroy

9543458
for-loop	arrays
the for-loop i ve included in the main function resets the entire keystates arrays to 0

9543518
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
but i realized that this is not easy to loops through the arrays like a for-loop so i was thinking of this

9543518
for-loop	loops
i wanted to do this so that in a for-loop i could get the ids and the values easily but the above only returns the value when i loops through it

9543530
post	get
you can also remove the where and add x.post_id as this_post_id into the from to get this for all post

9543534
implements	extends
you need to have the object extends or implements another object so that you can cast them as different kinds of objects

9543569
width	height
float is preferred over display inline since with the latter you can t set the element s dimensions width and height as well as vertical paddings top and bottom - which floated elements can do since they re treated as block elements

9543569
width	height
inline-block is like inline but gives you some properties that block elements like width height as well as vertical padding

9543576
for-loop	arrays
however i can t get it to work with two arrays in a double for-loop only nothing more

9543576
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
like i said it works fine if i either only display one arrays data or use more loops however i only have to use a double for-loop and nothing else

9543580
momentjs	datejs
i ve done a fair bit of reading on so tried to manipulate momentjs and datejs into helping me and generally been plagued by a feeling of frustration since i started trying to solve this so if someone could help or point me at the duplicate question on so that i just haven t been able to find that d be awesome

9543588
pypdf	reportlab
it uses reportlab toolkit the html5lib and pypdf together and pretty easy to use

9543611

tinyurl	bit.ly
base 62 is used by tinyurl and bit.ly for the abbreviated urls

9543808
gridview	detailsview
in addition bind is very useful in templatefields used in the gridview and detailsview

9543820
submit	submission
if you want to use the updateuser function on submit then it must prevent the form from actually submission

9543820
submit	submission
the browser runs the function before submission the form that s how on submit works

9543838
firefox	safari
i would like to get the font to display at 1.5em as it does in firefox but i would like to maintain the rounded corners that are present in safari which disappear in firefox only when i add the font-size 1.5em

9543854

9543856
factories	presenter
you could publish a new view was instantiated to a message bus to which a presenter factories could bind the instantiated view to a presenter

9543891
filesystems	hfs	integer	unsigned
historically hfs plus the mac os x native filesystems probably used by ios also stored each timestamp in a 32-bit unsigned integer representing the number of seconds since midnight jan 1 1904 gmt

9543897
asterisk	pbx
after too many time using this phone with any type of pbx server like asterisk asterisk windows and elestisk i face mysterious problem in my soft-phone

9543911
width	height
you can use padding property so its automatically set height width what you want.

9543930
portrait	landscape
this should tell you whether you are in portrait or landscape

9543951
memcached	apc
i think i can t use all the api php extension memcached apc xcache that need to install something in my remote linux server as my web host server is a shared server what i just can do is to place files scripts in the httpdocs folder

9543962
submit	submission
so the click first triggers the submission regardless then the event handler kicks in because it is a submit button and then the form is sent to the server from the first submt

9543966
int	chars
you may need to cast the int to chars so that you can store it in a string

9543981
google-chrome	firefox
at the moment the information appears to be scattered across the internet and i haven t found much that addresses specific versions of browsers which change rapidly google-chrome and now firefox

9543993
google-chrome	firefox
the problem i am facing is lets say my default browser is firefox and i open the page in google-chrome so when the python script opens the new page it opens that in firefox instead of google-chrome

9544177
firefox	safari
it generally isn t that difficult to get the buttons to look the same between firefox and safari

9544209
google-chrome	firefox
but ok under firefox and google-chrome

9544219
implements	extends
i assume this means it doesn t recursively extends but i thought i d ask here before implements it into my project and wasting a lot of time

9544290
google-chrome	safari
i m seeing the same behavior in google-chrome 17 and safari mac

9544328
int	double	int	chars
in java not only string but all primitive wrapper classes int double chars etc are immutable

9544334
togglebutton	seekbar
i have seekbar and a togglebutton for each of the rows in list

9544402
backbone.js	zepto
backbone.js requires either jquery or zepto to be loaded before backbone.js if you intend to do any dom manipulation if you use a view

9544402
backbone.js	zepto
so backbone.js doesn t know if it should use jquery or zepto when it loads and you end up with an undefined value being used a function

9544434
width	height
a simple way would be to add a uiimageview to your cells that has a small width and the same height with the cell example

9544449
button	checkbox
finally i found a solution the event that triggers then radio checkbox button are checked with javascript and not only is called onpropertychange in ie and domattrmodified in firefox

9544468
google-chrome	firefox
ie8 firefox and google-chrome are giving perfect output

9544473
maven	pom.xml
i do not think maven will search for un-installed dependencies within a multi module project if you are not executing on the parent pom.xml

9544482
postgresql	mysql
there is a transaction_retry gem which not only works with rails 3+ but supports all major databases mysql postgresql and sqlite

9544486
onfocus	onblur
the problem is it works fine in chrome mozilla ie onfocus orange onblur gray and onerror red

9544499
width	height
if your listbox is inside a grid it should take all the space of that grid - if it is inside a stackpanel it will use the least amount os space possible so you will have to use fixed height width

9544542
pull	push
surely you d be better off using a pull for updates than a push and use a technology like nuget to handle your references

9544582
opera	firefox
what i don t get is some browsers like firefox opera will not go through proxy

9544583
interpolation	splines
then you can either define them manually or take a look at splines interpolation

9544583
interpolation	splines
with splines interpolation you only need a single point in-between to determine the full curve

9544620
post	get
the get friends function in hackbook works fine though but you can t post anything on your friends wall

9544695
getter	setter
then you would have to manually create setter and getter methods to access the variable outside your class

9544695
accessor	properties
in order to help deal with memory management useful for objects apple introduced properties in obj-c 2.0 and it allowed you to define the accessor for a given variable

9544695
getter	setter
you could say that a variable would have certain attributes such as retaining or copying a value having alternate setter or getter name etc and you defined this like

9544695
getter	setter
then in your implementation you could synthesize these properties with the given attributes and the compiler would generate setter and getter methods for your variable

9544695
getter	setter
is a setter and a getter called settopspeed and topspeed with an instance variable called topspeed created by the compiler to store the value

9544695
accessor	ivar
this helps for code readability because there can be confusion between when you say self.topspeed or topspeed in your code the first calls the accessor the second is the ivar

9544695
accessor	ivar
the _topspeed differentiates itself from normal variables and also makes it explicit when you re calling self.topspeed the accessor vs _topspeed the ivar

9544718
uiview	catransition
i have a method inside my uiview subclass which adds a to catransition its layer

9544744
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
but not in google-chrome opera and firefox

9544747
children	parent
parent usually calculates it s size according to it s children

9544765
for-loop	loops
when you go to iterate or pass through the data structure one element at a time the iterator presents you with an interface in which each element in the data structure follows sequentially allowing you to loops through with a basic for-loop structure

9544785
getter	setter
i have a worksite class that has worksiteid worksitename and refcode fields each with a getter and setter

9544785
getter	setter	tostring	getter
i can use the worksite objects with no problem except that when i look at the client-side jax-ws generated sources in netbeans the getter and setter are all there but the tostring method is not there

9544810
post	put
and in the loaded page window.php i put the code to print the post parameters.

9544838
google-chrome	firefox
both on firefox and google-chrome in ubuntu

9544862
post	get
for this reason you should use a post verb instead of get

9544940
textarea	textbox
i already done this with some textbox and textarea with a .js file named farsitype.js

9544954
inherited	subclassing
subclassing the form create another form which inherited from registrationform

9545000
switching	screens
you will need full control over the client machine to enforce something like this using a client-side application that can occupy the full screens lock task switching etc..

9545025
width	height
change height or width whatever is needed.

9545027
pull	push
it should work under windows 7 and allow at least the following commands git add git status git commit git push git pull

9545029
post	get
post it to the server then use to get its value

9545097
post	get
works with get post or the hope is that it will

9545097
post	get
my issue is currently i don t want to have mirror code if at all possible where one acts based on post and one acts based on get where both are literally the same code otherwise

9545114
public	protected
if it s a member variable the visibility modifier needs to be default no modifier or higher protected or public

9545119
post	get
the code acts based on post and one acts based on get will never be the same

9545124
width	height
is there some way that i could change the height and width inside the open to be

9545128
google-chrome	firefox
ie8 ie9 firefox google-chrome etc

9545134
width	height
parent container will take the height and width

9545153
udp	tcp
i send my socket with a application in c++ in udp or tcp if impossible in udp... to nodejs

9545169
margin	height	width	height	width	margin
a good way to center a div is to use fixed positioning top and left set to 50 and left and top margin to the negative of half of the width height

9545187
width	height
in javascript you can center an element by determining the viewport dimensions height width of the available screen and position your element relative to those dimension

9545216
width	height
using auto as margins and defining a width and height should be enough

9545230
folder	directory
once you made your file changes and are ready deploy change directory to the new folder and run the following commands

9545280
width	height	google-chrome	firefox
explorer will display it improperly sized even when width and height are provided google-chrome and firefox just prompt to download

9545286
allocator	stl
in modern c++ with the stl containers and smart pointers plain memory allocator should only happen in very rare exceptional cases

9545356
post	get
you can use to determine whether your script was called via http get or post method

9545356
post	get
now assuming that you ve coded your entire script to use you can copy all post variables to get variables

9545382
qobject	qpointer
you can t have a shared ownership between a parent qobject and a smart pointer and prevent one to delete the other but you can track the deletion of any qobject by using only qweakpointer or qpointer

9545382
qobject	qpointer	qobject	qsharedpointer	qsharedpointer	qpointer
update with qt 5 tracking qobject s not managed by qsharedpointer with qweakpointer is deprecated in favor of qpointer which is itself undeprecated

9545453
jobs	cron
also could that pose a problem for the remaining cron jobs

9545458
public	protected
the protected and public members of the parent class are still accessible in the derived class and friends thereof

9545462
public	protected
public inheritance makes public base members public protected members protected and private base members are inaccessible

9545462
public	protected
protected inheritance makes public and protected base members protected within the derived class and private base members are inaccessible

9545462
public	protected
private inheritance makes public and protected base members private within the derived class and private base members are inaccessible

9545465
boost	stl
there is dependency on the boost and stl libraries

9545465
boost	stl
stl is not a problem and the boost dependency is quite easy to avoid

9545482
width	height
e androidruntime 4276 java.lang.illegalargumentexception width and height must be 0

9545487
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i have a sample project located on github that does exactly the pinterest piictu style hide the uinavigationcontroller uitabbarcontroller stuff

9545498
jobs	cron
it doesn t cause any problems for any following cron jobs

9545503
pull	push
i want to let users commit pull and push changes in current branch switch to another existing branch but do not allow to merge branches

9545524
hash	salt
the server stored salt+hash pass salt now if you send hash pass salt the server calculates salt+hash hash pass salt salt which is obviously not the same as salt+hash pass salt and the login fails

9545528
post	get
if these are the only ones will call the callback five times which means you get the title of the first five post

9545528
post	get
or in case there are less than 5 post you will get an error

9545552
jboss	glassfish
for java ee 6 obvious choices are glassfish 3.1.2 jboss 7.1 tomee

9545598
google-chrome	firefox
i was so confounded as google-chrome just said there was a problem but thankfully i tried firefox and it actually blurted out the offending code

9545600
gif	png
the full transparency works fine for png and gif merely the half-transparent areas are a problem

9545601
post	get
i am not sure i get it but if you use a form with post _post array will keep variables and they will not be visible in the url

9545676
hide	show
this way you d be able to hide big ball and can show small balls

9545693
int	chars
server is localhost and has database test with table person chars 50 name int 10 number - primary key

9545701
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
when i hover over the image with my mouse the javascript works fine in ie but in firefox google-chrome safari etc

9545701
width	height
as you can see from the img tag height is inferred proportional to width by not being specified

9545709
entities	entitymanager
you re trying to work on entities that are not managed by the entitymanager you re working with

9545712
jboss	glassfish	jboss	resin	glassfish	resin
examples of those are glassfish jboss tomee and resin

9545721
jar	manifest.mf
if the jar is indeed runnable then you can read the main class from meta-inf manifest.mf and invoke main via reflection

9545723
postgresql	mysql
maintaining mysql in addition to postgresql in same server may be not reasonable so i m looking for a way to use postgresql

9545741
width	height
the reason is surfaceview aspect ratio width height must be same as camera.size aspect ratio used in preview parameters

9545750
subtract	add
the offset cancels out as you d have to both add it to get to the function and subtract it to get the base address so you might as well not bother

9545753
postgresql	mysql
maintaining mysql in addition to postgresql in same server may be not reasonable

9545753
postgresql	mysql
adding postgresql support as a requirement seriously limits your options so installing mysql side-by-side with postgresql may be a good idea

9545760
expression-blend	silverlight
i am making a silverlight application using expression-blend 4.0

9545761
google-chrome	firefox
use inspect element on google-chrome or firebug on firefox

9545765
min	max
just had to maintain a lastcandleindex var and convert the scrolling to use candles indexes and their dates instead of increasing decreasing the min max values by time intervals so now the scrolling is not scrolling time intervals but a fixed number of candles

9545794
min	max
just had to maintain a lastcandleindex var and convert the scrolling to use candles indexes and their dates instead of increasing decreasing the min max values by time intervals so now the scrolling is not scrolling time intervals but a fixed number of candles

9545814
clearance	devise
i haven t used clearance i usually either roll my own authentication or use devise but a quick look through the code tells me that sign_in user does nothing more than set current_user user so you need some way to persist that information before you redirect

9545828
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this will work for you in all ie firefox google-chrome safari etc

9545845
winpcap	wireshark
also take a look at winpcap which lets your application access the same sniffing abilities of wireshark

9545846
children	parent
when you build the max min-heap you don t need to heapify percolatedown the leafs as they can t have any children which are bigger smaller then their parent

9545866
addition	multiplication
now suppose i wish to use this operation in modular arithmetic addition multiplication etc

9545869
put	get
i ve put in a finally statement but i get syntax error i don t have any idea on how to correct them i ve tried everything but to no avail

9545877
comparator	comparable
your object should implement comparable interface and hence you will be forced to override comparator method

9545886
tax	shipping
note in my example that there s no tax or shipping breakout as pp has so you ll need to display that as necessary before showing this buynow buton or perhaps on your confirmation page or confirmation email you send

9545948
express	node.js
i was using express in node.js where it was serving static images in a case-insensitive way but when i moved to s3 i found that the images are case sensitive

9545955
onchange	onkeyup
for a textbox you don t want to do this it would if you clicked to enter so instead you can look at either onchange or onkeyup

9545973
primefaces	richfaces
both primefaces and richfaces have such a component p poll and a4j poll respectively

9545973
primefaces	richfaces
for push both primefaces and richfaces have components available again p push vs a4j push

9545992
opera	firefox
i think that some android applications you said opera and firefox simply doesn t do this check but implements some native proxy handling not caring of how the system work

9546055
hash	salt
you should never use passwords use password hash instead properly salt of course

9546060
jtextfield	jeditorpane
i want to pass the search string entered in simplebrowser jtextfield into jeditorpane which is in mytabbedpane

9546060
getter	setter
i don t how to use getter and setter

9546071
pull	push
otoh my guess is that we can start just using only the develos release hotfix branches introducing feature branches later and in this setting folks would just have to pull push normally

9546071
squash	merge
am planning to keep that in sync with develop obviously ignoring the merge history by squash merge

9546118
children	parent
the difference is that capturing method starts the event chain from parent to children meaning that parent event will fire first and the child element will fire last this happens in your case

9546154
oncreate	ondestroy
whenever there is an orientation change android destroys your activity calls ondestroy and then restarts it calls oncreate

9546188
implements	extends
what is the difference between extends and implements in java with respect to performance and memory etc

9546188
implements	extends
for above scenarios 1 2 what is difference between using extends deriving child class implements implements interface

9546195
for-loop	arrays
my question how can i do this for the above mentioned 4d arrays without using a for-loop

9546196
sse	avx
i know various ways that i can do this using sse instructions as well as the avx instruction vbroadcastsd but i m not sure which method will yield the best result

9546197
for-loop	arrays
if the for-loop is only for checking if every field is empty the bla bla is empty and the trigger arrays isn t being used afterwards your if statement can be compactly written as

9546204
portrait	landscape
this technique is good if you dont have different layouts for portrait and landscape mode

9546247
min	max
i m calculating the min max and the avg of player level

9546247
min	max
but i want it to withdraw also the name corresponding to the min and max value

9546279
inherited	subclassing
it means the subclassing inherited

9546303
firefox	safari
i m wondering if there is a common routine for making input boxes look like they do in firefox and ie in safari because they usually look horrible once you add a touch of css to the element

9546330
folder	directory
create temporary directory without modifying mtime of parent folder

9546354
rss	feed
i working on a universal ios app that gets news from an rss feed

9546369
getter	setter
you are correct -- use getter and setter and you are also correct that you don t want simplebrowser s button s actionlistener creating a new mytabbedpane object inside its actionperformed since your program should only have one mytabbedpane object

9546449
ubuntu	linux
i know that is probably off topic as it is a linux ubuntu question but my main problem may still be java-related

9546452
strlen	substr
by smart use of pointer arithmetic you can skip the calls to substr which do allocation and strlen which take o n time in the length of the string

9546465
setinterval	clearinterval
use setinterval clearinterval instead

9546494
persistent	transient
normally java card simulators keep both persistent and transient memory in ram

9546496
children	parent
if you read the text given by your links carefully you will see that each parent node at position i in a heap has children at positions and only if these positions do not exceed the length of the array

9546496
children	parent
since the percolatedown algorithm swaps parent with their children only length 2 iterations are needed

9546541
centos	linux
the amazon linux ami is loosely based on centos and a perfectly decent os for ec2 in fact it has been tailored by amazon for ec2 specifically

9546541
debian	linux	debian	centos	centos	linux	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian
that said centos and the amazon linux ami in turn uses the yum package manager to install and update packages from centos and 3rd party repositories debian ubuntu use the apt package manager instead - the inherent concepts are very similar though see section adding packages in amazon linux ami basics

9546541
centos	linux
be advised though that you might actually not need to do that insofar the amazon linux ami has been built to be binary-compatible with the centos series of releases and therefore packages built to run on centos should also run on the amazon linux ami

9546541
centos	linux
the desired package pptpd is not part of the standard repositories on centos either though but it is available in the 3rd party extra packages for enterprise linux epel repository see letter p - i can t comment on the viability of using this one vs

9546577
post	get
since phonegap s file transfer does an http post at it s most basic this should get you started

9546665

uilabel	nsstring
i m trying to pass an nsstring address object to a uilabel text but i received a warning from xcode compiler about incompatible pointer as shown in the screen shot below

9546685
versioning	upgrade
on a side note i don t know what versioning of kdevelop ubuntu is shipping these days but if it s anything less then 4.2 you certainly want to upgrade

9546805

9547184
draggable	droppable
i m not sure exactly what you would like to achieve but take a look at jquery ui draggable and droppable most importantly the later which makes it easy to manipulate the behaviour of elements which support other elements being dropped on them or dragged over them

int	chars
one idea is to send string containing the two int concatenated by a comma chars

you may need to fflush stderr to get the message to write before the program exits

9547988
free	malloc
that s because this function is not reentrant mainly because it can use malloc and free

9547990
post	get
and of course i ll be happy to post a little code sample here once i get going for the sake of others future reading of course

9548030
int	chars
if you talking about number of bits you can use short chars instead of int

9548047
int	chars
if you want to limit how many chars a user can input as an int you can use a control-structure checking if the entered value is between 2 limits

9548059
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i read that using google-chrome can bug it out so i used firefox and safari to check

also see jonskeet s answer regarding reading booth stdout and stderr at the same time in the background

9548254
client-side	server-side
the problem i encountered there as you may probably guess but i understood only later on was that one check is done client-side and the other is done server-side

9548254
client-side	server-side
being one client-side it sounds immediate while the other server-side sounds remote

9548254
client-side	server-side
a tech user would very easily bypass the whole verification if everything is done client-side and nothing server-side

9548254
post	get
and when i get a 100 functioning sbox going i ll post the final product here so it s available to all who may encounter the same or a similar problem

9548256
stdout	stderr
you re trying to read all of stdout - which will basically block until the process finishes - and then all of stderr

9548256
stdout	stderr
use two threads one reading from stdout and one reading from stderr - that way it doesn t matter which of them next has data you ll be reading from both of them

9548303
mouseup	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown
you can do this by attaching event handlers to the mousedown and mouseup events similar to how you attached to the mousemove event

9548303
mouseup	mousedown
when using the mouseup and mousedown events you may want to limit your handling to only when the first mouse button is pressed

9549069
google-chrome	safari
i still have some small problems with google-chrome but i think is connected with the fact that for google-chrome and safari the font is 20 px height instead of 16 like in all other browsers don t know why but they are not so bad the text is 4 px lowered i can accept this

9549073

to work around this try adding a thread.sleep timespan.fromminutes 2 in your exception handlers to ensure that the exception log gets fflush to storage

9549252
hmac	pbkdf2
pbkdf2 uses hmac

9549252
hash	hmac
hmac however is an algorithm which uses any hash function

9549257
int	chars
that is three int which may be positive or negative each separated by single spaces and then another space before a block of text which may consist of any chars but which should not contain carriage returns

9549257
int	chars
now i suppose i can read a substring up to the space chars for each of the initial int and then simply read the remaining text in one go

9549310
post	get
i m sure if you contact microsoft you could post your question to them perhaps even get phone support

9549313

9549524
udp	rtp
for live streaming the latency should be kept to a minimum and the typical protocols used are rtp udp

9549524
udp	rtp
this is more often necessary with audio streaming since the header size ip + udp + rtp is considered big in relation to the audio payload

9549567
sorting	filtering
the reason avoiding custom sql is so important in this case is that the code i m writing is generic and heavily data-driven and it needs to mix with other filtering and sorting qualifiers on the query for post objects so i can t just hard code either method calls on post to access the collection of categories or custom sql that might not mix well with the sql generated by the other filtering

9549608
inline	inlining
this way you force inlining for sure since the inline statement is only a hint and does not always lead to inlining

9549610

int	chars
i m trying to learn more about bitwise and see how i can improve the performance of my code with it so i ve made an test code in that code i make 2 arrays one with unsigned chars and another with unsigned int the idea is to simulate an rgba array and see the differences in manipulating it with just pointer or with bitwise

9549672
int	chars
to be sure that everything is working in the end i do an sum of all values of the array the problem is that the values from the array manipulated with pointer differs from the one with bitwise for now the array have just 4 positions in the int array and 16 in the chars one

then repeat with the next 8 digits except that you subtract the number this time

9549727
popupwindow	pop-up
instead i want it to be done by using popupwindow class which gets popped up on startup and display some message on the pop-up

9549814
width	margin
because the left declaration pushes your element with width added to the calculation so the push actually means 50 to the left + width of your element so we use the negative margin to compensate for the width 50 - width 2

9549877
width	height
if i use a specific height and width it works fine

9549877
width	height
if the tabcontainer takes all the available width and height the menu does something very strange

9549882
for-loop	arrays
one finds the same thing is true when comparing a for-loop direct iteration of an arrays to a .foreach iteration of the same arrays for the same reaons

9549913
oncreate	getwritabledatabase
you probably call getwritabledatabase or getreadabledatabase in one of the methods oncreate or onupgrade of your implementation of sqliteopenhelper

9549913
oncreate	getwritabledatabase
getwritabledatabase calls oncreate or onupgrade so if you have a getwritabledatabase call in one of those methods you will run in trouble

9549946
backbone.js	javascriptmvc
no i don t know of a standard way to do this but yes that s what some of the javascriptmvc frameworks do like backbone.js

9549997

9550464

int	chars
you assign that int to a variable of type chars thereby losing information

9572003
range	max
query the table once to get the highest imprints column value to use for your maximum random value range like so select max imprints as max from my_table

9572031
hash	md5
because sha256 hash are much longer than md5 hash you can detect the hash algorithm by looking at the length of the hash

9572072
children	parent
it properly creates the ul parent but the li children don t get created added properly - they just get wrapped in the default span tags

9572083

9572265
hide	show
over the years there must be a dozen ways to show hide rows or showing hiding page sections to the client in asp.net on the server or through client side methods like javascript and i am getting lost on what to do

9572265
hide	show
html table with css to show hide and client side javascript to show rows

9572265
hide	show
gets a little bit more involved when server side results dictate when to show hide in js back on client

9572265
hide	show
most of the time a server-side action dictates for me at least when to show hide rows in the ui so i typically lean toward the server side options but i want to get some input as to which one of these methods is most advantageous and why so i can be more consistient in my approach to doing this

9572286
width	margin
according to the width of the dialogpreference i set the margin of a text field so that its position is aligned with the thumb position of a seek bar

9572295
filtering	grouping
you could then keep the two completely separate without having to go through incredible measures to filtering access to different user grouping for something that seems more like an administrative task than an actual value-added feature to your site

9572318
google-chrome	safari
but ie9 google-chrome and safari -- the divisions that the tabs are supposed to switch to remain set at display hidden

9572320
keydown	keyup
i can detect keyup and keydown for f10 just fine but when f10 is released the application menu receives focus and the app ignores subsequent function key presses until either a f10 is pressed again or b a non-function key is pressed

9572337
haskell	ocaml
in particular it is widely used in type deduction for example in c++ templates type deduction or in functional language such as scala ocaml haskell type synthesis

simply do nothing in the position setter and for the position getter return the total number of bytes that have been returned from the read method so far just have a private variable of type long to store this

9572536
django-userena	pinax
i was thinking of using the accounts app but django-userena seems better so i created a project zero with pinax and tried to integrate django-userena with it

9572536
django-userena	pinax
but is it easier for me to actually download django-userena demo and use it as a starting point instead of using pinax

9572543
getter	setter
updated the object to include a new string object and getter setter

9572551

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
4 the following css accomplishes what i m looking for in google-chrome firefox and safari on the mac i use for testing

9572685
installation	upgrade
you should be able to share the system directory across all of your ci installation providing a central place for upgrade and using less disk space

9572720
width	height
you can get the image dimensions from javascript and then force positioning them as a background image in a fixed height width div

9572720
width	height
you can grab the height the width via javascript after the image has loaded

9572739
fgets	getchar
edit i would also delete the fflush stdin and replace getchar with fgets

9572743
autodesk	3ds
there currently is no official support of the quicksilver hardware renderer for autodesk products other than 3ds max and 3ds max design

9572743
ati	nvidia
however autocad uses a built-in opengl renderer which is more beneficial when using nvidia quadro or ati firegl gpu s over consumer graphics cards

9572743
autodesk	3ds
many users often install 3ds max in combination with other autodesk or 3d modelling software strictly for final rendering due to its superior rendering tools

9572743
autodesk	3ds
there may be other third-party renderers that i have missed or to come in future releases but 3ds max is always autodesk s first foot forward and despite the learning curve will always have more advantages including gpu accelerated final rendering

9572790
unix	solaris
which works on some unix systems like hpux but not on solaris or linux.

9572797
hide	show
as you can see at several points in the hide show sequence i use deferreds to allow certain events to complete before launching new ones

9572810
min	max
the function changes the value of minval maxval minloc maxloc to correspond to the min max intensity values and locations

9572812
maven	pom.xml

9572816
qtreeview	qabstracttablemodel
i have a window which contains a qtreeview databasetreeview on a subclass of qabstracttablemodel via a qsortfilterproxymodel

however when i get to the part where i sync the celery and kombu tables under the running a worker section i get a bug

9572899
strlen	strcmp
i also get a lot of warnings about how i use strlen and strcmp about the arguments and how i m making a pointer from a int without a cast

9572939
modulus	fractions
i m trying to pass a number that looks like it s a fractions int but because i ve used modulus to check if it s divisible i know will evaluate to an int

9572939
primes	modulus	modulus	fractions
the problem is that when i try this in haskell on the fourth line in my code i run into an issue with passing the number divided by a primes that goes into it - it appears to be a fractions int but because i ve already checked with modulus i know it s going to resolve to a regular int

9573000
for-loop	loops
i embed this in a for-loop and i want to write to the file loops that i am on

9573009
many-to-one	one-to-many
i use -- to illustrate one-to-many and many-to-one since you describe the

9573027
int	double
the operator has type which means that it only works on fractional types like float double and rational and not int

9573080
gridview	repeater
if you don t want to use a gridview you might consider a repeater

9573130
children	parent
there s generally no reason for a parent to fork a single child to do that sort of work but if a parent forks multiple children then that work can be distributed across multiple processors or the multiple units of work can at least be scheduled to make optimal use of one processor is the forked children ever need to wait on i o or for a long-running system call

9573146
slideup	slidedown
applied to your code it gives the following inverting the slideup slidedown to match the condition correctly

9573169
centos	linux
i ve got a very simple java program j.java see below on my application server that successfully connects to an oracle 11.2 database on a database server both servers are linux centos using jdbc thin driver from oracle

9573169
next	except
as you can see from the seturl command in the java code below i ve configured the application and database servers to sit next to each other and they re on the same network cross-cable connected to each other so there s no network traffic on these development boxes except my code

9573234
post	get
then don t run the query yet but use the explain statement to get the query plan and post it here

9573245
domcontentloaded	onload
wrap the method in an onload or domcontentloaded event

a form on my website is not functioning correctly in safari google-chrome

9573333
opera	firefox
it works in ie opera and firefox

binary output for an 8 bit unsigned integer

9573388
sequence	permutation
below is the code this is after i ve done like a hundred of permutation and different sequence of let-do-if and tabulation and i m exhausted

9573394
children	parent
i think that one of the easiest thing to change the background color of the parent frame and all children jpanel could be set the background color of the jframe and then iterate over all the child jpanel and set the background also to them

9573501
cassini	iis
the headers posted here are from the cassini server asp.net development server 10.0.0.0 but i have seen identical results in iis 7 on windows 2008 as well

google-chrome	firefox
in the latest versions of firefox and google-chrome for mac i get the started getstuff... alert then nothing after that

9573516
google-chrome	firefox
i thought xmlhttprequest is supported in google-chrome and firefox

9573522
int	chars
i doubt chars i is the way to go there you should try chars int 0 + i

9573546
post	get
and no i cannot post the whole code as it is an assignment this isn t the goal of the assignment trust me it focuses on data forwarding and more just need to get this basic thing working thank you for help everyone

9573564
for-loop	loops
if you replace your for-loop with jquery s function it should solve the problem not because there s anything magical about but just because that encapsulates each iteration of loops in a separate function call which means your variables gallerytitle and the others will be captured in separate closures and thus retain their correct values after loops is finished

9573571
textview	imageview
hi have a app with a actionbar sherlock and a listview that shows 1 imageview and 2 textview but the actionbar blocks the first row in listview

9573603
tolower	toupper
use tolower or toupper before comparing characters

9573603
fflush	gets	fgets	strcmp
the c language which uses fgets gets fflush strcmp has many issues in this area

9573614
capistrano	bundler
i m using rails 3.2.1 bundler 1.0.22 capistrano 2.11.2

9573620

in the example below i m using a string properties accessor on zipfile to get a zip file named somefile.txt

9573629
organization	naming
i have somehow turned into the person to oversee my organization s sharepoint and i have been tasked with finding a way that when a file is uploaded to any of our document libraries the file name of said file is either prepended appended with a date or random string in an effort to prevent naming collisions

9573698
post	get
when the formset comes back in the post i get the data like so

9573729
taskkill	processbuilder
but if tasklist works for you you can use processbuilder in order to run the windows command taskkill

9573729
taskkill	processbuilder
call taskkill like this with a processbuilder instance cmd c taskkill pid pid replace pid with the actual pid

9573769
struts	wicket
we have nearly 1 000 screens with our core financial services application and although wicket looks great it is extremely difficult to convert our struts 1.3 code to wicket

9573784
put	get
the tasks now properly time out and i can get the data by prerender time - and i can easily genericize this and put it on any page i need this functionality

9573804
button	checkbox
currently i have a button click event which takes the datakey from a row in a datagrid via a checkbox and assigns it to an int variable to update an individual in a databsse

9573804
button	checkbox
here is my button click event so far which is working for 1 checkbox selected

9573818
getter	setter
so i managed to optimise the code since i figured what was causing the bottleneck was the ruby - js communication which happened each time was being executed which is all the time since ruby uses getter and setter methods for classes or when objects were being passed directly between languages

9573826
repo	egit
you can tell egit to point to a local git repo from the git repositories view

9573826
repo	egit
once egit knows where your repo is it can import projects from that repo

9573844
winpcap	wireshark
although i can see traffic being sent by a and received by b wireshark and winpcap shows no activity on any network adapter

9573847
int	chars
here you have every bit of chars stored in int array which means 4bytes for 1bit

9573855
portrait	landscape
when i m starting the app in portrait mode and change the orientation to landscape

9573855
portrait	landscape
when i m starting the app in landscape mode and change the orienation to portrait mode press then the back button results in a slide animation from right to left like closing an activity and shows the home activity again

9573855
portrait	landscape
so it s like the landscape and the portrait mode are treated like two different activities

9573855
portrait	landscape
i don t use so an orientation change should follow the normal android activity lifecycle and destroy the old portrait or landscape version of the activity

9573855
onstart	ondestroy	oncreate	onstart	oncreate	ondestroy	onresume	onpause
in myfragmentactivity i just do some logging tracking stuff in oncreate onrestart onstart onsaveinstancestate onpause onresume onstop ondestroy by calling some static methods of a tracking class which just holds a reference to the application context

9573858
width	height
i have a big image about 14848 px width 14336 px height i used deep-zoom tool and exported the files to silverlight and used a multi scale image control

9573926
serializable	deserialization
the time required for serializable deserialization of each session object is going to increase more or less linearly with the size of the object

9573931
respond.js	modernizr
the source code for this polyfill is here and including it out-of-the-box will make things easier to keep updated and allow for smaller file compression for those already including it via modernizr or otherwise if you are you can delete it from respond.js

9573940
children	parent
i did a left outer join assuming that some parent might exist that have no children

9573974
apache	nginx
i was playing with this earlier i have apache and nginx and testing both on my server

9573984

tablea id int match chars 15 multiple chars 10

9574023
binutils	bfd
i made a symlinks for ld opcodes bfd gas gprof and binutils in the gcc source folder to get this output.

9574023
mpfr	mpc	binutils	mpc
i built gmp v5.0.4 mpfr v3.1.0 and mpc v0.9 using gcc v4.2.1 installing them in the same prefix as used in the gcc and binutils configure

9574023
mpfr	mpc
for each configure i am explicitly stating the locations of gmp mpfr and mpc

9574023
mpfr	mpc
i built gmp mpfr and mpc separately from gcc doing so resulted in some build errors

9574023
mpfr	mpc	binutils	mpc
gcc binutils gmp mpfr and mpc are all build in a separate directory which is not a subdirectory of the source directory as recommended by the gcc installation instructions

9574023
binutils	bfd
make symlinks to the main gcc src directory for ld gas binutils opcodes gprof bfd

9574023
binutils	bfd
and gcc found most of them as stated before i put symlinks in the gcc directory for ld opcodes bfd gas gprof and binutils my actual problem here is telling the configure script to compile a new assembler and linker

9574034
getter	setter
in your node class java naming conventions the same way that setter should be prefixed with set getter should be prefixed with get nextitem should really be getnextitem

9574061
daemon	cron
there s a cron job that runs the daemon every 5 minutes

9574118
udp	tcp
when doing a lot of transaction based connections and having issues with tcp s time_wait state duration which last 2msl 120 seconds leading to no more connections available for a client host toward a special server host you should consider udp and managing yourself the re-sending of lost requests

9574118
udp	tcp
as a consequence the dns server send a udp reply with a dedicated flag raised in order to ask the client to use tcp this time

9574202
int	double
from experience i always keep the interface to simple types like int double etc i did also use string in the interface and simply converted to std string using code that s easy to find on the internet

9574235
portrait	landscape
this video would need to be able to be viewed in portrait and landscape mode so it will need to autoresize on deviceoriantation

9574235
portrait	landscape
but all the images can only be viewed in portrait mode and if the device is in landscape mode they are still displayed in portrait mode so they dont adapt to the layout

9574235
portrait	landscape
or should i be locking the movie so that when its in landscape mode you cant scroll and you have to return it to portrait mode

9574235
portrait	landscape
i know a lot of apps lock to portrait or landscape

9574256
slider	supersized
i ve adapted the supersized slider to work with wp e-commerce to create a featured product slider

9574277
super	implements
if you are going to have different user types than you might try implements a super sub type design

9574278
width	height
instead you can set one vertical property top or bottom one horizontal property left or right and then set both height and width to 100

9574294
fold	catamorphism
the catamorphism for lists is better known as a fold

9574294
fold	catamorphism
earlier i said that the catamorphism for a list is called fold but cata doesn t look much like a fold at the moment

9574368
for-loop	loops
this is not allowed because a generate for-loop creates an implicit localparam statement for loops variable and elaborates the items in loops based only on that localparam

9574373
pull	push
to get around that you can work on specific branches or set up an intermediate bare repository on either mac which you then git push to from othermac and git pull from from imac and vice-versa

9574385
width	height
if you can you assume that all of your columns above are fixed width except for the first column where product.name is used and your font style is the same then you can use the following method instead of checking the table height border

9574402
ubuntu	debian
r as well as r-cran-rjava and r-cran-rserve are available for debian and ubuntu as part of the basic distribution

9574473
inherited	subclassing
i m just wondering if i could create some kind of subclassing which would inherited instance variables so i could move out some of the code

9574492
post	get
i was very surprised that the ajax call would post get to the server which i was able to verify by looking at the server log but that the response was never read

9574518
int	double
this is for historical reasons because iirc matlab originally didn t have support for int at all so all numeric constants in matlab produce double values and the promotion rules were created to make it possible to mix int types with floating-point constants

9574518
int	double
to fix this explicitly convert those int types to double before concatenating

9574525
postgresql	mysql
i m not as familiar postgresql as mysql but looking at the psql documentation it looks like you can pass in the command to run using -c parameter

9574542
bmp	png
if that does not work try saving as png instead of bmp

9574548
children	parent
i have 2 tables parent and children

9574548
children	parent
in the children table there is a column called parent whose value is the primary id of a row in the parent table

9574559
sublimetext	aptana
actually figured this one out myself by accident - was researching another code editor called sublimetext and read this article which if you scroll down to the 6th section explains that the terminology for these vertical linkages is indent guides. and also it appears that this feature is not available for aptana - too bad

9574571
width	height
adjust the width and height to the actual pixel dimensions for your image

9574578
post	get
once you get the response you can check that application s id in post is matching your application

9574580
pop-up	dialog
a second later two dialog boxes will pop-up in the active dialog confirm that the two keys involved in the drag and drop process are actually p.ks in their respective tables and press o.k

9574582
onmouseover	onclick
i tried with onmouseover onclick onblur etc

9574583
try-catch	exception-handling
disclaimer i know try-catch blocks but i need to process exception-handling dynamicaly

9574589
min	max
uniformly distributed between min and max inclusive

9574599
content-disposition	content-type
also bear in mind that content-type header should be before content-disposition

however whenever i enter a value greater than the upper limit of unsigned integer uint_max the program displays 3435973836

9574844
google-chrome	firefox
as the attached images shows firefox and google-chrome tends to tighten the width in 11px but not in 14px

9574866
vim	textmate
i am making the switch to vim from textmate and i wanted to know what should be included in my .vimrc to get the similar behavior for

9574912
integer	unsigned
checking if an unsigned integer is 0 or uint_max is pointless since it can never reach that value

9574921
operands	scalar
the left operands should be a string and the right operands should be a tuple with the same number of elements as there are format specifiers in the string a scalar value will work if there is only one format specifier

9574953
vim	textmate
if you re moving from textmate to vim i would try installing janus and thoroughly reading the documentation

9575024
unsigned	short

prepare	execute
mssql_execute execute a prepare statement not a string containing a sql statement which is the function of mssql_query

9577714
prepare	execute
you will need to prepare a statement bind parameters into it and execute it

9577714
prepare	execute
although it would be possible to execute your stored procedure by building a sql string and sending it to mssql_query doing so is not recommended when a prepare statement can be used

9578272
lisp	scheme
there are two primary dialects of lisp common lisp and scheme

9578272
lisp	scheme
however both common lisp and scheme are standardized and the standards define a certain baseline of features which you can expect any implementation to have

9578272
lisp	scheme
if you want to understand lisp you re better off first learning either common lisp or scheme

9578272
lisp	scheme
you can easily learn common lisp after you know scheme

9578272
lisp	scheme
common lisp has many good libraries out there scheme less so but it pales in comparison to the vast amount of library support available for java or python

9578272
scheme	racket
if you want to get started i recommend downloading racket a highly popular implementation of scheme

9578272
lisp	scheme
though originally developed as a teaching language it comes with a very large standard library more characteristic of common lisp than of scheme

9578287
post	get
i spent a while attempting to get my code to display correctly in this post but it keeps breaking

9578359
setinterval	settimeout
setinterval is much more suited for countdown timers and things you need to run continually since settimeout only runs once and you need to keep on calling it

9578360

this will use get for pull and post for all pushes read create update delete

9578612
int	double
i could be wrong about this but this could be a precision error arising from the fact that js numbers are represented as ieee double and the number that you re describing is so large that it might actually be out of the range of int values representable exactly with ieee double

9578612
int	double
according to this earlier answer the largest int representable exactly by an ieee double with no gaps in the representable int is 2 53 which is about 10 14

9578617
put	get
either way you ll never get a form to accept a focus event unless you first put a tabindex on it but if an input based field gets focus first it will never bubble

9578624

the reason that you should not do a custom subclass is that uinavigationcontroller instantiates it s uinavigationbar directly and you cannot tell it to use your subclass

9578639
integer	unsigned
for certain hash functions in java it would be nice to see the value as an unsigned integer for comparison to other implementations but java supports only signed types

9578712
int	double
output is brown over fox quick quick dog brown the brown lazy brown 3 0 3 1 1 0.8 0.8 0.8 0.8 0.8 so it works for string and int but doesn t for double same value each time

9582015
width	height
when you ll resize the form that control will keep its height but it ll resize to keep its margins so if you ll make the form wider its width will be increased

9582151
getter	setter
now a property is just shorthand for declaring two methods - a setter and a getter

9582151
getter	setter
a property is usually not always backed by an instance variable and if you have the compiler write the setter getter for you by using synthesize then the backing variable pre xcode 4.4 has the same name as the property

9582151
getter	setter
instructs the compiler to write the setter getter but to use the variable foo_ as the backing variable

9582151
getter	setter
so the difference is that foo is the name of a property and used either in dot notation myclassinstance.foo or less usually by directly calling the setter or getter

9582151
getter	setter
if you ve written you own custom setter getter or if you are using manual memory management and synthesized retain or copy properties the difference is huge as foo_ by passes the setter getter and hence the custom code or the synthesized memory management code

9582157
stdout	fflush
if you call fflush stdout

9582179
iboutlet	ibaction
you need to declare the button in the controller like you did as an ibaction and this time declare this as an outlet iboutlet

9582292
fseek	ftell
another approach typically used as long as you know the file isn t being updated is to use fseek ftell to seek to the end of the file get the position wich will tell you its size then seek back to the start

9582326
ready	each
an idea could be creating an array of deferred to use inside every ready function except the last one resolving each one when the snippet has completed

9582523
viewmodel	caliburn.micro
when you have a contentcontrol in a view with the same name as a viewmodel property on your parent viewmodel then caliburn.micro will locate the view of the corresponding viewmodel inject it into the contentcontrol and bind up the view viewmodel

since to write both setter and getter methods for one property like this is just too much work

9585986
post	get
most of the complexity of creating the params map in play is due to combining post get route etc.

9586026
getter	setter
if the setter and getter do nothing else than accessing an underlying real attribute then the simplest way of implementing them is not to write setter and getter at all

9586026
getter	setter
you don t need getter and setter to ensure encapsulation in the case your access logic changes to something different than the standard access mechanics later since introducing a property won t break your interface

getter	setter
usually you don t write setter getter at all

getter	setter
you will need a getter setter for the id parameter

9592576
getter	setter
you would need a getter setter for the entityid string in my case

9592608
superclass	subclassing
as a generalisation an instantiable class should only depend on itself and its superclass never subclassing

9592608
superclass	subclassing
there are possible exceptions to this where a superclass may need to know about its subclassing but this is probably an indication of poor design due to the generally undesirable coupling

9592620
margin	height
height - returns the height of element excludes padding border and margin

9592620
margin	height
.innerheight - returns the height of element includes padding but excludes border and margin

9592675
post	get
i am trying to post photo from my server to facebook but i get strange error

9592751
accessor	properties	google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox optimize the properties accessor to be as efficient as copying the length to a local variable

9592792
webchromeclient	webviewclient
when you have a webview you can set a webchormeclient or a webviewclient the webchromeclient will be similar to your chrome desktop browser

9592792
webchromeclient	webviewclient
to sum up the webchromeclient is easier to use but the webviewclient allows you more configuration

9592814
apache	nginx
the entire nginx community recommends using php-fpm and in general ditching apache

9592814
apache	nginx
you re statement that everyone uses apache behind nginx is a naive one and false as well

if i post the data and put a break point inside the postvoucher method i get the data for id and tableid but products is null

9592843
folder	directory
your static resources should go in your apps static folder or a completely new and different directory not media_root or static_root

9592862
width	height
facebook says the image must be at least 50x50 and no greater than 3.0 1 width height aspect ratio

tex	mathjax
i am using mathjax to render some tex code from a static html file

9592941
width	height
java.awt.rectangle x 8 y 28 width 664 height 388

9592956
width	height	portrait	landscape
when the device shifts from portrait landscape or the desktop window resized the event will be called and you can manually set the height and width of your elements

9593003
post	get
i have a query to get the users friends and one to get all post users have posted as statuses now i need to combine them

9593008
portrait	landscape
to detect when a mobile phone is portrait or landscape use orientation for instance

9593025
inherited	subclassing
if i understand your inherited hierarchy correctly the type in the where seems to be iqmuser the base class while the is implemented on the subclassing user

9593097
int	chars
i have to set each chars in a string to an int so that i can sum their values

9593118
for-loop	arrays
instead in your template you could iterate over the arrays in a for-loop and traverse the dictionary to the username and category keys

9593139
int	chars
chars are usually represented internally by int so can be assigned to an int

9593139
int	chars
if you have chars 1 and want to store int 1 then you can do

9593142
getter	setter
as i want this is auto for quick fix ctrl-1 - create setter and getter .

9593148
int	chars
yes -- in c and c++ chars is just a small int type typically with a range from -128 to +127

9593184
addclass	removeclass
then you can addclass or removeclass the class with jquery you can even toggleclass

9593217
google-chrome	safari
i downloaded the originally transparent image and tested with it in google-chrome safari and iphone

9593218
folder	directory
for example my own private scripts reside in the private folder which is in the same directory as the var www directory and are accessed via include .. private script.php

9593219
hide	show
if the user clicks on the complete radio box its should show the application_complete box else hide it

9593228
int	double
from what i ve seen there has been some success passing the type of an object the custom attribute expected a new instance of a custom object but i m primarily looking at simple data types string int double and perhaps generic collections list dictionary etc.

9593252
post	put
if necessary you can send a running server a post with json data containing a new configuration which then gets put into effect by the view handling the post request

9593259
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
-the blue line does not appear in the most recent versions of firefox google-chrome ie or safari

9593359
folder	directory
look in select a directory folder on your drive

9593374
inherited	subclassing
you can also do this in viewdidload a uiwebview is a subclassing of uiview and inherited all its methods

9593384
accessor	properties
your class has to have a constructor and if you have at least one properties you can get accessor and mutators as a shortcut

9593384
getter	setter
now you can add add getter and setter automatically if you have a constructor and if you have variables for initializing

9593404
folder	directory
i could write a php program that read a directory process each file and when done transfer it into another folder

9593431
folder	directory
deleted all files that were auto-created from these directory and then reproduced the folder structure and all files into the project from the sdk version of the support4demo

9593453
springsource	grails
on my local machine i m using springsource tool suite an eclipse branch with integrated groovy and grails compatibility as well as egit

9593477
filesystems	hfs+
x which is unix-based but uses a default filesystems type hfs+ that

9593524
libs	buildpath
so far i have created a java project added the jar file as an external jar to the buildpath and then have attached the folder containing the jni libs using properties - java build path - libs tab expand the jar file containing the class files and edit native libs location

9593562
h.264	webm
the 3 main formats for html5 are ogg h.264 and webm

9593562
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
unfortunately there s no one format that works on all major browsers msie firefox google-chrome safari so the solution is

9593569
children	parent
group those children by their parent

9593569
children	parent
because if the size of the group is equal to names.length all names have been found assuming no two children of a parent have the same name

9593569
children	parent
if you need to do more with the parent like paging or fetching the children you could split this problem into a sub query note that the line is not required it s just an example what you can further do with the query

9593586
width	height
for example database username passwords paths thumbnail height width etc .

9593611
jar	war
you will always need a version number for a project however it is possible to change the name of the generated package jar war ear etc. through the element in the pom

9593616
istream	getline
if you want to find out if std istream getline read an array full of characters as demanded but not an end of line character you need to figure out whether the number of stored characters minus the terminating null is identical to the extracted characters

9593616
istream	getline
actually looking more closely at the spec std istream getline actually sets std ios_base failbit if it doesn t encounter a newline while reading the character it also sets std ios_base failbit when no character is read but it doesn t set std ios_base failbit if at least one character is read before end of file is reached

9593628
google-chrome	firefox
this works when using ie and google-chrome but does not work in firefox

9593645
rss	feed
in order to get the rss feed for a repository you first have to watch the repository you re interested in

9593645
rss	feed
now if you need to use an external rss reader or similar you should find a news feed link on the main github page that will take you to an aggregated rss feed of any and all interesting things happening in your watched repositories

9593716
mouseleave	mouseenter
what i am trying to do is to create a function where on mouseenter will flip the image and on mouseleave the image will flip back to original state

9593720
istream	getline
istream getline sets the streams failbit flag if the line is too long

9593747
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
firefox google-chrome opera all look right just not in ie

9593750
pop-up	dialog
based on what you want to do with this i d imagine you could do something like pop-up a dialog as a system level alert which needs a password to make it go away

9593780
writetofile	nsdata	nsstring	nsdata
but the second problem in your code is that if your budget class is not a property list type nsstring nsdata nsarray or nsdictionary objects writetofile will not save it sucessfully

9593811
put	get
one way to get the url to stay as the one a user typed in instead of showing up as your subdomain is to put the whole site in a frame that loads your subdomain inside of it

9593813
min	max
name vectorposition type min max avg med ..

9593818
puts	gets
it gets data from items of a certain type and puts it into custom xml

9593832
cos	sin
s and c are sin and cos values for an angle passed into the function as it is called

9593851
strdup	strncpy	strcpy	strdup	strcpy	strncpy
if you cannot use strdup i would recommend the use of strncpy instead of strcpy

9593851
strcpy	malloc
so use strcpy or strncp with a pre-sized array or a malloc -ed pointer

9593861
mouseover	mouseenter
edit i apologize i mis-read your previous code i saw mouseenter when it is mouseover

9593861
google-chrome	safari
this page is functional in all modern browsers but is extra cool in webkit-based browsers google-chrome safari - you could mimic a similar behavior by having a basic hover and extending that for browsers that support it

9593864
punctuation	words
finally you iterate through the sentences of set 1 and in each sentence through the candidate starting positions of relevant tokens probably only words that follow white space or punctuation and search the suffix array of set 2 for them

9593919
for-loop	arrays
i then have a for-loop which is runs data from another arrays

9593929
inherited	subclassing
it is much easier to use child-parent relationship with inherited super and subclassing

9593929
super	extends
well you could say that when you import a package you are going to extends some of its classes and in this way it would be most super parent

9594035
button	checkbox
i am trying to click a checkbox that enables a purchase button to appear

9594057
onchange	onkeyup
just bind a listener to the onkeyup and onchange events for the that runs a function that creates the right kind of mailto link

9594074
post	get
this could be an artifact of me doing a get instead of a post of course

9594084
post	get
on a side note if i click on the submit button again after the first post and without refreshing the page i get this message

9594084
post	put
so not sure why my form is converting the method from post to put

9594096
bitblt	gdi
edit fixed i created a compatibledc for the graphics object and a handle for the bitmap using b.gethbitmap then used the selectobject function inside gdi to select those two and used the compatibledc instead of hdc in the bitblt function

9594102
x86	64bit
on a windows 64bit machine echo programfiles x86 does print c program files x86

9594107
xrange	enumerate
enumerate is more pythonic but xrange is fine here too

9594108
post	get
i am using the mediawiki api mentioned in the post from felipe to get the needed information

9594119
bash	tcsh
to be extra sure that you don t have any x11 dependencies run unset display for bash or unsetenv display for tcsh in your xterm before you test your command line

9594125
hash	salt
this code is supposed to hash a password with a salt

9594125
hash	salt
the salt and hash password are being saved in the database

9594164
getter	setter
it seems confusing when you show people that they can easily create attributes by setting var or val in constructor and not care about getter and setter they can change if they need to ultimately find that in fact you should avoid using those kind of facilitations

9594192
google-chrome	safari
it works fine on current browser versions of google-chrome android 2.2+ and mobile safari but not displaying at all on blackberry versions 5 6 windows mobile mobile ie 7 and android browser 2.1

9594231
ravendb	couchdb
this is not something specific to ravendb as you can do those things with mongodb and couchdb as well so probably the most intrinsic difference among those databases is that raven gives you a very nice and easy .net experience and has out-of-the-box multi document transactions

9594245
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
as you need object i o just use an objectinputstream and objectoutputstream for everything

9594245
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
you must construct the objectoutputstream before the objectinputstream at both ends

9594245
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
use the same objectinputstream and objectoutputstream for the life of the socket at both ends

9594301
min	max
for the performance comparison i ve been using one of the built in jmeter listeners that show average min max response time and average bytes per each request

9594314
super	extends
there are extends and super keywords to define bounds for java generics

9594332
udp	tcp
the server identifies client-a from the token and forwards the request to client-b over its tcp link including a s udp address port number in the request

9594332
udp	tcp
the server identifies client-b from the token and forwards the request to client-a over its tcp link including b s udp address port number in the request

9594332
udp	tcp
as you can see the server never talks on the udp links created by the clients for their requests only on the tcp links

9594356
strtol	atoi
your way could be extended to handle more than one digit but i think that what you re really looking for is atoi or the non-deprecated strtol

9594393
explode	substr
suggestion explode your string on the space character get the first and last values in the array by index then use substr to fetch the characters you require

9594443
explode	substr
the optional parameter indicates into how many pieces the string should be explode to and considering what you want to achieve along with substr

9594444
google-chrome	safari
this behavior only occurs in google-chrome and safari

9594444
google-chrome	safari
when i open an offline version on my computer using both google-chrome and safari it works fine

9594446
bufferedreader	objectinputstream
a serialized object should be read with objectinputstream not bufferedreader or indeed anything else whatsoever

9594467
higher-order-functions	combinators
it is based on combinators which are higher-order-functions that use only function application and earlier defined combinators to define a result from its arguments

9594530
sortedmap	sortedset
the only collections that implement ordering are sortedmap and sortedset and neither of those puts a bound on the type parameter

9594553
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it displays fine with ie7+ firefox google-chrome but not safari

9594577
post	get
having the db choose a random post per request can get expensive so i don t want to pick a row on every request

9594607
equals	compareto
you should not need compareto because this would give you a definition of the ordering of the elements though it can tell you if two objects are equals

9594615
for-loop	arrays
i am currently returning an arrays and running a for-loop through it

9594671
post	get
i have seen some examples of apicontroller actions named other than get post etc for example here i see an example of an action called getorder

9594685
put	get
where i m stuck is how to get these standard views and put the desired text in the right sub-views with i guess view.findviewbyid

9594718
post	get
i noticed in another post to add -lboost_system to the other linker flags but when i do this i get - libboost_system.dylib file was built for unsupported file format which is not the architecture being linked i386

9594756
lisp	racket
i like common lisp but clojure and racket are not to be sneezed at either

9594783
min	max
other basic linear algebra functions missing in symbolic math toolbox are norm cond max min sort lu qr chol schur

9594799
qtextedit	qtreeview
i have a qtreeview qlistview and qtextedit set next to one another in a column like format

9594914
post	get
to get everything that is sent post to your apache server via your test.php file you can use

9594920
put	get
for instance when using canvascontext obtained through the getcontext 2d on the canvas element you can get and put image data which is basically a collection of pixels represented by 4 bytes each rgba

9594920
width	height
that means that you end up with an array of length width height 4

9594948
put	get
note i believe i need to search for a string using strpos and then get the line number and take the whole line and put it in the string

9594970
folder	directory
and i want is the my web clients can access my resources in that folder but they can t do a directory listing.

9595001
apache	nginx
you should be able to do this with apache or nginx and possibly iis if configured correctly

9595108
hash	salt
if it doesn t create difficulties you can get slightly more efficient storage in your database by storing the salt and hash password as raw bytes rather than hex strings

9595127
int	chars
program should initialize an empty list and then prompt user for an int and keep prompting for int adding each int to the list until the user enters a single period chars

9595127
min	max
i can t figure out how to get the min and max returned from each function separately

9595166
mouseup	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown
the mousedown mouseup mousemove override will not trigger because it hovers into different controls

9595177
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
web developer toolbar documentation is available for google-chrome opera internet explorer 8+ safari and firefox

9595189
width	height
set image.onload event to create svgimage element with src width height copied from image

9595192
children	parent
i m trying to compare the window s hash to the title attributes of the div s anchor children and then click the parent of the anchor who matches

9595211
width	height
i know the height and width as well as each pixel value from x y location that i want a qimage to be

9595296
width	height
i have a grid of absolutely positioned elements whose height width and position top and left are a percentage of their container s

9595296
margin	height	width	height	width	margin
essentially on mouseenter the box would increase in height and width and decrease its top and left margin to pop out of the page

9595296
google-chrome	firefox
as is it works like a dream on google-chrome on firefox you should see stuttering and on ie even more stuttering

9595323
width	height
putting percentages in the height and width attributes is not strictly copacetic though

9595329
post	get
so my question is how do i get the user to authorize my app so i can post to their wall

9595336
windows	winpe
windows os and winpe 3.0 environment

9595423
min	max
but you ended up doing too much with your max and min functions

9595423
min	max
again a misleading part was that assignment is that it suggested you write a custom routine for these functions even though max and min exist in python and return exactly what you need

9595423
min	max
its another story if you are required to write your own max and min and are not permitted to use the built in functions

9595423
min	max
that should hopefully be enough general information for you to piece together your custom min and max functions

9595423
min	max
while there are some more advanced and efficient ways to do min and max i think to start out a simple for-loop over the list would be easiest

9595457
width	height
i am using eclipse and it seems that everybody works with controls by adding positioning and width height by code i find that a pain in the a

9595487
cpython	ironpython
we are using python for .net over ironpython since we want access to the full range of cpython libraries matplotlib among others

9595547
floating-point	integer
if you want to avoid this rounding you should avoid floating-point arithmetic altogether by casting the operands to integer

9595562
gtk	pygobject
since pygobject binding is virtually the same than the c api because the introspection technology i suggest to use gtkcellrenderer present in gtk

9595596
width	height
first i call imageprocessing.rgbtobitmap data width height

9595599
setinterval	settimeout
my only guess is that the browser itself get s itself into some weird state where it doesn t run standard inbuilt browser functions neither settimeout or setinterval worked for me but both the javascript functions did exist

9595665
free	malloc	free	realloc	realloc	malloc
java doesn t give the programmer direct access to memory therefore no pointers no malloc no free no realloc etc

9595696
post	get
i have search hi and low read many different post and tutorials but yet i can t seem to figure out how to get my images to save in a database

9595696
put	get
it seems that every time i attempt to put an image into the database it causes the database to not be created and then i get a force close

9595706
ubuntu	debian	debian-based	ubuntu
since you are on a debian based system see this article which explains the correct way to set up multiple hosts on debian its the same if you are on other debian-based systems like the various ubuntu flavors

9595711
oledbcommand	sqlcommand
this example is actually using the oledbcommand but the syntax is similar for the sqlcommand

9595721
int	double
in cases where i have seen int or double being compared this first style seemed much better to me personally

9595738
typedef	struct
but the typedef types cannot be forward declared as class struct

9595749
touchesbegan	touchesended
instead of uirotationgesturerecognizer detect the tap events directly using touchesbegan withevent and touchesended withevent

9595752
post	get
you can just redefine the isnew function for that model to get backbone to do a post but that seems like a hack

9595763
post	get
if called via get it displays a login form that post to the same

9595766
hide	show
the show hide forgot password form suddenly stopped working

9595790
touchesmoved	touchesended
which depends on touchesmoved withevent and touchesended withevent

9595807
udp	tcp
with sockets tcp and udp you re essentially sending the data over the internet to yourself

9595807
udp	tcp
tcp is guaranteed to be in order and has a bunch of other nice features while udp is pretty much slap some headers onto the data and hope for the best

9595822
post	get
i already have the following two functions but i don t know how to combine them so that i can send post data and get the response

9595822
post	get
so i need to know how to combine them so that i can get the response after sending post data

9595826
width	height
in my case i have a scrollview with a fixed width to device size and variable height

9595859
width	height
the header image should extend the whole width of an a4 page be 300px in height

9595859
width	height
the footer image should extend the whole width of the page be 664px in height

9595859
width	height
both images dont need to be resized they are already the whole width of the page the correct height

9595886
ssl	https
if https is not listed then curl was not built with ssl support and you cannot use https

9595887
post	get
with any links on the text i get a double post one on top of the other like this

9595889
outputstream	inputstream
so just now i decided to google gwt inputstream outputstream and there are some opensource projects out there from whom you could borrow steal some code to achieve your life long fulfilling goal of emulating client-server file io thro gwt

9595902
google-chrome	firefox
the following works in google-chrome wonderfully but in ie and firefox

9595906
google-chrome	firefox
i tried the website you posted with firefox and google-chrome both latest version on os x

9595937
udp	tcp
you usually resort to udp as a speed optimization when tcp is not fast enough and packet loss is inconvenient rather than when it can t be handled

9595948
google-chrome	firefox
i would be wonder if there is any way to have dropdown verb menu for firefox and google-chrome

9595974
profiling	debugging
if you want to test application on device then you need to create debugging profiling for it

9596011
folder	directory
now navigate to the directory where your project is stored and go to the folder called dist

9596020
mouse	keyboard
note that mouse buttons are treated like keyboard keys

9596025
width	height
our idea is that when someone access our app form mobile browser like iphone android windows phone - they can view full width and full height

9596025
width	height
but when someone access from a regular desktop browser and it s width more than 800 px we need to re-size our app both width and height

9596025
width	height
i d tried thousands of time for re-sizing width and height and able to re-sized width but can t re-sized height

9596097
google-chrome	firefox
the system works perfectly on google-chrome and firefox

9596104
try-catch	exception-handling
for #3 either define exception-handling clauses to catch explicit exception-handling thrown by your bean methods ordervalidateexception enrichexception etc. or use inline try-catch blocks around each step in your route i prefer the first approach myself

9596142
children	parent
create those 3 children with a parent that don t have any parent itself because my json doesn t return infos about the parent s parent

9596142
children	parent
create the 2 other children with a as parent probably because of the way it s sorted but that doesn t change the conclusion so a parent that does have a parent

so in short always specify base when using parseint
