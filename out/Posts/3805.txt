10573093
udp	tcp
after i threw out every thing to do with stl everything works fine tcp and udp

10573093
rtp	rtsp
a little off-topic inside the live555 there are at least 20 bugs and the most fatal errors are they used unblocked rtp over tcp therefore most packets are get lost before they reach the network interface and at rtsp client the rtp tcp socket will never get the packets which are lost in the network interface and then a rtsp session enters into endless receiving loop it hangs

10573195
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie8

10573350
google-chrome	firefox
for reference browse this page on google-chrome and firefox please click here

10573394
width	height
if you want the final frame to have the size of your original frame in this example with a width of 200 and a height of 250 then you will have to scale the resulting frame

10573394
width	height
of course you could put your uiimageview inside another uiview which will have a non-rotated frame with a width of 200 and a height of 250 but that would just be superficial since it won t really change the fact that a rotated rectangle has a different width and height than the original

10573406
gridview	sqldatasource
i have a gridview and sqldatasource to bind data from datatable to the gridview

10573411
profiling	instrumentation
as with other performance optimizations you should generally only add additional autorelease pools to your code if you notice high memory usage and profiling using instrumentation for example leads you to additional autorelease pools as a solution

10573411
for-loop	loops
so if you re creating lots of temporary objects in each iteration of a for-loop in your code the default autorelease pool won t be drained until after your entire loops has run meaning all the temporary objects you create can add up to a high temporary memory usage sometimes called the high water mark

10573418
gridview	sqldatasource
i ve created a gridview component on the default.aspx for the employee and bound it to the database table with an sqldatasource

for-loop	loops
your where clause doesn t mention sessionalmarks so each time you loops through your for-loop you re updating all rows in that table

10573509
width	height
you may also need to set the container the body and html to height 100 and perhaps the width as well

10573510
sorting	grouping
the problem i have is that because these are all in the same table and the date column is sorting by date the companies that are listed as active get grouping together either at the beginning or end of the list but in reverse chronologial order

10573662
queue	fifo
i ve been doing some research looking for a sane solution i read a bit about queue systems such as gearman and rabbitmq but a fifo system would not work for me either the order in which the events are added is irrelevant since it s perfectly possible one adds an event to fire in 1 hour and right after another that is supposed to trigger in 10 seconds

the element may change width therefore i cannot use the css method of margin 0 auto

10573782
inherited	subclassing
or if you re using a custom subclassing have you updated the header file for your subclassing to inherited from spmanagedobject instead of nsmanagedobject

10573782
inherited	subclassing
if you re manually adding the simperiumkey attribute to a model for example to micromanage your tables inherited from spmanagedobject you may also need to manually add the simperiumkey and ghostdata variables to your custom subclassing if you have one

10573828
google-chrome	safari
this only happens in webkit browsers google-chrome and safari

10573846

changed put to post everywhere

10574374
post	put
however it still fails if i revert to using post instead of put and the browser ends up on for some reason

10574374
post	put
it also fails when put ting or post ing with ajax see code above

10574386
pull	push
i prefer console to do frequently actions like push pull add and others

10574389
post	get
to retrieve it use node.js to decode get and post parameters

10574430
getter	setter
therefore if you want to access cube outside main you still need getter and setter

10574440

in your user folder open the matplotlib directory

10574504
int	double
what i want is to combine these two methods into one generic method that alongwith string str receives parameter t as well so that if i want to use getdoublevalue method i can use double for the parameter t and if i want to use getintvalue method i can use int for the parameter t

10574586
x86	64bit
x86 64bit

10574631
int	double
as you see you can not restrict where t to double or int32 that s why you probably have struct on that place int and double are not struct

10574631
int	double
you should either typecheck t and throw an exception if it s either double nor int like in answer by ie

10574631
int	double
box double or int result into it and implement implicit conversion into double or int

10574640
min	max
however if you d like the groups be persistent so items don t move from one group to another use min instead of max

10574649

pycrypto supports pkcs#1 in the sense that it can read in x509 subjectpublickeyinfo objects that contain an rsa public key encoded in pkcs#1

10574723

instead the data encoded in your key is a pure rsapublickey object that is an asn.1 sequence with two integers modulo and public exponent

10574786

problem i am seeing all default methods like gethashcode gettype and tostring in vba but not the ones which are part of the com interface and specifically written to be com visible like getstringvalue below

10574979
pop-up	dialog
everything works nicely except that the browser chrome in this case after a while pop-up a dialog telling that the script being debugged is stuck and providing options for killing it

10574984
submit	submission
i want to do this without submission my micropost form meaning without clicking the main submit button for the form

10575000
rss	feed
in the end i found a new example and wrote this tutorial it parses a rss feed but the same principles apply for any xml

10575018
getter	setter
if you want to access the property from an other instance than create a getter and setter or declare the property public

10575022
post	get
try with 500 or more you will get maximum post

10575022
post	get
you wont get 500 post every time but will get above 490 post in general

10575022
post	get
some post get filtered by various reasons like privacy blocked user not suitable for specific region and other things

10575040
tostring	gethashcode
note how the gethashcode gettype and tostring methods are visible

10575061
post	get
ok i ve searched far and wide and can t find a solution that i can get working...so i decided to post here

10575079
rss	feed
i have an rss feed for my podcast and essentially what i am trying to do is populate an html5 audio player with urls within the rss feed

10575079
rss	feed
i am struggling to figure out exactly why the code below is not working for me basically at this stage i simply want to append the url s within the rss feed into the #results to show that its working then i will add it to the src part of the audio player

10575135
int	chars
example name field will be storing chars string literal and hance can t be int type and has to be string type which in sql is chars or varchar or nvarchar

10575140
tiff	dng
format dng should follow all the formatting rules for tiff 6.0

10575143
int	double
i m working on a programming assignment to make a function template that can handle int and double

10575216
lisp	scheme
i am more used to scheme but here s a solution that works in lisp

10575233
int	boolean
generally it s a good idea to avoid treating boolean values to int to make the code more readable especially for developers who use multiple languages

10575246
multiplication	modulo	addition	multiplication	addition	modulo
much easier to define addition or multiplication modulo 2 32 or 2 64 and not worry about it

10575252
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i see this behaviour in google-chrome firefox and safari

10575257
cpu	hyperthreading
hyperthreading helps by allowing you to make fuller use of cpu core execution resources

10575263
mvp	presenter
also keep in mind that one of the most important benefit of mvp in gwt is that you can easily mock your views and unit-test your presenter without a sluggish gwttestcase

10575306
getter	setter
i can setter and getter functions rename to c# reflection model

10575310
express	everyauth
everyauth tends to make assumptions that express is present making integration into connect-only apps difficult

10575351
int	boolean
this does not say that boolean false int 0

10575396
hide	show
i am trying to toggle the show hide between the arrows but only within the specific context

10575449
put	get
one call to get the data back put it into a viewmodel then give that viewmodel to the view and the ajax controller just sent the settings back to the database

10575468
int	boolean
it also makes it easy to see when you are mixing boolean into int or floating point expressions

10575525
int	chars
function chars fgets chars s int count file stream

10575525
getchar	getline
use getchar or getline instead

10575576
free	malloc
on the other hand the heap usually has a huge size say as much space as is free on the system and so malloc ing a large object won t cause an out-of-memory error

10575619
base-class	subclassing
in a manner of speaking yes but a proper visitor implementation would require that your base-class implementation have an if chain that checks what subclassing of the base class this is an instance of since as others have pointed out the purpose of the visitor pattern is to achieve something like multiple dispatch which requires distinguishing the runtime type of an object in some way

10575673
pull	push
then you can push to pull from each other s repositories

10575753
versioning	upgrade
i would recomend to use a new feature in html css or js only when all stable versioning of most popular browsers support it these are 90 but with a notification for the users that do not have them like please upgrade your browser to the last versioning

10575798
width	height
and the shadow div values half of img width and height respectively

10575850
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome works perfect but in ie the text teste get white i figured out that when input file over the text teste it get white

10575858
pop-up	dialog
if a dialog pop-up choose carefully

10575887
cassini	iis
also if your vs and iis urls are different you can give you site a virtual directory name in the project properties so that it matches your iis directory or better yet just have your project use iis instead of cassini the built-in web server

10576062
getter	setter
basically the way i implemented the iterator and getter setter is probably the source of the problem

10576097
post	get
i suggest trying to write something and if you can get it to work post your attempt here stack overflow...not this particular posting describing what isn t working

10576123
google-chrome	firefox
i had another css solution that i used after a4j jsfunction call to server to get info for the popup and show the overlay popup but that does not work in google-chrome and it works in ie with a script error in jquery script code and not in my code but works fine in firefox that is when i switched to richfaces solution thinking it looks very somple but once i include a test working on seperate page solution to my jsp it does not work

10576127
nginx	lighttpd	apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd
in theory you could build a pure-node web server that emulated the functionality of apache lighttpd nginx but i wouldn t recommend it

10576127
apache	nginx
nginx is very fast much lighter than apache

10576158
daemons	systemd
the one suggestion i would make if using php on same systemd is that you ensure you are using mod_wsgi daemons mode for running the python web application and even one daemons process per python web application

10576186
gunicorn	uwsgi
there is no specific reason why a python web application would consume more memory under apache mod_wsgi than under a different wsgi server such as uwsgi or gunicorn

10576205
folder	directory
java.io.ioexception cannot run program mp3wrap.exe in directory e music new folder zz concatinate clear_10 createprocess error 2 the system cannot find the file specified

10576230
cout	cin
for more substantial input output where you d naturally want to use cout or cin a better option is to use subprocess.popen

10576230
stdout	stderr
standard output the result of cout in c++ is then passed into the stdout list and standard error is passed into stderr

10576254
hex	binary
the expected string must be 12 bytes or hex encoded binary of length 24 allowed chars are a-f a-f 0-9

10576283
ontouch	ondraw
i need to set an ontouch method to the rect that i have set up but i dont know how to do this in an ondraw method

10576390
hide	show
however i needed 3 out of these 8 to have unique div id s in order to have a jquery show hide function to display divs below them when checked

10576448
punctuation	words
nearly flawless except for the space between the words minutes and the punctuation

10576496
google-chrome	firefox
please see the link below if you open this in ie the image is not complete whereas it opens fine in firefox or google-chrome

10576527

all my objects use class-method to initializer themselves

10576548

pep 326 a case for top and bottom values advanced a reference min and max in python

10576562
google-chrome	firefox
the current setup seems to loop properly in firefox 12 and the flash player but doesn t in google-chrome 18 it just goes to the beginning of the clip and sits there

10576578
hide	show
you are trying to show and hide your modal popup via server side

10576578
hide	show
in your code you can show and hide your modal once you bind to controls on your modal

10576599
jython	pypy
also note that none being less than everything and the empty tuple being higher than everything wasn t ever guaranteed in py2 and eg jython and pypy are perfectly entitled to use a different ordering if they feel like it

10576607
post	get
and this post has been helpful in helping me understand how to get the intersection of two lists

10576662
width	height
in order to do this my guess is that the inner div needs to ignored from the outer one s size computations for width only not for height and that s what i m not sure how to do

10576677
maven	pom.xml
being the last one in the pom.xml its settings will win--a general rule in maven

10576699
freebsd	linux	libevent	epoll
maybe you can take a look at epoll linux kqueue freebsd libev and libevent to get some idea

10576704
int	chars
amazingly when i write the same code with int in place of chars it works just fine

10576851
hash	md5
my idea is there is a server which can get the md5 hash of each file in the ftp server and send that hash list and file list to its clients

10576856
accessor	properties
i understand the most proper way to do this is to create a properties in form3.cs with get and set accessor

10576890
initializer	class-method
all my objects use class-method to initializer themselves

10577021
google-chrome	safari
they all work in safari but in google-chrome i get this sometimes-fail

10577055
stdout	stderr
when it segfaults the subprocess module does not return anything in stdout or stderr

10577076
bazaar	git
in particular i m most comfortable with managing an hg repository although i ve also worked with bazaar git and darcs

10577091
spaces	delimiter
chinese language has spaces delimiter only for logical constructs but most words follow each other with no delimiter

10577105
stdio	fflush	stdout	stdio	stdout	fflush
by default the c stdio library configures buffering for stdout so that the buffers are fflush at every end of line but only is stdout is a tty

10577143
paradox	bde
i used to use the following code to add fields at runtime this is for bde paradox tables

10577148
tablet	galaxy
then i built it and sent to my samsung galaxy tablet

10577161
sorting	filtering
dataproxy and loader are used mostly to facilitate a relying on the server for filtering paging sorting or b reuse between parts of the application for getting access to the same pieces of data

10577161
accessor	properties
the propertyaccess interface allows valueprovider and other instances to be generated by just the properties name that the values will be get set from using bean accessor

10577161
sorting	filtering
the loader is responsible for being told what settings paging filtering and or sorting to use when loading then triggering the load - different subclasses have different responsibilities accept different load config types and return different results

10577205
post	get
reading again your post i think you want to get the gui just when you click at the object and when you do this you get both guis

10577244
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
other than using implementation inherited using superclass abstract method which is overridden in the subclassing can make the classes tightly coupled

10577246
superclass	subclassing
listing subclass-specific constants in a base class is not that great an idea because ideally a superclass should not know about its subclassing

10577254
rspec	capybara

you will have to make sure that the system user has full access to the tomcat folder so that when tomcat runs it can freely create folder and files within its own directory

10577579
free	malloc
if you allocate memory on heap using malloc you can free the memory any time you want even before the end of your function s execution

10577584
superclass	subclassing
indeed it calls the superclass for fun but the superclass calls print and as print is overridden the overriding version in the subclassing gets called

10577604
put	get
actually i m probably missing quite a lot because i d like to put this a #total_distance method in the swim model swim.rb but when i try to do that i can t get the controller to recognize the method and i read elsewhere that a view should not try to access a method defined in a model due to caching issues

10577622
margin	height
i found a couple of solutions here but if i change the height of the top row the bottom row s style margin need to be changed along with it

10578084
memcpy	memset
i mostly use memset or memcpy to copy the data from to buffer

10578084
memcpy	memset
so that means c++ compiler will insert the internals in to the structure object and memset or memcpy will not work as in c

10578089
rss	feed
however if you re submitting to the app store apple will require that you re really implementing a voip-like app and not just downloading new rss feed in the background or some such.

10578114
memcpy	memset
as long as your structures don t use any c++ constructs virtualism etc memcpy and memset will work on them even in c++

10578119
int	chars
int value chars escape sequences will not be supported it is an unreliable method that does not scale well across multiple platforms and unnecessarily increases the complexity of parsing by proxy of validation

hi when i create a textbox on visual studio on windows form application i can get the width more than 20 pixels however i cannot get the height more than 20 pixels

10578176
hash	md5
md5 hash to avoid duplicating files on save

10578203
folder	directory
in php it s hard to do that since the source is open to all but you could do something similar to modify the index to grab the server s name or ip and check for it in your database if you have allowed it the process returns ok and every thing works fine else you send a self destructive command to the index and the index will delete all of the files and folder starting from its directory you can find a command here you can delete the maxdepth argument to recursively delete all the files and folder and keep in mind there is no perfect solution for your problem since the other party could change the index source code easily

10578306
getter	setter
i am looking at options to not having to write getter and setter in my code

10578306
getter	setter
currently i am using __call to automatically map getter and setter to my properties however i have been informed that that is very slow

10578306
getter	setter
what options do i have because writing getter and setter to return properties only is not a very good use of our developer time and maintaining them is more of a headache

10578313
gridview	repeater
i have read many articles regarding difference between gridview and repeater

10578313
gridview	repeater
i come to know that gridview pattern is fixed in and where as repeater can provide customized html mark up

getter	setter
i couldn t find any good articles that talk about how to maintain getter and setter dynamically so i thought of another way which may or may not work for you

10578443
gridview	repeater
in simple words we can say performance of repeater is far better than gridview

10578443
gridview	repeater
if you need basic rendering for read only items then its better to use repeater and if you need events pagination and editable controls then you should go for gridview

10578443
gridview	repeater
so it depends upon you requirements either you need repeater or gridview

10578487

superclass	subclassing
i m trying to use an nsinvocation to invoke a superclass method from the subclassing

10578562
super	self
this seems a bit odd to me as i had always assumed that super followed pretty much the same rules as self it could be treated as a direct reference to the object in question and assigned to variables used as a return value etc.

10578603
super	self
super and self are the same object so just use

10578603
super	self
the difference between them is that you can use super as a receiver of a message to self as a way to ensure that it invokes the superclass implementation

10578613
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i tested it with the common browsers like google-chrome firefox and safari

in internet explorer up to at least ie8 clicking a radio button or checkbox to change its value does not actually trigger the onchange event until the the input loses focus

10579151
onclick	onchange
now your onchange event should be triggered but as you can see it is redundant code thus you are better off just using the onclick event handler

10579161
nginx	lighttpd	apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd
in other words ob_flush tells php to give apache or nginx lighttpd whatever the output and then for php to forget about it

10580418
memcpy	memset
i mostly use memset or memcpy to copy the data from to buffer

10580418
memcpy	memset
you should definitely prefer to move to use properly default copy constructed objects and ditch the memset memcpy operations

10580418
memcpy	memset
while memset and memcpy can work in limited cases basically when the class struct and all its bases contains only stuff that would have worked in c a pointer to the virtual dispatch table will not be properly set by memset but may work after a memcpy - all implementation-defined and doesn t try to maintain any invariants

10580418
memcpy	memset
you do not have to worry about this in the context of ab using memcpy and memset

10580418
free	memcpy
you still have to worry about the c issues memcpy creating multiple objects using the same resources file descriptors pointers to heap locks etc. where both objects assume they have exclusive control of that resource and attempt to delete free release it later

10580482
superclass	subclassing
2 if you want to call _init on subclassing which will actually execute the superclass _init method then do not define define it on the subclassing class

10580482

superclass	subclassing
you should not redefine the flag in subclassing but only assign a value to the flag in the superclass

10580634
post	get
if you aren t sure how to parse a certain string you ll need to post a more detailed question including the input string array your code what you expected to get and what you actually got

10580662
superclass	subclassing
and then in subclassing you call superclass with this referring to the object so it has a chance to initialize

in c++11 you can use as the function is marked as a const_expr and can thus be called to obtain a constant expression of type t that can be used as the template argument but if you are working with a c++03 compiler you will need to work around the problem in a different way like moving the min and max to default arguments to a function or providing different overloads that take values from the user or will call a function default to if the argument is not present but this latter option is more cumbersome

rspec and minitest are other frameworks with other strengths but lack this business readability factor in that they are mostly code and not nearly as readable to a non-technical person

10586170
rspec	minitest
so chances are you are going to want to use rspec or minitest for your unit testing or the default test unit and cucumber for integration testing if you have an interested product owner or a need for a common language for test scenarios

10586170
rspec	minitest
if you do not you can write your integration tests as rspec examples or the minitest equivalent without losing much

10586171
banking	payment
youâ ll be able to see balances transfer money between your barclays accounts and make payment to people and companies you ve paid before through online banking

10586223
lan	localhost
i made a virtual host in my etc apache2 sites-available enabled it with a2ensite command and everything works great on localhost but i have a problem accessing the application from another computer in my lan using my ip

10586224
google-chrome	firefox
http s username password server ressource.ext - i believe firefox and google-chrome still support that ie killed it

10586252
bash	zsh
bash and zsh offer alternatives which are less unwieldy like the double brackets in bash which you use in your function1 definition and of course posix test is a lot more well-tempered than the original creation from bell labs

10586265
slider	supersized
i am still trying to use the click event to function as a link that goes to a slider within supersized slideshow

10586266
x86	64bit
on 64bit machines while it produces exactly the same files on 32 bit machines when compiled with x86 target cpu

10586316
profiling	instrumentation
finally it d be a good idea to profiling your app with instrumentation while you do the insertion

10586320
inherited	properties
rather see if you can t favor composition over inherited create a kind of proxy class for the sprite let s call it managedspriteproxy which implements all the methods you would call on managedsprite but forwards all the actual manipulations to its managedsprite properties

10586366
width	height
just a couple of tweaks needed first of all in your css you need to give your a left and top position as well as some height and width which i ve set to 100 to span the image and your a position relative so the caption is nicely positioned over the image

10586376
google-chrome	firefox
ie7 8 google-chrome and firefox are working perfectly

10586378
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox google-chrome they all work

10586378
google-chrome	firefox
other answer session variable not working in internet explorer but works fine in firefox google-chrome

10586384
m2e	pom.xml
i m just using m2e with a default pom.xml with no compiler versions specified

10586396
width	height
i find i often have to explicitly specify the width and height of image controls to get them to appear correctly

10586404
nstimer	nsrunloop
the reason for this is that we have complete control over the thread while using a nsthread but if using a nstimer than we are executing inside a nsrunloop which may freeze the ui if any heavy lifting is done inside

10586404
nstimer	nsrunloop
you are also guaranteed that a nsthread that is detached is executed immediately with a nstimer which is based on nsrunloop cannot as it may or may not be able to execute immediately

10586410
children	parent
was to do as the answer below suggested and then in the parent window s wm_paint message send a wm_paint to each child and have the children paint into the parent s doublebuffer not painting anything into itself and then have the parent bitblt it s buffer that has been drawn into by itself and then by each of its children going from the bottom to the top of the z-order into it s hdc

10586460
qmainwindow	qdialog
i have a qmainwindow that opens a qdialog

10586460
qmainwindow	qdialog
when the qdialog is closed the focus is lost - the qmainwindow doesn t get it back and no other widget seems to have it actually there are no active widgets besides those two

10586460
qmainwindow	qwidget
it holds a qwidget object whose parent is the qmainwindow

10586462
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in my case i had to test on more browsers ie7 ie8 ie9 google-chrome safari firefox 3.6 and latest versions so what i ve done was install virtual machines with all the browsers that i need and another machine with jstestdriver running on server mode

10586482
textview	imageview
inside that there shall be several rows with an imageview next to a textview next to a radiobutton

10586501
submit	submission
- submit the application once it is ready i discourage submission a half baked package

10586536
versioning	upgrade
if you want to install upgrade newer versioning from cpan you do not need to install db library as all required devel files .h + .a are also included in strawberry perl 5.14.x - simply run

10586538
tiff	png
i expect two subsequent calls to the save method using the same tiff file to produce the same png file

10586541
uilabel	nsstring
as for the uilabel i personally use core text since it has more font support but they may also be using something simpler like nsstring s drawatpoint withfont method

10586547
libjpeg	libpng
i will describe a specific example namely with the math- and data plot application gnuplot and its dependencies libfontconfig libpng libgd libjpeg libreadline.so ...

10586614
fuzzy	stemming
have a look at this library it contains fuzzy string matching functions for javascript including stemming lehvenstein distance and metaphones

10586620
accessor	properties
my order is usually public methods view lifecycle delegate callbacks private methods memory management then synthesized properties with accessor

10586637
strstr	substr
using strstr every substr is accepted as a solution so i recommend using regular expression see preg_match_all

10586640
easymock	jmock	easymock	jmockit	mockito	easymock	mockito	jmock	mockito	jmockit
easymock jmock mockito jmockit etc

10586642
uitableview	reloaddata
instead of using reloaddata you can add the new rows by animation using this method in uitableview

10586731
inherited	subclassing
the client send a subclassing of stream that i created filestreamex that inherited from filestream

10586779
post	get
all works as expected except that in the case where the post is converted to get

10586779
post	get
please notice that the post has parametres as a get i didn t do it and i won t change it i am just trying to avoid duplicated content

10586785
width	height
the two right canvases are of fixed width and height

10586828
fadein	fadeout	fadein	hide	hide	fadeout	hide	show
have your jquery look for all button div elements select by class and link them to their targets according to their actions show fadein or hide fadeout

10586852
post	get
a redirect response from your server for whatever request you made regardless of it being post or get request always results in your client making a get request unless you somehow enable it to not automatically follow redirects--sometimes i do this with curl but i don t know any widely used browsers with this functionality available easily to the user

10586852
post	get
if you redirect outside of .htaccess say in a php file to construct redirect response your only option is to convert the post parameters into a string of get parameters and add it to the end of the url you send back to the client with your redirect response

10586852
.htaccess	httpd.conf
i m fairly confident there is not a way to do automatic post parameter appending to redirect in the .htaccess or in the httpd.conf files whether you use the redirect directive or the rewrite directive via the mod_rewrite module

10586879
x86	64bit
i have installed my 32bit msi target x86 on 64bit machine every things seems to work fine except some com dlls which fails to load and gets an attempt was made to load a program with an incorrect format

10586888
width	height
i have an issue with a div containing lots of tiles in fixed width height divs i want it to scroll horizontally so the tiles inside the container scroll with the scrollbar

10586927
getter	setter
and a number of getter and setter give you access to localized virtual attributes

10586950
put	get
for example i get as in put the string length 15 and i want to create from that the condition

10587004
put	get
the code works fine if the rows sub is passed integers hardcoded but when i put a variable i get the select method of range class failed error

10587014
width	height
enforcing a width and a height around an image is a shorthanded way of doing this

10587104
lxml	elementtree
i m working on a function that determines if the content of a given html element - el - in an lxml elementtree is the leading content of a line in a rendered html page

10587113
boost	stl
the language is mostly c++ without templates and exceptions which is a platform compiler restriction so no stl and boost

10587136
folder	directory
my topbanner file i have in blue directory folder in xcode

10587166
google-chrome	firefox
i m not sure what s up but the below gets called and received fine in both firefox google-chrome

10587169
getter	setter
3 should have the getter and setter too

10587173
getter	setter
definetly object type variables should be private initialized and have getter and setter as appropriate

10587191
getter	setter
3 should have the getter and setter too

10587285
post	get
use post instead of get and everything will be fine

10587352
bower	npm
and then a node module called bower makes the actual build process for your client-side code incredibly simple and you can use just about any piece of code you find on npm

10587372
public	protected
i am not aware of any rule that says any particular attribute should be private in a class java offers other modifiers like protected and public and no modifier which implies package accessibility

10587372
getter	setter
about the getter and setter part of the question i believe these are just a way to enforce encapsulation

10587372
getter	setter
their paper demonstrates very compelling reasons on why something like getter and setter methods could be a good idea to avoid class extension fragility

10587395
width	height
the width isn t 960 height is

10587432
children	parent
without doing anything to the parent div if i invoke the following code on any of the children in the parent div

10587432
children	parent
the parent div will conform to the new height based on all the heights of its children

10587432
children	parent
and then change the height of any of the children in the same fashion as described above the parent s height does not conform to the new height based on all the heights of its children

10587451
persistent	transient
the simplest solution is to add a persistent section attribute or convert your existing transient attribute

10587471
post	get
that is you would send the api key as part of the url as a get parameter and submit all fields you would like to write as post arguments just like a web form

10587486
onkeyup	onkeydown	keydown	onkeyup
the keydown event is not repsonsible for the chararcter input so focusing the input will be enough onkeydown - the character will appear onkeyup

10587499
textarea	textbox
say when i hover over the picture of the dog i want the text in the div near the bottom of the page called dogdiv to appear in the textbox with the id textarea

10587586
post	get
you can get them as parameters in your controller function and act upon them directly with no middleman they d just be another post value

10587600
fseek	ftell
note that i also use fstat instead of your fseek ftell

10587601
post	get
the spring security information is available during regular get and post methods but is not available for a multipart post method

10587601
post	get
once again i was able to successuly inject spring beans into them and access spring security info for regular get and post methods but i was not able access spring security info for a multipart post

10587664
for-loop	arrays
for i get a response of 1 and the arrays doesn t print because ostensibly it s empty which means that it also doesn t enter the for-loop

10587689
google-chrome	firefox
i am trying to replicate firefox preference of delaying tab loading options general don t load tabs until selected as an extension in google-chrome

10587741
hdfs	oozie
the build artifact of a oozie project is a jar file containing all mapreduce jars it uses and their dependencies we use maven s assembly plugin to compress it this is the artifact we later deploy to hdfs after decompressing

10587741
hdfs	oozie
deployment to hdfs is on-demand from archiva getting the artifact of the oozie project build extracting it and putting it to hdfs

10587754
filesystems	ntfs
this article gives some info on how to extend your filesystems to allow for diacritic characters for ntfs anyway

10587763
apache	nginx
since your rails instances can be run in different processes when using nginx or apache no shared memory like in threads i guess the only solution is using file locks

10587842
mouseleave	mouseenter
i want a z-index of 1 to be set on all highlighted edges before the transition begins on mouseenter and i want the z-index of 1 to be removed after the transition completes on mouseleave

10587842
mouseleave	mouseenter
edit please keep in mind that the user can mouseenter mouseleave on several different edges before the transitions have a chance to complete

10587846
folder	directory
i have three directory and each of these directory contains 8 subdirectories and each of those subdirectories contains 2 folder that i want to delete

10587864
implements	extends
now the kicker is that if i take all of the fields from all of the mapped superclasses that i listed above and put them directly into blogpost and make blogpost just extends nothing and implements java.io.serializable then everything works perfectly

10587890
hash	salt
here s the bit that generates the password salt and hash when the account is created

10588000
post	get
i ve been searching in the internet and maybe found that my problem is that i might change the get method to a post protocol so that it could take any kind of length

10588031
hash	salt
just commenting on the salt hash system storing the salt alongside the password in the database sort of defeats the purpose of salting--if you database is compromised the salt becomes useless from a security perspective because its right there to aid in guessing breaking the security

10588031
hash	salt
the purpose of a salt is to increase the time taken to guess a hash word by adding a secret string of appropriate length to the value you are hashing

10588032
moq	justmock
when i need to test i can use a mocking tool moq justmock rhinomocks etc to create a fake iconfig that returns a known value without hitting the actual .config file or you can do it without a mocking framework by making your own mocks and store them in your test project

10588064
accessor	properties
also use an accessor instead of making the textstring properties on item public

10588084
unsigned	short
hx is for an unsigned short x is for an unsigned int lx is for an unsigned long and llx is for an unsigned long long

10588111
getter	setter
if you want to get more advanced in your vba if your files are small you could run searches by setting up an object with setter getter and store the records into a collection class then iterate across it with the data you re looking for

10588162
free	malloc
it s a bad programming design concept if you don t explicitly free memory that you have malloc ed and although you eventually can rely on the os to do this for you it may cause memory leaks when you later modify your project not to exit but you forget to free your used memory

10588171
width	height
the .imgclose need a height and a width in order to display correctly.

10588174
cpython	pypy
edit again one completely different approach would be to use pypy s sandboxing mechanism which should be much more secure than cpython plus a sandboxing module

10588200
bonjour	avahi
the two popular implementations are bonjour used by apple systems avahi used by linux

10588221
width	height
you must specify the width height and display inline-block|block

10588250
folder	directory
you could do something like this if you re confident that log and data folder in other directory won t be picked up

10588267
post	get
in my rails fb app when running in the canvas if i go to users instead of get ting the index page it post s and creates a new user

10588333
inherited	properties
it now gives the warning of properties hides the inherited member...use the new keyword if hiding was intended but i can live with that because deserialization now works again we can move the data from one provider to another

10588369
vim	emacs
for example both vim and emacs support tags files generated by the ctags command that list all of the function and variable definitions in a project

10588391
post	get
so far all is well however when it comes to displaying the message inbox of all conversations sorted on the latest post it get s tricky to do with one query

10588398
inherited	subclassing
however if you followed my initial map of your inherited you should have had an epiphany that using subclassing for what you are trying to do is an inappropriate solution for what you are trying to model

10588452
photoshop	paint.net
if the image is of a file type that supports transparency open it up in image editing software paint.net photoshop etc. and delete the white or replace it with empty transparent color

10588480
innodb	myisam
innodb unlike myisam supports row-level locking

10588482
post	get
you can add get variables to the url string used in the urlloader or you can use urlvariables to use post variables to pass values if necessary to your php script

10588494
google-chrome	safari
you can use a webkit browser like google-chrome or safari to open a private browsing session or incognito window

10588584
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i ll show the code now just wanted to mention this works perfectly on iphone ipod touch devices and even my firefox safari and google-chrome desktop browsers

10588592
post	get
i have looked into google and stack over flow and read all the post regarding how to get internalsvisibleto to work

10588594
instances	transient
but i expect you already know that and just want to know why not to just inject a new instances with a transient lifestyle of the dbcontext into anyone who needs it

10588594
instances	transient
let me start by saying that registering a dbcontext as transient could work but typically you want to have a single instances of such a unit of work within a certain scope

10588595
pop-up	dialog
don t to create a new jframe if you want the pop-up window use dialog with parent of the frame

10588595
jwindow	jdialog
don t extend jframe or jdialog or jwindow

10588612
google-chrome	firefox
firefox still supports document.load while google-chrome only lets you load stuff using xhr

10588643
inherited	properties
even though heading is inside a properties of the viewmodel that this document inherited

10588679
width	height
you can change the width and height of the widget by applying css to the element that django creates

10588690
vim	emacs
both emacs and vim have folding modes

10588712
rss	feed
i m looking to integrate a lightbox2 gallery system with slick flickr s ability to pull in a rss feed containing image information

10588765
multiplying	add	multiplying	multiplication
it shifts all bits over by 2 places resulting in a multiplication by four just as you would add two digits in a base 10 number to multiplying by 100

10588774
ffmpeg	avisynth
solution is to install avisynth and then you can load with ffmpeg any avi file for whom the system has a vfw codec

10588793
express	node.js
however i m still a little bit uncomfortable as this translates to a server-side javascript environment such as node.js and more specifically an api written on express

10588798
inherited	properties
notice that this code also injects the base class in order to gain fine grained control on properties parsing and support for inherited between different dsl files

10588809
sorting	filtering
sorting and filtering functionality with the non-data header rows could be a problem

10588836
put	get
i can go to the web service in a browser put in the same values and i get a seemingly valid xml response

10588872
express	node.js
i m trying to display these images to the browser via node.js using express framework

10588918
opera	firefox
opera - you can use the same thing as firefox but with opera

10588918
opera	firefox
code to get the url from firefox opera using dde which used ndde - the only good dde wrapper for .net

10588920
put	get
but when i go to put this code in my app i get this exception

10589003
ubuntu	debian
for ubuntu you really want to work within the .deb apt-based packaging framework the distro already provides the same applies to debian derivatives generally

10589021
google-chrome	firefox
update my anwswer refers to a similar issue that happened in firefox a few months ago and i suggested in hopes that it would work for google-chrome 19 but currently oleg s answer is the correct approach

10589021
google-chrome	firefox
a few updates later of firefox it did stop happening and currently all of my grids are fine in google-chrome 18 so hopefully it will not be an issue when 19 is released

10589038
pull	push
fork the 3rd party repo on github to so i have a place to push fixes and from which i can send pull requests to the 3rd party lib maintainer

10589038
pull	push
when ready push my topic branch to my forked repo on github and submit a pull request to the 3rd party project

10589055
google-chrome	firefox
try opening this example in google-chrome and firefox

10589091
prepare	execute
the function would prepare the query prepare statements and then execute it return the result in an array

10589119
int	double
your code will only handle bytes and int it cannot handle floats and double

10589154
ready	each
as each child actor sends back the data set the corresponding flag in my main actor is set to true and the other two flags are checked to see if were ready to move on

10589177
folder	directory
so i went to git bash and typed npm install socket.io i found the the directory in my user folder c users weka node_modules .

10589229
padding	overlapping
a more custom way to do it would be with two overlapping divs where one is only slightly larger than the other by either size or by using padding

10589240
int	chars
that represent the transition of the nondeterministic automaton each with 2 int and a chars i j and c representing the states where the transition ie the transition goes from state i to state j with the chars c

10589242
ant	maven
in response to comments complaining that maven is rigid and makes it hard to use custom build logic provide fine-grained control over the build process - i would recommend looking into ant plug-in for maven there are actually several but here is one

10589242
ant	maven
basically it allows you to run any ant command as part of the maven build and you can do pretty much anything with ant

10589286
icmp	udp
mere algorithm has something to do with ttl on udp packets old school and icmp echo in newer implementations

10589301
rss	feed
i m using the following code to read a rss feed

10589338
firefox	safari
i m having trouble with the following code in firefox and safari

10589338
firefox	safari
this works fine in internet explorer but not in firefox or safari - nothing happens

10589351
free	malloc
i am juggling with two ways of free ing malloc ed memory in a linked list structure

10589373
free	malloc
you can free memory blocks allocated by malloc in whatever order you like

10589380
hash	salt
i am reading about the best way to store password information in database and most of the examples say that we should not store the actual password in database but hash and salt values

10589380
hash	salt
in a web application the code that authenticates user is located on the server side so we send user name and password over the wire and on the server we read the salt value then hash password that we received with salt and compare it with stored hash value in db

10589380
hash	salt
this means that hash class would be exposed on the client and i would need to read hash and salt value from db on the client which kind of allows anyone to create a few lines of code and fetch all user info on client

10589387
public	protected
any public or protected property or method in site.master.cs will be accessible from site.master

10589390
google-chrome	firefox
also when firefox does the post back the whole page does not appear to reload with google-chrome or ie the whole page will flash white and reload

10589390
google-chrome	firefox
because with firefox the viewstate i have for my accordion works like it is supposed to but again not with google-chrome or ie

10589406
awt	swing
i have a swing + awt application which uses an external jar library by calling a main method inside it

10589436
width	height
edit if you are looking to fill each grid square with a different color then this function will not work or could at least be used in combination with another function which creates and fills the squares in a similar way to the function above but cutting the width and height off based on the dimensions of the canvas width and height

10589444
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
but i didn t test firefox safari or opera

10589461
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox when you click on something it seems to gain focus but that does not seem to be true for google-chrome in this case

10589514
superclass	subclassing
to resolve this try to store a base class reference whenever you define a new subclassing avoid using this when calling a superclass method

10589540
post	get
usually a get request has no body so try with a post

10589546
struts	stripes	jsf	stripes
that is why companies usually adopt an existing and well-developed mvc framework like jsf spring mvc stripes struts etc

10589585
sorting	filtering
now i am supposing that you are getting the cursor from the procedure get_data.get_emp_data .. .you need to write a procedure that call the above procedure and do sorting pagination and filtering on the above data returned from the cursor

10589659
folder	directory
this version appears to have installed fine however it appears that the developers never intended for this to be installed outside of a root directory cause installing it outside of root in a sub folder seems to break the styling and scripting to a point seems my bet is they did src href assets blahblah.ext instead of assets blahblah.ext

10589671
folder	directory
and yes socket.io is a folder into the root server directory and my server-side socket is listening on port 3000

10589676
portrait	landscape
if i test my code in portrait mode i can see only icon and if i rotate orientation to landscape still i see only icon

10589676
portrait	landscape
on the other hand if i run with landscape i can see text and icon on portrait and landscape

10589680
springsource	grails
i have installed the latest version of springsource tool suite and have installed the groovy and grails plugins and everything is working fine

10589713
usergroups	administration
when going this route for extra security it would be best to use integrated security for the sql connection and then lock down access to the queries and tables so that only a certain usergroups can run the administration actions and add users and regular users can only execute read and data insert update statements for related tables

10589715
rss	feed
i use wordpress for my blog and would love if the pictures that i post in each blog were added to the rss feed like say the first image

10589736
eruby	erb
templating languages like erb eruby erubis use the ruby programming language to run arbitrary code embedded in a web page and replace the results of that code with the text it produces

10589751
oncreate	ondestroy
to oncreate through to a single final call to ondestroy

10589751

10589999

the background image alone cannot expand the element until it s visible that s why you need to specify width and height

the large string is split into an array split by spaces and for each item in the array it converts it to a hexadecimal number int a 16 means turn string a into an int string a is in base 16 and then returns that ascii chars chr ... represented by that int

you can also set a background image sprite containing the desired text to the input field if the height or width are known and just adjust the background-position on the onfocus and onblur events

10602676
tunnel	packets
number 4 and 41 in protocol list you linked to clearly state ipv4 encapsulation and ipv6 encapsulation you would use ipv4 with ipv6 encapsulation for example to generate packets which are then de-capsulated unless that s not actually a word upstream at an ipv6 over ipv4 tunnel

10602684
width	height
any component that requires some dimensional computation for its initialization won t work in a hidden tab because the tab panel itself is hidden via display none so that any elements inside won t report their actual width and height 0 in most browsers

10602684
put	get
updated this what i get the data when i put alert data

10602704
viewdidload	viewdidappear
turned out that popping the view while the search controller was still active messed up something in the navigation controller that made it impossible to hide the back button in controller b afterwards well it eventually stayed hidden between viewdidload and viewdidappear but then it always turned visible

10602736
pop-up	dialog
after click dialog pop-up and value reset to initial text

10602856
udp	tcp
most likely this will be ipproto_tcp tcp or ipproto_udp udp

10602856
udp	tcp
in practice it s unlikely you will need to pass these parameters explicitly very often as for ip generally sock_stream implies tcp and sock_dgram implies udp

10602856
udp	tcp
in contrast ipv4 ipv6 is a layer 3 l3 protocol and works independently from tcp udp

10602859
libstdc++	libc++
additionally you can switch between using libstdc++ and clang s own libc++ which are different implementations of the c++ standard library

10602859
libstdc++	libc++
libc++ in some cases might have a better implementation of the c++11 standard than your existing libstdc++ library

10602859
libstdc++	libc++
the latter is important if you re using clang in an environment with an outdated version of libstdc++ like mac osx but note that the two c++ libraries are not compatible with each other so you would have to rebuild any dependencies against libc++ if you were to use that

10602868
google-chrome	firefox
it looks quite smooth in google-chrome but it s flickering badly in firefox

10602874
sorting	filtering

we recently upgrade to a new versioning of the component with some additional properties features all old properties are intact but i could not get visual studio to detect the new properties

10602994
folder	directory
deleted the bin and obj folder in the solution directory so that the pia s would get newly created when i added the new control

10602994
put	get
at that point the application would compile and run but i could not get intellisense to detect the new properties and if i put them in place anyways the application would not compile

10602998
onmouseover	onload	onmouseover	onclick
as far as actually using onmyfunction alert hi i don t believe this is possible because the onclick onload and onmouseover events are built in

10603112
integer	unsigned
assuming that and that str is one of an unsigned integer

10603172
bash	tcsh
you either have gt.m already installed and i would guess it is an older version on your system somewhere else and have some environment variable defined for it in your bash tcsh sh environment or you didn t provide all the step you did to get to that error

10603188
inherited	properties
i need to do that to set the basetype properties of cars to vehicle to implement a inherited

10603202
typedef	struct
remove the struct keyword it s not needed since you ve already typedef the struct

10603220
onresume	onpause
the two activities are of course forwarding their onpause and onresume events to their glsurfaceviews

10603220
onresume	onpause
a fix is to set the visibility of each glsurfaceview using setvisibility view.invisible visible in onpause and onresume respectively

10603287
html.beginform	html.textboxfor
if the html helpers such as html.textboxfor are not used inside a html.beginform they will not emit the html5 data- attributes

10603432
draggable	droppable
i would advise you look into jquery ui s draggable and droppable

10603432
draggable	droppable
these will undoubtedly be more powerful than the script you linked and you can set up elements to be draggable with jquery s powerful selectors and droppable only within certain elements

10603464
sorting	grouping
secondly you are using grouping by where sorting is carried out by order by

10603548
client-side	server-side

10603554
children	parent
when performing a delete on an order the parent hibernate is trying to cascade delete the children

10603554
children	parent
instead of just deleting the children first it is attempting to null out the foreign keys then delete the parent then delete the children

10603565
post	get
you should also process the user input as you will get users that enter double tags making explode have empty values plus using post like that you will have sql injections

10603611
put	get
using firebug i ve put breakpoints in ac_oetags.js to see if ac_generateobj gets the proper params and it does get it properly

had the same problem yesterday the onclick with an onchange worked for me - not ideal though

10603666

uses microtime and md5 to produce a hash and then grabs a random 5 characters ...

10603725
ncover	testdriven.net
i don t care that i haven t covered that line with tests but my testdriven.net ncover code coverage report does show the untested line and this causes the class coverage to drop to 86

10603769
versioning	upgrade
i am currently attempting to upgrade my versioning of sql server express edition to developer edition

10603801
targetinvocationexception	argumentnullexception
however since i am invoking a private method using reflection i would assert a targetinvocationexception for the method that throws an argumentnullexception like so

10603801
targetinvocationexception	argumentnullexception
i would like to assert an argumentnullexception instead of a targetinvocationexception for that private method so i can scan over its code and know what its expected to do rather than to debug to find out

10603822
union	distinct
there is no reason to use distinct and union together as union will make the results distinct

10603829
google-chrome	firefox
i ve reproduced in google-chrome in firefox

10603854
width	height
i think the easiest way to do what you want is to present some uiview that is 1.5 pixel height and animate it s width

10603856
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it appears to work properly in the latest version of firefox mac but not in google-chrome safari mac

i have both phpbb and wordpress installed on the site

10603874
for-loop	loops
if i replace the boost_foreach loops with a for-loop using an iterator

10603909
free	malloc
you can modify malloc free using hooks to remember allocated memory for example suppose that your record the new pointer in an array of pointers

10603921
versioning	upgrade
in addition to avoiding peculiar upgrade issues when moving to a new edition and a new versioning unless you don t really mean express is sql server 2008 you also have the added bonus that you still have your original databases intact which you won t have if the upgrade fails in worse ways than simply being blocked

10603975
opensuse	linux
i am running java 1.5.0_15 on an opensuse linux machine

10604001
post	get
i need a simple code example of sending http post request with post parameters that i get from form inputs

10604039
put	get
the solution that comes to my mind is write a .py file to continually put trending topics in a queue and write independent .py files continually running making get queue requests and saving the data in the db used by django with raw sql or sqlalchemy

10604066
addition	modulo
the xor operator performs addition modulo 2 making the potentially expensive mod operation unnecessary

10604066
int	boolean
using packed int however would be a somewhat more complicated than your use of a simple boolean array which really is likely just an array of bytes

10604077
jpql	hql
here s the hibernate documentation on hql which is a small superset of jpql

10604108
profiling	debugging
how to setup eclipse to use jboss-eap for debugging and also minimal profiling

10604236
int	chars
9 there are number of chars that can be interpreted as decimal digits and converted to an int

10604284
vsto	add-in
the add-in is managed code c# but is not built with vsto - it uses custom wrappers and a com shim

10604284
vsto	netoffice
i ll add that migrating to vsto or a similar technology such as netoffice is an option but we d prefer to avoid that if possible

10604305
superclass	subclassing
so means that a function that takes superclass of a can be viewed as a subclassing of the original function

10604308
google-chrome	firefox
there is similiar script called adgallery with jquery and supports ie6 7 8 9 google-chrome and firefox

let s say i have we have a superclass a and subclassing x and y

10604534
width	height
i want to convert this to an ogv file with a much lower bit rate 128kb but the same width and height

10604540
width	height
while this certainly can be done with core graphics it s infinitely easier to add a transparent png to your project with the appropriate width and 1 pixel height and then position a uiimageview in your table cell over the content to create this effect

10604570
google-chrome	firefox
just use firebug extension in firefox or the built-in google-chrome developer tools

10604601
for-loop	arrays
alternatively you could use an arrays that is actually 3x2 instead of 4x3 then fix your for-loop to use indexing that matches

10604630
awt	swing
i have heard quite a few times not to mix swing and awt heavyweight and lightweight components

10604638
width	height
i got an assignment that i have to make a programm in java that takes an image.creates 3 buttons named align left right and center .2 textfields width and height that i can input numbers there and a button resize.the 4 buttons align left right center and resize have to change the image place to left right or center and resize the image as the numbers were given respectively

10604638
width	height
i need to also make a setpreferedsize and somehow get the width and height of textfields

10604659
hash	salt
if your app uses the user id in public data such as by including it in a url parameter you should use a hash algorithm with a salt value added to obscure the id

10604666
int	boolean
in java that is a compilation error because the value of the assigment has type int and a boolean is required at that point

10604676
folder	directory
in the directory element for the top folder change programfilesfolder to programfiles64folder

10604717

10604922
post	put
tell you to just put in postname which will create static urlâ s for your post and pages

10604927
mdpi	hdpi
i can t find the reference right now but i m pretty sure the value of density in that class for mdpi is 1.0 hdpi is 1.5 and xhdpi is 2.0

10604927
screens	hdpi
ideally a large-mdpi image and a large-hdpi image will be approximately the same size when measured with a plastic ruler on the screens but the hdpi image should look nicer on account of having more pixels

10604948
typedef	struct
there is no struct timer in scope just a typedef for an anonymous struct

10604957
awt	swing
you can use awt components together with swing jcomponents only if you have got really important reason s for example a.m

10604957
awt	swing
i d suggest don t mixing awt with swing and vice versa

10604957
awt	swing
swing is based or inherits of awt components and their methods

10604981
awt	swing
mixing awt and swing has performance drawbacks and if you are trying to use themes you will also run into problems

10604981
awt	swing
swing is built on top of awt and yes it is newer and faster and better but it s still got access to everything awt has

10604992
versioning	upgrade
as per this homebrew imagemagick issue precompiled binaries may reference the wrong library versioning when something else is upgrade

10605014
keydown	keyup
the only information i ve found on this is that you need to keep track of variables such as the shift key kanji key etc for foreign languages with bools in the keydown and keyup events and then make a massive switch case that will take in all of the variables and spit out what you d want for your app

10605030
width	height
it s as if animating a width height of an element cancels out all other animations in the animation block

10605038
rss	feed
i tried to implement pull-to-refresh into my rss feed

10605042

typeerror	traceback

10605081
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
however i am wondering why it shows the correct thing during the while loops as it goes along but then after it is complete the for-loop shows all three of the arrays entries having the same name the value is correct for the third entry but for the first and second entries the value field contains half of the correct value for the third entry

10605101
hex	binary
so far i ve investigated that i can not simply open core as binary and search for 654321 converted to hexadecimal nothing found in hex editor

10605113
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox it s 20

10605124
couchbase	couchdb
btw couchdb and couchbase are completely different database products both use erlang platform and it seems like you are using them interchangeably

10605125
fgets	strtok
the value returned from strtok will be pointing to an element in curline so all entries in the array of struct s will be pointing to an element in curline which is overwritten with each call to fgets and will only be valid for the current iteration

10605125
strdup	strtok
you should make a copy of the value returned from strtok during the while possibly using strdup

10605135
hex	binary
so far i ve investigated that i can not simply open core as binary and search for 654321 converted to hexadecimal nothing found in hex editor

10605137
getter	setter
i would suggest introducing functionaljava s option in the accessors getter and setter while leaving hibernate to handle a simple java field which is allowed to be null

10605146
readonly	temporary
it seems that this puts a temporary lock handle on the binaries even when they are on a readonly share

10605162
width	height
orignal width 4022 original height 3779

10605182
cassini	iis

10605202
hide	show
here is working fiddle which show alert when you click on legends like on tokyo and then hide tokyo line

10605324
accessor	properties
the checked field is a properties rather than an attribute so i would recommend using the appropriate accessor and mutator for the checked status

10605355
onfocus	onblur
you can capture onfocus and onblur events of your various elements and have some logic decide if allowed or not depending on your needs

10605461
textarea	textbox
what you call textarea is an lcdui object textbox

10605485

one common example is to have the parent hide itself show the child and then show itself again when the child is closed

10605549
int	boolean
g error error argument of and must be type boolean not type int

10605557
post	get
another solution is to get all tags of the post from db compare the list with the submitted one and decide what we have to delete and what we have to insert

10605589
int	boolean
the role column is an int and each its bit should mean different boolean flag as in previous example you can map this to a enum in c# and say that if the first bit is on then user has rights to update description if the second bit is on user can change schedules and so on

10605645
google-chrome	firefox
the following code works in firefox but not in google-chrome

10609557
put	get
sound easy in theory but when i ve tried them either the date comes out formatted wrong --15 5 12 i get an undefined offset warning or the script seems to work but the printed confirmation that the update s worked shows the dreaded 1-1-70 date so now not only does my script not work but my database has some weird blank entries and is adding totals up strangely at least the database is relatively easy to find and fix the errors - once i remember where i put my server password anyways

10610215

without knowing beforehand the min and max prices what i d like is to have the histogram cover the entire range of prices with a set number of intervals say 10

10610797
min	max
i know that one solution could be to query my database for the min and max values and then figure out the appropriate interval size but that goes against one of the main points of using elasticsearch which is to not have to hit the db for search related queries

10610807
width	height
because width and height doesn t change when dpi changes object returns same width and height i cannot see what the real size is of the image in pixels the size the user see

free	malloc
for the actual program storage the interpreter and garbage collector will use plain malloc mfree to allocatate and free memory plus some fairly complex control structures to enable the garbage collector to function

if there are more than one parent div elements that have three or more such children then all of the 3rd children are selected

10611581
int	chars
obviously that number has to be something wider than a byte since there are more than 256 chars java uses a version of unicode where every chars is assigned a 16-bit value and this is why java chars are 16 bits wide and have int values from 0 to 65535

10623845
std	ostream
i m not sure why you re getting that specific error somehow it thinks their use of the operator is defined as taking an rvalue reference to an std ostream but it looks like the recommended way may be to specialize the cppunit assertion_traits template as seen in testassert.h

serializable	deserialization
during serializable the objects instance variables are sucked out and converted to bytes and written on a file typically a file with .ser extension then during deserialization the bytes are read from the file and then converted to instance variables and are used to create new object identical to the one which was serializable

10624616
serializable	deserialization
you can check the hashcode of the object before serializable and then after deserialization they will never be same as hashcode is provided by jvm depending on where the object is create on the heap and its obvious the 2 objects cant be created on the heap at the same address...so they are diff objects but with identical state

10624621
ubuntu	debian
if setting up such services is heavy and you want to avoid it and - say - you are using debian ubuntu then save your objects into files with marshal-ing in the shm device which is practically memory

udp	tcp
like matzi suggested udp gives you lower latency and lower packet overhead as the header is smaller than tcp but on the downside the delivery of the packet to the destination is never guaranteed ie

10624972
udp	tcp
you could say that udp packets are sort of like separate entities while tcp is a continuous unbreaking stream you need some way to distinguish where one message ends and another begins

10624972
udp	tcp
after you ve selected udp and or tcp for the transport you still probably need a custom protocol that encodes and decodes the data payload the tcp udp packets move around

10625115
hash	md5
if you are unable to use a cryptographic hash function md5 sha-1 you could opt for one of the non-cryptographic hash functions pearson jenkins hash

viewdidappear	viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidload	dealloc
this depends on your scenario usually the best approach is to add in viewdidload and remove in dealloc and in viewdidunload but there are some cases when you have same method in different classes like ui effects and want to call only current screen s method using notification then you will have to add the observer in viewwillappear and remove it in viewwilldisappear or viewdidappear viewdiddisappear

pipe in unix only pipes output written on stdout from previous command with the command on rhs of pipe hence your grep command is only working on 2nd and 3rd line while 1st line on your terminal is coming from stderr

10640121
stdout	stderr
stderr and stdout

10640121
stdout	stderr

hide	show
i need to hide a serie when user click a button and show it when user clicks again

10640413
move	drag
the behaviour i am trying to achieve is such that when i drag a navigation element the content container move with it and when i drop the navigation element in a new position within the list the content container sticks to its new position in the content area as well

10640416
for-loop	arrays
the for-loop is not the best way to approach iterating over an arrays in ruby

10640446
int	chars
if chars_read is less than the length of the string then sscanf didn t consume all the chars so the string didn t consist entirely of a single int

10640471
subtract	add
instead you probably meant to synchronize your get - add - and subtract -methods

10640476
post	get
i know there are other plugins out there that already do this but i m not sure how they actually get the content from the php file to edit the post pages

10640518
int	chars
this can be generalized to either form a atoi function ascii to int or extract the first number that occurs in a string terminated by any non-digit chars by using a loop and a chars pointer to index over the string str

10640564
folder	dir
i want the name to be 1config.ini so that it appears at the top of a folder dir

10640663
next	replacewith
note one think should keep in mind that when one use then #myfield will removed from dom so next time you can t catch it and next replacewith will fail

10640721
public	protected
from a subclass you cannot call private methods only public and protected - this rule applies to constructors as well

clang	llvm
emscripten can compile llvm bitcode eg generated by clang from c++ to javascript

10640816
google-chrome	safari
granted these are new and i believe they only work in safari and google-chrome

10640851
google-chrome	firefox
try echoing dumping the content and viewing the page with firefox or google-chrome and change the encoding to utf-8 and then something else like iso-8859-1

10640870
getter	setter
technically a property is just syntactic sugar for a getter setter method - so a property can do anythign a method can do but most of the time it shouldnt

10640874
getter	setter
this means you only have to mess with the magic __get and set once and then simply naming your methods the right things will make the behave as getter setter and lazy initializers

10640876
ubuntu	debian
in debian ubuntu is something like this

10640892
hide	show
on bases of those values i am hide and show few contents on page2

10640917
width	height
my approach has been to get the canvas width and height at the beginning of the game calculate the side of the squares and then draw the grid out and save that as a bitmap and then use that bitmap in the game

10640923
getter	setter
first of all this is exactly the reason why you should use getter setter methods

10640927
hide	show
in this example all elements with the class togglable will show their primary child element when clicked and hide all other child elements

10640980
uitableview	nsindexpath
void tableview uitableview tableview didselectrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

10640985
public	protected
using the same example as op you can t lazy load public members as you would protected private

10641020
int	chars
since this is c++ you should use reinterpret_cast to cast the unsigned chars pointer to an int pointer

10641044
width	height
i even reduced the sizes width height kb to match with men.jpg but it still doesn t show

10641138
children	parent
children divs are displayed or hidden programmatically what changes the height of the parent element

10641147

10641163
inherited	properties
you can use the style.basedon properties to inherited one style from another

10641171
slideup	slidedown
instead of .hide and .show use slideup and slidedown animation which will give a nice effect instead of that shaky effect

10641234
fflush	gets
2nd parameter in printwriter constructor is fflush which accepts boolean datatype we need to fflush the data so it gets thrown on the console even if the buffer is not full

10641263
integer	unsigned
this is because pythoncom represents them internally as a 32bit signed integer when the correct representation is a 32bit unsigned integer

10641263
integer	unsigned
we need to interpret the negative number as a 32 bit signed integer then interpret that as an unsigned integer

10641284
scrollable	panels
i have some htmlwindows in a scrollable panels and i want to see the full text in these windows

10641340
filtering	grouping
the individual users need to be part of a roll-up role or grouping in order to add that roll-up role or grouping to the filtering

10641364
int	boolean
when you do add explicit casts to convert the pointers to int the program becomes valid again and you will get boolean from the comparisons

10641390
width	height
i have a script i don t remember where i found it for resizing images based on stage width and height

10641440
ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	icollection	ilist	icollection

when you put scrollview inside scrollview android just get confused which scroll view is touched

10641559
int	double
i have a formula that involves a double but is guaranteed to give an int answer -- specifically an unsigned 32-bit int which alas java doesn t do well

10641559
int	double
eventually i found the issue but the behavior is still very odd to to me a double cast directly to an int seems to be capped at the max_int for a signed int whereas a double cast to a long that is then cast to an int gives me the expected answer -1

10641559
integer	unsigned
the max int of an unsigned 32-bit integer represented as a signed 32-bit integer

10641580
int	chars
real type means the int types enums real floating point types and chars â 6.2.5 17

10641602
google-chrome	firefox
the page works fine on firefox v12 and ie v9 but breaks in google-chrome iron v12 specifically clicking on the club name to get the stats for the club causes the tabs to be displayed vertically and the accordion to be a mess

10641695
viewdidappear	viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewdidappear
though it s probably best that you do whatever it is you are wanting to do in the viewdidload viewwillappear or viewdidappear methods of your rootviewcontroller unless it s something you don t usually want to happen

10641704
post	get
you can then loop over the post to get individual post details

10641741

temp should be a double not an int if you don t want things you assign to it to become int

10641744
avd	galaxy
i would like to create an avd of the samsung galaxy s ii

10641762
postgresql	mysql
you re much better off using mysql or postgresql - both are trivial to use in cloudfoundry and will perform much better

10641813
wav	caf
we have a large number of apple core audio caf files that we d like to use on our android client so it would be helpful to convert from caf to wav in java

10641833
findstr	ipconfig
another possibility is to put in this place the ipconfig all | findstr command so the auxiliary file is entirely avoided like i done in the first version of my program

10641863
post	get
if you want to send some confidential values in url via form you must use the post method if you will use the get method for the form like login the values parameters like userid and password will be visible in url and anyone can hack that thing

10641864
implements	extends
your pattern class has to extends basicobject and extends implements codeobject which is actually an interface

10641864
implements	extends
the method will accept any classes that extends basicobject no matter whether they extends implements codeobject

10641888
hide	show
i would like it to hide the error div and then do the alert but as i run the code the alert show up firs then the area is set to hide

10641907
post	get
i want to pass the username email and password to my users model to add the user to my database but i m not sure how i can get the post data into that method

10641918
width	height
i recommend wrapping your entire document in a and setting it to height 100 and width 100 and controlling overflow with that div instead

10641919
post	get
from the other post here it looks like it could be a compiler problem in which case you can get around it by using a typedef instead of the map type directly

10641964
post	get
the codeigniter input class allows you to get the post data after it has been filtered by the form validation library

10641983
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
json.stringify in javascript which is in all mobile browsers google-chrome firefox opera safari and in ie since version 8.0 more detailed list of compatible browsers is here

10642059
opera	safari
there isn t a good compiler for converting userscripts into safari or opera extensions

10642059
opera	safari
some userscripts work on opera though and there are some older safari extensions that run some userscripts but i don t hear good things about them

10642060
floating-point	integer
converting a floating-point to an integer type if the value is too large for the destination then the maximum value is substituted

10642071
comparator	comparable
to implements comparable interface class must implement a single method comparator

10642072
int	double
remember that there are no primitive unsigned long or int types in java and the java language specification java 7 for narrowing primitive conversion 5.1.3 states that casting a too small or too large floating point value be it double or float to an integral type of int or long will use the minimum or maximum value of signed integral types emphasis mine

10642072
int	chars
a long if t is long or to an int if t is byte short chars or

10642072
floating-point	integer
otherwise if the floating-point number is not an infinity the floating-point value is rounded to an integer value v rounding

10642072
int	chars
the results for chars int and long are unsurprising producing the

10642072
int	double
the first case thus promotes maxuintfromdoubleaslong to a double via multiplication and then casts it to an int

10642072
int	double
so first promotes maxuintfromdoubleaslong to double back to long still fitting and then to an int

10642093
width	height
i was able to do this by destroying and recreating the cycle updating the width and height field based on the container and images within there images were dynamically sized to the container width

10642095
width	height
consider replacing it with a div and setting a width and height

10642127
put	get
i know that does not exactly answer you question but hopefully it will put you on the track so you can provide some more information and get it all fixed

10642179
screens	tablet
which works fine in phone s screens the problem is that it could happen that a 7 tablet takes the value from values-mdpi and a 10 tablet too but the result is not the same i guess because of the screens size although is the same resolution and similar density

10642182
getter	setter
i have noticed there are some new features in roo 1.2.1 to facilitate jpa functionality rooentity to roojpaactiverecord but i thought when i open roo shell in sts it could handler that conversion automatically...i can still achieve that manually however after i change the annotation name no matter i use poll now or re-build the project all the getter setter finder entitymanager are error out due to no aspectj injection actually i can see the aspectj files are generated sts just cannot identify them with the entity java file

10642222
hide	show
just hide all spans and then show the one you passed as variable

10642249

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
you want the web audio api html5 rocks tutorial which unfortunately is only partially supported in firefox google-chrome and safari currently

10642275
implements	extends
create another class which does the extends implements

10642369
subclass	abstract-class
you could skip the interface if you ll never have an implementation other than a subclass of the abstract-class

10642377
post	get
i have an application interface that uses http post get using xml messages

10642377
inherited	properties
i have the objects deserialized into the following that cannot be changed extended inherited but no additional properties functions

shadowing	named
and it avoids the dangerous issues that can happen when you start shadowing variable named -- accidentally referring to the wrong x will get you into trouble sooner or later

10642486
folder	directory
reorganize my folder to a shared parent folder to avoid this cmake craziness which presents some security problems for me as some directory are not public

10642497
webclient	httpwebrequest
by analyzing these http requests you will be able to extract the ones that retrieve the data and automate them using webclient or httpwebrequest

10642515
pop-up	dialog
i don t know how you are displaying this window but i suggest using a dialog pop-up

10642515
pop-up	dialog
once the user closes this dialog pop-up you need to then somehow call the api.playtoggle function again to start the slideshow back up

10642545
ubuntu	debian
it is possible that this also might be part of a specific build that debian ubuntu distros are using

10642597
getter	setter
you should also create getter setter moethods instead of using public fields

10642613
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and mozilla firefox seem to work fine

10642728
svg	vml
use vml2svg.xsl and its dependencies as the imported stylesheet of an object which calls transformtoxml to convert vml to svg then convert svg to png using readimageblob and imagemagick

10642730
mootools	zepto
jquery and other similar frameworks like zepto mootools and dojo irons over some of the cracks in javascript such as cross browser inconsistencies and will make things a lot easier

10642730
hide	show
jquery also provides a quick and easy way to show and hide elements on the page via show and hide here how it works

10642783
folder	directory
you will need to create a lib and config folder inside the bin directory of your application

10642783
folder	directory
the .config files go in the config folder and the jar files of from the roles in the install folder go in the lib directory

10642804
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
use firebug with firefox or in google-chrome or safari or ie8 use the developer tools to see what js is loading on your site and use the error console to find fix the errors

10642805
docx	xlsx
i have similar behavior for docx and xlsx files

10642805

after uploading the document if the file is of type docx or xlsx i call a sp webservice to update the metadata

10642851
post	get
sorry for the long post i wanted to get all the details in

10642869
hide	show
i use jquery to hide this button when clicked on to inturn show more button links

10642907

i don t want them to be positioned absolutely because i have a parent element that has a background border and color but when i position the children absolutely the parent doesn t stretch here is the code in its entirety

10642919
xul	xbl
overlays only apply to xul documents not to xbl bindings it is a xul feature and not supported by xbl

10642992
inherited	subclassing
instead other models inherited from the abstract model gaining all of its functionality and it s those subclassing that actually are instantiated

so instead of list ef4type or ienumerable ef4type or iqueryable ef4type

10643136
folder	directory
create a directory named shelled in eclipse dropins folder

10643138

if you do your own view as i do in my apps you can easily show it and hide it by playing with the alpha property

10643155
bids	ssis
you need bids business intelligence development studio to create the dtsx packages and ssis which isn t available with sql express

10643162
uilabel	uibutton
just out of curiosity can you maybe switch from using uilabel s to just using uibutton s with the custom type

10643176

when i submit a post with ajax that is not in english i will get something similar to u4f60 u662f u5982 u4f55 u505a uff1f

10643215
postgresql	mysql
i have a default installation of mysql and postgresql on my os x box and mysql is 2x faster comparing queries that are warmed up by repeatedly executing the query

10643234
shadowing	named
then there is no ugly shadowing issue because you are using distinct named

10643257
post	put
all i can figure is that since i run both domains they think i should put a forwarding script in the hard coded silent post url which basically looks for an originating domain parameter and re-sends the post to the secondary domain

10643292
post	put
i have never used iframe post form lib but the initial working code looks like it is setting up the listeners on document ready in your code you put the set up inside of the change function of file-to-upload

10643292
post	put
but the problem with your code is you put the set up of the post form in the wrong place

10643321
width	margin
with a fixed width and auto margin css will center your div

10643342
mouse	keyboard
but this has the problem of exaggerated events generated when the user moves the mouse and no events at all if he moves out of your script windows or if he s more of a keyboard user

10643426
width	height
i tried adding an svg text using the x y width and height attributes and then prepending an svg rect

10643438
width	height
check box width and change image width if needed then check if image height is greater than box height if not then done

10643458
filtering	grouping
this way you don t have to use the .include and you can even filtering the grouping

10643465
int	double
you can almost do the same thing by converting everything to long double but that can lose precision for large int values

10643502
rss	feed
in one of my pages i pull in two rss feed and display them using the jfeed plugin

10643504
postgresql	mysql
that guide contains examples for doing this for mysql and postgresql earlier in the page

10643543
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i am using jquery to prevent the default action and this works fine in google-chrome safari firefox and ie 8 9 but in ie7 the browser is trying to make use of the of the anchor in the default fashion

10643557
screens	tablet
these are also based on the physical resolution of the screens so may vary across devicesâ for example a 1024x720 tablet with a system bar actually has a bit less space available to the application due to it being used by the system bar.

10643590
post	get
i have registered a custome imodelbinder or attempted to but when my post action is called my custom binder isn t hit and i just get the default serialization with the null arrays - even though wireshark shows me the incoming complex object contains array elements

10643602
dotnetzip	sharpziplib
dotnetzip is much easier to use than sharpziplib example of zipping all files in folder

10643613
pull	push
also if you login you should try git pull heroku master then try to git push heroku master

10643637
free	malloc
a small template program for midi sysex input using various malloc d spaces would free memory in the wm_destroy bit of the wndproc but when i transplanted this to a larger program it crashed on exit

10643662
mp3	ogg
i am using a plugin that asks for mp3 and ogg versions of the file

10643662
mp3	ogg
for some reason every other browser uses the mp3 but firefox looks for the ogg and then i get some sort of error and it won t play

10643680
bash	zsh
as you can see they appear to be identical - there s certainly no color issues in either zsh or vim that i ve noticed i don t use bash much

10643680
bash	zsh
however i do not think i ve messed with anything that would affect the solarized colorings between bash and zsh in vim

10643688
mp3	ogg
you should try to force the content-type header to mp3 or ogg when you re serving up a file like that

10643692
subtract	add
though it s not possible to do the operators you could always just create add or concat subtract and compare methods..

10643695
submit	submission
by giving a unique value each time and setting the session data to the same value you can also avoid duplicate submission if the user clicks submit twice

10643696
mp3	ogg
i use buzz.js for playing music you still have to provide a mp3 file as well as an ogg one but it solves your problem and works on every browser

10643708
dotnetzip	sharpziplib
i also agree with the suggestion of antonio bakula to use dotnetzip instead of sharpziplib

10643708
folder	directory
if you want to enumerate the files or directory inside a specific folder you can instead use directory.enumeratefiles or directory.enumeratedirectories

10643712
comparator	icomparer
most of the linq ordering methods are supported in linq to entities with the exception of those that accept an icomparer because the comparator cannot be translated to the data source

10643732
google-chrome	firefox
notice that for ie 9 it works the same way as other browsers google-chrome firefox but when i changed the document mode in the developer tools to ie 8 the problem showed up

10643746

there is also a background image on each column that is scaled to fit either the height or width whichever is greater

10643747
getter	setter
and myconnectiondao is a pojo with getter and setter for above properties

10643779
textmate	sublimetext
has anone had any luck both compiling and running coffeescript files in sublimetext 2 with the textmate bundle

10643785
getter	setter
and i also know that you have to either use getter or setter or you have to notify the observers with self willchangevalueforkey thekey and self didchangevalueforkey thekey when you change the values programmatically

10643785
getter	setter
getter and setter implementation

10643811
equals	gethashcode
if you override one equals and not the other gethashcode then you run the risk of encountering inconsistent behavior when using gethashcode plopping your objects in a collection implemented as a hash table versus equals

10643815
equals	gethashcode
if you implement equals but not gethashcode then if your class is used in any data structure which uses hashing etc. it will behave incorrectly

10643823
width	height
because if you call it before the image is loaded its width and height are 0 both

10643837
range	minimum
but for some reason the numericupdown controls throw an error as the value 0 is out side the minimum maximum range the minimum is set to 1 so basically it is reading it as 0

10643842
google-chrome	firefox
it s better to first inspect your code online using google-chrome or firefox s inspect element or firebug

10643883
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the print styles work just fine with google-chrome safari firefox and ie9 but completely breaks in ie7 and ie8

10643886
boost	stl
boost serialize already has methods for serializing stl containers so that is not the problem.

10643894
exponent	modulo
let s say you already have a modulo and exponent from

10643895
versioning	upgrade
i have upgrade my websphere application server from versioning 6.1 to 8.0 but my application does not work anymore and gives the following error

10643923

a tooltip has more in common with a popover but they are generally regarded as a popup historically

10643927
exponent	modulo
let s say you already have a modulo and exponent from

10643959
single-quotes	double-quotes
short answer use double-quotes instead of single-quotes as pavel suggested

10643962
exponent	modulo
i have a library that lets you create the binary data to import rsa keys in modulo and exponent now

10643962
exponent	modulo
let s say you already have a modulo and exponent from

10643963
width	height
for a 2.5d projection otherwise known as an orthographic projection the simplest method is to choose a 2d vector for the third dimension and use it as weights to add the depth to the width and height

10644011
bufferstrategy	bufferedimage
on a bufferedimage in real-time in conjunction with a bufferstrategy

10644014
children	parent
so that if the parent s dirty bit is set then the children will also need to be redrawn for the whole picture inside this view to be drawn correctly

10644014
button	checkbox
also each of the nice looking button or labels are just a uiview object with a drawrect that was already implemented that can draw a good looking image of what it is -- a button a checkbox a label or any other widget

10644015
put	get
by using such static methods you can build dynamically expressions like m m.name nick with a couple instructions...than you put in and them...done you get and expression you can apply to an exixting iqueryable

10644091
jar	war
as of ava ee 6 is you no longer need to separate ejbs from servlets and can use them together in the very same jar in the war file

10644100
oncreate	setcontentview
the crash itself happens on the setcontentview r.layout.foo method call in oncreate

10644100
mdpi	hdpi	tablet	mdpi	tablet	hdpi
we ve seen this on at least 2.2 - 4.0.3 on mdpi hdpi xhdpi phones and tablet

10644115
udp	tcp
there is also a slight glitch in the docs when you open the page for basic_datagram_socket async_connect the example in there is instantiating tcp sockets instead of udp ones

10644116
inherited	properties
then we need to inherited from csharpclientcodegenerator which doesn t really generate anything but just tells ria which generators to use by overriding some of its properties

10644129
fflush	gets
you don t need both and you should close the output stream writer rather than the input stream so it gets fflush

10644152
width	height
be careful when your image was rotated it s width and height hadn t switched

10644164
zlib	libpng
several things i found in the cocos2d forums lead me to believe it s an issue with the zlib implementation on ios but i ve tried using both stb_image and lodepng to avoid zlib and those libraries actually performed even worse than libpng

10644178
hide	show
finally you ll want to use a bit of jquery to hide and show the different field sets when the user selects a different job type

10644178
hide	show
to do that attach a .change handler to the select_tag element and have it hide all the fieldsets then show the one fieldset with an id that matches the selected job type

10644200
jtextfield	jlabel
if i enter a letter a jlabel is displayed and the color of jtextfield changes in red

10644200
jtextfield	jlabel
if i delete the letter the jlabel will disappear and the color of jtextfield is normal

10644204
google-chrome	firefox
hovering over a will rotate the element in firefox but not google-chrome

10644247
width	height
changing the canvas s style will change the canvas s client width and client height not the actual width and height so the content of the canvas will end up being scaled stretched

10644247
width	height
you can t specify the width and height of a canvas in percentages

10644247
width	height
example of the problem here note that no canvas shows up when width and height are percentages

10644247
width	height
you need to set the canvas s style to be width 100 and height 100

10644260
uiview	subviews
i have tried adding a subviews but it simply overlaps the dvc below it and i have not been able to figure out a way to add a dvc as a subviews to a uiview

10644279
getter	setter
i have a class called db details that encapsulates a bunch of string properties with getter and setter

10644284
cos	sin
from i understand from the code you have the angle between the sin element and the cos element of the given x y coordinate

10644307
spaces	delimiter
and does not consist entirely of delimiter characters defaults to spaces and tab

10644339
apache	nginx
andrew gerrand has a good blog post about this for nginx but the principle is the same for apache

10644437
gif	png
the background of both 8-bit-transparency png the ball and 1-bit transparency gif the hand allow the background of the svg page to shine through correctly

10644440
background-image	background-color
the browser disables some css rules like background-image and background-color some browsers have options to enable them

10644458
subtract	add
uppercase the letter convert it to ascii subtract a then add 1

10644458
multiplying	add
as you calculate as per the previous recommendation multiplying the previous sum by 10 then add the new value

10644474
int	chars
you can try by convert the chars to int and rest 96 you have to take care of out of range chars or use regex

10644524
stdout	stderr
kernel#quietly uses the following to silence stdout and stderr

10644526
textview	imageview
i have a simple combination of one imageview and two textview over it

10644526
textview	imageview
i would like to make the textview overlap the imageview and then save the combination as a whole as png for example

10644526
textview	imageview
i know i can layer the textview over the imageview using a framelayout which i am already doing

10644529
super	self
you can override __setitem__ self key val method and use super specialdict self .__setitem__ to access parent object s dict s method

10644573
folder	directory
place your .dae files in a folder titled models in your root directory

10644599
liferay	web-inf
jaxen and dom4j are liferay dependencies that reside in its web-inf lib folder while jaxen also exists in weblogic system classpath

10644599
liferay	web-inf
you can try to fix this situation for example by moving dom4j.jar from liferay to weblogic system classpath or by setting prefer-web-inf-classes option in the web-inf weblogic.xml deployment descriptor of the liferay application

10644636
ubuntu	debian
debian and ubuntu over the last couple of years

10644651
google-chrome	firefox
unfortunately i can t make it work in google-chrome it works in firefox and most of my users use google-chrome

10644685
width	height
notes avoid trying to execute this code on the oncreate method since you re likely to be trying to fetch the width and height of the view prior to it being drawn and therefor will result in an error since the dimensions of the bitmap can not be 0

10644690
comparator	comparable
you ll want to look at the comparable interface and the comparator interface

10644690
comparator	comparable
implement comparable if this is the only way your objects can be compared comparator otherwise

10644694
post	put
the most problematic expressions are html tags and because it interferes with the way i put my post variable together

10644699
multicastdelegate	delegation
an important thing to note however is that because of the unfortunate way multicastdelegate and delegate.combine are implemented attempting to use covariant delegation with any code that will attempt to delegate.combine may cause a crash at run-time since delegate.combine requires two delegation that are the precise same type

10644699
multicastdelegate	delegation
it would be nice if there were a generic method to combine delegation of different types the method itself would have to be given a type which could be satisfied by both delegation though the product of such combination couldn t be a multicastdelegate since instances of that class only hold type information for one delegation type

10644701
cpu	processors
suffering a cache miss can stall the processors for hundreds of cpu cycles waiting for the slow bus to supply the data

10644718
setcontentview	findviewbyid
you need to call setcontentview before findviewbyid

10644744
libevent	epoll
python s select module is just a wrapper around select poll and epoll syscalls whereas libev and libevent implement an event loop

10644805
getter	setter
events deal with multicasting the call to multiple delegates you can add custom logic to allow or not a delegate to be added the same way you can wrap a field in a property and add some logic on the getter setter for the property

10644816
put	get
i have put my code at so that you can get a feel for it but here is the gist of it

10644892
folder	directory
these .h files are physically located 2 directory up and one down in an include folder

10644979
int	chars
example.cpp in constructor â store3items store3items const t1 const t2 const t3 with t1 std basic_string t2 chars 12 t3 int â

10644979
int	chars
example.cpp 50 50 instantiated from â storeitemsbase createholder const t1 const t2 const t3 with t1 std basic_string t2 chars 12 t3 int â

10645052
getter	setter
one further thought if protobuf objects have getter setter or appropriately named fields one could simply use jackson json processor s data binding

10645052
getter	setter
by default it handles public getter any setter and public fields but these are just default visibility levels and can be changed

10645053
hex	binary
i have never tried to convert hex utf-8 code points to binary before turns out it s actually quite easy when you get your head around it

10645133
post	put
and the user is filling out a form of information on a client that i will eventually patch put post to that resource

10645137
int	double
otherwise i would have to make an instance for int int float double etc

10645166
super	implements	super	self
so you can just implements those methods to change what they do using super specialdict self .__setitem__ key value or dict.__setitem__ self key value to refer to the normal implementation when you need to

10645187
mongoid	mongomapper
hi can some one help me map this to rails and mongo i have two days on the subject but i can t seem to figure it out i mean make the models for these two collections in mongoid or mongomapper

10645196

when i look at inspect element in chrome i can see that the css max-width has over-written the javascript generated width but it has not chamged the height and that remains as per the script

10645275
touchesbegan	touchesended
most probably you will notice the events responsible for touchesbegan and touchesended for tapping

10645283
interpolation	splines
if you don t know what the function should look like you can use simple splines or interpolation schemes

10645304
tolower	toupper
toupper and tolower fall short in this issue unfortunately and there s no other c++ construct available

10645312
freeglut	glew
i ve been attempting to install glew and freeglut to use with visual studio 2010

10645317
nsdata	nsjsonserialization
i m creating a simple nsurlrequest using post and setting its body to an nsdata build using the nsjsonserialization

10645321
folder	directory
if you have that exact directory structure you can use relative imports to import from the parent folder

10645336
interpolation	splines
if there s not much going on between any two of your data points ie the actual function doesn t have any bumps whose peaks are not represented by one of your data points then the splines method of interpolation is one of the best choices you can make

10645377
build.gradle	gradlew
just add apply plugin eclipse at the beginning of your build.gradle and then try running gradlew eclipse

10645386
getter	setter
given that the property is called movieposition the getter should be called -movieposition no underscore and the setter should be called -setmovieposition no underscore and the first letter of the property name capitalized

10645386
getter	setter
while it is allowed to specify the names of the setter and the getter neither kvc nor kvo pay attention to that

10645401
python-mode	pymacs
mainly because in the python-mode package there is some more stuff to use with python emacs like pycomplete pymacs etc.

10645430
width	height
you specify that your view will change its width and height automatically and can get the right values you need to get from there

10645449
public	protected
member functions in class b can access any public or protected member variables in class a

10645449
public	protected
member functions in class b can access any public of protected member functions in class a

10645470
folder	directory
i have successfully added the fbconnect folder to my application as well as the src directory to my header search paths in build settings

10645540
google-chrome	firefox
however i found that this would fix the issue for ie7 and still work in ie8 9 as well as firefox but it now stopped working in google-chrome this for this.valueof function is undefined

10645541
treemap	treeset
treemap and this treeset doesn t use your equals method at all except if you fetch the entryset or keyset

10645541
equals	compareto
that class s compareto must return 0 to indicate that two artifact s are equals

10645557
rtp	sip	udp	rtp
i am having some trouble packetizing an h.264 stream using sip and rtp over udp

10645605
tinyint	varchar
i think tinyint is better than varchar in this case

10645624
google-chrome	firefox
i ll just make a note that this flicker occurs in ie and google-chrome while it does not occur in firefox

10645624
updatepanel	contentplaceholder
wrapping the contentplaceholder in the master page with an updatepanel

min	max
the headline aggregation can be a sum min or max value but even if the individual values are of type float the aggregation will be of type integer

10645664
background-image	background-size
you can use css3 to fit the background-image using background-size

10645666
mp3	wav
this is where wav or mp3 files come into play since they play sound as a wave they can play any sound really

10645692
mp3	ogg

10645713
wav	aiff
java sound supports the following audio file formats aiff au and wav

10645764
int	double
the cool thing is the udf can serve double duty by returning the safely converted int value

10645775
post	get
i found a stack overflow post with a sample showing how to get the duration of an avi file

10645785
dsl	dynamic-languages
a call to expect is defining a structure for rspec to execute using rspec s own custom dsl and system of matchers. gary bernhardt has a rather neat screencast in which he argues that the mystery of rspec actually falls out naturally from a dynamic-languages like ruby

10645847
for-loop	loops
since my carousels are created in a foreach loops i cannot know how many of them i will have so i tried to call the function in a for-loop

10645883
freebsd	netbsd
in bsd freebsd netbsd etc use

10645903
udp	tcp	sctp	tcp	sctp	icmp	sctp	udp	icmp	tcp	icmp	udp
layers 1 and 2 fit very closely layer 3 is roughly ip routing layer 4 is roughly tcp udp sctp icmp and so on

10645903
udp	tcp	sctp	tcp	sctp	icmp	sctp	udp	icmp	tcp	icmp	udp
send works with stream datagram and raw sockets so it could straddle multiple layers of the stack -- you could use it to send tcp udp sctp or icmp packets or scribble directly on the wire if you wish

10645939
sudoers	passwd
for that scenario i added a all nopasswd line in my sudoers file that allows the jenkins user to run usr sbin installer without providing a passwd

10646506
implements	extends
here i have class which extends activity an implements surfaceholder.callback

10646510
hide	show
normally the toolbar will have list of items needed and you only hide show them

10646518
accelerometer	gyroscope
the devicemotion property is only available on devices having both an accelerometer and a gyroscope

10646518
accelerometer	gyroscope
i expect some simple but good enough math calculation upon the senser data from accelerometer and gyroscope to finally calculate the roll yaw and pitch

10646576
inherited	properties
you don t have to worry about messy inherited heirarchies - you can just alter the properties at will

10646601
google-chrome	firefox
tested with firefox 12 and google-chrome 18.0.1025.168

10646601
google-chrome	firefox
note how in webkit browsers google-chrome the file size changes but in firefox it didn t update the file size

10646601
google-chrome	firefox
both firefox and google-chrome will see that the file size is less than 2mb and add it to the form

10646601
google-chrome	firefox
a user chooses it in the form and both google-chrome and firefox show bytes 40 000 - 50 000 in the textarea

10646615
scrypt	salt
the keys are so small in fact that you can have the user choose a signing passphrase feed it to scrypt 1 with their user id as the salt and use the output as the private key you just need to frob three bits to make it a valid ed25519 private key

10646626
hid	keyboard
the barcode reader behaves like a hid device like if the input was typed on a keyboard

10646627

the library should support connecting disconnecting and most importantly accessing the byte stream of data at transport layer tcp udp packets with tcp udp header

10646631
google-chrome	firefox
i use xdebug helper in google-chrome or easy xdebug in firefox to initialize xdebug my problem occurs regardless of which i use

10646639
integer	unsigned
use an unsigned integer type to get more eventid and userid s out of the same number of bytes

10646639
integer	unsigned
if you are only using ipv4 addresses store the ip as an unsigned 4-byte integer and use inet_aton and inet_ntoa to convert back and forth

10646659
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
typed arrays are not supported in ie 10 firefox 4 google-chrome 7 safari 5.1 and opera 11.6 and mobile support is shaky but improving

10646669
width	height
and the side-buttons class if i remember correctly keeps the button width inherited from a nested div with class two columns but the height adjusts depending on the text

10646707

realloc	malloc
in the first case the second malloc originally the first was crashed and in the second case it crashed a realloc that appears later in the same function

10646836
multiplication	modulo
using the modulo allows you to map every possible output of the matrix multiplication encryption to a letter in the alphabet which is b which lets you store the encrypted message in the form of a string of letters

10646842
public	protected
the function f can access only the private and protected parts of the base class but only public parts of the derived class

10646915
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	calloc	malloc
unless ptr is null it must have been returned by an earlier call to malloc calloc or realloc

10646915
free	malloc
this could be anything - you could be overwriting the internal structures of malloc which could cause a crash later on some invocation of malloc or free

10646915
free	malloc	free	realloc	realloc	malloc
also after the realloc cont 0 cont will no longer be a pointer returned by malloc since it s as if you d written free cont

10646926
post	get
i saw a post about it but couldn t get it to work

10646944
google-chrome	safari
i am using jquery browser detection function to alert a different value on different browser but seem it is conflict with safari and google-chrome

10646944
google-chrome	safari

if you want to get the values of one column only why did you put all the columns values in to result string

10647169
implements	extends
some important points are to extends element and implements ielementsizing

10647212
mouseleave	mouseenter
however this creates a funky blinking effect because on mouseleave of the main image i hide the three small images which immediately triggers a mouseenter for the main image because of the overlap and the mouse still being on top of the main image

10647212
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works great on safari and google-chrome but not on firefox and ie where the images still blink

10647212
mouseleave	mouseenter
i tried to work with switches that i flip on off as i mouseenter mouseleave the various images but that doesn t work either because the events seem to trigger in different orders

10647265
folder	directory
i was wondering how could i get a .wav file without creating a whole new folder in the application release directory

10647273
hide	show
and on jsp page2 whatever show and hide content is there rendered using

10647282
children	parent

10647282
children	parent
then instead of just exiting the parent you wait for all the children to finish

10647309
width	height
both height and width on both parent and child is fill_parent

10647312
lxml	html5lib	lxml	beautifulsoup	html5lib	beautifulsoup
the best solution is to install an external parser lxml or html5lib and use beautifulsoup with that parser

10647376
folder	directory
with it you can change your current directory allowing php to think you are in model folder

10647378
mouseover	mouseout
but the issue with adding html dynamically with js is that the resulting dom elements would not have the necessary event handlers attached to them in the case of hovercard mouseover mouseout and probably others

10647394
profiling	instrumentation
while profiling the app i don t see any valid memory leak in instrumentation tool

10647520
for-loop	loops
well this is quite embarrassing and i couldn t manage to do it on the interview that i had today i was applying for a junior position now trying at home i made something that works statically i mean not using a loops which is kind of useless but i don t know if i m not getting enough hours of sleep or something but i can t figure it out how my for-loop should look like

10647521
apache	nginx
the easiest solution is to add a rewrite rule to your nginx or apache server like so

10647577
apache	nginx
the easiest solution is to add a rewrite rule to your nginx or apache server to internally rewrite all calls to the same index.html page

10647593

caliburn	prism
before continuing i have very little experience with prism although i have worked with caliburn before so i am going to assume it works in similar manner

10647770
folder	directory
once you develop your code just upload whole webroot app directory inside public_html folder

10647827
oncreate	onstart
the flow is oncreate -- onstart -- onresume

10647840
client-side	server-side
although you re looking for a client-side solution the most stable and reliable method of doing this one that adheres to the robustness principle of being conservative in what you send would be to use a server-side javascriptserializer to serialize your c# object into a json string

10647849
folder	directory
i have used the below function to store images locally in a folder created in document directory

10647849

i know that there is a way to make a for-loop work like a while loops

10647917
folder	directory
if that is not the case wamp s htdocs equivalente in apache s xampp is the www directory folder

10647917
folder	directory
create a folder inside the www directory say sites put some files in there then run wamp and write for this example

10647920
hive	hdfs
i am able to query on mongodb and i want the same for nginx log too for which i need a simple parser to read nginx logs and convert to maybe json csv or put it in hive hdfs

10647953
free	malloc
bk used to be a chunk of user data but now it s a chunk of free data so malloc is allowed to scribble over the memory as it sees fit

rule #1 dont mix new delete with malloc free

10648976
realloc	malloc
if you re allocating with malloc in the first place and you need a bigger heap space then you need to call realloc which will return you a new pointer which may not map to the same memory areas as arr therefore you should not use it

10649995
hash	md5
you could calculate a hash code such as md5

10649995
hash	md5
if both jars have the same md5 hash code it s very likely the content is the same as well

10650078
public	protected
to access this from outside you will have to create a public method in the child class that calls the protected method of the parent

decimal	ieee
what bigdecimal basically does is to store a decimal number as a string instead of using ieee 754 notation that is dividing a decimal into an exponent and a mantissa and then doing a decimal convergence as a term 2 -n series

10657382
multiplying	subtract
now bigdecimal must convert this string representation into a usable numeric format before doing any arithmetic operations adding subtract multiplying dividing which is the reason why bigdecimal has a low performance compared to ieee 754 double and float numeric formats

10657385

10657970
min	max
this is fine except when retrieving the min max values for sched_other

10657970
min	max	ubuntu	linux	range	min	range	max
since scheduling is system dependent if i get the priority of the current process as sched_other and try to get the min max values on a ubuntu or other linux systems i ve come across my values would be 0-0 which won t work for trying to set a valid priority range

10657992

comm	grep
diff unlike johlo s grep answer cares about order works on non-sorted files unlike johnshen64 s comm answer

10659073
integer	fractions
if m is greater than or equal to 10 -3 but less than 10 7 then it is represented as the integer part of m in decimal form with no leading zeroes followed by . u002e followed by one or more decimal digits representing the fractions part of m

10659073
integer	fractions
the magnitude is then represented as the integer part of a as a single decimal digit followed by . u002e followed by decimal digits representing the fractions part of a followed by the letter e u0045 followed by a representation of n as a decimal integer as produced by the method integer.tostring int

you should use either a treemap or a linkedhashmap instead of a hashmap depending on if you want elements sorted by their natural order or insertion order respectively

10659167
comparator	comparable
a treemap will sort keys based on their natural order which means the keys must implement comparable or you have to provide your own comparator in order to determine the ordering

10659202
backgroundworker	dispatchertimer
then dispatchertimer calls a backgroundworker to apply the filter so i can cancel the backgroundworker

10659255
equals	gethashcode
given that you have a custom type though you ll want to override equals and gethashcode so that it works well with linq

10659255
equals	gethashcode
so it s not just enough to implement equals you must also implement gethashcode when using methods of this type with custom classes

10659255
equals	gethashcode
now that you have gethashcode and equals overridden i like implementing myself as well you can use except

10659255
equals	gethashcode
also as a side note some types such as keyvaluepair tuple and anonymous types already implement equals and gethashcode correctly for equivalence in such a way that they take into account their individual components

10659595
button	checkbox
radio button checkbox and button are all actually the same type of field but with different flags set

if you need to show it later using js than you should also hide it using js making it accessible for users without js

10659623
client-side	server-side
i read up on ajax long polling from the server since jquery is client-side and php is server-side but i am unsure how i could implement it here

10659632
rss	feed

10659636
maven	pom.xml
i have a maven multi-module project whose parent pom.xml states

10659645

addition	multiplication
most current generation cpus support fused multiplication and addition fma operations that is a b+c is performed in a single cycle

10659781
spaces	delimiter
posted the above answer before you clarified you want up to 10 set of numbers delimiter by spaces

10659783
client-side	server-side
if you re wanting to know how to disable the server-side click handling client-side you can add a client-side click handler like this

10659990
opera	firefox
this will work in recent-ish webkit opera and mozilla browsers although only firefox has an implementation of document.caretpositionfrompoint

10659995
width	height
it d be really easy to turn the point object into the width and height values you need

10660029
vbscript	jscript
as vbscript has no native sort you ll have to use other techniques javascript jscript with a suitable sort function a disconnected ado recordset or a .net arraylist with a bit of creative formatting

10660051
client-side	server-side
you definitely should not generate the html yourself as you sad and instead just bind the result set to any kind of server-side data-grid or use some kind of client-side jquery datagrid implementation

10660092
prng	random
namely i have a pseudo-random number generator prng and as one may know they involve an internal state that changes every time new random numbers are generated

10660092
put	get
we could also create one master rng object and pass it around with pointers instead of making it global which would put us back on square 1 so that classes that need random numbers get a pointer to the rng object in them

10660111
oncreate	setcontentview
in the oncreate im using setcontentview main.xml

10660130
children	parent
this mean the fork works but the standard output client browser is totally lost for everybody all children and the parent

10660149
rspec	minitest
i mostly think in ruby test unit minitest rspec and cucumber though my cuke skills are stale but if other languages frameworks have this figured out i d love to see what they re doing too

10660160
int	chars
because we cannot test for int -0 we cannot refer to the index of the last chars as -0

10660167
children	parent
then i need to make it a tree nested output like the json shows with parent children - just like if you were creatign a file system directory

10660204
teamcity	jenkins
re just looking for a ci server then the free version of go works well as does the free version of teamcity jenkins and atlassian bamboo

10660251
maven	m2e
i had this problem but using maven m2e and running it from inside eclipse

this happens in both firefox and google-chrome so i assume it must be according to spec in some way

10660412
case-sensitive	case-insensitive	postgresql	mysql
since mysql indexes are already case-insensitive i m guessing you re dealing with postgresql which creates case-sensitive indexes by default

10660446
hide	show
when you call show the changes to that s why you need to call hide or remove that style part

10660474
getter	setter
the second step will create a matching setter and getter

10660504
hide	show
i d take advantage of the classes to show hide stuff with css you re adding the classes but not using them

10660548
equals	tostring
if that s the case convert your integer tostring and check if it equals

10660554
spaces	delimiter
if you specify a scope like api you ll need to explicitly request a refresh token by also specifying refresh token in your scope spaces delimiter

10660559
int	chars
which implicitly does the same thing since the expression c - a + 1 is implicitly cast to an int since java does all non- long int math anything involving chars s byte s short s and or int s by converting everything to int s first

10660559
int	chars
what you had cast the int result to a chars which would be represented by the chars whose ascii value is that number something b w 1 and 26 which isn t something readable

10660572
button	checkbox
when the button is clicked it loops through all the rows which are checked and removes the first cell which is checkbox and adding rest of the cell wrapped in a row to next table i assume it would wrap the resulting cells into the row but thats not the case because when i select multiple rows it appends directly at the end of last rows last cell

10660583
postgresql	mysql
this may be done slightly differently in postgresql and mysql but in postgresql you can create many tables that are partitions of the larger table or on a partition

popover	tooltip
i usually create a new .js file with all my custom functions and include that in my page the same way you are including the popover and tooltip scripts

10660757
hide	show
another approach much easier and extremely inefficient would be to parse the whole list into different blocks and then use javascript to hide them and show the correct one

10660758
int	chars
a chars a short int or an int bit-field all either signed or not or an object of enumeration type may be used in an

10668756
super	self
so my question is what is the need of super form self .__init__ parent or what purpose it is trying to full fill in this code

10668790
keydown	keyup
the autosuggestion should be drop down the list of items find those items that begin with the string that a user typed in the edit control but do not select one of them do not display all other items and finally do not change select item when keydown or keyup occurs only highlight the item and select only when a user press enter

10668796

for-loop	loops
use a normal for-loop not a for in loops

10668951
macports	homebrew
others say the same thing about homebrew but i have only worked with macports and it makes installation of modules too easy

10668951
macports	homebrew
another approach to using package managers like macports or homebrew is to use a virtualenv and install python and all related modules there

adding a cashapelayer and setting its path property in layoutsublayersoflayer which doesn t animate inside uiview animations since path isn t implicitly animatable

10669069
spaces	delimiter
for most languages this is relatively straightforward because i can use the spaces delimiter between words to tokenize a paragraph into words for the dictionary but for example chinese does not use a spaces character between words

10669108
versioning	upgrade
i strongly suggest that you upgrade to the latest versioning of jquery ui and use that autocomplete plugin instead

10669113
put	get
i just edited a aouto-generated servlet in netbeans and within the ide it works fine but nom matter where i put it on my tomcat server i get a 404 or it just tries to download the .class file

10669114
subtraction	addition
i have nodes that perform arithmetical operations addition subtraction etc

10669115

there is no grid like control in jquery mobile there are controls like list and collapsible but nothing like grids with flexibility like sorting grouping etc

10669120
screens	tablet
i ve seen several tablet apps that split the screens into two parts

10669133
vim	gedit	vim	emacs	emacs	gedit
vim v gedit v emacs i wanted to use a regular expression which would be more human readable and easier to write then creating a massive tree or as user joel suggested just going over the words with a loop

10669148
versioning	upgrade
also you may want to upgrade to a more recent versioning of the autocomplete plugin

10669187

afterwards i try to link my visual studio 2010 with portaudio_x86.lib and include the directory where it is located the output folder of the .dll creation image 2 and 3

10669231
uiview	subviews
a better solution would be to insert a custom uiview inside your scroll view and draw all the texts manually instead of creating tons of subviews

10669235
folder	directory
i have all my fonts in a folder labeled fonts in my root directory rootdirectory fonts

10669246

innodb	myisam
i have a huge project written in php and the data is stored in mysql mostly myisam tables and a bit of innodb

10669321
google-chrome	firefox
you can process iframed content in a userscript because google-chrome and firefox process iframe d pages just as if they were the main page

10669327
stateless	stateful
dealing with a stateless cluster is often simpler then dealing with a stateful cluster

10669332
postgresql	mysql
i think postgresql is most common in the python world with mysql close behind

10669332
postgresql	mysql
and either way unless you want to use database-engine-specific things you can use any database - be it sqlite mysql postgresql oracle or anything else supported by sqlalchemy

10669416
min	max	range	min	range	max	range	minimum	minimum	max
all that is left for you to do is prepare an ienumerable of tuple where the first int is minimum ip int-value the second is the maximum and the tvalue is the data that is associated with that min max range

10669421
client-side	server-side
php executes on the server-side long before the client-side code its run

ubuntu	debian
on ubuntu and debian

10669529
rss	feed
i was thinking rss feed

10669564
int	chars
i think the problem is that you are trying to read a chars into an int

10669564
int	chars
the problem is that there s no int in the stream just a chars

10669589
flask	django
i hear flask is pretty light though all i personally have much experience with is django

10669601
calloc	malloc
you shouldn t cast the return pointer of malloc calloc in c

10669641

i am trying to avoid creating another nsstring for each uilabel in my 2nd vc since i ll have many more in the future

10669689
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
with the introduction of ios 5 we got the ability to write our own container controllers view controllers that can host other view controllers inside themselves just like uinavigationcontroller and uitabbarcontroller do

10669691
fseek	ftell
use ftell to store the position of the file an fseek to go back to it later

10669709
put	get
the form displays when i remove the php code but when i put the code back in i just get a blank white page

10669719
post	get
combined to do post then get its probably better to use separate functions but this will work for th e demo

10669721
fseek	ftell
the process is simple with ftell and fseek

10669736
width	height
basically this is for a fluid width site where i want to cap the box height and auto adjust the image size to show all the text without going over the height

10669765
minimum	max
it s working perfectly now but i don t know if it s the right way to do it cos i can t figure out how to adapt it so that i can add extra search fields for bathrooms minimum price max price zip etc

10669778
coalesce	isnull
coalesce function works a bit different coalesce will take any number of parameters and return the first non- null value i prefer coalesce over isnull cause

10669826
put	get
problem is when i get back to where i am trying to put it into an arraylist once returned it seems to work fine

10669845
free	malloc
you need a call to free for each call to malloc

10669845
free	malloc
that doesn t necessarily mean that each malloc call in your source code needs to have a corresponding free call

10669845
free	malloc
i should also note that free ing all malloc ed memory isn t absolutely required

10669862
width	height
at that point you can move text from the end of the current textarea to the beginning of the next textarea until the scroll height width goes away

10669886
width	height
or sometimes you will get called an onmeasure with measurespec.exactly at which point you have no choice but to use the supplied width or height

10669888
hide	show
i m using it basically to show hide advanced options on the form

10669890
width	height
you re better off either avoiding the iframe and simply modifying the webview contents directly or giving the iframe 100 height and 100 width so that it takes up the entire webview

10669948
pop-up	dialog
if the name already exists another dialog box will pop-up to alert the user that existing data will be replaced

10669975

10670146
ubuntu	linux
linux ubuntu 12.04

10670166
selecteditem	selectedindex
because it s easier i bound to selectedindex instead of selecteditem

10670213
int	chars
in this case both an int array or a chars array seem convenient for the board representation

10670213
int	chars
i suspect that since every element of the chars array has size of 1 byte it may be slower because of a different representation in memory consider a modern computer which has at least 32 bits for int representation .

10670223
chown	chmod
and i used chown wwwdata and chmod 777

10670239
int	chars
chars s are generally 1-byte aligned and int s are generally 4-byte aligned

10670239
int	chars
assuming you are working with a machine that follows this standard both arrays will store their content as contiguous blocks of memory the int array being 4x the size of the chars array

10670262
crypt	salt
on the php crypt document page the crypt_blowfish example has a trailing for the salt argument it s this

10670279
typedef	struct
because in c++ the struct you defined is named s while in c it s named struct s which is why you often see typedef struct used in c code

10670291
google-chrome	firefox
when i access the system using firefox or google-chrome browsers the user will not be able to re-submit the â œ_createtoeditâ partial view which will contain the modelstate errors and any data annotation errors

10670291
google-chrome	firefox
where this problem is happening on all the browsers ie9 firefox google-chrome

10670311
hash	salt
if so the hash are still going to be different due to the random salt

10670312
width	height
basically if the rectangle the window is going to be exceeds the maximum width or height it adjusts it and sends it on so it shouldn t cause flickering

10670318
crossover	mutation
a genetic algorithm which does mutation crossover operations on randomised sample portfolios will find a very good solution pretty fast

10670330
portrait	landscape
also even if you re able to make the layout look nice in portrait mode it ll probably be not even close to that in landscape

10670372
listview	gridview	switching	screens
i don t know how you have them on the screens but you should switching to using some sort of adapterview listview gridview etc.. and then load an adapter with all of your teams

10670501
debian	centos
i used to build it on a 32-bit debian box and run it on a 64-bit centos 5.3 server box and it worked fine

10670501
versioning	upgrade
should i somehow put an earlier versioning of libstdc++ on the dev box and try to link against it or try to upgrade the prod box

10670526
viewdidappear	viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewdidappear
in first detailviewcontroller s viewdidload and in viewwillappear and in viewdidappear

10670530

10670555
glut	glew
i do not want glut or any other middleware utility library in between to do the dirty work for me that includes glew

10670614
glfw	glew
here is a sample with glew and glfw copied from my project

10670701
int	chars
but it might give you a hint - probably that int and chars will be much the same

10670701
int	chars
so if you store data in the chars array and then process it somehow using int types you will probably get an extra instruction each time a conversion is made between the two

10670766
min	max
-selecting a single record from each group based on the max or min value doesn t matter which one contained in a different field such as support_id

10670785
libpcap	wireshark
google for tools like tcpdump tcptrace tcpsplit libpcap wireshark

10670801
intersect	contains
sql server returns the error order by items must appear in the select list if the statement contains a union intersect or except operator.

10670834
portrait	landscape
basically the current orientation is portrait and i want it to be forced to be in landscape

10670870
jtextpane	jeditorpane
for editable text use components like jeditorpane or jtextpane

10670899
google-chrome	firefox
i tried on the three i have installed firefox google-chrome and ie 8 i believe and none of them execute anything

10670910
post	get
after form post you can get all select box values

10670949
portrait	landscape
there s no way you can force your device into portrait mode if it s in landscape and vice-versa.all you can do is tell your application to be in a particular mode either landscape or portrait.you can do that by -

10670962
width	margin
i want to get rid of the white space because i have a centered window that grows to 100 width and because of the invisible margin on the left it extends farther to the right and causes the white space on both sides to be asymmetrical

10670974
width	margin
i m working on a webpage and i have the width of my div tag set and am using margin 0 auto

10670975
hide	show
if this is the only h2 with an anchor tag in it on the page then i would add the jquery hide and show methods to the script

10671018
int	chars
for example with 128-bit simd you can process 16 bytes per instruction or 4 32-bit int per instruction and chars might be 4 times faster because of this alone

10671052
put	get
i mean it s ok to have a comment with a simple text but if you want to put complex info there like i showed in my example with sub-fields like author copyright license it is easy for third party programmers to get those node objects

10671102
getter	setter
every thing else is fields constructor getter and setter

10671102
getter	setter
each field has a getter and a setter

10671102
getter	setter
there are no more methods than the getter and the setter

10671102
getter	setter
1 field per each getter setter method pair

10671102
entities	entitymanager
now when i have a customer which i build out of three entities address phonenumber and person the customer can instantiated through finding the other three entities in the database with the entitymanager

10671249
folder	directory
assuming you are using a recent xcode and haven t configured it to save build files in your project directory you should be able to place your project directory in your dropbox folder

10671256
setinterval	clearinterval
i want to execute clearinterval function automatically after removing div which containing setinterval function and this div is the result of ajax response because it don t stop itself after removing the div

10671282
portrait	landscape
clearly this does it if the user is currently holding their device in portrait orientation and thus presumably your shouldautorotatetointerfaceorientation is set up for landscape only and this routine will shift it to landscape if the user s holding their device in portrait mode

10671307
setinterval	settimeout
rather than use setinterval to schedule the animations use the completion callback of the last animation to trigger the next cycle with a settimeout if necessary

10671316
vim	gedit	vim	textmate	textmate	gedit
but you should stop trying to use vim as if it was gedit or textmate or whatever other editor you are used to

10671352
pop-up	dialog
you can use the filereference.browse to get a dialog system pop-up to choose a file

10671355
implements	extends
you can use labelitemrender as is or extends it to implements your custom labelitemrenderer

10671379
post	put	post	get	put	get
additionally actions performed on those resources identified by the uri are determined based on the specific http method used in the request get post put delete etc

10671379
post	put	post	get	put	get
in other words any language or platform that can make http requests and can send get post put delete requests can be used to extend or build upon your api

10671450
libusb	pyusb
it requires libusb and pyusb

10671490
put	get
get rid of the 8080 in the curlopt_proxy setting and put the curlopt_proxyport value in quotes

10671610
content-length	content-type
the response headers keys sent back when i make a request are date content-length content-type charset connection server

10671620
put	get
simply put i want to access the individual keys and values of item in swig but i can t get json.parse to work

10671674
width	height
at this point you would probably want to set a fixed width and height to the ul that holds all of these list items and place them at 0 0 with regards to their parent

10671700
ssl	https
but then our portal is on ssl https

10671739
folder	directory
nb mamp is installed in applications but i have the root directory in a folder on my user folder

10671800
folder	directory
i m tired of doing long cd commands to other directory so i want to make a little tool for jumping to the most recent folder

10671810
int	chars
i want to convert a string to an int and all i could find is that you have to convert the string to a chars array and then cast this array to an int but my code produces strange values and i can t figure out what the problem is

10671833
union	distinct
in most cases union all is slightly faster than union distinct

10671959
width	height
look at the demo height is unknown width is set

10672028
spaces	delimiter
roughly i would say first check for existence with a pattern like y to preform on x.then go to the expense of counting words with a split operation and a spaces delimiter

10672033
hide	show
when check one radio need to hide all the div in grade_select and then show the div which id include the current radio value

10672065
width	height
specific informations such as width height color depth would remain the same unencrypted

10672068
glut	glew
i do not want glut or any other middleware utility library in between to do the dirty work for me that includes glew

10672068
glut	glew
glut is completely unrelated to glew

10672069
hide	show
use the selector to hide all divs that are immediate children so that you can have other divs inside them if you like then filter out the one that you want to show

10672141
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is that in google-chrome there is no white space between the span elements and it is caused by the fact that in firefox the height is 13px and in google-chrome it s 15px when setting the font size in google-chrome to 7px i achieved the right effect

10672141
google-chrome	firefox
i ve created a fiddle please take a look at both firefox and google-chrome

10672172
pull	push
i made a pull request but now i need to push an additional commit to this pull request

10672262
textview	imageview
for controls -- like text boxes textview or images imageview -- this will wrap the text or image being shown

10672309
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
safari 5.1.2 firefox 10.0.2 opera 11.62

10672352
oncreate	setcontentview	oncreate	findviewbyid	setcontentview	findviewbyid
you should call findviewbyid r.id.ctry only after you call setcontentview r.layout.main in your oncreate code

10672386
ubuntu	linux
as well as this i have a ubuntu linux virtual machine running 64 bit apache and php 5.3

10672469
versioning	upgrade
so probably the xcode you are using is an upgrade versioning

10672481
inherited	properties
it doesn t actually inherited width as boltclock has pointed out it is not an implicitly inherited properties but rather fills the parent element with wrapping allowed

10672512
pubnub	pusher
there is also a commercial solutions for real-time data streaming pubnub pusher etc

10672536
int	chars
i d suggest use prepared statement but if you still want to go with the way you have then you will have to somehow tell mysql that this is a chars s entry and this is a int entry

10672536
int	chars
to define the difference between chars entries and int entries you will have to add single quote around the chars entries

10672549
put	get
i put all your code into eclipse with a test activity and i was able to get it to work fine

10672583
touchesbegan	touchesended
then in your annotationview override the touchesbegan withevent or touchesended withevent to send the update

10672586
google-chrome	firefox
note i have tested both firefox 12.0 and google-chrome

10672590
post	get
edit i cannot replace the get to post because this page is called not just from itself but also from other pages so two of the parameters must be used as get

10672648
user-controls	tabcontrol
instead move controls to the usercontol and add instances of this user-controls to the second form and tabpage of the tabcontrol

10672708
memcached	apc
but you can do it using sleep polling a database or better a cache apc memcached

10672708
eventlet	gevent
can deal with events python tornado gevent eventlet twisted â

10672733
profiling	benchmarking
finally if you are curious about your specific case you could profiling benchmarking your two alternatives in your environment

10672762
google-chrome	firefox
i ran them on google-chrome and firefox

10672787
iboutlet	ibaction
i cannot add them as iboutlet or ibaction to my main scene s view controller which is pretty obvious

10672818
folder	directory
this is very confusing as i donâ t know to how to stop it to stop reading the path from the root directory but read it from application root folder

10672881
google-chrome	firefox
now this works pretty good in google-chrome and firefox

10672900

10672908
int	chars
signed chars and unsigned chars are arithmetic integral types just like int and unsigned int

10672944
for-loop	arrays
the reason that and the are undefined within the callback function of the inner function is that is aysnchronous which means that the entire for-loop will have finished running before any of the callbacks occur on the inner calls - so by the time these inner callbacks occur i is one higher than the maximum index of the concepts and relations arrays

10672948
google-chrome	safari
the issue seems to be that safari does not apply a perspective to the #container when using -webkit-perspective whereas google-chrome does

10672980
width	height
either way when you specify the width with a value such as 300px â this height will take priority and the element will be assigned 300px itself

10673053
accessor	properties
the properties or indexer system.directoryservices.protocols.directoryconnection.credential cannot be used in this context because it lacks the get accessor

10673063
accessor	properties
the ldapconnection.credential properties doesn t have a get accessor so you can t retrieve its current value and set the username properties on the returned networkcredential instance

10673153
margin	height
so document.body.clientheight is just the height of your image and a little bit of margin

10673160
children	parent
this works by setting the weight sum of the parent layout and the weights of the children layouts

10673160
children	parent
the weight of the children should be equal to the weight sum of the parent

10673175
portrait	landscape
the trick is to set up a instead of wrap_content in portrait mode and instead of wrap_content in landscape mode you can use layout-land folder for that

10673217
width	height
i have tested to check if the value of height and width is null but that i can only do after the code and then it s to late

10673334
post	get
redirect for get requests in case the user enters the xyz url directly in the address bar and redirect to some error page or home page for post requests since that should never happen anyway

10673338
google-chrome	firefox
to clarify it works in firefox probably not in google-chrome

10673352
for-loop	arrays
i got the idea of a for-loop for the arrays and the select query will be repeated depending on the size of the arrays which is not so useful

10673429
iboutlet	ibaction
this will allow you to declare the ibaction iboutlet to that button in the class you specify

10673460
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
safari plays from the local url firefox and google-chrome don t and neither gives any errors

10673511
hash	salt
after this it sends the username encoded and hash password to the server where it is then decoded salt re-hashed and checked against the stored password in the database

add an helper view height 0dp width constrained to parent at the bottom of your base view at the bottom add the margin you want

10673614
google-chrome	firefox
while google-chrome and firefox do accept this syntax

10673687
super	extends
the class extends it has a super line and this line is causing it to be set to null.

10673725
children	parent
the former selects all descendant para elements that are the first para children of their parent

10673740
concave	convex
i should note that the polygon can be of any shape with any number of sides and may concave or convex

10673781

width	height
the addition of a s scroller component wrapping the vgroup will give you the scroll bars essentially the way this works is you set the size on the s scroller to the size you want to visible can be a percentage like 100 width height of the view container then you set no explicit size on the vgroup the vgroup will expand to have a height equal to the height of all the components nested in it plus any padding plus the gap space the scroller will take care of figuring out how big the scroll tab button should be and adjust the scrollrect on the vgroup for you essentially it s going to work like magic

10678973
width	height
if you don t constrain the scroller s height and width it will not work as it doesn t have a defined region to draw in and will just become as large as it s children the nested components

10690692
accessor	superclass	accessor	properties	superclass	subclassing
given that re-synthesizing a properties in a subclassing without re-declaring it works exactly like overriding the accessor methods -- the subclassing s implementations are used instead of the superclass s

10690692
ivar	subclassing
the one difference is that a synthesized ivar has the same visibility as a private ivar so subclassing can t access it including to use it as the backing variable for a property

10690692
ivar	subclassing
this means that the re-synthesis in the subclassing must use a different ivar name

10690692
superclass	subclassing
if the superclass has then the compiler requires the subclassing to do something like

i can t seem to get spring pre post method security annotations to work

10691115

the only way i can fix it in google-chrome is with margin-top 1.1em on the img but that ll also result in white space above the image in firefox and possibly other browsers

10691116
pull	push
putting all these projects into one repository makes the git push pull merge workflow a bit awkward

move	drag
i have implemented dragging and dropping on top that...howewver when i drag items down i am using the methods lineup and linedown to move down the wrap panel

10691227
gunicorn	uwsgi
obviously you would more likely want to include that in the actual configuration for gunicorn uwsgi

10691238
cpu	processors
secondly on a superscalar ooo processors with decent branch prediction conditional moves are in most cases a pessimization compared to a simple branch so in fact compilers targeting such cpu s will most likely not do the if-conversion

10691304
width	height
the main image will change its height and width depending on the photo

10691304
width	height
the addthis div currently adjust for the height but not the width

10691304
width	height
another way i thought of doing this is using jquery to read the image height and width then set the left and top elements of the addthis div based on image size

10691433
dictionary	map
or maybe you have a list of raw dictionary values that map to the model

10691457

10691466
post	get
e.g post or get

10691577
viewdidload	viewwillappear
doing the initial fetch asynchronously in viewdidload or viewwillappear will prevent the ui from locking up when the user goes to view the table and in almost all cases the table should already be visible once they actually see the table

10691615
children	parent
after doing a bit of reading i found that the way to achieve this is having a parent node with a rigidly defined size and children with sizes

10691622
crypt	salt
if there s a salt often the first two letters of the username pass that in with the crypt function

10691644
dictionary	map
i already know how to do the parsing with scriptcontrol but cannot figure out how to map the result into the dictionary and collection classes

10691669
maven	pom.xml
you should go the pom.xml of each module you want a .exe and do what i posted on this question trying to integrate launch4j in a maven project using alakai plugin

10691677
lzma	lz4
you can look at various schemes from lz4 to zlib to lzma to ppmd paq etc. in a sequence from fastest with least compression to slowest with best compression

10692231
rss	feed
for some reason it s not being updated by the rss feed -

10692232
rtp	rtcp
this is because the even ports are typically used for rtp and odd for rtcp

10692232
rtp	rtcp
vlc uses live555 for its backend rtp rtcp parsing and i m pretty sure the even odd thing is a hardcoded situation

10692235
post	get
when i send a post i do it programatically with both username and password parameters though i get the following error back

10692239
button	checkbox
i have recently created a way to style html checkbox and radio button but it requires adding additional elements to it like a or a

10692239

i am trying to create a bottom aligned fluid width sticky footer that contains three links that are the same height as the container which also have fluid widths

10692282
google-chrome	firefox
there are some experimental new css features in the pipeline that will do this which are currently winding their way through the standardisation process and just starting to appear in beta versions of google-chrome firefox etc

switching	accessory
if your android device has usb host already still it will switching to accessory mode and acts as usb device instead of usb host

10692389
min	max
i want the min and max values to be 0 100 respectively

10692389
min	max
however if the user does the rectangle drag to change the viewport of the graph or zooms in out the y-axis min max changes

10692389
min	max
is there a way i can force the min max values to persist but still allow the user to zoom draw the selection box essentially allowing them to just pan zoom the x-axis

10692405
google-chrome	firefox
typical works in google-chrome firefox but not ie story

10692407
ant	maven
maven is a build tool like ant which can pull specific versions of libraries and other dependencies from an online server

10692482
dictionary	map
i m trying to use map on the dict_values object returned by the values function on a dictionary

10692489
width	height
position proportionally to the height width of your parent custom layout that matches the height width of your imageview

10692511
xsb	yap
the most clean solution will likely be to use a prolog compiler that supports tabling like b-prolog ciao xsb or yap

10692534
eglibc	uclibc
at this point it is not finished because for my version of angstrom distribution 2010.x uclibc is not default library built by bitbake but eglibc is built

10692563
getter	setter
one technique i ve used is to use macros to automatically generate the getter setter for class attributes

10692563
getter	setter
i actually think that s easier to read than a bunch of setter and getter

10692568
x86	64bit
the extractimage interface bb2e617c-0920-11d1-9a0b-00c04fc2d6c1 on a 64bit os is only accessible from 64bit applications because explorer is 64bit thus resulting in a class not registered exception from hresult 0x80040154 regdb_e_classnotreg exception in applications compiled as x86

10692640
gtk	cairo
it requires ruby of course as well as the latest ruby gtk bindings and ruby cairo bindings and of course gtk and cairo themselves

google-chrome	safari
the approach work perfect in all browsers with exception webkit browsers google-chrome safari

10692762
google-chrome	safari
as the workaround one can use xmlmap d adjname adjname because xmlmap adjname will work in google-chrome and safari

10692851
ccscene	cclayer
subclass ccnode or any other class that s appropriate ccscene cclayer it doesn t really matter

10692921
put	get
it doesn t matter if i comment out the method_missing or not no matter what i put in that class block i get the same error

10692923
post	get
i am using the post get redirect method to submit a form using asp.net webforms

10692946
put	get
this time the model will be different from what i get from the repository so it does not make much sense to put it in the same file

10692975
int	chars
some are already mentioned as assigning the chars to the int array

10693057
uilabel	uibutton
your comment says ad uilabel to the toolbar but you then proceed to make a uibutton with a custom view manufsectionlabel

10693094
opera	safari
maps api version 3.7 january 24 2012 included enabled canvas street view on ie 9 opera and safari windows

10693173
implements	extends
you should create a class that extends baseadapter using the constructor that takes a list the list of your strings and make it implements spinneradapter

10693176
accessor	properties
you should use a copy accessor when the setter parameter may be mutable but you can t have the internal state of a properties changing without warning - so the judgement as to whether you can stand the value to change unexpectedly is all your own

10693210
portrait	landscape
the image at the external url could be landscape or portrait and i don t wan t to have the image cropped with something like overflow hidden

i ve tested it in ie google-chrome opera and firefox and it works fine

10693253

i used the toggle command because i want to be able to close show and hide the div by clicking the same link i also want to be able to hide the active div by clicking on a different link which currently works great

10693269
orientdb	neo4j
could you provide examples for the most common open-sourced ones say orientdb neo4j flockdb.

10693314
post	get
maybe i should also be using a filewrapper like in this post but i get identical results with and without it

10693333
portrait	landscape
this works in firefox text turns red in landscape and blue in portrait just so you know it s working

10693333
google-chrome	safari
in webkit safari and google-chrome it will not.

10693345
factors	mean
the problem is that when the zoom factors is increased to more than 1 the scrollbars are lost on richtextbox but the content is getting edited but not visible i mean the content is below the visible screen once the zoom is set back to normal i can see the content and scroll bars again could you please suggest what i am required to do to get the things right

10693383
subtract	add
i have a working implementation but theres seems to be some thing i m missing since the results i m getting are not precise that is if i add or subtract 20 or so pixels from the width i get the same truncated string..it should be a little more accurate and have a closer cut

10693390
flyway	liquibase
configure the db migration tool to run on application startup both flyway and liquibase support this through their respective apis

10693390
versioning	upgrade
when the app starts the migration tool will discover that the db structure is outdated and upgrade it to the newest versioning

10693433
post	put
http authentication is generally eschewed in favor of either an http put or post request over https usually fortified with some kind of cross-site request forgery csrf prevention measure or an oauth2 strategy which typically defers the issue to the authentication broker s implementation

10693435

emacs	lighttable
i really like the lighttable color scheme but despite lots of googling i can t seem to find an emacs theme

10693542
viewdidload	viewwillappear
the you need to create the array in either viewdidload or viewwillappear

10693545
width	height
remember that a horizontal dialog unit is 1 4 the average character width and a vertical dlu is 1 8 the average character height

10693553
udp	tcp
if you re asking if tcp can be implemented in udp the answer is no

10693553
udp	tcp
first tcp packets and udp packets have an incompatible format

10693553
udp	tcp
second tcp and udp have different protocol numbers seen in the ip header which means that tcp traffic destined for a udp port would not be passed to the correct upper-layer protocol

10693570
implements	extends
i thought of extends the outputstream class and implements my own outputstream.write method

10693583
post	get
but when i try to access it using jquery s get or post methods i get no response

10693653
width	height
i want the container that contains a b c and d to fit exactly by exactly i mean height and width should be just what it contains

ssl	https
please note that https ssl was not designed to work on shared-ip hosting such as gae so there are some ssl extensions that have various support on browsers sni vip

10693749
post	get
it sounds to me that you re expecting a get request but by default a form will result in a post request

10693752
median	percentile
etc then reservoir sampling is a reasonable way of estimating percentile median from an arbitrarily long stream of numbers

10693752
median	percentile
finding the median or any percentile is then a straight-forward matter of sorting the reservoir and polling the interesting point

10693753
free	malloc
free malloc pair to resize buffer i am afraid may lead to fragmentation and reserving memory before hand creates other problems

10693771
rss	feed
i tried to implement rss feed following this simple explanation from cake book

10705203
mouseover	mouseout
i decided to use the mouseover and mouseout events along with the open and close commands

10705203
mouseover	mouseout
also i would love if i was able to get it to close on mouseout if it was activated by a mouseover but not if it was activated by a click so if user clicked the menu it would stay open until he picked a option or clicked outside

abstract-class	superclass
your superclass for this could be element because you said element is an abstract-class which robot and items extend

your route expects a put request while you re issuing a get request

10705508

10706012
min	max
edit one other piece of data that i need is the min and max productcount for the period 24h

i am trying to implements the use of a c++ library within my project that has not used const modifiers on its access functions

pop-up	dialog
given you want to both pop-up a message and disable the gui page underneath i d recommend you take a look at modal dialog

10706070
google-chrome	firefox
and i guess i can just prevent escape from doing what it does exiting fullscreen in firefox and google-chrome with preventdefault

10706070
google-chrome	firefox
for example on google-chrome it s called webkitfullscreenchange and on firefox it s mozfullscreenchange

10706075

treemap	linkedhashmap
map is an interface and must be instantiated through one of the associated concrete implementations hashmap treemap or linkedhashmap

width	height	width	border-box	height	border-box
border-box - include border width height and padding width height or basically the width you set includes the borders padding

10706372
google-chrome	firefox
now sometimes i think ie8 uses a different box-sizing than google-chrome firefox etc this is why sometimes you have issues

10706372
google-chrome	firefox
note if you don t have the doctype then you re in quirks mode and ie differs wildly from google-chrome firefox on the box-sizing box model - and that s your problem right there

10706382
int	double
however take care that int for example can conflict with double

10706426
httpresponse	request
after you are done sending the request body create a httpresponse object and pass it to receiveresponse

10706471
min	max
the part i am struggling with is the closures after the max and min

10706471
min	max
obviously i am guessing it finds the min and max values out of the set but i need to modify this and am uncomfortable not understanding this

10706500
width	height
don t forget you will also need to swap the values of the height and width properties of the field

10706550
d3.js	highcharts
i was working with the d3.js graphing library but due to its lack of native ie8 support i would like to switch to highcharts

10706573
for-loop	arrays
this is the classic c-style for-loop to iterate through an arrays slightly adapted for javascript since the arrays can tell you its length while you need to keep track of that yourself in c

10706576
getter	setter
you are far better off using dead simple getter setter implementations -- synthesize ideally -- and move all change-response logic outside of the getter setter

10706576
getter	setter
kvo works fine if you need single getter setter response logic

10706588
express	node.js

i have a get and a post route

10706603
apache	lighttpd
but whatever you do you re probably approaching the level of complexity where you ought to look at using a real httpd or network framework instead of rolling your own apache lighttpd tornado twisted etc

10706614
background-color	transparency
found at android webview style background-color transparency ignored on android 2.2

10706639

the pickle module in python provides object serializable and deserialization functionality

10706683
addclass	removeclass

so that only the min or the max had to be in the range

10706756
pull	push
if you want the controller to completely block until all work is done then you can have it be a push pull until it receives x messages message content can be anything

10706773

put	get
how can i tell ruby to listen for the get request and capture it or more specifically capture and put into a variable the url that is requested in the get above

10706995
nsurl	nsstring
you can use the code in this test application and just change the path of the file from nsstring to nsurl

10707004
submit	submission
to submit the data to the controller without using javascript you need to use an html form submission

10707007

i m already using a javascript function to determine whether or not i need serve up an ogg file or mp3 file when the image is clicked

10707010
post	get
i was playing around with the http post and get requests in java

10707010
post	get
when i send http post get the tool that i am using either a browser or java sends information about itself

10707021
getter	setter
you could make getter and setter

10707021
getter	setter
this is basically the same as a getter and setter but you can get away with one function instead of multiple functions for each member it can get messy though if not maintainted properly

10707047
many-to-one	one-to-many
so itâ s 2 many-to-one and 2 one-to-many

10707072
integer	unsigned
if id is created as integer then i can do max value of 2 147 483 647 for unsigned values

google-chrome	firefox
as for firefox being slower at rendering than google-chrome i can assure you that for most practical purposes it s not

10707136
post	get
when the post action is performed i want to display the same page again in addition i want to keep the entity parameter as set by the get action

10707159
post	get
my client polls the update_stories action to get new post for story 1

10707202
put	get
when you send a put request you don t get a new location you just continue to upload to the same one

10707206
getter	setter
i know that in python one doe s not create setter and getter before they are needed

10707221
submit	submission
i m guessing that it s submission the form via ajax with the right selector and then subsequently firing the actual submit for the form again but i m not for sure what s happening

10707288
onclick	onchange
to observe changes to idl attributes like htmlselectelement.value input events like onclick or onchange are probably your best bet

10707293
getter	setter
since our getter setter methods don t actually do anything .

10707293
getter	setter
however properties become very useful when the setter getter actually does something more than just assign return an attribute s value

10707322
mouse	keyboard
if you interacting with the ui via a mouse or keyboard you ll need to handle that yourself and the chances of you doing that robustly and efficiently enough to actually yield a better experience than the native browser widgets is slim

10707323
pull	push
localhost development machines pull from network repository make changes push back to repository

10707330
margin	text-align
text-align center will center it horizontally as for vertically put it in a span and give it a css of margin auto 0

10707336
getter	setter
if the getter setter are really as trivial as that then you shouldn t even bother with them just use an instance variable

10707336
getter	setter
if you do need a getter setter that does something interesting then you should switch to a property as mgilson described

10707338
width	height
you can put both in a wrapper with position set to relative and define a fixed width and height to it

10707338
children	parent
it s necessary to define a height because both elements have the position set to absolute it makes the elements to be removed from the normal flow of the document so the parent element in this case the wrapper won t add the height of the absolute positioned children to its own

10707338
children	parent
also note that defining the parent s position to relative will affect the position of the children as their position will be calculated in relation to the parent s position

10707447
implements	extends
create an authenticator class that extends abstractaccountauthenticator in the package com.companyname.auth and implements this method on it

10707620

try-catch	exception-handling
you can probably remove the inner try-catch without changing any semantics of your code the stacktrace might have a different line number for caught exception-handling

10725148
int	chars
it doesn t discard the stream contents so if there s junk in the stream such as the chars a that can t be parsed as an int it will never clear that junk and will just keep retrying

10725148
int	chars
rather than throwing an exception from the stream extraction operator just the failbit if it can t extract int or the separator chars are wrong also try using more whitespace to help make the code more readable

10725154
multiplying	multiplication
this all seems slightly ridiculous now but it worked and works relatively well -- you quickly learn to scan these for familiar operations so that sgemv is a single-precision general-matrix times vector multiplication which is probably what you want not sgbmv dgemm is double-precision matrix-matrix multiplying etc

10725177
post	get
if possible get hold of the error messages and post them here

the ordering imposed by the compareto method is should be consistent with equals

10725244
children	parent
in rally webservices api if i want to traverse a story hierarchy it s necessary to do a query for the parent story then grab the children collection s off of the returned stories and then recursively query on each child until the process reaches the leaf node results

10725288

i can t touch httpd.conf and have limited .htaccess directives although rewriterule and the likes apply

10726333
udp	tcp
you certainly could implement the tcp algorithms on top of udp

10726333
udp	tcp
that would effectively be the same as tunneling tcp datagrams inside of udp datagrams

10726333
udp	tcp
the main reason to implement reliable transport on top of udp is to get away from tcp algorithms in favor of something more efficient

10726333
udp	tcp
so you could implement tcp algorithms on top of udp but you wouldn t want to

10726449
width	height
if your image is an iplimage it will have attributes width and height corresponding to the number of pixels in x and y direction respectively

10726469
super	implements
i could possibly create an avmutablecomposition to simulate the effect but there s a lot of other objects dependent on the exact time of the video player that it would require a major overhaul of the app to have to implements a whole separate handling system for simulating the appropriate video player time from the composition which i m not super willing to do at this point

10726846
int	boolean

you ll want to check out the owl to rdf mappings document at the w3c to learn more about how that happens

10726969
rdf	owl
but if you must handle the restrictions by hand you re going to need to delve a little further into the underlying rdf structure of the restrictions to get the bits you re looking for or use an api that s actually designed for working with owl such as owlapi

so ceiling first looks for the element equals to 5 null meaning compareto returns 0 and if it finds one returns that one

10727054
equals	compareto
your compareto equals doesn t obey the normal recommended rules certainly bad for a tree trying to use them

10727264
userprincipal	directoryentry
the userprincipal class is extensible so you can surface more of the properties of the underlying directoryentry object right on your user principal

10727264
userprincipal	directoryentry
using that extensibility technique which is explained in the msdn article managing directory security principals in the .net framework 3.5 you should be able to also make available a custom attribute which i assume is how you store that password hint in your directoryentry on an extended userprincipal class

10727279
decoder	encoder
all that matters is that the decoder gets the same assignment of 0 s and 1 s as the encoder

10727284

use the coalesce function around your field name in your statements instead of surrounding the sum function

10727291

serializable	deserialization
my suggestion in your code if there is no functional difference between zoom null and zoom 0 then i would just declare zoom as a primitive int instead of integer or initialize it to zero in the constructor and ensure that you never set it to null then you can be guaranteed that it will never be null and you won t have to add special code to deal with that in your serializable deserialization methods

10739082
hash	md5
in that case if you hash by md5 the content of a file with file_get_content or if you use md5_file or even if you use md5 command with the same content as your file content you will always get the same result

translation	localization

to bind a udp socket when receiving multicast means to specify an address and port from which to receive data not a local interface as is the case for tcp acceptor bind

malloc it using something like this in your constructor and free in the destructor

10739949
stdout	stderr
now it does not appear that the output from the passthru call will capture the output even if you send stderr to stdout so here s what would work

10739949
stdout	stderr
you would modify the command using the --file flag and pipe the output of the command which contains the error to a log file while making sure to also send stderr to stdout do 2 1 after the command in order to capture the error

10740016
width	height
docking changes the position of the control but also the size to fit in th height or width of the form

textview	imageview
im trying to create a custom dialog box which contains main linearlayout which has 2 nested linearlayout inside it which contains imageview and textview

10740933
multiplying	multiplication
edit if you really need multiplication then leave it to the professionals since multiplying mode with alpha values is a little tricky

10740950
for-loop	arrays
you will need to move the logic that generates the arrays i.e the code in the setup method inside the for-loop in the itworksrepeatably method for you to see different arrays each time

10741173
base-class	derived-class
if a derived-class method is declared new rather than override code which is bound using the derived class will use the derived-class method but code which is bound using the base class will use the base-class method

10741178
for-loop	arrays
then instead of starting all flashes together in your for-loop btw for-in-loops are not suited for arrays you will need to push them recursively on that queue

10741248
strncmp	strcmp
also as an additional note always remember that strings in c can be compared manipulated only using the strcmp or strncmp group of string functions

10741305
range	infinity
it appears that when you pass a negative timespan that is -2 milliseconds or lower the method correctly throws an argumentoutofrangeexception but when you provide a negative timespan from the range described above it returns a task that never completes by setting the underlying system.threading.timer to a duetime of -1 which denotes infinity

10742012
hide	show
unfortunately when you have a very short list the list cannot be scrolled upward to hide the first item cause there are not enough items in the list -- so the fallback is to show the first item the header as well and have it display tap to refresh

if you subclass qtabwidget you can access the protected function qtabwidget tabbar which returns the qtabbar it uses

10742214

google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in firefox 12 but in google-chrome 19 there is a flicker due to the page being scrolled and restored

10742422

children	parent
so if you name your objects and have them be part of a hierarchy of qobject you know they are children of a parent object you can make use of findchild

10742652
width	height
place the iframe within a div and use overflow hidden with a width and height that hides anything except for the button

10742699
apache	nginx
i never try this for me is much more interesting generate a security token and serve the file over a apache or nginx who use some security plugin

10742699
rtsp	rtmp
but if you think in something different than progressive download like http live streaming or rtmp rtsp etc you need a video server like wowza flash media server or red5

i ve put a breakpoint at main __main __getmainargs _imp____getmainargs and maincrtstartup but none of them get hit before the error is thrown

if you know the name of the table then you can build a dynamic sql statement like you propose as follows note that this only covers int tinyint smallint bigint chars nchar varchar and nvarchar - but should give you the idea

10742744
ant	pom.xml

10742771
median	max	min	median	min	max

10742823
inherited	properties
i thought to create a class and inherited from systemobject then you can create different dynamic properties but could not do

10742828
google-chrome	firefox
i have a flyout menu that of course looks great in firefox google-chrome but in ie it s choking

10742930

10743089
g++	gcc
open the discovery options select the gcc c++ compile change g++ to c++ and add -std c++0x to the compiler invocation arguments

10743106
int	chars
it is having trouble because it wants to implicitly convert from a generictype to an int to a chars but it also could return a string and so there is an ambiguity and both match generictype

10743208
range	max
if your range is limited to max long values of 10 12 then a problem in regards to space is that you must use longs because you only need a few bits more than an int can hold

10743216
hide	show
on the other hand you could wrap all div s with payments method in one div with id let s say paymentsmethods and then show hide it

10743233
backbone.js	javascriptmvc
the easiest way to do so is probably by using some sort of javascriptmvc type framework like backbone.js where you would have a collection of models representing each item and a view for each item that is hooked up to a particular element in the dom in your case an li and can be wired to respond to events on that element for example when you click the item that items view responds to its click event and acts accordingly

10743255
int	chars
2 requires the use of the conversion to int followed by a standard conversion to chars

10743279
post	get
the server won t get your client changes unless you post the changes to him

10743279
getter	setter
this is because you need to access them in your createchildcontrols method as well as in the getter and setter of yout text property

10743281
versioning	upgrade
since doxygen s parser is rather loose it is a lexical scanner not really a parser it might work as well if you do not 100 follow the grammar rules of the language but it will be a trail and error process to find out which deviations are allowed and might break if you upgrade to a future versioning of doxygen

10743283
inherited	base-class
of course they are inherited -after all the behavior of the base-class will probably depend on them being there- they are just not accessible

10743342
maven	pom.xml
but when i tried to include the module via maven pom.xml and then extend the module to call the import then i get nullpointerexception at the line where the reader is used

an example using inputstream outputstream is given below

10743411
getter	setter
the class definition is i deleted setter and getter

10743632
put	get
we put these together to get

10743634

i thought perhaps i could create a single xml element with two children using transformations then tag the text field to have the tags of the children and place the parent but this hasn t worked for me either

10743692
g++	gcc
i am running ubuntu and i have gcc g++ installed

failed in google-chrome 19 and firefox 12 it works in ie8

10743779
inherited	properties
this properties is inherited so setting it on the body element will disable selection in your entire document

10743806
actionscript	mxml
so yes it can be used with flash or rather pure actionscript but it is a little less convenient than with mxml where everything is set up by the framework because it takes more under the hood configuration to be able to run all the necessary parts for remoting

10743826
put	get
i am trying to get a list of all the currently running application and put them into an nstableview

10743827

10743939
google-chrome	firefox
i tried it using google-chrome 19 worked and firefox 12 did not work

10743974

i think you need to pass result in the second parameter to the render method in your get route just as you are already doing in the post route

10744045
sorting	grouping
however to compute grouping by either index scan or in-memory sorting may take place to create the buckets and such an index scan or sorting implies a traversal of the data in a sorted order

10744048
ant	pom.xml
it is not the intention of this plugin to provide a means of polluting the pom.xml so it s encouraged to move all your ant tasks to a build.xml file and just call it from the pom.xml using ant s task

10744069
width	height
each symbol which i ll again remind should be defined using this meta-language should be able to access its child symbols informations not others to avoid deadlocks and circular referencing for example the user may want the height and width of a symbol to be equal to the sum of the height and width of all the child s symbols or to use the same picture and so on

10744140

what i am thinking is that i will have to write some javascript to parse the radio button and checkbox in the form then pass this data through the window.location trick to the obj-c code

10744409
rss	feed
at first glance you re not using the full zend mvc model some things you could use to improve performance is to send methods that are handling html for the view and use the rss feed from youtube to make this request

10744438
google-chrome	firefox
the following code works on google-chrome 19 firefox 12 opera11 as well as ios5 but not ie9

10744598
int	double
t can be int double float etc

10744598

further if you have a recent standard library implementation that implements c++11 a call to std fabs with an int type argument will automatically convert the argument to type double so there is no ambiguity

10744851
put	get
as you may get various character encodings on webpages it is generally best to decode all your scraped data into unicode asap deal with it as unicode in the spider then encode it to whatever encoding you require at the last minute before you print it or put into a database etc. i actually wrote a piece about this based on my own experience with scrapy two days ago that may be helpful

if the rowid is numeric you could average or sum or perhaps take the smallest min or largest max of all the ids

10744984
viewdidload	viewdidappear
so yeah between viewdidload and viewdidappear the view gets its dimension and boundaries it s totally reliable and also documented in the viewcontroller docs

10744984
viewdidload	viewwillappear
notice also that viewdidload will be called every time the views need to be created like first time and after a low memory warning -views are usually deallocated when memory is needed- and viewwillappear will be called every time a view controller is on top of the stack and its views are about to be rendered

10744985

10745250
keydown	keyup
example a lowercase a will be reported as 65 by keydown and keyup

10745291
min	max
that said having looked at the results it looks like there should be an algorithm to determine how many weightsets there given a weightsno min and max and from there it should be fairly straightforward to fill those in with possible values

10745311
lodash	underscore.js
here is an example of how to setup backbone lodash underscore.js replacement jquery and require

sensormgr is null when you reach onresume since you forcibly set it to null in your onpause method

10745685

client-side	server-side
the number of repeats is set both server-side data posted by the controller may have multiple languagefromtos and client-side an add button that allows the user to add another div with its contained select s in different cases so i presume knockout s templating is a no-go as mvc needs to loop through and render each row so that it can catch them all on a normal post back

int	double
it was not zooming due to the reason i was using xvaluetype as chartvaluetype.time.when time is converted in double the int part remains the same whereas only decimal part changes.hence there was only one int point on the x axis an hence zooming was disabled

10748899
hide	show
very simple use toggle intead of show hide toggle makes element visible if it is hide and hide it if it is visible

width	height
every time the layout has to be recalculated it verifies if width and height are fixed or not in order to determinate if width and height should be recalculted or not

10749516

int	double
a double can exactly represent an int up to 53 bits

10749609
int	double
if you re lucky and an int is half a double you can store the int like this

10749609
int	double
if a double and int have the same number of bits what you want is impossible

10749634
int	double
if you are always passing two int to this one parameter then it makes no sense to pass a double

10749634
int	double
the way you are doing it leaves you no opportunity to detect the difference between a true double and two int

10749638
gridbaglayout	boxlayout
if you still want to use boderlayout on the jframe because you need some side panel or something like that you can just wrap your jpanel with the gridlayout into another jpanel with a gridbaglayout or boxlayout or something similar and then put that other jpanel into the jframe

button	checkbox
how to implement a button that gets all checkbox #39

10749717
int	double
since usually a double has 64 bits in it and each int has 32 bits you d think that you could just store the bits into the double directly

10749717
int	double
because of this stuffing two 32-bit int into a double will appear to work in most cases but if you test it with all possible input values you ll find some cases where the values unexpectedly mutated during their stay inside the double and came out as different values when you decoded them again

10749717
int	double
of course you could get around this by being careful only to set the mantissa bits of the double but that will only give you 26 bits per int so you would only be able to store int values of + - 33 554 432 or so

10749776

first of all from my experience it is definitely good idea to use external maven installation with m2e

10750860
maven	m2e
now about your problem i don t know if it s m2e s embedded maven or some kind of your mistake or misunderstanding but i ve just generated simple project using the same quickstart archetype and everything works ok

otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank

10751539
integer	unsigned
the operand with unsigned integer type

10751539
integer	unsigned
here the two operands in are signed and unsigned int which have an equal integer conversion rank

10751564
integer	unsigned
when multiplying an unsigned int and a signed int both operands are converted to unsigned int and the results is also an unsigned int due to the integer conversion rules for arithmetic expressions in both c and c++ so the result of will be uint_max - 1 in both c and c++

10751574
integer	unsigned
both have unsigned integer types the operand with the type of lesser

10751574
integer	unsigned
converted to the type of the operand with unsigned integer type

google-chrome	firefox
both firefox and google-chrome do set the explicit domain with a dot prefix

10751813
google-chrome	firefox
funnily enough firefox and google-chrome both create cookies without the dot prefix

10751813
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox on the other hand see more than 1 cookie

10751813
google-chrome	firefox
this broke google-chrome and firefox users were no longer able to login because the server would try authenticate the old auth cookie

10751813
google-chrome	firefox
this worked in google-chrome and firefox

10751820

breaking the page in parts maybe one part is throw the error and the rest working good if this is not so important you can simple hide this part and show the rest until you fix it

10751939

if you can foresee that you re only going to have a small team and a limited number of builds i would recommend teamcity with nant

10753368

it s the job of the salt to make already existing rainbowtables useless because a rainbowtable has to be built for one specific salt

10753526
rainbowtable	salt	rainbowtable	hash	hash	salt
using a different salt for every hash will prevent rainbowtable attacks because you would have to create a rainbowtable for each hash

this automatically generates accessor methods for both fields sensible tostring equals and hashcode implementations - and you also get pattern matching as an added bonus

hide	show
consequently i altered the code to hide and show tabs rather than create and destroy them

convert.toint32 8.6 is the safe way to ensure your double gets rounded to the nearest int in this case 9

10754324
oncreate	onnewintent
doing so it invokes the onnewintent in the first activity instead of oncreate

maven	m2e
just like what m2e does for maven project

10754934
rtp	sip
it seems that both the rtp and sip standards are doing exactly what they should be doing

this goes all well on a debian 32 bit machine but fails in ubuntu 64 bit and i have no clue why

10754971

the above code describes the ontouch and ondraw method in my custom view class and i have to prevent image cross the line.as we can implement using matrix where we can move the object horizontal and vertical avoiding the object by setting the wall on 4 sides of cell but i have to move object freely inside a puzzle.any logic would be helpful i am stuck.thanks in advance

can you or more likely the dba get the error message and the error stack from the alert log and post it here assuming it is something other than the privileges issue from #2

10755160
spaces	delimiter
this will concatenate the data with spaces as a delimiter

10755204

i escape the same characters as php s addslashes function but i try to avoid its multibyte character vulnerability by detecting supplementary 32-bit characters

10755224
hide	show
i need to show and hide it in particular time

.htaccess	httpd.conf
enable mod_rewrite and .htaccess through httpd.conf and then put this code in your .htaccess under document_root directory

we don t explicity try-catch this exception-handling but use a handler to manage them

10755403
put	get
i m trying to get the list of checked checkboxes with specific class attribute and put their values to array

10755513

google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
in google-chrome opera and internet explorer it works as expected but in firefox i get this strange behaviour

10755818
versioning	upgrade
this upgrade could change the target versioning of my app or for example have push-notifications

10755883
getter	setter
to give a bit of history in the setclass function an option access was provided to create so-called privileged slots that could only be accessed through getter and setter provided with the class

10755883
getter	setter
and personally i m very happy with that as it allows me to use information from objects that is not readily reachible by using the getter and setter included in the package

10755883
getter	setter
it also allows me to economize heavy calculations by avoiding overhead created by getter and setter

10755883
getter	setter
they just don t provide getter and setter for slots that the average user shouldn t reach

10755883
getter	setter
to give a trivial example the following creates a class with two slots and a getter and setter for only one slot

10755890
junit	mockito
with a very simple mockito run junit test and class i am seeing different output when the test is run with java 1.6.0_32 and java 1.7.0_04 and want to understand why this is happening

google-chrome	firefox
this is correct in firefox and google-chrome

then check to see if that point is within your bounded line x coord lies within min and max x coord and same for y

10755963
lodash	underscore.js
keep in mind that i am using lodash by john-david dalton instead of underscore.js because lodash provides better performance and a custom build process

10755973
try-catch	exception-handling
for tests i recommend you to put a try-catch clause around the statement which is producing the class cast exception-handling set a breakpoint in the catch block and look which class the i-th element really is

10755992
folder	dir
.htaccess in dir folder

10756013

10756038
google-chrome	firefox
the code seems to work fine in ie and firefox but is not working in google-chrome

10756054
int	chars
my suggestion would be to use chars variables and use achar to set values and ichar to convert back to int as necessary

10756077
portrait	landscape
but when i push secondviewcontroller i provide there both portrait and landscape orientation if current interface orientation of secondviewcontroller is landscape and i press back button secondviewcontroller pop from stack and firstviewcontroller appears the orientation of firstviewcontroller is landscape

10756084
getter	setter
getter and setter will be duplicated

10756084
getter	setter
i have thought about strategy pattern but i think it s maybe too much just for getter and setter .

10756084
getter	setter
the question is if we have two classes not linked with a common attribut and exactly the same getter setter

10756098
jar	war
i program also in ruby and there it is no problem the only thing you need is ruby itself a few easy to get libraries and you r set even with the possibility to make it into a jar war or exe.

when javascript converts a string to an int using parseint it reads each chars until it sees a non-numeric chars

10756233
background-image	background-position
if the background of outer is the image and the background of heading is the dotted line you can set the background-image of the span s to be the same as outer and then set the background-position to offset that image by the same amount as the element so it lines up with the other background

ant to maven - multiple build targets but i will have a seriously huge pom.xml for each project with lots of duplicated stuff so i really don t like this idea

10756509
hide	show
i recognize there are ways other than show hide to alter the visibility of elements and i m fine with the limitation that those methods must be used to trigger the custom events

10756543
mouse	keyboard
the controller interprets the mouse and keyboard inputs from the user commanding the model and or the view to change as appropriate

10756543
mouse	keyboard
in fact a qt component manages the graphical ... output and interprets the mouse and keyboard inputs so it could indeed be called merged view and controller with respect to the definition above

10756578
hide	show
i think you re on the right track with one view controller owning one view that then has sub-views that you hide show as needed

10756578
hide	show
then to switch tabs just hide one view and show another and all will be well

10756607
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
ie firefox opera and safari don t do this

10761046
mousemove	mousedown
mousedown becomes touchstart mousemove becomes touchmove etc

int	chars
i need to remove duplicate chars within a string but would also like to include an exception to allow a int amount of chars to repeat remain in the string

10761416

10761453
google-chrome	safari
iâ m guessing i need a doctype because the following font styling only appears how i want it in safari and google-chrome

it compares raf with settimeout setinterval

10761637
width	height
so unless the iframe itself takes up 100 of the height and width of the screen then no i don t believe you can play the movie at fullscreen size

10761637
width	height
if you do have control over the whole screen then you can dynamically resize the height and width of the iframe as well as the object contained within it -- when it comes time to activate or deactivate the media

10761641

ropemacs	pymacs
i have tried ropemacs and pymacs but i don t think they are good enough

10762174
metaclass	setattr
class attributes are passed to the metaclass as a single dictionary and my hypothesis is that this is used to update the __dict__ attribute of the class all at once something like cls.__dict__.update dct rather than doing setattr on each item

10762177
children	parent
treestores are more complicated than liststores because they must not only contain the data but also its hierarchy parent and children nodes

10762196

10762283
16-bit	64bit
in the case of directx it s a bit the same microsoft has published specs for com so anybody who follows those specs can get interop with essentially any com object within reason -- a 64bit compiler probably isn t going to work with a 16-bit com object written for windows 3.1

10762285

with vps you can configure your own cron jobs install perl libraries execute perl scripts .

10762291

this shows a pop-up dialog box

10762386

i have a div which dosn t have fix height or width

10762503

post	get
the channel is already encrypted when the client send the get post http method call to the server containing the requested uri

10762521
width	font-size
if you are using a fixed width font then you need to measure how wide a character is in the font and font-size and font-style you re using

10762521
margin	font-size	width	font-size	width	margin	fontfamily	font-size
it is possible to measure a fixed width font by creating a div with no margin padding or border setting the style to position absolute setting the desired fontfamily and font-size on it and putting one character in the div

10762556
int	boolean
public boolean requestfeature int featureid

10762611
background-image	background-size
when making a background-image responsive you can use the background-size property

10762624
for-loop	loops
the downside is you d need to replace the string the list of characters in each for-loop and potentially add or remove for loops based on the number of unknown characters

10762667
ord	chr
you can do the same thing with much cleaner code with chr ord and array_map

10762706
uiview	subviews
when you zoom the web view the content view size is changing but your ego view will not get a resize message because either the content view is not a true uiview or the scroll view is blocking the resizing of it s subviews somehow just a guess on the implementation

10762731
google-chrome	firefox
and the worst thing is that in google-chrome and firefox is working perfectly

10762797
isotope	masonry
you may have to add the manual trigger behavior if you are working with masonry or isotope in order to make it work

10762820
post	get
according to another post it seems that setsizemax should cut off the upload but that is not the behavior i get

10762829
min	max
if you view the html source do you have a td s with the classes min max and quantity

10762884
post	get
the reason you have that error is that your routes file is configured for a get not a post

10762894
equals	compareto
so when i use the compareto method nothing is assuring me that inside both objects the 2nd elements of their arrays will have a field say the name field and therefore if that were not to be true it could be comparing a name with age cause inside it only holds an array of field s that are equals type as long the key class knows

10762910
subtract	add
since you know the numbers are all positive another option is to add 0x1p23 and subtract 0x1p23

10762979
google-chrome	safari
on the paper it sounds great especially since they claim to use webkit which has a significantly better performance for my ui in google-chrome safari

10762979
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
orders of magnitude slower than the same thing in google-chrome safari or even the slower firefox

10762980
oncreate	ondestroy
i don t know if this is the proper way of doing it but you could make a local variable boolean which is set after the first oncreate and reset at onpause ondestroy

10762984
move	drag
if i drag and move the map i get to see other tiles but not the initial ones

10762984

10763047
entities	entitymanager
your entitymanager is the key to gain access to the context where entities reside

10763047
entities	entitymanager
so as you can see the entitymanager is the public interface through which you access your entities however your entities reside in a context attached to your entitymanager

10763082
post	put
if you need to do post put delete head etc you re probably better off using something like httpbuilder

10763094
width	height
something like where the first two parameters are the x and y position of the top right corner of the image view and the second two parameters are the width and height

10763106

i have very simple contact form and i would like to hide the label somehow so that it doesn t show csrf token

10763204
google-chrome	firefox
i had the same problem with my .net canvas app that initially seemed limited to ie and firefox but recently exhibited the same behaviour in google-chrome

10763213
getter	setter
since a getter setter is only three lines each or 6 for both you could set the threshold just above there

10763228
put	get
and to test if objects get destroyed with arc in the startgame method of classicgame i put this

10763229
mouseout	mouseup
when the invisible div is clicked canvas draws image 1 on mouseup or mouseout it reverts back to image 0

10763235

10763387
cvs	svn
as i move from cvs to svn i m trying to add a file in svn using ant

10763387
cvs	svn
as you can see it s a mix of using cvs with svn so i m sure i was wrong in doing this

10763388
gif	png
alternatively you could use the parameter and pass to it a transparent gif or png which will give the same effect

10763390
int	boolean
i think this is wrong because of the as a type for comparable which would mean the list can take an int and a boolean as objects but i don t want that

10763402
knitr	latex
sweave knitr drivers are provided to output nicely formatted markdown latex etc

10763428
udp	tcp
the problem is not in the choice of protocol - tcp ip won t help and neither would udp broadcast

10763428
packets	multicast
one alternative is to have a new process multicast a who is there message and have all of the others respond with a multicast or directed packets

10763453
netbsd	minix
some of that is also out-of-date as -- in 3.2 -- minix adopted the netbsd bootloader

10763491
gridview	rowdatabound
if you have dynamic content in the rows during rowdatabound of the gridview you can access each control using the findcontrol method and customize each control from there

10763520
ubuntu	linux
i am on linux ubuntu with opencv 2.4 installed

10763545
put	get
when you get an x expected error don t put too much faith in it

10763636
pull	push
i basically only need pull commit and push capabilities

10763677
post	get
don t know if it possible to make however although i know how to do it via old get urls and refreshing page i want to try the new way with jquery to call the file and post or get data via jquery but without using a form

10763702
getter	setter
i also prefer to use self.object for properties because it uses the getter and setter of the object and the self. makes it clear and to avoid situations where a retain is needed or not

10763782
portrait	landscape
because i have to clip one portrait one landscape

10763784
mouseup	mousedown
and i ve had absolutely no trouble with it thus far...admittedly i haven t done incredibly extensive device testing but it s worked on my desktop with mousedown mouseup as well as an htc droid eris android 1.6 and my droid razr android 2.3 .

put	get
if i don t put that part ia key indexia i get all my ia.

10763975
post	get
and if you want to get all the comments of a post first you have to get the wall post id which you can get easily from the above code and then

10764008
google-chrome	firefox
it s working fine in other browsers like firefox and google-chrome

10764032
xul	xbl
you could insert a piece of javascript in the xul document that uses document.queryselector to find the tabpanels inside your xbl binding and then would append the dynamically-created canvas to id

10764041
qthread	qapplication
to avoid this you should sometimes call qapplication processevents during long operation or run this operation in separate qthread

10764086
width	height
how can i scale a div to 100 height and width inside of another element

10764086

no users of your applications who are not fans of associated page will not get post published on that page appears on their wall associated page it s still a page nothing unusual here

10764254
debian	mint	ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	debian
this bug might also be present in all debian heirs like ubuntu mint etc.

10764283
for-loop	arrays
in the for-loop you are adding the un-initialized value of carry to the arrays which will cause undefined results

10764338
width	height
you should modify this to fit your needs set the proper text size width height etc

10764377
button	checkbox
if you want a single button that you can toggle use a checkbox

10764377
button	checkbox
if you are trying to mimic a checkbox using a radio button you will just confuse your users

10764380
google-chrome	firefox
it starts up fine in google-chrome but in firefox i get an empty window

10764381
post	get
i can able to authenticate user as well as i can get my friend list as a facebook user and also post message on wall but i am looking for sending private message to my friends and i didn t get any solution for that so can any body help me how can i achieve .

10764384

10764445
couchbase	couchdb
now i want to try couchbase i ve studied it 2 days but i still don t know how to access couchbase from couchdb rest api using nodejs .

10764484
opera	firefox
however there is different behaviour in firefox and opera

10764484
opera	firefox
in opera and firefox the caret is placed outside of inserted html node and when user continues typing the typed characters are not inside html node

10764484
opera	firefox
but in firefox and opera the next typed letters after x key press are black - not wanted

10764495
serializable	deserialization
serializable and deserialization may have inbuilt support depending on the platform you are using

10764558
width	height
so it would seem that all you need to do is take the declared width and height from the image dictionary and apply the matrix to determine how big the image is in user space

10764558
factors	matrix
however one of the problems from your point of view is that is possible indeed common to concatenate matrix to affect the current scaling so simply looking at the matrix applied to an image won t give you the scale factors applied to that image because something else may have already scaled the ctm

10764558
width	height
then given the width and height of the image work out its dpi

10764570
implements	extends
whereas an interface can extends or a class can implements multiple

ant	maven
there are answers for the question above but i wish to know a concrete example of using maven or ant over just eclipse

10764576
ant	maven
so i really don t know why i need maven or ant

10764577
x86	64bit
on searching for the error on google i realized the problem was due to build in 64bit if i am not wrong for which i needed to change my target platform to x86 from anycpu

10764602
ant	maven
maven and ant are used to script builds so that they may be executed in batch jobs like with jenkins or on the command line

10764602
ant	maven
if you were to learn one of the two learn maven it s the one pretty much everyone uses these days replacing ant

10764656
post	get
i try to implement a servlet which should be called either through post or get

10764758

these elements are injected by an xbl binding and are not part of the xul document

10764804

10764839
width	height
for the splashscreen to take the full width height edit the css to remove the margins

10764848
int	chars
the chars stored as 32 bit int is then taken from ebp+8 the original value pushed by the main but as 32 bit to eax and then the lower less significant byte is put in a local storage

10764848
int	chars
as you have seen the single chars is pushed on stack as a 32bit int eax and it is taken back in eax in the same way

10764848
int	chars
so once the fake int is taken operation that the cpu handles coherently whatever the endianness is into a register the lsbyte must be put in a local storage so that its address is guaranteed to point to that chars lower byte when deferenced

folder	directory
the problem i am having is because zf-basic-project was written to be in its own subdomain it refers to things like css via absolute paths css default.css and now that it is a folder within the demos subdomain as far as the browser knows this is actually at zf-basic-project css default.css and therefore i tried to make the rewrite in the directory say zf-basic-project css is actually css which is the code

versioning	upgrade
may 31 2012 15 09 we recently upgrade our varnish versioning and are currently investigating the effect this has had on cache purge

uiview	subviews
now in the viewdidload method i am adding a subviews to the uiview i put in interface builder like this

10769373
post	put
switching to put post should i guess save the problem

10769382
folder	directory
what i need this script to do however is it needs to search recurssively in all folder for .mkv files and then run the ffmpeg command and save the output to the same directory

10769384
children	parent
you should return the children where enable true and join their parent

10769390
google-chrome	firefox
this is something that i ve noticed recently in google-chrome and firefox

10769401
iprincipal	iidentity
it sounds like you miss the fact that the instance of iprincipal iidentity is recreated upon every request

10769402
versioning	upgrade
unfortunately i cannot tell you when the stable versioning of node will upgrade beyond that

10769409
google-chrome	firefox
for console.log to work use google-chrome firefox find console output via f12 and see what adata 10 contains maybe you need adata 9 programmers use to count from zero

10769414
hide	show
once they can stay diappeared i ll write more code for showing hiding show me for the show hide link

10769464
for-loop	arrays
i have created some variables and i want to insert them into a database i used a for-loop to insert some values in arrays but i got that this error

10769494
getter	setter
i thought property created the instance variables and synthesize created the getter and setter methods for it

10769533
nowjs	node.js	express	nowjs	express	node.js
i am building a website app using node.js express and nowjs

10769568
getter	setter
i thought property created the instance variables and synthesize created the getter and setter method for it

10769568
getter	setter
you can implement your own setter getter and ivar yourself or you can synthesize them or any combination

10769568
shadowing	named
if you had created an ivar named x you d get a compiler warning about the method parameter shadowing the ivar

10769661
client-side	server-side
you still need to create client-side and server-side templates though

10769666
post	get
sorry first post couldn t figure out how to get stackoverflow to quit complaining about format

10769668
button	checkbox
when the user selects a checkbox and then hits the submit button i open a showmodaldialog ie-api-doc firefox-api-doc screen

10769680
post	put
i need to be able to put this app in any url and it works so if its hosted at www.site.com dir1 dir2 then it should post to www.site.com dir1 dir2 account login

10769684
post	get
try this blog post which has an example of using jquery ajax jsonp to get shortened urls from the tinyurl api

10769725
abstract-class	superclass	superclass	subclassing
any subclassing of an abstract-class must either implement all of the abstract methods in the superclass or be itself declared abstract

10769731
hide	show
now i want to change show hide so that it is show by default and hidden when clicked

10769763
hide	show
change the hide to show in dom ready

10769774
hide	show
if you want it to show by default and then hide when clicked.

10769829
width	height
and this the output is value of width and height but don t calculate value of x and y and make out of range in the output screen

10769842
inherited	subclassing
if i subclassing them both to a custom uiviewcontroller the masterviewcontroller will lose its uitableviewcontroller inherited

10769859
range	max
this is technically o n because a 32-bit int has a fixed range and can be binary searched in 32 passes max

10769860
opera	safari
it appears on opera safari etc

10769881
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
so i switched to qgraphicsscene qgraphicsview that seems much simpler to use with animations

10769881
qgraphicsview	qmainwindow
at the moment i have a qmainwindow with a qgraphicsview widget that takes all the area

10769918
hide	show
it works fine itself but i need to hide and show it only from a fancybox button and from an esc button

10769918
fancybox	supersized
i m using fancybox 2 and i want to implements fullscreen too so i used supersized

10769923
jdom	dom4j	jdom	xom	dom4j	xom
have a look at jdom dom4j and xom

10769987
django	turbogears	bottle	turbogears
as a django newbie i have some exprience with other python webframework like turbogears and bottle but exploring django i m trying to auto create the admin management for my app model

10769989
listview	gridview
we were not able to do it with listview but we found some example with gridview that looked exactly as we need then we spent some time using gridview and did put the image in the front of the text

10770039
x86	mips
you can compare mips and x86 compiles and look at the assembly language differences at

10770046
post	get
i will post the full code of the class below to show as well as the logcat i get when it the application crashes

10770077
bash	tcsh
you should be in a bash tcsh etc

10770100
google-chrome	firefox
the only thing in the callback parameter is a value which can be null cancel hit or an empty array in google-chrome and firefox indicating something was sent

10770153
children	parent
3 reloading parent with all children

10770200
awt	swing
the setvisible method of a component should always be invoked on the edt just like any other modification you make to an swing awt component

10770207
int	double
however when dealing with pods such as double int etc the story is quite different

10770214
ostringstream	std
right now the best you can do is use a std ostringstream

10770233
post	get
this happens both with get and post methods

10770234
put	get
you will have to do your query to get the array but i put in an example so you can see how to use the result

10770259
puts	gets
what is happening is that a and b are interchangeable in the formulas so there are two matches and thus puts gets outputted twice

10770260
int	double
even in 32bit architectures you should pass int and double by value

10770287
post	get
default value is get post

10770308
hide	show
alternatively you could hide the element by default and show it with javascript when the appropriate conditions are met

10770319
debian	mint
there are no nice packages on my mint debian i had to install libpcre3-dev ocaml libcairo-dev libgtk-3-dev and libgimp2.0-dev dependencies first but it should be worth an intsall

10770358
google-chrome	firefox
this is probably due to different cache mechanisms in google-chrome and firefox

10770362
nhibernate	queryover
in nhibernate 3.0 and newer queryover is a strongly-typed wrapper for criteria one of nhibernate s oldest query interfaces inherited from java hibernate

10770370
post	put
i recommend to not put fees and prices into the form and read it out off the post request

10770381
awt	swing
you are right setvisible for any awt swing container starting edt non safe way

10770382
comparator	comparable
if you can a good way to sort by first a then b is to implement comparable in your someobj class and make a comparator method that compares on both a and b

10770435
for-loop	arrays
basic idea is that i want to print out the arrays using a for-loop in the printloop func

10770442
submit	submission
ebay sanitise the input that you place into your listing quite heavily and they would not allow you for example to put html that submit to an external form submission script

10770454
button	checkbox
the problem is whenever the screen size changes when the user rotates the device the checkbox and the button disappear from the screen

10770467
viewdidload	viewdidappear
since you re saying the notification is received after the view is displayed once my suspicion is that you are registering for notifications in a method that isn t run until the view is displayed viewdidload viewdidappear etc.

10770483
httpconnection	downloading
i found some examples here on how to downloading a file but most of them seem to be using httpconnection

10770487
onfocus	onblur
you can use the window object s onblur and onfocus event handlers to find out what the visitor is doing at the browser level

10770494
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsitem
the qgraphicsview has no directly connection to the qgraphicsitem objects inside of the scene

10770494
qgraphicsscene	qwidget
if you really need this kind of normal qwidget behavior in a qgraphicsscene with layouts then you should be looking at qgraphicswidgets which do support layouts

10770539
textview	imageview
but to give a better insight into what i m doing i m trying to create a class that will affect the alpha of an object imageview or a textview for instance

10770563
google-chrome	firefox
the news beats and music rollovers and anchors work fine for me on firefox 12 and google-chrome 16

10770564
folder	directory
it all works fine until it has to add a slash to a link that has a matching folder on the root directory

10770570
free	malloc
malloc will then find a big enough free space with size of a multiple of the header size

10770600
post	get
i get different results from your post of the ascii numbers

10770628
hide	show
i ve got a select that on change gets the id value and im tring to hide all and show th ones that with the same id value

10770643
post	put
my solutions in these cases inevitably end up overriding the object s to_xml method since the create post or update put should internally call the object s to_xml to serialize your data into xml

10770645
google-chrome	firefox
the space is visible in both google-chrome and firefox so its not a browser issue it seems

10770698
minimum	max
this is correct based on a minimum value in the data of 2008-04-01 and a max date of 2012-05-01

10770741
entity-relationship	diagram
and why entity-relationship diagram s primary key is used as unique key in the data dictionary

10770743
post	get	client-side	server-side
as we know usually client-side technology can t parse vars which are coming from http mean from post and get this job for server-side one

10770750
client-side	server-side
maybe you re assuming that a change in a variable client-side would be reflected but it won t unless you re-execute that server-side code refresh the page

10770799
superclass	subclassing
i don t see the reason why you would want to do that but i would advise you to do as follows in your subclassing declare a separate nsmutablearray property let s call it nicestmutablearrayever and override the getter for your superclass nsarray property to return the mutablearray instance

10770814
width	height
in order to achieve the result you want in a flexible way you should only use float left on the elements make sure all elements have a well defined width this is important and preferably a height as well but it s not that important

10770851
addclass	removeclass
this allows the usage of the addclass removeclass toggleclass methods for manipulation as well as hasclass for checking

10770852
superclass	subclassing
the subclassing s designated initializer would call the superclass s designated initializer passing in the nsmutablearray to use

10770860
mp3	wav
when i try to convert the file from mp3 to wav with lame it gives me an error

10770890
x86	64bit
apparently i had it compiling to x86 i m on a 64bit machine and vs didn t like that

10770904
express	node.js
i have nodejs plugin installed in intellij but i could not find a way to create a node.js express project as what can be done with webstorm

10770906
post	get
also post and get have different meanings it s not just about how good it looks

10770926
entity-relationship	diagram
i have read and seen that many-to-many relationships in an entity-relationship diagram can be shown by adding another table which includes the primary key of both tables as reference keys

10770929
switching	screens
my guess is that this user independent logon screens that comes up directly after booting when multiple accounts are available or when clicking switching user on the lock screens runs in session 0 while user 1 runs in session 1 user 2 in session 2 and so on

10770932
post	put	post	get	put	get
http requests are mapped based on two attributes the requested url and the http verb get post put etc

10770934
minimization	fminsearch
why is fminsearch not working in this minimization case

10770937
x86	64bit
apparently i had it compiling to x86 i m on a 64bit machine and vs didn t like that

10770972
innodb	myisam
2 it s probably better to use innodb on the table you write to frequently as it supports row level locking as opposed to table level locking provided by myisam

10770994
hide	show
yes you can hide and show different parts of the dom via javascript

10771001
google-chrome	firefox
it works perfectly fine in google-chrome but i ran a test in firefox as the assessors will be using that and it fails to work at all

10771003
fossil	git
like git veracity fossil including a week of trying to install a

10771011
put	get
anyone has any ideas how i can get resizable to put the handles at the edge of the image regardless how big or small the image is instead of placing them at the edges of the full sized image

10771031
hide	show
when a user clicks on the link for a product we hide page 1 and show page 2

10771031
client-side	server-side
in summary this type of manipulation can be done completely on the client-side without any php or server-side code simply using html javascript and css as pointed out by marcel

10771084
children	parent
another option for design time is putting all wanted textboxes in a panel which will be their parent and then iterating over the panel s children controls and cast them to textbox

10771092
super	extends
i know that will work but i was under the impression that there was a way to just call super on the class i m extends from and have it do whatever it would normally do in its constructor

10771094
post	put
put simply the resources keyword specifies that you have an object like a user article post comment etc that you want to have create read update and delete actions on

10771102
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
when you save instances of classes using objectoutputstream change the classes or their names and then attempt to reload them using objectinputstream you are liable to run into trouble with saved instances not matching the new versions of the classes

10771109
superclass	subclassing
you can just call super -- also fyi in your particular example you don t even have to write a constructor in the subclassing it will implicitly call the superclass default constructor

10771110
superclass	subclassing
the parameterless constructor of the superclass is called automatically from the subclassing

10771111
superclass	subclassing
by default subclassing s default contructor will call superclass s default contructor so you can just write

10771119
superclass	subclassing
the superclass no argument constructor is automatically called when a subclassing constructor is called

10771190
int	chars
rather than working with string s you can cast int to chars and make use of it directly

10771208
hash	md5
there is no way to convert an md5 hash into another kind of hash

10771208
hash	md5
once you have the new hash you can delete the old md5 hash

10771263
width	height
if you want to match any width height values

10771280
range	minimum
the standard specifies minimum range not the precise range itself

10771339
width	height
the stride will always be of the full bitmap but the scan0 property will be different according to the start point of the lock rectangle as well as the height and width of the bitmapdata

10771339
width	height
so it is basically really just locking the whole bitmap but giving you a pointer to the top-left pixel of the rectangle in the bitmap and setting the scan s width and height appropriately

10771413
portrait	landscape
meaning there is no portrait landscape etc.

10771449
rational-numbers	fractions
the struct you describe only handles rational-numbers those that can be expressed as fractions

10771462
express	node.js
i m programming in node.js using the express framework

10771469
int	chars
if you want to minimize the calls to the random generator you can produce 5 chars from each random int

10771473
multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract	subtract	add
to implement the basic float operations you basically need to be able to add subtract multiplying and divide integers and do some bit shifting

10771532
jmenubar	jmenuitem
you need to add the jmenu and jmenuitem to the jmenubar

10771539
cos	sin
this may seem hard to believe but think about common transcendental functions sin cos log

10771541
iboutlet	ibaction
create an iboutlet not ibaction for both the buttons

10771559
accessor	properties
i would initialize the properties to null make it private with an accessor method and have the accessor do the real initialization the first time it s called

10771570
.htaccess	httpd.conf
enable mod_rewrite and .htaccess through httpd.conf and then put this code in your .htaccess under document_root directory

10771571
post	get
this post happens asynchronously so you don t get a page refresh unless you do something specific in the success section

10771571
post	get
of course you don t have to be doing a post either it could be a get

10771587
mouse	keyboard
if you want ui changes for any type of focus whether via mouse keyboard or programmatically then you should not use focus visual styles and should instead use setters and triggers in styles or templates that are working from the value of general focus properties such as isfocused or isfocuswithin

10771626
put	get
the compiler doesn t care it all gets compiled into a single dll and the folder is irrelevant although by default it does get put into a namespace with controllers

10771678
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the following is confirmed to work in ie8 safari 5.1.7 google-chrome 19 firefox 3.6 12

10771686
vsto	add-in
i have created the same button using vsto 3.0 for an outlook 2003 add-in and the same code creates a button that is at the top of the context menu above the open button

10771686
vsto	add-in
i am suspecting the problem is that the itemcontextmenudisplay event is being fired before the other built-in controls are added to the context menu whereas the outlook 2003 add-in button is being created in a method that is fired by the explorer.commandbars.onupdate event which doesn t exist in the vsto 4.0 explorer object

10771721
put	get
just put a number input edittext in your xml layout and when it s time to get the input grab the input

10771767
outputstream	inputstream
would be inputstream outputstream usage and you would use nio

10771787
ubuntu	linux
i have installed bottle on my ubuntu linux server using

10771857
bash	zsh
in bash or zsh to read a whole file into a variable without invoking cat

10771857
bash	zsh
invoking cat in bash or zsh to slurp a file would be considered a useless use of cat

10771858
ostringstream	std
the benefit and beauty of std ostringstream and std string is that you don t have to know the size of output in advance which means you don t have to use magic number such as 10 in array declaration

10771869
folder	directory
you need to create a blank wav file in the root directory not the www folder

10771891
facebook	fbconnect
i am using fbconnect in my project for integration of facebook.but now i saw in all apps when the user tap the facebook button it goes directly to the facebook app in the device to open for login.i think this is done with urlschema to communicate the app to app in a device.but how can we o this in case of facebook

10771928
facebook	fbconnect
also the fbconnect code see git github.com facebook facebook-ios-sdk.git has a sample directory with a hackbook xcode project

10771928
facebook	fbconnect
here is the facebook ios tutorial which uses fbconnect

10771951
vb.net	vb6
i remember the old vb6 way if you want to invoke a html element s click event in vb.net code

10772006
hide	show
sure i could use jwindow but then i would have to worry about emulating the show hide behaviour of a jpopupmenu using focus etc

10772028
int	boolean
table having boolean column boolean should only accept value 0 or 1 but it is accepting int value as well as string value

10772028
int	boolean
here strip_status boolean column accepting string and int value

10772042
int	boolean	int	chars
you can put arbitrary length strings into int columns floating point numbers in boolean columns or dates in chars columns

10772098
sorting	filtering
i also see the problem that the page reloads when clicking on a sorting filtering such as view all kitchen and miscellaneous which is what you want to prevent

10772098
shadowbox	lightbox
i made a downloadable demo using both quicksand and shadowbox a lightbox alternative here which might interest you since your webpage is linking the filtered icon results to a lightbox alternative named lytebox

10772117
folder	directory
i have directory like home user music home user photos and the like witch are inserted by the user and each new folder is a level so what i need to do is to create a method that recieves a number and then prints every folder that is at that level

10772118
webkit	gecko	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
there s a few swing-based browser widgets floating around which embed a gecko firefox or webkit google-chrome safari renderer and would thus be able to take advantage of proper javascript interpreters but they re all buggy expensive or unmaintained

10772118
swt	swing
eclipse s swt project includes a browser widget that appears to be actively maintained but has a dependence on the swt libraries and would be somewhat more difficult to use in a swing application though it may be possible

10772118
swt	swing	awt	swing
swt is an entirely different ui toolkit from awt swing which you re currently using and in order to take advantage of its browser widget you d have to find a way to embed it in a swing app or use only the swt toolkit

10772154
ivar	subclassing
vistedbyhumans is not actually an ivar but a global variable of your subclassing planet

10772157
width	height
hi i m working on an application that will be loading images and i m looking to scale each image to it s largest possible size for instance if the image is a landscape image if width is larger than height i would like to stretch the width to fill the width of the phone and scale height to keep it s aspect ratio

10772157
width	height
if the height is larger than the width a portrait image the image should be scaled to fit the height of the phone and width should then adjust to keep the aspect ratio i ve had a bit of trouble getting this to work here s what i ve done so far though any help would be greatly appreciated

10772160
width	font-size
because how much width a character or set of characters will take will depend upon the font-size

10772161
post	get
send a http request get post ... to the web server

10772184
hide	show
if yes it hide the close button + the box and show the open button

10772217
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
one tip for debugging this kind of problem is to always start from looking at the console log in web inspector if you are using google-chrome safari or firebug if you are using firefox

10772218
put	get
a single script would get insanely large then i divide by class or put the unittests into a separate file

10772237
google-chrome	safari
if you were using a browser other than safari or google-chrome that might explain any erratic behaviour

10772330
int	boolean
boolean expression automatically cast to int either 0 false or 1 true so you can also do it like this

10772363
folder	directory
the folder would then be created in the default working directory of the program which is the same folder where the executable resides

10772363
folder	directory
you can change this working directory using the setcurrentdirectory function before creating the folder and file

10772373
for-loop	loops
the continue makes it go to the next repeat of the for-loop instead of trying to execute the rest of the current loops - that seems like the right thing to do since the rest of the current loops depends on place lat lng

10772381
width	height
also make sure to update the width and height to match the new screen as well

10772391
width	height
however you have to give a width or height for this to work when the img-src is not found

10772396
google-chrome	firefox
my food menu works perfectly in firefox and ie but not at all on google-chrome

10772400
post	get
after your users authorize your app consumer you can see the realtime api docs on how to get it working and process the post done by foursquare

10772432
mouse	keyboard
a button triggers an action event when it s pressed and released using the mouse and not when it s clicked or when it s pressed using the keyboard space bar mnemonic keyboard shortcut etc.

10772460
width	height
increase either the height or the width to their maximum depending on which is already greater

10772533
next	except
itself puts things in next line always..and you don t have anything in except

10772543
google-chrome	firefox
this works perfectly in every internet explorer version i have but in google-chrome and in firefox both of the spans are displayed

10772553
google-chrome	firefox
this works perfectly in every internet explorer version i have but in google-chrome and in firefox both of the spans are displayed

10772569
scatter	graphing
i d like to achieve the same effect on my own scatter graphing although i m using circles rather than paths so it may not be possible

for get display width height

10772677
filewriter	bufferedwriter
you don t need a scanner and a filewriter and a bufferedwriter for this

10772683
jar	war
to give you another point of view and to be constructive i would go with embedding your jar into a war application and you get some things for free the most important i think is that you gain a managed application lifecycle so with a standard web application context listener you can start and stop your program in a managed way

10772693
put	get
then if i put them in a class project add the generated code compile and use this on for the reference parameter i still get code generated for these types

10772700
bluetooth	usb
i am using a usb bluetooth dongle in a winxp sp3 environment

10772718
glut	glfw
get rid of glut and use something better like glfw

solution use setinterval and clearinterval instead of timeout because settimeout only executes the closure function once or settimeout in your closure function

10772778
width	height
calculate the maximum size and set the canvas width and height properties

10772785

hide	show
from a conceptual point of view i don t like to hide show controls on the screen

10772888
hide	show
sometimes if you have a very cluttered form is better to separate the two functionality inside a tabcontrol or separate windows or as you have already done with this groupbox hide show functionality

10772900
free	malloc
but when you find you must use malloc then you would need to free it

10772900
free	malloc
typically parameter ivar local variable you would declare the enum by value but like int you may occasionally need to use malloc + free

10772920
notepad++	textwrangler
the regexp that you can run in various texteditors such as textwrangler mac or notepad++ pc

10772932
onmousedown	onmouseup
you have to manage yourself click and double click detection using the onmousedown and onmouseup

10772932
onmousedown	onmouseup
a click is a onmouseup following a onmousedown with almost no move between both

10772932
move	drag
if you do manually the drag drop that is without using the not so compatible html5 new feature you ll have tohook onmousemove so that you can display the dragged object during move and it helps detecting move between down and up

10772973

tested on firefox 12 google-chrome 19 safari 5 and opera 10

10773191
pull	push
no ftp as being done directly only push and pull has been used

10773229

10773579
hash	md5
thus it has a different md5 hash

10773588
spaces	delimiter
operator reads words delimiter by spaces when used with a string parameter

10773617
min	max
note min and max must be inclusive

10773633

but since the selection is usually made using mouse and keyboard events we can listen to them and check if a selection is made

10773708
min	max
the problem you have is that max - min overflows and gives you a negative value

10773726
getter	setter
then i used setter and getter as you can see above

10773736
freebsd	linux
the tool is believed to support linux freebsd macos x and windows cygwin environments

10773753
getter	setter
the jettycomponent in camel has getter setter where you can configure this in java code

10773796
children	parent
parent contains many children in an orderedset

10773796

10773807
opera	firefox
go into the preview print mode for opera firefox available

10773807
opera	firefox
use the available tools like firebug firefox or dragonfly opera to inspect the dom and the current styles

google-chrome	firefox
when i deploy it to heroku it is fine with google-chrome and firefox

10773992
getter	setter
one more thing to add is i am only referring to properties here since only they have getter and setter

10773998
getter	setter
the dot syntax is a special case used by property setter and getter

10773998
getter	setter
if you declare a property using the property keyword and then synthesize the setter and getter or declare the setter and getter to be generated independently using dynamic you can access the setter and getter using dot syntax

10773998
getter	setter
in that statement readwrite means i want a getter and a setter and assign means i want the value to be assigned to myint instead of retained or copied

distance	polygons
take the shortest distance between the point and each of the lines segments connecting the vertices of each of the polygons java2d apparently doesn t provide a method for this but the shortest distance from a point to a line is a fairly simple calculation

10775062
distance	polygons
for example you could order the polygons by the distance to their centrepoint defined as above

10775062
distance	polygons	minimum	diagonal
if the minimum distance to a segment that you have found so far is d then you can automatically rule out any polygons p where the distance from your query point to its centrepoint is d + r where r is half the length of the diagonal of p s bounding rectangle in other words for simplicity you imagine a bounding circle around that bounding box and check that the distance to that bounding circle is further than the nearest point found so far on other polygons

10775110
gridview	sqldatasource
i have a gridview and sqldatasource

the server should work with a qtcpserver and everytime you receive a new connection from a client you create a new qtcpsocket obviously everything server-side for now

10775386
windows	wow64
secondly and most importantly you also need to turn off inspection of sse registers which requires code injects that don t work under windows 7 vista wow64 the setting for this can be access via the options menu - debugging options ctrl + o - registers tab - decode sse registers

10775386
windows	wow64
also make sure you aren t using any plugins most are not compatible with windows 7 wow64 but they should generally lead to crashes on starting olly when you have olly working again then one can add the plugins one by one validating that they actually work

10775392

another way i found is use streambuf as i asked in my previous questition and then create istream ostream to it and fill content from it to std string as showed in documentation

10775961
width	height
to get the height and the width of the client dynamically use javascript and then set the height and the width of the objects dynamically

10775961
width	height
you can use the following javascript example to get the height and the width of the client.as it depends upon the browsers you are using

10775961
width	height
to get the height and the width of the client try this javascript

10775978
serializable	deserialization
there are a few approaches one could take involving trade-off between the size of the serializable deserialization routines themselves the size of the code necessary to use them and the ability to handle a variety of deserialization formats

that s my function to generate random doubles between a min and a max

10776096
min	max
returns a random number between 0 and max - min

allocator	stl
a good c++ stl or third-party library implementation can avoid a lot of this cost by including small buffers inside the objects themselves and only performing dynamic allocator when a large buffer is needed but very few do this in practice

10776252
libstdc++	libc++
if i m not mistaken llvm s libc++ does but gcc s libstdc++ does not. since this is a quality of implementation issue that s often outside the control of your own code the main thing you can do here to minimize the impact is be aware of the possibility that automatic objects allocate dynamic memory and avoid creating more than you need for example by using pointers or references when possible

10776302
post	put	post	get	put	get
all the requests get post put etc are instances of httpurirequest

give it a constant height and adjust the width to match that of its superview so that you can use it in portrait or landscape orientation

10776977
gentoo	ubuntu
i use both gentoo and ubuntu and i see that emerge the package manager of gentoo has a higher readability than apt-get aptitude just because it uses way much more color output than the latter

google-chrome	firefox
use console.log string variable instead when you are using google-chrome or firefox

10777034
google-chrome	firefox
the behaviour is identical in both google-chrome and firefox

10777202
post	get
this is fairly uncommon and i would recommend that you split the show the form action a get action and the save a form a post action

10777204
post	get
btw if you sending some request let s say it s post you don t need to perform separate get as sending a request generates a response in other words after sending new question with post first you re trying to save it to db if no errors render the page and send it back in response

uiview	calayer
a calayer is a core animation layer and there is one backing every uiview within ios and layer-backed nsviews on the mac

10777518
uiview	calayer
each uiview is effectively a lightweight wrapper around a calayer and each calayer in turn is effectively a wrapper around a textured quad on the gpu

10777549
inherited	properties
in your code any given draggabletoolbarview instance has two properties to connect to delegates one called toolbarviewdelegate which it inherited from its superclass and one called draggabletoolbarviewdelegate which is defined in draggabletoolbarview itself

10777549
ivar	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
this is allowed as long as the name of the backing ivar in the subclassing is different than that of the superclass

10777549
hide	show
now you can send setdelegate to a draggabletoolbarview and it will use the same delegate for the dragging methods and the show hide methods

10777560

as in increasing the height | width

10777627
hide	show
you should also not toggle hide and show in the loop if a search term only matches once then you are calling hide

put	get
it works if the file is in say the desktop folder but if i try to put it in the my pictures library i get this error message

10777702
mouseover	mouseout

10777740
carrierwave	fog
if you re using fog with carrierwave the documentation in the readme says you can set the fog_host option

10777754

10777866
ethernet	wireless
i wonder if there is a more compact way to find the link speed and the type wireless ethernet of a network interface in linux rather than just open and read the sys class net eth0 type and sys class net eth0 speed files for example

10777893
put	get
i don t want to put my .properties and log4j files in my resources folder in my spring mvc appication because these will get put into the jar at compile time and i want to be able to edit these files on my server when i deploy my application

folder	directory
the src main conf has my property files so in intellij i went to the myapp-web module and added a jar or directory dependancy pointed to that folder and chose classes

10777905
mouseover	mouseout
so you need a mouseover handler to set the text and a mouseout handler to put it back again

10777916
min	max
i grouped on date start only to show that if you remove the where clause you can determine the min and max start dates by start day

10777919
bottle	flask
i have never used flask or bottle or the other microframeworks but i would keep in mind where your project will be in the future

10777923
bottle	flask
i d totally go with flask unless one dependency bottle is better than three flask jinja2 and werkzeug

10777923
flask	web.py
i d suggest to avoid web.py it works but is full of magic and is inelegant compared to flask or bottle.

10777938
inherited	properties
problem is in using xaml i cant inherited from the control and assign different properties and it seems in using prism i have to use the default constructor in injecting in the control into the region

10777950
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
this problem can happen if you construct a new objectinputstream or objectoutputstream over the same socket instead of using the same ones for the life of the socket

10777983
width	margin
this doesn t work because the vertical margin is a percentage of the container s width

10777998
inherited	subclassing
cpcontrols as abstract subclassing of cpview contains a -setenabled method which most ui components inherited from

10778015
strtok	strcmp
alternatively if every token is separated by space you can simply use strtok and strcmp to distinguish between special words such as and the rest of the input

10778020
lisp	scheme	haskell	scheme
since clojure scheme and lisp don t support user-defined precedence or fixity it isn t possible to define these syntactic constructs in the way haskell does

10778037
width	height
second i did note that the content adds up to 430 and yet you have your background image set at 477px e..g background images bg_content.jpg width 903px height 477px - that might be the cause

10778092
apache	nginx
x-accel-redirect if also using nginx as front end to apache

10778117
hash	salt
2.looks like the salt is prepended to the password when generating hash

10778119
directx	gdi
the whole point of having an operating system is to abstract the hardware details and present to applications a clean programmatic interface if you want to draw onscreen you should use the graphic libraries provided by windows gdi directx

10778124
versioning	upgrade
i found that what i am trying to do is perfectly legal in svn 1.6 but i was trying to do it in svn 1.4 so all i have to do is upgrade to the newer versioning

10778139
width	margin
you always have to keep in mind the margin width and the width of its parent

10778146
flask	pylons	flask	django
most likely if you are using a popular web framework like django flask or pylons you can find many examples and tutorials specific to that framework that include sqlalchemy

10778149
express	everyauth
it s for sns-auth-process using everyauth and the project is based on express

10778149
express	everyauth
but a successful login info can be obtained throughout the everyauth but in my case cookie is more important since i don t exactly need a session management with express framework because what i intend to do is session management through socket.io

10778161
doc	rtf
this one does not support yet doc or docx but it supports rtf

10778192
put	get
next to fix the problem with the radio buttons put a around both single and multiple and get rid of the space

10778195
hide	show
if you really don t want to use ajax to show the more data you can load both contents in seperate divs and hide the full view when user clicks on the show more link just show it

10778232
range	max
if you need to persist it between jvm instances you may want to allocate a range store the max of that range in a database or other transactional store and make sure to request a new range when you get close to the max in the atomiclong plus appropriate locking to ensure you don t go past that range

10778235
width	height
the outer container fits perfectly with percentages for width and height

10778260
post	get
you cannot do http post for actions in a browser only http get which is why you receive the list of previous actions

10778275
accessor	properties
the method named zeswitch without the colon is actually the accessor method for the switch because you ve named your properties zeswitch

10778304
rvm	bundler
i don t use rvm gemsets or anything else i prefer to vendor all of the required gems within the project and let bundler manage the dependencies

10778306
folder	directory
i would like to dynamically build the menu such that all the group names are created based on the folder names in a specified directory and so that the slides to insert are pulled from within that particular folder

for timed tasks the simplest approach is a basic settimeout setinterval

10778346
flask	django	bottle	flask
i m building an application in both bottle and flask to see which i am more comfortable with as django is too much batteries included

10778346
flask	django	bottle	flask
most php frameworks seem to have a method of building an array of the segment variable names regardless of the number but neither flask bottle or django seem to have a similar option i seem to need to specify an exact number of segments to capture variables

10778347
jar	war
all of the proper jar files are in the war i checked but i m getting this error

10778361
google-chrome	firefox

required	placeholder
the design required that i put the name of each field as a placeholder in the form and i am not sure if this is why it is not working properly

10778463
mongoid	mongomapper
or you could use some full featured gem to do that for you like geocoder that supports mongoid or mongomapper

10778468
post	get
if you want to use simple get and post calls mvc will be good choice

10778511

10778632
width	height
at the moment the div nav_image is showing a width of 1200px and a height of 0px though

10778641
width	height
the doc says width and height meaning the two 85 s or how its displayed on the screen

10778685
superclass	subclassing
i have a superclass cpolygon and two subclassing crectangle and ctriangle

10778685
superclass	subclassing
the question is whether it s considered good form to implement a method in one of the subclassing that is not included in the superclass ie

10778701
implements	extends
recently i see a class says class a which extends service implements runnable

10778710

10778739
h.264	webm	mp4	h.264	mp4	webm
both of these methods will result in a loss of quality in your resulting videos as they are re-encoding the already encoded material and in my opinion even the webm codec is not nearly as good as a properly encoded mp4 using the h.264 codec

10778747
chown	sudo
sudo chown -r username users username library developer xcode

put	get
if you had put the contents array initialization codes in a separate method instead of the constructor you may not get this exception at the object initialization phase

10778804
comparator	comparable
natural ordering means that the elements must implement comparable so that they can be compared without the use of a comparator

10778804
comparator	comparable
the tricky part about giving the caller a choice between comparable elements and a comparator is that you can t do compile time checking to make sure they fulfilled at least one of these requirements

10778804
comparator	comparable
treeset s contract is essentially to throw a classcastexception if you try to insert an element that isn t a comparable if you didn t provide the treeset with a comparator when you created it

10778819
comparator	comparable
both comparable and comparator work by following the same principle but the first one as the name states is attached to a data class so that it is its natural comparator

10778850
post	put	post	get	put	get
rest use common operation get post delete head put

10778856
width	margin
instead of width 100 try display block and margin 0 -30px

10778868
for-loop	loops
the reason why your do while loops is not working is that you have a for-loop inside of it

10778908
width	height
the nav_image should have correct width and height now

10778922
post	get
using a more web-style of gets and post around specific resources starts to get you into the rest architectural style

10778948
short	base
the base class should contain only those methods which will be common to all derived classes you never put any method in base class that is specific to an derived class.in short base class holds only generic members which will be needed by all derived classes

10778954
post	get
the answer in the post was semi helpful but i can t get anything to compile

10779010
mouseup	mousedown
if it was simply adjusted to turn on a timer that ticked every 10th of a second after the object is clicked mousedown then turned off on mouseup or roll out instead of trying to do it for every mouse move event it would improve the performance significantly

10779044

canvas.fm used node.js to handle soundcloud s incoming mp3 stream and then piped this into ffmpeg giving an ogg formatted audio stream could then be piped into an http response

10779162
google-chrome	firefox
we ve already got this kinda-sorta working with html5 indexeddb but google-chrome is stupidly slow with large amounts of data 10 min to load and current versions of firefox have a lovely bug that randomly and irretrievably trashes the entire db so this is plan b -- plus we d really like to have a user-specifiable file that they can then backup mail around etc

10779214
google-chrome	firefox
this works only in firefox since google-chrome doesn t allow createobjecturl from window.webkiturl for some reason.

10779222
erd	diagram
for mysql and rubymine ide each of those tools will let you look at an existing database and you can even compare an erd from mysql usng the actual tables with rubymine s model dependency diagram erd using the information in the rails models

range	minimum
i have to make a marks program that displays a set of marks that a user enters and some calculations average maximum minimum range etc.

10779247
put	get
if you put the url of the site into a hashset you will get the same behaviour as your arraylist solution but it will be a constant time lookup instead of variable on the length of your list

10779256
hide	show
if you want to hide items from the listview i would prefer you to take seperate lvt show true only rather than trying to manipulate the views

if the line terminators are always one or the other i d suggest setting up 2 file connection managers one with the crlf row delimiter and the other with the linefeed row delimiter

10785537
setinterval	clearinterval	setinterval	settimeout	clearinterval	settimeout
another way of looking at it is using settimeout instead of setinterval and clearinterval

10785539
google-chrome	firefox
this fiddle return the correct value of 5 5 in both ie and firefox but in google-chrome it returns 5.5

10785539
google-chrome	firefox
which means that the client sets the culture both google-chrome and firefox reports sv-se so the globalize culture loaded is sv-se like in the fiddle above

implements	extends
make your sensors implements extends the interface classes

10785588
inherited	subclassing
the pointcut picks out all method executions for public methods returning void and having no arguments that are either declared in or inherited by middle even if those methods are overridden in a subclassing of middle

10785843
opera	firefox
i tried in ie firefox and opera

10785847

add overflow auto or overflow scroll and a width height to your div s css this will give you a scroll bar that will wrap the text and look like a textarea well without a border

10785872
google-chrome	firefox
the code is working fine in firefox google-chrome but gives the object doesn t support this property or method on ie8 in the line this .get 0 .pausevideo

10786087
put	get
if i put them in select clause or group by clause i dont just get the latest record but the other records as well

10786091
width	height
you need to set a height and width for your .logo

10786115
width	height
i am sure it is not about accessing the element from css bcs when i set the width or height or any other thing in the css it is working

10786192

as for the cdr you can have it as a csv or sqlite file or a relational database like mysql postgresql etc by using the cdr_odbc module

10786250
onresume	onpause
prepare it in onresume and release it in onpause

10786270
128bit	64bit
ideally i would like to specify the hash size 64bit 128bit etc.... but this is not a requirement

10786271
implements	extends
a good reason for a private method would be one that implements something inherent to that object that even an extends class should not change factual reason in addition to encapsulation

10786282
int	chars
my problem is that i don t know how to convert int value to chars array

10786334
hash	salt
use a collision resistant hash function with some static salt along with the internal id reference

10786370
children	parent
once i get the stuff i don t what all of this parent with children but i can t remove both

10786375
stdout	stderr
takes stderr file handle 2 and redirects to stdout file handle 1

10786377

10786397
stdout	stderr
redirects stderr to stdout

10786435
draggable	droppable
once you ve put in jquery you can just use the jquery ui library and use the draggable and droppable interfaces

i also don t want to give coordinate as a hard coded value but want to calculate using screen width height cause i want to run same application on torch i torch ii model of blackberry

10786475
google-chrome	firefox
i m trying to write a greasemonkey script that will work on either google-chrome and firefox

10786496
auto-generate	edmx
.designer.cs files are auto-generate and should never be modified because every save to edmx even after moving some entity in diagram or t4 template if you use it will trigger recreation

10786528
filesystems	fat
we all know that android doesn t support any filesystems for sd cards except fat

10786560
src	attr
you can also applies the jquery attr function to change the src and alt of that div

10786574
google-chrome	firefox
with firefox it seems to be working with a window.refresh...but not working in google-chrome safari...etc

10786576
width	height
since these cells don t have any content and only serve to visually represent days when the rooms are booked it seems rather pointless for them to have width larger then height

10786577
width	height
your height of scrol view is 250 and width also 250

10786582
rbac	acl
you could probably use an rbac for this but it would take a lot of roles to do it and some customizations and you d end up creating an acl anyways

10786597
solaris	aix
i want to port our application which works on windows linux solaris aix etc. but i have a lot of problem with locale

10786652
min	max
if all you want are linearly distributed bins from min to max then it is quite easy to write

10786671
hide	show
so the page has an apropriate javascript to show hide this

10786674
folder	directory
while iterating through aces i found that for aces with inherit flags applied to is folder subfolders directory

10786676
cpu	hyperthreading
i have 2 physical cpu each one is quad core and hyperthreading is enabled

10786685
queue	fifo
a job queue is a queue that is a fifo fifo collection of tasks to be carried out at an unspecified time in the future

10786710

this may sound ridiculous but a certain website sets content-disposition to attachment for images and i don t want the â save asâ dialog to pop-up every time

10786728
min	max
then i m setting max and min and using line height as the variable

10786735
google-chrome	firefox
it does block however when i request delay from within 2 google-chrome tabs or firefox and it executes sequentially causing the 2nd request to take 10 secs

10786809
portrait	landscape
my activity has 2 different xml layout for portrait and landscape

10786813
distance	polygons
but the condition was that the side of the polygons was 1 and not the distance between centre and vertices so we must scale

10786868
inherited	properties
due to properties value inherited all instances of links inherited the style that you have created because you did not use x key attribute

10786874
post	get
or if you are trying to pass values from javascript to php you will need to make use of http request variables post get or xhr.

10786876
width	height
but as the width of the div gets smaller i need the height to adjust as well

10786941
put	get
you need to get out the and if you already put your code inside those tags

10787010
put	get
i have to put somehwere otherwise i get this error

10787020
margin	height	width	height	width	margin
while a non-fixed width 100 takes all the container s width the height of an element when not set to a fixed size will stretch to accomodate any in-flow content including padding margin borders...

10787045
hash	md5
another way you can do it if you don t want to keep track of timestamps although that is the best method is to keep track of md5 hash or sha1 or whatever is least resource heavy

10787059
sorting	grouping
you will most likely have to grouping by category_name as well as sorting

10787065
portrait	landscape
the solution below will save 2 styles portrait rotated by 90 if original in landscape and vice versa

10787073
children	parent
you may have to tinker with the kind of join you use i know what should should nt have children but it will give you all the children categories with their parent sorted the way you ve asked

10787117
hash	salt
precomputation is pretty easy computing a table for id s 1-100 with all sorts of salt is actually a promising strategy since the attacker knows that it s sequential database ids that were hash here

10787206
folder	directory
so i just had to move the image folder into src so it will automatically make a copy of this directory into bin

10787246
switching	screens
if its the case each time you switching between the two screens all the changes you ve made on the character are reverted back in flash everytime a movieclip is instanciated or readed from a new keyframe its like it was a new movieclip used

10787246
switching	screens
or even a global _root variable even if its really ugly and re-apply that color to your character each time you switching between different screens

10787262
post	get
somehow they are able to redirect the user to a different page with some sort of get variable in the url which is what i understand to be the advantage of using get over post

10787298
min	max
then the tuning problem become one of max min size on the pool what the idle time is to prune the pool and what the behavior is fail vs block when the pool is maxed

10787316
equals	gethashcode
this method requires that you override the equals and the gethashcode methods for the car type

10787316
equals	gethashcode
that way my equals method simply checks for id equality and my gethashcode method returns base.gethashcode

10787350
equals	gethashcode
if they are you should potentially just use the default implementation of equals gethashcode which uses reference identity for equality

10787369
setinterval	clearinterval
first the setinterval clearinterval functions use a number variable to work

10787369
setinterval	clearinterval
setinterval returns a number variable and clearinterval takes that number in parameter to remove the previous started interval

10787373
vsto	add-in
seen a quite a few examples of calling vsto functions from vba using automation add-in com interop etc but not the other way round

10787373
vsto	add-in
i have an excel application vsto add-in that is only designed to work with only the one excel workbook

10787387
google-chrome	firefox
this is working like a charm on firefox and google-chrome but doesn t work on internet explorer 8

10787400
getter	setter
there s no difference until you decide to rename the generated getter setter methods and the message is likely to become invalid

10787400
accessor	properties
for the public instance variables you can skip the accessor methods both properties and method styles and use the structure dereference operator

10787422
google-chrome	safari
i suspect it would also be a problem in google-chrome safari and most if not all other browsers as well as i see what appears to be a special case for ie in the yui button click handler

10787422
submit	submission
finally since yui is submission the form on click yet another solution should be just to catch the form s submit event and check if the event target is your button do what you need to do then let the submit go or stop it as needed

10787462
post	get
the http protocol defines get type requests as being idempotent while post may have side effects

10787462
post	get
in pain english that means that get is used for viewing something without changing it while post is used for changing something

10787462
post	get
for example a search page should use get while a form that changes your password should use post

10787495
equals	gethashcode
instead of implementing equals and gethashcode just use removeall

10787495
equals	gethashcode
implementing equals and gethashcode in the way you describe strikes me as extremely dodgey - if your equals implementation returns true then your gethashcode method needs to return the same value so that those two objects will be placed in the same bucket in a hashtable

10787495
equals	gethashcode
implementing equals and gethashcode isn t entirely trivial and is probably something i d generally avoid doing if there are alternatives

10787522
post	put	post	get	put	get
i am developing an api that stores user request get put post delete

10787570
ant	maven
there are soo many advantages to using ant or maven

10787570
ant	maven
maven is more or less an update concept of ant

10787570
jar	war
so if your manager was to ask you to copy two hundred directories but ignore jar war and ear files within those directories and once copied

10787570
ant	maven
so that in mind ant or maven will accomplish and prepare all this on the fly with less overhead for your application to use

10787570
ant	maven
the size of the code in ant or maven will be 1 4 compare to java

10787571
post	get
if you re using forms based auth you can either fabricate the cookie for it or do a post and simulate the user logging in to get the cookie

10787600
implements	extends
and forces all extends classes to implements their own method render

10787624
children	parent
register the delegate for the parent and all children but that seems to be what you want to avoid...

10787624
children	parent
setontouchlistener still exists in m4a you can use it on the parent and all children same effect as option 1

10787634
for-loop	loops
i d argue that a for-loop is the wrong type of loops here it doesn t correctly express the intent of loops and would definitely suggest to me that you re not going to mess with the counter

10787655
std	ostream
warning friend declaration â std ostream operator std ostream const nvector â declares a non-template function -wnon-template-friend

10787655

noexcept	throw
based on what i have read so far the last-minute addition of noexcept seems to address some important issues that arise when move constructors throw

10787784
width	height
i ve written a couple test methods one that returns an int one a simple custom window object with width height members and successfully called both from the c++ app

10787813
stdout	stderr
another approach if you can t edit the source code of the to be executed class is to use runtime#exec to execute the class programmatically using the java command the usual way like as you would execute it in command prompt and then capture its stdout and stderr

10787827
google-chrome	firefox
i have a javascript that works fine in ie9 and firefox but not in google-chrome

10787919
ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	debian	opensuse	debian
by far the most popular are deb ubuntu debian and rpm fedora mandriva opensuse but there are also systems that distribute tgz files

10787937
profiling	instrumentation
instrumentation which is included in xcode ide already provides a good suite of profiling and performance tools

10787962

then instead of blocking on a recv send or an accept call you block on either a poll epoll or select call - then handle that event for that connection as much as you are able to

10788035
fiddler	charles
it looks like you want wireshark or fiddler or maybe even charles

10788052
folder	directory
i should also note that i ended up copying the glm folder to my include directory reciding in my mingw folder

10788059
next	except
disable include in next previous navigation for all annotations except occurrences

10788071
width	margin
so my guess is a margin of -200px which is as you say the negative equivalent of the width of the #left element itself causes it to float all the way up and to the right rather than to the left and to hug the edge of the #center element which itself is also floated

10788084
post	get
this method allows a full control over the requests made by the navigator filter and access to the request data headers get and post values etc.

10788084
post	get
you could log the requests analyze the requests and their post get fields etc

10788101
noexcept	throw
noexcept is primarily used to allow you to detect at compile-time if a function can throw an exception

10788205
google-chrome	firefox
this works perfectly on ie and firefox but on google-chrome it refuses to submit anything

10788241
width	height
to find your minimum width and height in density-independent pixels dp use

10788241
width	height
should use 72 dp for a height of one cell 294 dp and for a width of

10788263
versioning	upgrade
the solution should not modify the core since this would add many problems with upgrade and maybe future magento versioning

10788282
hide	show
i think it s better to do this with css classes rather than a load of hide show methods

10788380
width	height
the margin-left and margin-top should be negative one half of the width and height of the box respectively

10788446
entity-relationship	diagram
i am trying to create an entity-relationship diagram by reverse engineering a mysql database using a .sql file

10788447
setinterval	settimeout
you need to use settimeout or setinterval to trigger an action at some time in the future

10788457
google-chrome	firefox
i have an answer form google-chrome in firefox is the same

10788457
postgresql	mysql
in mysql this data was added to the db but the form is still on primary screen in web browser on postgresql nothing happend but the form is still on primary screen in web browser

10788461
noexcept	throw
if a function marked noexcept does throw then std terminate is called

10788461
noexcept	throw
allowing the specification of noexcept when calling functions that may theoretically throw but are not expected to for the given arguments

submit	submission
many email providers like google yahoo and hotmail will show ugly warnings about submission data to 3rd parties when you attempt to submit a form inside an email

10788698
getter	setter
it is the combination of a getter and a setter for some type a which has a field of type b so memberlens above would be a lens data int

10788698
getter	setter
well let s first make two simple functions that extract the getter and setter from a lens

10788698
getter	setter
what all of the lens packages do is essentially to wrap this concept of lenses - the grouping of a setter and a getter into a neat package that makes them easy to use

10788714
put	get
given the new entry is get the site1.com part using the function below i got it here and put the result inside the like

10788723

stdout	stderr
unfortunately the windows implementation of qprocess is hard-coded to check once every 100 milliseconds for stdout stderr from the external process

10788731
switching	screens
if the mpmovieplayerviewcontroller switching to fullscreen then rotating the screens then exit fullscreen the views are not well arranged they should be automatically

10788892
post	get
that said its pretty easy to setup flash to communicate with remote scripts as it has the ability to post get data through requests

10788901
int	chars
i guess the genre_id production_id and approved are int columns and not chars so it s no use to have quotes around numbers like 25

10788921
width	height
i tried opening it up with a hex editor and am trying to figure out its image height and width and its offset to the pixelarray

10789030
noexcept	throw
the compiler will try to figure this stuff out but it usually can t the function in question might be in another object file not visible to the compiler or transitively use some function which is not visible or when it does there is some trivial exception which might be throw that you re not even aware of so it can t implicitly label it as noexcept allocating memory might throw bad_alloc for example

10789070
post	get
you ve changed the queryset for the field for a get request but not for a post

10789070
post	get
either change it at the beginning of the view so it happens for both post and get or even better do it in the form s __init__ method

10789091
setcontentview	findviewbyid
findviewbyid only returns views in the xml passed to the current activity s setcontentview typically this is your main.xml for your first activity

chromebug has been long abandoned venkman doesn t work add-on authors are a little bit stranded there

10789170
int	boolean
it d be easy if i could use this boolean in a sort clause by mapping the distance to the query listing_location and multiplying it with the int representing the boolean true 1 false 0

10789214
int	double
i have an object a and i want to check if its value is double int or string

10789214
int	double
if object a 12.3 or a 12.3 it should be able to convert to double and throw while converting to int

10789214
int	double
if object a 12 or a 12 or a 12.0 it should be able to convert to int and throw while converting to double

10789214
int	double
if object a apple it should throw for both double and int

10789251
range	minimum
disregard the other things inside the string minimum maximum and range but for this line

well i had kept the middle td blank with specified height and width and was always working but did not work this time

10789265
dictionary	map
i loop my annotation dictionary but it show on map pin image from first dictionary on all my pins

10789306
hide	show
the start ensures its always visible when mouseovered the link is cancel which means it will stop execution if you mouse out too early and if you do mouseout it will then hide the image and remove the oncomplete event so that if you show it once more it stays visible when it comes into view

10789333
int	double
first convert.int32 double does not truncate the value taking the int part and excluding the decimal part

10789333
int	double
exception or something when i try to convert double to int

10789396
int	double
you could try to add some value to the double to make sure it s bigger or smaller than an int can be

10789396
int	double
double - int will work if the variable is in between the int-borders

10789423
int	double
i think you have a double and you want to convert it to int if itâ s an int and otherwise throw

10789452
width	height
now due to the limited functionality i kept the window size fixed having maximized as false and well defined height and width of 250x200 pixels

10789454
jar	manifest.mf
jar is never a black box --- it is basically a zip file so you can unpack it add your own main class that calculates parameters change main-class attribute in manifest.mf and you are done

10789455
pexpect	subprocess
i ported the same script to windows and changed pexpect to winpexpect and used the coresponding winspawn to start the subprocess but it stalls out at the first prompt

10789470
ssl	https
it is giving me a lot of ssl errors when i browse https websites from the application based on qtwebkit

10789490
mouseup	mousedown
instead of checking for both mousedown and mouseup on the same element check only for mousedown on your button and then check for mouseup on any other element

10789496
inherited	properties
i have written a .net 4.0 winforms numeric editor control which inherited from textbox and i have added a value properties that is a nullable decimal type as follows

put	get
i have it set up now so that this blocked call happens on a private dispatch queue and when i do get data i put a block back on the main queue

10789650
min	max
i have defined the min max length with min max of the repeating decimal because otherwise 009009009 would match in the first test case as well

10789651
findwindow	setparent
otherwise c.exe will have to use findwindow ex or enumwindows to manually find the hwnd handles of a.exe and b.exe and then call setparent on them

10789689
getter	setter
which only has a getter it doesn t have a setter

10789709
getter	setter
for example i will need to read and write to a textfield in the view so should i provide a getter setter for this

10789716
jasmine	sinon
my jasmine sinon approach to this is not really accurate due i m not testing that the method is returning the new collection i hope someone can come with a better implementation

10789737
put	get
retrieval operations including get generally do not block so may overlap with update operations including put and remove

10789813
post	get
you will need some php to get the data from the database or at least ajax code calling to external scripts that pull post from the mysql database

10789836
unsigned	short
dealing with the notion of an unsigned byte like this is normally done by expanding the byte into a short or int with the higher order bits all set to zero and then performing arithmetic or displaying your values

10789867
division	modulo
among other reasons to keep the following very useful relationship between the sibling operators of division and modulo

10789878
width	height
having maximized as false and well defined height and width of 250x200 pixels

10789926
width	height
fixed height and width id of the closest anchor and scrollto

10789937
ssl	https
however it does not prevent the user from manually attempting to access the subdomain using the https the ssl that i have does not cover subdomains and shows trust error when used for sub-domains

10790036
jobs	cron
you could set up staggered cron jobs on your 5 machines so it runs every 2.5 hours on each of your 5 machines

10790056
width	height
likewise avoid the scaling of the .inner divs by 200 in the width and height you shouldn t have to do that they should be the same size as the .hexagon div and the immediate children that you have classed as .before and .after

10790091
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
works in opera and firefox but not in google-chrome

10790125
screens	hdpi
but then after testing it on a hdpi screens i found it did not work so well

10790125
width	height
obviously after reading how to support multiple screens i am suppose to use dp to get the correct width and height to work with

10790125
screens	hdpi
i understand mathematically why this is happening but feel like there could be a better formula that would work for both ldpi and hdpi screens rather than just ldpi

10790137
google-chrome	firefox
i m designing a 2-column html5 interface backwards compatibility is not important all users will be using latest google-chrome firefox with a sidebar on the left and a main content area on the right

10790152
tax	shipping
by default crm charges tax only on the amount and considers the freight as tax-exempt however many regions such as canada require that tax is charged on the shipping freight amount

10790214
submit	submission
when form is valid you submit the data via javascript and maybe you process it before submission it

10790234
post	put
so each client would send messages to the application web server via a http put post and only receive messages via it s own pubnub subscription channel

10790240
folder	directory
if i need to build a blog i simply create a blog folder in the same directory as my skeleton app with it s controllers models and etc

10790293
inherited	properties
you could of course redefine all your child object s arrayiterator inherited methods to handle your special properties naming case on get or set but this would seem redundant and unproductive as opposed to just looping over setting anyway in your constructor

10790297
ppl	tbb
my project doesn t use intel tbb but uses the microsoft concurrency runtime parallel paterns library ppl technology

10790330
integer	unsigned
to answer your first questionâ how many bytes are required to represent a nonnegative integer using an unsigned representationâ consider the following functions i wrote in common lisp

10790341
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
as for compatibility should work on ie9+ google-chrome opera 11.52+ firefox 4+

10790357
mousemove	mouseleave
i have also tried the mousewheel mouseleave mousemove events but none get the effect i am looking for

10790371
width	height
okay this is killing me i can t figure out what i m doing wrong i have multiple divs which have a width of 350px and a height of 100px and i want to avoid them overlapping.

10790377
rvm	bundler
will allow bundler to work with any ruby loaded by rvm but by default will use 1.9.3 from

10790399
equals	gethashcode
implement the gethashcode method whenever you implement the equals method

10790399
equals	gethashcode
this keeps equals and gethashcode synchronized

10790420
equals	gethashcode
if you override equals and gethashcode you wouldn t even need to override the operators and that s a cleaner approach

10790432
post	put
also next time when you post make sure to put the full error log

10790439
hex	binary
im not having problems with the protocol im having problems with basic binary hex math magic

10790445
put	get
i m sure there s a much cleaner way but you could just use cbind to get the pairs of interest three times then use rbind to put them together

10790503
post	get
i use curl in my example but you should be able to get it using any sort of post request

10790552
fast-forward	merge
fast-forward means it didn t merge

10790578
post	get
using httpfox firefox addon i get exact same post data but result renders fine in firefox

10790610
udp	tcp
you can try to send your data less often and switch to udp which is non-ordered and unreliable but faster than tcp

10790614
int	chars
i ve seen other formats for referencing int or chars but i ve never seen this

10790641
width	height
it doesn t appear to be currently possible to easily change the way tinymce adds width and height tags to the img element

10790654
google-chrome	firefox
one final comment is that i do see this in multiple browsers tried google-chrome and firefox so far

10790675
post	get
in reality the data sent with the request is either get or post variables like you work with normally

10790711
linefeed	delimiter
the problem i have is that single line commands are delimiter with a linefeed but the data section consists of any number lines terminated with a . on its own line

10790728
put	get
no matter what back-end i use i can manually log out from fb and put url like and i ll get all info about the user

10790793
children	parent
are there multiple children ids per parent id

10790820
int	double
i have loaded this data in a different vector that can contains int or double

10790834
profiling	debugging
one potential reason is to make debugging and profiling easier with tco the parent stack frame disappears which makes stack traces harder to make sense of.

10790856
explode	implode
one easy way though not necessarily the most efficient is to make an array by splitting on the spaces remove the last one and then stick the rest back together into a string via explode array_pop implode

10790872
shadowbox	lightbox
i created a quicksand demo with shadowbox a lightbox alternative based on the original demo

10790888
min	max
i hightmap mesh is genearated from an image with a very simple algortihm the naive way is generate a flat plane that has the same number of vertecies accross and down then interpolating between the min and max y values of a boundary using the intensity component of the image i m not quite sure what you think the shading language has to do with that though

10790950
google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari
what i already have is a skeleton which works in opera safari and google-chrome

10790959
accessor	properties
i ve never used custom accessor methods but this seems like a clean way to set it up so i don t have to set up each properties in my viewdidload or elsewhere and don t have to worry about it being nil

10790963
restrict	shared
if i have restrict to shared my birthday on privacy setting no app would be able to grab my birthday even if they ask for it

10790978
uiview	calayer
if you put an nslog into your uiview s -drawrect method then override its default layer class with your own custom calayer that does its own drawing your uiview s -drawrect would no longer be called

10790990
getter	setter
but when i try to create the getter and setter for the entity factura .

10791009
google-chrome	firefox
on a desktop browser google-chrome firefox at least you ll see the boxes populating from top left to bottom right in the same order as on the source code and on a mobile device iphone ipad at least you ll see the exact opposite occurring

10791020
accessor	ivar
only access your ivar through the accessor

10791020
accessor	properties
declaring the variable as dynamic in the 4th point will signal to anyone that looks at your code that you ve likely written a custom accessor for that properties

10791080
interpreted-language	compiled-language
compiled-language have a rigidity to them while interpreted-language have a flexibility

10791115
lua	scheme
python scheme guile and lua are easily available to add as a scripting language to a c application

10791125
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i m getting this rendering issue on firefox safari and google-chrome

10791238
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested the site on the latest versions of google-chrome firefox and safari

10791248
profiler	gprof
another way to achieve that is to write a real profiler but such a tool already exists gprof and write a parser for it

10791287
inherited	properties
enums are primitive types and cannot inherited from other enums as inherited is a properties of objects

10791319
blogspot	blogger
i want to add copy to clipboard and open a new tab to blogger blogspot

10791341
folder	directory
since the path to the file folder is replicated in the jar the -c option changes directory before including the file

10791346
isometric	draw
checks the map the goal is to draw an isometric map a table like and displays it

10791412
google-chrome	safari
currently webkit browsers will support it like google-chrome and safari

10791430
equals	gethashcode
you should make them proper value types by overriding equals and gethashcode

10791450
textview	imageview
in particular i have a gridview that i have inflated with a layout that has an imageview a textview and a hidden textview visibility set to gone

10791460
post	put
to put it below a post you add

10791460
post	put
to put it above a post you add

10791470
concave	convex
subdividing a concave polygon into a set of convex polygons

10791470
concave	convex
in my comment above i suggested recursively subdividing the concave polygon in order to obtain a set of convex polygons instead

10791470
concave	vertex
if not at least 1 vertex behind the edge the polygon is concave

10791470
concave	convex
so the root node obb would contain the entire concave polygon and leaf nodes only convex sub-polygons

10791549
datamapper	activerecord
after all i can sure find posts about whether datamapper is superior to activerecord

10791551
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox load it perfectly but ie9 doesn t show it at all

10791579
int	double
use a double for the sum otherwise you are doing an int division and you won t get any decimals

10791599
serializable	deserialization
it s not even clear that v8 offers any kind of binary serializable deserialization of json structures

10791599
serializable	deserialization
this serializable and deserialization has a cost and it might not even be much faster than parsing the json text representation

10791616
hide	show
for my needs i found it easier to use an absolute positioned header hide it before scroll and show it when finish scroll i need the same code to support ios4 and android

10791616
hide	show
for my purposes i hide the header on a touchstart event and show it again on touchend or scroll event plus some timers to improve responsiveness reduce flickering

10791618
ethernet	wireless
interfacing such an application with delphi is pretty easy usually these days i would interface using tcp ip over either wired ethernet or wireless wifi

10791629
portrait	landscape
...that since the procedure happens only the first time a webpage is rendered that once the device is turned from portrait to landscape the inflation algorithm will grow the text based off the width change of the screen being wider even when set at 100

10791629
portrait	landscape
perhaps this is because 100 is in relation to the width difference of portrait to landscape

10791653
ampl	mathprog
fixed number of variables in a problem is a common assumption in solvers and algebraic modelling languages including ampl mathprog

10791674
mouse	keyboard
includes different animation directions depending on the way you navigate using scroll mouse or keyboard navigation keys

10791679
uiview	subviews
uiview s -addsubview retains the subviews

10791682
post	get
in this approach your clients send messages via typical get or post http requests which are handled by web2py controllers or other framework and receive messages from the web2py controllers calling comet_messaging.comet_send which sends a post request to the tornado instance which then blasts it out to its list of listeners

10791730
for-loop	arrays
you could try writing out the code for a dot product with all of the static typing of the counter input numpy arrays etc with wraparound and boundscheck set to false import the clib version of the sqrt function and then try to leverage the parallel for-loop prange to make use of openmp

10791733
rss	feed
i have done this before by extracting data from rss feed but for this application i am trying to use data from a webpage

10791751
post	put
the post are in a div that is set to automatically put the post on the next line when they overflow so the only issue is placing the post in the div in the right order

10791785
selecteditem	selectedindex
i think you are looking for the selecteditem property or possibly the selectedindex property and the items property

10791795
width	height
however i didn t manage to change the height and the width of the popup in this manner

10791799
entities	entitymanager
please note that in the 1st case all entities are created at the beginning of application one can also use builder pattern to create instance of entitymanager class - this will clearly abstract creation logic from usage

10791806
dictionary	map
a source map is like a dictionary containing a mapping of the raw names with the compressed names

10791806
google-chrome	firefox
source maps are supported in google-chrome and firefox dev tools but not enabled by default

10791808
getter	setter
org.achartengine.simpleseriesrenderer changed the class i added an and a boolean multiplecolorsenabled with its getter and setter

10791817
button	checkbox
the reason i am dealing with raw framework elements is that i could be adding radio button or checkbox or anything that extends frameworkelement to the grid

10791820
width	height
additionally your width and height property values are missing a unit of measurement

10791831
uiview	calayer
i was a bit surprised at first that uiview s drawing is helped by calayer but calayer s delegate is actually uiview

10791835
daemons	systemd
for programs that do not have terminals it doesn t make sense to hang up their terminal so the signal wouldn t be sent to daemons except by systemd administrator action.

10791835
daemons	systemd
you can do anything on this signal but systemd administrators expect daemons to re-read configuration files on this signal -- doing something else may be confusing and annoying.

10791880
post	get
if the action is destructive use post otherwise use get

10791882
put	get
keep in mind that the further offscreen you put the button the faster it will have to move to get onto the screen in the time allotted in the setanimationduration

10791922
bottle	cherrypy
change bottle to run using cherrypy

10791950
neo4j	datomic
you can build a versioning system into to neo4j that timestamps each entry and use a last-write wins algorithm and there are other database systems like datomic that have this built in

10791966
youtube	vimeo
for the embedded things i have been using auto_html with great success vimeo youtube images and even added soundcloud myself

10791979
subtract	add
for instance if you have a number in the range 0 1 and want to force rounding it to 4 bits of precision you would add and then subtract 0x1p49

10791981
width	height
will scale the image to it s largest size so that both it s width and height fit inside the area

10791981
width	height
will stretch the image to area s width and height

10792033
put	get
since you already have your data in json i would just put it into a hiddenfieldvalue and use a json deserializer on the c# side to get it back to a poco

10792057
width	height
the attribute and or any css declaration will always have precedence over the width and height html attributes

10792071
superclass	subclassing
so that the superclass constructor is somewhere even though i instantiated only the subclassing

10792071
superclass	subclassing
is easy to reason that the instance of the subclassing must include all the members of the superclass all of them up to object

10792071
inherited	subclassing
these variables and methods must include also variables not inherited by the subclassing

10792071
inherited	subclassing
so that the instance is not just what the subclassing declares or inherited

10792071
accessor	superclass	superclass	subclassing
for example if the superclass has a private variable priv and public accessor getpriv setpriv subclassing can invoke the accessor therefore accessing the variable modifying state etc

10792071
inherited	subclassing
i leave to some other discussion the rationale behind subclassing doesn t inherited private members etc.

you should also know that both streams inputstream and outputstream are calling the same delegate method

10796504

put the above on an aspx and you will get no complaint at compilation nor even at runtime - you ll just get

10796511

width	height
but imgpath never comes img height 50 width 50 src dp no-image.jpg but technically speaking it would take the value of noimage.jpg if error is there but every time it shows me the img with src as id .jpg

10796652
mouseup	mousedown
by default click event will check both mousedown and mouseup event to be fired before it fires the callback

10796652
mouseup	mousedown
the problem is that you click on the text your current target is the text now it means mousedown event is already fired inside the text area and it s waiting for mouseup event to be fired in order to complete a click event

10796652
google-chrome	firefox
in jquery we have event.stoppropagation or event.stopimmediatepropagation but it just works for firefox not in google-chrome

10796652
mouseup	mousedown
what i suggest is using mousedown and mouseup event instead of click event

10796660

inherited	properties
as can be seen in the definition of localbusiness schema.org uses multiple inherited to also include properties from the place type

10796778
inherited	properties
the first one use regular classes to model a single inherited tree and uses traits to mixin those additional properties

10796780
getter	setter
this is because by default jaxb when serializes a pojo looks for the annotations over the public members getter or setter of the properties

10796780
getter	setter
so either change and set the annotations on setter or getter of properties or sets the xmlaccessortype to field

10796803
google-chrome	firefox
this works perfectly as i want it to in firefox but it does not work in google-chrome

10796803
google-chrome	firefox
the select box changes as desired in firefox but no change occurs in google-chrome

10796807
post	get
if as in your post you only have get methods and not set methods you will need to explicitly add the xmlelement annotation as the default one won t be applied in this use case by default all unmapped properties are assumed to have a xmlelement annotation

10796816
onstart	ondestroy	onresume	onpause
this is probably what takes up the most time so i would start by measuring how much time is spent on these callbacks onpause onstop ondestroy onstart onresume of both activities

10796852
satisfiability	np-complete
incidentally i realize satisfiability is np-complete

10796871

what i am trying to achieve is that a user can drag the image onto the body of my site and then move it and reposition it anywhere they want - i dont have any difficulty with achieving this and have got it working before using the ui draggable and droppable

10796880
aggregate-functions	sum
you have a select statement for selecting aggregate-functions count sum etc

10796880
getter	setter
you do not need to write getter and setter you even can t do that

10796897
google-chrome	firefox
use mouseup instead of click it should work in ie google-chrome and firefox

10796913

10797512
margin	height	margin	font-size	width	height	width	font-size	width	margin
more precisely all sizes width height margin padding and font-size of the child elements images divs etc. are defined in em units so it is easy to scale the whole website only by changing the base font-size in the body

10797518

i m writing some java code to dowload files from a server...for that i m using the bufferedoutputstream method write and bufferedinputstream method read

10797638
post	get
when you wish to submit a form containing many fields which would otherwise produce a very long url the standard solution is to use the post method rather than the get method

10797651
gmail	hotmail
as per the requirement of my client i need to receive emails on my website from all other domains like gmail hotmail yahoo etc.like receive emails on myname mywebsite.com from any domain

width	height
i need to get new width and height of webview in onconfigurationchanged method is that possible

10797808
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
one approach would be to break the string down and parse components or another would be to use regex to replace the case-insensitive strings with the case-sensitive string

10797822
yacc	bison
the precedence of operators can also be directly derived from ruby s parse.y if you are familiar with bison yacc

10797826
button	checkbox
in you datagrid you would have to tag your checkbox with some identification and then use buttonbase.click event at datagrid level which will be handled for any click event bubbled for any button based eleemnt such as button menuitems togglebuttons checkbox radioboxes comboboxes that gets clicked in the entire visual tree of the datagrid

10797831

rss	feed
instead you should provide the user with personalised rss feed

10797959
rss	feed
each user would have their own rss feed related to the topics they have indicated they are interested in

10797972
put	get
the example below allows you to get dependencies like pil from dist.plone.org it pulls wtforms for form handling and gdata for crypto convenience and put them in packages.zip which can be added to sys.path before imports for example with import zippedpackages where zippedpackages.py looks like

10798054
post	get
i am trying to get the most updated comment for a post

10798123
keydown	keyup
it s obvious you can t do something like this to suppress a wm_keyup message when a you process the keydown event a keypress message is already sent to your control but the keyup message won t fire until the user release the key

10798123
keydown	keyup
a solution would be to use a boolean flag suppresskeyup set it to true at keydown and check it and resetting it in keyup but you ll have to check it thoroughly and see what happens when the user misbehaves like pressing two keys

10798127
bufferedoutputstream	bufferedinputstream
bufferedinputstream and bufferedoutputstream typically rely on system.arraycopy for their implementations

10798132

i want to know some suggestions on how can i manage or design my page for mobile app so that it fits well in both the portrait and landscape orientations

10798239

so i would instead suggest adding the userid and the password hash i.e md5 sha1 to the session and obtain the user information using both of them each time

10798249
tabs	tabpanel
basically we arrange the tabs in the tabpanel in the tabcontrol

google-chrome	firefox
an ex developer of ours when working on one of our first versions of our internal php framework integrated the dropdown element of main navigation using javascript and i need to get a fix applied for ie8 which is causing the dropdown to appear offset even though using css displays fine in firefox google-chrome

10798474
google-chrome	firefox
as i mention this is working as expected in firefox google-chrome

10798506
getter	setter
both programs are independent first lets say getter in java and second setter in c++.

10798529
hash	md5
the problem is that potentially two different bytearrays could hash down to the same md5

10798547
integer	fractions
a variable with implicit type which is assigned an integer value will be an integer so it won t have a fractions part

10798580
put	get
if you are retaining your fragment instance you should be able to get away with just using ordinary setters to put stuff in data members

10798612
hash	md5
it may happen that two md5 hash collides are the same

10798641
alarmmanager	timertask
yes you can use alarmmanager class or timertask class for such purpose

10798649
urwid	ncurses	mouse	keyboard
urwid provides a higher-level toolkit on top of ncurses and includes an event loop to handle keyboard and mouse input

10798653

10798662
getter	setter
your getter setter for courses is not correct

10798662
getter	setter
your getter setter dont follow correct naming convention which is required for hibernate

10798976
google-chrome	firefox
see fiddle open in google-chrome then in firefox

10798995
getter	setter
it s the getter setter method names that are important for properties not the name of the field

10798995
getter	setter
you should correct this for all getter and setter you have.

10799006
rss	feed
i m trying to implement a console library that reads data from composite c1 global datatype called rss feed and then foreach rss feed the application must retrieve rss entries from the link attribute and insert all entries into a global datatype called rssitem

10799034
getter	setter
property - create the declaration of your getter and setter

10799034
getter	setter
synthesize - provide the definition of getter and setter based upon the parameters which are passed inside property

10799036
ati	nvidia
target only newer opengl versions and drop support for anything below would be a viable option since most of the videocards by ati nvidia and even intel support some version of opengl 2.0+ which is roughly equivalent to the gl es 2.0

10799051
maven	cargo
is probably maven cargo plugin

10799059
google-chrome	firefox
firefox google-chrome and ie10+ support this

10799089
elf	dwarf
where the implementations of creature are serializable objects of type elf man dwarf and hobbit

10799101
mef	prism
that there s also prism mef unity reactiveui - this is becoming too much

10799102
getter	setter
so you have to make public accessor methods getter and setter

10799102
getter	setter
and in the implementation you just write synthesize to make the compiler include the automatically created getter and setter at that position

10799144
width	height
actually it is best to set the width 240 and height 180 in your img to reduce page load time to tell the browser of the exact dimensions of your image s

10799214
getter	setter
and think of how much work is required to code an accessor - 4 lines for getter and 2 for a setter

10799241
width	height
just a tip use sp for textsize and dp for height and width of controls

10799252
public	protected
if you only want callers within the class or a subclass to be able to call it then make it protected - otherwise make it public

10799306
post	put	post	get	put	get
rest doesn t mean a great deal more then you use http verbs get post put delete etc properly

10799347

i am currently in the middle of creating an app that uses a sql ce database i have made this database deploy-able with the application however the problem i m having at the moment is i need to run testmethods but this is erroring out when it doesn t find the database as its looking in the testingproject folder under debug or release as that is it s data directory

10799393
post	get
i have quite a few restful get and post methods implemented in wcf 4.0

10799414
entities	entitymanager
to persist recieved entities you should use persist or merge methods of entitymanager class

10799454
children	parent
then you should use the .on to bind handlers on the parent for the children

10799469
uiview	subviews
i have a uiview and i have multiple uiimageview s as its subviews

10799479
getter	setter
property and synthesize are two objective c keyword that allow you to easily create your properties and therefore avoid to write by hand getter and setter methods of the property

10799479
getter	setter
the property define the property itself should be placed in the header file and can get some attributes as for example strong nonatomic retain assign copy the synthesize should be placed into the implementation file and tell the compiler to generate the body of getter and setter method

10799491
post	put	post	get	put	get
url just tells where the resource is located and you can invoke get post put delete etc on this url to invoke the resource

10799492
sorting	filtering
the problem is that standard restfull api don t any standard interface for sorting paging and filtering of the data

10799492
sorting	filtering
after that i hope it will be clear my recommendation to extend the current standard restfull api with additional methods which have additional parameters and which provide sorting paging and filtering functionality

10799492
sorting	filtering
moreover because of the same reasons it has sense to implement sorting and even filtering of the data

10799492
sorting	filtering
i want to emphasize that restfull service gives you no standard interface for sorting paging and filtering of the data

10799492
sorting	filtering
it s page rows which specify the page number and the page size which will be asked from the service sidx and sord parameters which specify the sorting column and the sorting direction and _search and filtering the last is in the format which allows to support filtering

10799492
sorting	filtering
you will have to extend the interface with additional parameters used for paging sorting and filtering or you will be not able to create performant and user friendly web gui

10799511
post	get
when i post data from first into servlet i want to get the www.example.com but not first.jsp

10799516

as correctly pointed out above by quentin rest archiecture simply implies that you d use the http verbs get post put delete.

if you need to do a search which users are in a bounding box you need to change your database to mysql postgresql or use solr to do the job

10799784
post	put
if i wasn t using nuget to pull in dependencies then this could easily be solved with a post build step to copy the dependencies from wherever i had decided to put them in my source tree

10799791

2 instead of h link if you don t want to expose ticket id you can use a commandlink which before navigating to viewticket.xhtml gets the ticket from jpa and puts it in flash scope

10800235
google-chrome	safari
this works fine in google-chrome and safari

10800273
int	chars
now let s say we have two arrays one chars and one int like this

10800273
int	chars
that said if one wants to print an int array as it was a string one either has to write a function wrapper to build a chars string holding only the values of the first byte of each int or one that builds a string with all the 0x00 values diked out

agda	ats
ats is a dependently-typed language that is designed for low-level programming though it s somewhat less elegant than agda

put	get
it s obvious that in a multi-threaded scenario where multiple threads put items in the queue and multiple threads get items there are race conditions

10801098
wikitext	mediawiki
if by an editor same as wikieditor with all its functionalities mean that you want wikitext output then you probably have to look in the mediawiki source

10801179
background-color	transparency
the flicker you re noticing is actually the button s background color being changed to transparency so the button flashes or turns white in your fiddle because the body s background-color is white

10801195
pyyaml	libyaml
based on some playing around i have determined that the version of nltk provided in the fedora 16 yum repo version 2.0.1 does not have libyaml support compiled and in addition is incompatible with the version of pyyaml that pip provides

10801202
width	height
i think the problem is that the view in the first row are resized in the width but not in the height

i followed this post to install r d com server in order to call r from the matlab but i get error messages

10801300

10801414
uiview	calayer
the blue square is a 22x22 pt uiview instance and the red square is a 22x22 pt calayer instance

10801414
uiview	calayer
note both the blue uiview s and the red calayer s frame are set in the overridden setframe method of the container view but results would have been the same if i had set the blue uiview s autoresizingmask property to uiview flexible left and top margins

10801414
uiview	calayer
of course the required visual result of the two squares sticking together could be achieved in any number of ways for example by having both layers become either calayer s or uiview s but the project that the real issue is in has a very legit cause for the one to be a calayer and the other to be a uiview

10801433
int	boolean
after trying several things i simply change the type in oracle from boolean to int leaving the java code still as setboolean 3 true and everything works

10801518

children	parent
i have a table with an association to itself so that any children menus are mapped to any parent menus within the same table but i am having an issue inserting the first parent

10801725
implements	extends
my solution was to write a custom soaprequestfilter that implements a javax.servlet.filter and a new class that extends httpservletrequestwrapper

10801725
implements	extends
since httpservletrequestwrapper implements the httpservletrequest interface extends the wrapper allows you to copy the httprequest and act on the stream without consuming the object and causing issues downstream

10801725
outputstream	inputstream	httpresponse	request
if the request needed to be redirected i created a new httpurlconnection to the old soap webservice and set the inputstream from that response to the outputstream of the httpresponse

10801731
int	boolean
but as you said after trying several things i simply change the type in oracle from boolean to int leaving the java code still as setboolean 3 true and everything works

10801731
int	boolean
hence you save time as compared to setboolean and int where you go from boolean to bit to int

10801731
prepare	execute
just prepare and execute

10801750
do.call	lapply
i m learning r recently and confused by two function lapply and do.call

10801802

10801823
jobs	cron
i don t have much experience with cron but i have found the crontab file i am using parallels power panel on a vpn and it already had jobs to run-parts cron.hourly daily weekly and monthly

10801823
folder	directory
even if i tell it to look for a folder which i know doesn t exist like cron.myfakefolder i don t get a not a directory etc cron.myfakefolder email

10801846
do.call	lapply
lapply is similar to map do.call is not

10801846
do.call	lapply
lapply applies a function to all elements of a list do.call calls a function where all the function arguments are in a list

10801846
do.call	lapply
so for a n element list lapply has n function calls and do.call has just one function call

10801846
do.call	lapply
so do.call is quite different from lapply

10801853
put	get
this is to avoid too many jni calls this method does 2 jni calls while the former makes one per put get

10801863
for-loop	arrays
apart from iterables also arrays which don t implement the iterable interface can be used in the enhanced for-loop

10801883
mapply	lapply
lapply is a special case of mapply

10801902
do.call	lapply
lapply applies a function over a list do.call calls a function with a list of arguments

10801910
hide	show
i have to display images dynamically and show hide depends on state of checkboxes using style and datatrigger

i m trying to create a poker chip like the one here products_id 379 using expression-blend 4 for a wp7.1 silverlight 4 app

10802004
nsurl	nsdata	nsurl	nsstring	nsstring	nsdata
from there you can save a reference nsurl or nsstring to the image s path in your app s document directory and you can load it from there using something like uiimage aimage uiimage imagewithdata nsdata datwithcontentsofurl pathurl

10802056
client-side	server-side
the server uses reflection to call the appropriate method in the server-side object and client uses javascript s call method to call the appropriate function in the client-side object

10802056
serializable	deserialization
the library uses jackson to take care of the serializable deserialization of various java types to from json

10802082
width	height
this mapactivity - width and height must be 0 question suggests the problem is the zoomin method is in the oncreate method

10802082
put	get
but i get same error when i put it in the onresume method

10802082
width	height
mapview has definitely positive values for width and height

10802082
width	height
work because it returns 0 for width and height

10802116
post	get
and here is the php code i am trying to switch from get to post

10802118
inherited	properties	inherited	subclassing
definitely put them in subclassing b the only reason you should put the methods in the class they both inherited from is if both will use the method or there s a likely hood that in the near future another class will be added and will use the methods properties fields or in your case variables

10802157
cout	cin
however if i remove the second pair of cout cin statements the program works fine

10802167
width	height
the width and height properties in myimage class were too small for the image to show

10802187
width	height
the width and height are still getting set in css but the src is now set within the javascript

10802187
width	height
you re setting it as a background with a fixed width and height

10802187
width	height
background image scaling isn t widely supported so it may be easier to add an image to the div with a specified height and width

10802213
wordpress	joomla
there are a ton of plugins for wordpress or joomla that set this up for you including subscriptions and individual items through paypal

10802227
parallel.for	begininvoke
using begininvoke the progress bar update is delayed to the end of the parallel.for loop

10802236
post	get
what you should really do is get the signed_request on first page load from post and add it to the url of your app as

10802250
addclass	removeclass
instead of addclass myimage you used removeclass myimage

10802265
integer	unsigned
you can use the shift operator to convert the number to an unsigned integer before converting to binary

10802280
versioning	upgrade
this is a temporary solution until we have an opportunity to upgrade to a newer versioning of the dependencies

10802305
post	get
basically i want to get the event id and the permalink id long number and the user id and post id

10802331
min	max
also important to notice the min max and tickinterval have no effect since we use ticks

10802342
post	put
also post what you ve tried and what the results were both to give further information and to make it obvious that you ve put some work into it.

10802369
post	get
this would be useful if you use get instead of post

10802440
mouseup	mousedown
so i think the correct implementation would be to capture the mouseup mousedown events hold the state in a variable ismousedown and check this variable in the hover function

10802456
oncreate	onstart
oncreate - onstart - onserviceconnected

10802464
post	get
after searching for how to post large files using python i came across this and i wrote a program based on that but when i run it i get the following error message

10802488
post	get
if i want to give access to guest on edit get and edit post to admin user i cannot do it via fluent security as it identifies both the methods as one

10802498
post	get
to get the post a user promoted you can do

10802554
google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome and safari if the browser is not able to connect to a local

10802555
min	max
of 20 of each item and a max of 60 of each item so apple 25 peach 25 pear 25 and orange 25 works perfectly but not apple 0 peach 0 pear 50 and orange 50 because we set a min of 25

10802555
range	max
but is there a way i could modify this formula or use something else that would tell me how many results to expect if i have something like 40 items with a range of 2-5 or something something that factors in the max value as well

10802582
width	height
it gets called if the mapview is attached to the window and therfore has width height

10802590
stringbuilder	bufferedreader
but basically using stringbuilder you are appending one line at a time the string data from the bufferedreader into the stringbuilder which you can use to get the final string once the entire buffer has been read

10802640
screens	tablet
i added preference-headers to my app so that the preference screens would not look broken on honeycomb and tablet sized ics

10802655
filtering	grouping
for my first table i opened the grouping properties of the row within the table and under filtering i made the following

10802677
portrait	landscape
my problem is that whenver i load an image from a file as a bitmap and create a scaled down thumbnail the images always gets horizontal instead of maintaining portrait or landscape

10802681
gif	png
in chrome 21 it doesn t work with the file extensions mentioned but if i change the filter to image files jpg png gif it filters the choose file dialog correctly

10802689
versioning	upgrade
if i decide to upgrade to a newer versioning of jquery i just change my dll and it s changed everywhere

10802702
width	height
but as you can see it always seems like you have to give the width and height properties i already checked the documentation but it s always short and not that s detailed and i tried giving null parameters or empty parameters but it doesn t work.

10802720
rss	feed
currently i am using this code to pull a rss feed from yahoo weather but i would like to style it the way i want but i am not sure how

10802737
put	get
i m trying to put together what i thought would be a simple ignore filter but can t seem to get it working

10802755
getter	setter
it would appear that the xraywrapper used by greasemonkey to wrap around dom elements is quite an imperfect wrapper since it doesn t really support the innerhtml getter setter

10802776
monticello	gemstone
the preferred mechanism for transferring code to gemstone using gemtools is to use monticello packages

10802830
post	get
this should give you the desired result tho at the expense of the action now being a get rather than a post

10802838
serializable	deserialization
this process is known as serializable deserialization

10802847
post	get
if you send it like form data post insted query string parameter get for form submission

10802851
std	ostream
later you could add your own proxy-object with overloaded stream operators which i think is still easier than writing your own stream derived from std ostream

10802859
hide	show
i can t be able to use startactivityforresult because if i use this method the tabhost hide and i want to tabbar is show in whole application

10802880
rsa	dsa
if you want to use keypair generator use an algorithm like rsa or dsa in the getinstance method like this

10802924

10802933
super	extends
i was actually trying to extends the arrayblockingqueue and add some some state and overrided add and i promptly got the java.lang.nullpointerexception when i invoked super capacity fair col constructor

10802953
onclick	onchange
on your you will need to use onclick or onchange depending on how you want it to look and feel which will call a function that takes in the selected option

10802966
for-loop	loops
i find the behavior of jslint not good but i agree that declaration of variables inside of for-loop is bad because it will be read by most persons as code with local loops variables which is incorrect

10803031
spaces	delimiter
i have data below with three different delimiter the first has a spaces to the number the second 3 spaces to the number and the final column a spaces and then a tab to the number and i want to be able to generate a list containing sequential values from each column

10803042
subtract	add
but we have subtract the distributions where two buckets contain more than upperlimit items twice we must correct that and add

10803096
min	max
you could use a smart choice of max and min width like this

10803096
portrait	landscape
the value can be either landscape horizontal orientation or portrait vertical orientation

10803152
typedef	struct
i have tried to make the typedef of myproc before the struct typedef but got too a compilation error

10803171
post	put	post	get	put	get
how can i implement a basic rest api with get post put delete methods in snap

10803215
put	get
use the cximage library on codeproject.com to save your image to disk--assuming you know how to get a hbitmap or cbitmap of the image you want to save put into word

10803238
post	get
problem is i ve set up a test case in exactly the way they want but only get is working cannot post to my website

10803293
getter	setter
however it you can split getter and setter into separate interfaces it would be possible to use c# template co-variance feature

10803322
width	height
basically i want to use link blocks of specific width and height and position within the popup image creating a link within a link

10803417
xpages	lotus

using bindparam instead of bindvalue to bind parameters by reference

10803481
return-value-optimization	nrvo
look this up along with return-value-optimization and nrvo

10803533
post	get
that sounds odd you may have to post some code to get more help

10803534
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome has a setting to add css rule to the value within the h4 tag which increases the height value of the element as follows

10803557
unsigned	short
i have to convert bytes to signed unsigned int or short

10803629

but still we get jaxb binding exception while doing post operations

10803644

however when they try to put more than one calling of the function per page they get this error in the error_log

10803693
appkit	nscell
some of the nscell subclasses in the appkit framework do this and fail to document that they have done so with the result that youâ ll ponder for hours why it is that -starttrackingat inview never gets called

10803735
post	get
firstly i realise my question may be relatively similar to some other post however i tried implementing code from other post but just couldn t get it to work the way i wanted

10803750
folder	directory
you should be using the temp folder instead of attempting to write directly to your webapp s deployment directory

10803751
width	height
this assigns a minimum dimension to the body equal to the width + margins and height + margins of the absolute element

10803751
width	margin
the inline-block element will account for the margin of its inner elements to determine its own width which then allows the right margin to work

10803751
width	height
solution does not work on the #wrapper being position absolute is because it makes the body have a zero width and height since the absolute positioning takes that element out of flow and there is nothing left inside body to give it dimension

10803802
implements	extends
you may be passing a class that extends thread to execute when you should be passing a class that implements runnable

10803855
rss	feed
i am working on an asp.net page that contains an xml reader that reads from a wordpress rss feed formats the posts and pastes it on the secure site

10803866
folder	directory
when i go to click on them in the datagrid the link is directed to the application root directory and not to the proper folder

10803881
git-rebase	undo
so if your git-rebase is wrong you can undo it by pointing the branch to where it used to be with

10803885
sorting	filtering
to provide filtering sorting etc you could use interfaces then you could access the window datacontext and execute commands in it

10803885
tabcontrol	tabitem
if you need them all open at once you could create usercontrols instead of windows and show them at tabitem inside a tabcontrol

10803906
implements	extends
any class which extends to baseadapter will implements 4 methods getcount getitem getitemid getview

10803918

i ve tried all i can with background-position position top left margin padding border and even background-size properties and although it works great on every device tested including ipad

10804057
oncreate	setcontentview
add this in activity oncreate before setcontentview

10804095
int	chars
bufferedreader.read reads a single chars not an int

10804098
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to the supported versioning of activeperl 5.14

10804113
carrierwave	paperclip
i would personally recommend not using ckeditor gem if you already have an existing attachments model through paperclip or carrierwave

10804124
for-loop	arrays
you might be surprised how fast a for-loop can execute over an arrays in modern browsers

10804165
ppl	tbb
framework such as ppl or tbb or generic threading

10804183
maven	pom.xml
i just found that when using maven i needed to also modify the pom.xml to have the compiler plugin

10804185
hide	show
next code allows hide show the data container table related to the checkbox

10804185
hide	show
and next code it should init the hide show state after page s load

10804223
postorder	inorder	preorder	postorder	preorder	inorder
i have a question i want to create postorder from inorder and preorder but i don t wana use reconstruction of tree i want only recursive do this

10804223
preorder	inorder
i code this and at this moment i have a part of right side of tree in preorder first char in preorder is root i find this in inorder and i have left and right side i recurency translate to right side but i have a problem with left side of tree

10804266
inherited	properties
the moment you write to an inherited properties of an instance a new copy of the properties is created for that instance

10804266
inherited	properties
where typeb inherited the val properties from typea

10804266
inherited	properties
in both the above cases when objb1.val is written it no longer refers to the inherited properties but instead a new copy of the properties val is created for instance objb1

10804292
width	height
it will be half of the actual width or half of the actual height

10804292
width	height
you can get the value of r from blend the actual width and height will be written in parenthesis in the width and height boxes - divide it by two

10804292
actualheight	actualwidth
if there s a need for variable sizes and the view box route doesn t work - there s another way to implement it because silverlight fails when you bind to actualwidth actualheight properties - with border s that hold rectangles

10804331
getter	setter
you should create getter setter for your phone # parts and do you validation checking in the setter

10804332
ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	iqueryable	ilist	iqueryable
i ve been using the method below without any issues nor without any performance issues so far i have tested with ilist list of t ienumerable ienumerable of t iqueryable and iqueryable of t

10804383
getter	setter
using getter and setter is a good option

10804396
equals	gethashcode
if included a gethashcode method one could define the semantics of to say that items should compare equals when examined as t s

10804396
equals	gethashcode
consequently if an implementation of does anything other than call equals within it a derived class which overrides equals and gethashcode and does not re-implement will end up with a broken implementation of that interface

10804408
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
this is different from inherited where a subclassing automatically implements the methods of its superclass and those methods can optionally be overridden on a subclassing by subclassing basis

10804408
superclass	subclassing
i suspect that you have some oop background so i won t go too much into subclassing other than to say a subclassing is very often a specialized or more specific version of the superclass

10804408
superclass	subclassing
in other words every subclassing is a kind of its superclass but every superclass is not necessarily a type of subclassing

10804414
post	put
it doesn t have replay option it just pops up a window on any request after you activate it you modify the values and then press a button to actually perform a post put

10804442

i have some page and works fine on google-chrome and firefox

10804521
google-chrome	firefox
as you can see the font is not the same at google-chrome and firefox

width	height
a don t declare explicit height or width in the svg file

10805116
subclass	abstract-class
if you can t subclass then an abstract-class is not a viable solution and interfaces are only going to give you the contract that your common classes conform to without any implementation

10805164
width	height
loadingimage sets it s width to its width and its height to its height

10805164
width	height

getter	setter
here is the interface file generated by the wsdl wizard i truncated the getter setter section to keep this post within the 30 000 char limit

you need to update the variable not just calculate the addition or subtraction and ignore the result

10805778
subtraction	addition
you probably want to update the element after every addition subtraction

10805832
width	height
you could make a start position x and y like 0 0 and keep adding the width to x and or height to y and use them on the next retangle to be drawn instead of fixing the start position that will make them inside each other

10805832

nsurlconnection	nsoperation	nsurlconnection	nsoperationqueue
its most basic classes wrap nsurlconnection in a nsoperation thus something that can be added to an nsoperationqueue

i ve tried the obvious qgraphicsview qgraphicsscene approach but those classes start to slow down unacceptably at around 400 000 elements

10806008
portrait	landscape
it looks like it thinks the ipad is in portrait when the modal view is dismissed but the device is obviously in landscape

10806041
mouseover	mouseout
if you desire html markup for the tip you will need to add an event to the mouseover event of the marker which displays the tooltip in an element and the adds an event on mouseout to remove the tip element

10806059
range	max
the basic idea is that cell b3 is maximized by changing max 8 cells in range e10 l19 to one

10806079
subtract	add
i could always just add or subtract 7 or 8 as needed

10806098
mouse	keyboard
this allows you to cause an event to be triggered every few milliseconds that you can handle with your typical event handling mechanism just like you handle mouse move keyboard draw etc

10806189
punctuation	words
in practice it would need to know the diffrence in and and ignore words like the and punctuation along with small typo s

uiview	calayer
there is no uiview s drawrect no calayer s display drawincontext or calayer s delegate s drawlayerincontext

10806329
uiview	calayer
this question aims to understand how our graphics programming actually get rendered in modern graphics cards since for example if we need to understand uiview and how calayer works or even use calayer s bitmap directly we do need to understand the graphics architecture.

10806336
inherited	properties
it inherited the parent car class and provides additional properties and methods

10806336
serializable	deserialization
this is so that the serializable deserialization knows how to handle the different car types

10806336
serializable	deserialization
also notice the static save and load methods that handle the serializable deserialization

10806388
calloc	malloc
the malloc and calloc functions return a pointer to the allocated

10806393
padding	overlapping
i thought a way to get around this might be to make the text boxes large and overlapping and then set the padding top left based on expressions to the positions that user has selected

10806416
versioning	upgrade
i ve also read that bb os v5 does not support google maps as well as the newer versioning of the os hence the upgrade blackberry bold test device

submit	submission
if you are submission with the target parameters shown you need to have an action method dosearch in controller searchcontroller otherwise you need to submit to the index action method in home controller by changing the form target parameters as

10806515
folder	directory
the directory path is not the problem because it opens a pdfviewer that i put in the same folder

10806519
ready	each
to overcome this you must adapt to the amd pattern which pulls in requirements - and runs once theyre ready each required module that is

10806524
freemarker	velocity
you probably be using some templating framework of some kind jstl velocity freemarker whatever that knows how to html-escape data and avoid things like double-quotes etc

10806560
children	parent
if it is the root s child then it is a zig otherwise either ii or iii depending on if the parent of current node and current node are both left or right children

10806581

you can specify a height width of the column row or leave that part out and they will default to being uniform

10806600
post	put
ahh the verb put is to be used with http not post and -x flag was missing after coincidental x placeholder

10806600
required	placeholder
this -x is required after the placeholder apitoken x

10806615
ant	maven
per the documentation this parameter specifies whether a failure in the ant build leads to a failure of the maven build

10806615
ant	maven
if this value is true the maven build will proceed even if the ant build fails

10806615
ant	maven
if it is false then the maven build fails if the ant build fails.

10806615
ant	maven
i would think that the default value of true would cause the maven build to fail if the ant build failed but that isn t what the docs appear to be saying

10806658
hide	show
jquery has built in hide and show

10806694
gridview	sqldatasource
i mean if i dragged and dropped a gridview and an sqldatasource and then i set up those controls in page designer in visual studio is it possible at some time later to retrieve the data retrieved by the sqldatasource and then store the data in a datatable

10806700
for-loop	loops
it then loops through those tags with a for-loop and for every tag it makes a new img element using createelement gives it a src attribute using the constructimageurl function and appends it to the popup page

10806724
activiti	alfresco
more recently the activiti workflow engine is the default in alfresco though jbpm is still available

10806724
bpmn	jbpm
the exception is simple workflows which don t use bpmn or jbpm and are simple one-step accept reject decisions that can be created by end users

10806731
width	height
right now i am implementing wpf application with fixed width and height

10806775
erlang	lisp
it s useless in python because it s not a language that performs such optimisation but if you translate this code into erlang or lisp you will get it for free

10806821
boost	stl
i usually mix in atl stl and boost classes with mfc they all work together as a happy family

10806831
post	get
i m trying to get a list of all post re-shared by my friends

10806875

if i post to this url or get 123456 i get normal json responses as in it actually executes my service

10806884
google-chrome	firefox
it works perfectly fine with firefox and google-chrome

10806892
super	self
only the designated initializer calls super all others call self

10806892
super	self
notice that it calls self not super

10806892
super	implements
one initializer should be deemed your designated initializer and only this method should implements super init where init is the designated initializer of the super class which may not be init

10806895
getter	setter
the java beans specification looks for default setter methods with a void return type but it allows customization of the getter and setter methods through a java.beans.propertydescriptor

10806895
getter	setter
the simplest way to use it has been to specify the names of the getter and setter

10806895
getter	setter
another way to specify the getter and setter methods in the propertydescriptor for a custom beaninfo is to use the actual method objects

10806895
getter	setter
this code is invoked by the propertydescriptor constructor in the first example that takes the accessor method names above because initially there is no method saved in the softreference s holding the actual getter and setter

10806895
getter	setter
in the second example the read method and write method are stored in softreference objects in the propertydescriptor by the constructor and at first these will contain references to the readmethod and writemethod getter and setter method s given to the constructor

10806908
mousemove	mouseleave
im trying to unbind and bind the mousemove it unbinds when mouse is over the link but does not bind back when the mouseleave the link

10806940

the only thing that sticks out is the get post but that hasn t been a problem before for svc s that i have made

10806944
hide	show
uitextview in a uitableviewcell smooth auto-resize show and hide keyboard on ipad but works on iphone

10806960
portrait	landscape
in portrait it is ok but in landscape the font size is too big

10806961
post	get
my guess is that you want other parameters in place as well which you can then use a form to send data via post or get to populate your page using those parameters

10806961
post	get
as mentioned the slug argument is not intended to populate queries and you should also be naming your get and post keys as well as option and meta keys something unique to your code so the likelihood of any naming conflicts is minimal

10806973
freemarker	velocity
4 template engines like velocity or freemarker - moves design out of java requires a lot of map operations it would be quite good but the velocity syntax and loop if abilities aren t as readable as for example those from smarty

10806991
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i tried using the event s which property equals 1 in google-chrome when left mouse button is held but seems to always equal 1 in safari and firefox even when the mouse button isn t being held

10806999
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
it could be a dropdownlistfor with autopostback true the same with asp.net checkbox and so on

10807030
google-chrome	firefox
i tried the code on firefox ie 9.0 google-chrome 18

10807050
outputstream	inputstream
how much data is available is determined by the client - the data that it writes to the socket s outputstream on its side appears as such on the inputstream of socket of the server side

10807082
stdout	stderr
i ve made slight modifications to the application to capture stdout and stderr to a log file

10807089
children	parent
this will find the parent of the span all it s siblings and any s that are children of those siblings and add .current to them

10807104
post	get
on the server-side you would get a post with the name value that you could then evaluate

10807163
starttls	smtps
smtps - error auth not accepted from server 530 must issue a starttls command first

10807167
jlist	jtable
use jtable with reduced funcionality you can use jlist too

10807192
wav	riff
if you are having to roll your own wav riff writer remember java s data types are big-endian so any multi-byte primitives you write to your file must be written in reverse byte order to match riff s little-endianess

10807194
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
if you want to send strings over a socket then an objectinputstream or objectoutputstream isn t the right stream implementation

10807194
bufferedreader	printwriter
consider using a printwriter to write strings to your stream and a bufferedreader for reading

10807260
accessor	properties
more specifically see section 7.1 accessor methods and 8.3 design patterns for simple properties

10807273
portrait	landscape
essentially it uses media queries to determine the width of the device and then using css displays either the portrait or landscape div

10807273
portrait	landscape
the portrait and landscape divs both house iframes which contain the ads for their respective orientation

10807310
ubuntu	linux
the one problem i m struggling with is that vsprintf seems to be behaving differently on os x versus linux i ve tested with ubuntu 10.10 and 12.04

10807318
width	height
give it a fixed width height and wrap the scrollable content in your included file in a div that can be scrolled

10807347
post	get
check if it s post request or get request

10807347
post	get
and there are lot s of ifs because this action should handle different contexts get xhr post post

10807350
jboss	glassfish
so far only the glassfish server plugin and the jboss tools plugin comes with facelets tooling

10807350
jboss	glassfish
based on your previous question you re using tomcat so jboss tools should do and it is actually more feature rich than the glassfish server plugin

10807355
children	parent
and it can return a list of the direct children to the parent

10807364
ant	maven
i want detail information regarding building an android project using ant maven

10807365
equals	gethashcode
what you should be doing short answer you need gethashcode and equals on modeldata instead of pagedmodel since you are using pagedmodel as the collection and modeldata as the elements

10807365
ienumerable	iequatable	equals	gethashcode
instead of overriding equals object on pagedmodel you need to implement iequatable t on modeldata where t is the type parameter to the ienumerable as well as override gethashcode

10807365
ienumerable	iequalitycomparer	union	distinct
these two methods are what all ienumerable methods in .net use to determine equality for operations such as union distinct etc when using the default equality comparer you don t specify your own iequalitycomparer

10807365
equals	gethashcode
to function correctly gethashcode needs to return the same results for all objects that return true for equals t

10807365
equals	gethashcode
the reverse is not necessarily true - gethashcode can return collisions for objects that are not equals

10807387
children	parent
adding that in a parent element makes adding it in the children elements unecessary

10807398
centos	linux
i have no idea whether this matters or not like for the driver for mongodb i am using wamp server currently on a windows 7 x64 and later i plan to move it under my centos 6.2 webserver so please also consider these also might have dependencies on linux

10807427
profiling	instrumentation
i would definitely recommend using instrumentation to profiling what message is taking the most time so you can really break it down

10807427
profiling	instrumentation
i have no idea if they would be faster or not but i really wouldn t know how to speed up what you have very easily unless you had the instrumentation profiling break down

10807451
mef	prism
i am evaluating the code named prism 4 mef application it is a .net 4.0 application and has a reference to microsoft.windows.shell namespace which is available if you install microsoft ribbon for wpf control

10807507
jobs	cron
read about cron jobs

10807543
cvs	rcs
given just a file you can use the rlog command part of rcs not part of cvs to get a log that will show all the commit messages

10807543
cvs	rcs
shameless self-promotion my own get-versions tool lets you grab multiple versions of a file in a single command it currently works with rcs cvs and git

10807585
int	chars
bufferedwriter.write int writes the chars value of the int not the int value

10807592
int	chars
what is confusing you is that while the method signature indicates it s writing an int it s actually expecting that int to represent an encoded chars

10807592
int	chars
the chars to be written is contained in the 16 low-order bits of the given int value

10807596
children	parent
stackpanel as the parent panel for expanders here is out of the question because it can t give all remaining space to its children

10807607
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
it seems to work for most browsers that i tested so far ie8 firefox 12 google-chrome 19 opera 11 safari 5

10807609
google-chrome	safari
in safari and google-chrome the change of css don t get applied until the javascript code is completed and thus user don t see the loading image when the search is being performed

10807612
google-chrome	firefox
the load event does not correctly bubble up the parent document and the event.target isn t set by firefox ie9 or google-chrome which is required to do event delegation

10807683
udp	tcp
the difference from tcp is that each read on udp socket de-queues exactly one datagram so this is a bit easier

10807692
children	parent
i am surprised by this i would like my parent class to have a method which has access to a private attribute its children are guaranteed to have

10807703
gridview	rowdatabound
as far as i can gather what egoldin is doing is filling the gridview then using the rowdatabound event he she is then taking this data returned and converting it to a table which can be used at a later stage

10807719
fast-forward	merge
in case of a fast-forward merge the history is not modified at all only the master branch points at a different commit

10807730
superclass	subclassing
the idea behind the double-underscore name mangling is to avoid conflicts with subclassing superclass - it s not meant to be used for private variables

10807796
accessor	properties
the framework also requires all persisted fields and properties to also have public get and set accessor and uses them when creating and initializing a new object instance

10807862
screens	tablet
really the only thing i did different is account for the stageorientation.unknown and prevent whatever that would do set the width to 1024 for the ipad screens might be different for other tablet devices in the main mxml file and removed the stopimmediatepropagation

10807878

10812392
inherited	properties
so as a new test inherited that properties evaluates to true

10812392
inherited	properties
you will need to distinguish between the prototype properties of a function object and the prototype object from which an object inherited - often referenced as the internal properties

inherited	properties
therefore it inherited from the function.prototype object - where the constructor properties says that all functions are constructed by the function constructor

10812392
inherited	properties
so the famous prototype chain is not about the constructor and or prototype properties but about the prototype object from which that object inherited from

10812993

x86	64bit	math.h	sqrt
i create an application to compute the primes numbers in 64bit range so when i tried to compute the square root of 64bit number using sqrt function from math.h i found the answer is not accurate for example when the input is 0ull the answer should be 0u but the one i get is 0x100000000 which is not right so i decided to create my own version using assembly x86 language to see if this is a bug here is my function

also i m repeating the same width and height percentage values in the resize options because otherwise no resizing occurs

10822824

the width is shrinking correctly but the height is staying the same creating a squeeze

10823383
postgresql	mysql
and it will work however i m afraid that you ll need to install postgresql locally note - i checked the trick with mysql - have no local postgresql so in that case maybe it ll be just easier and better to develop application in the very similar environment as target one which is generally always the best option

10823483
daemons	launchd
some of those solutions involved trying to launchd the ios simulator s security services daemons for example

10823489
regression	least-squares
the most obvious solution would be to use least-squares orthogonal distance regression but this is difficult as you will need to generate footpoint parameters onto the bezier curve for each point you wish to fit

10823490
folder	directory
to make it relative tot he project directory i copied the android.jar to a libs folder in the project right clicked and added to build path

10823643
tcplistener	tcpclient
my first approach was to make it with tcpclient and tcplistener but i m a bit confused doing this with many clients

slideup	slidedown
you could make it look good by calling jquery s slideup and or slidedown methods or another animation method and relying on callbacks to order the animations

10823766

10823797
maven	cargo
i m using maven 2 w cargo to deploy to different remote tomcats depending on the maven profile used

we are using the ftdi vinculum ii vnc2 for the usb host controller and my boss would like a solution where the customer can plug in any or most bluetooth usb dongles into the usb port on our instrument and then be able to connect our instrument via bluetooth to an android phone

10823972
rfcomm	l2cap
i ve found out the usb dongle only implements the controller stack hcl sco lmp and hci and that the host my custom firmware in this case must provide the implementation of the host stack or the parts of it that we need in any case hci l2cap rfcomm at least

10823972
bluetooth	usb
either that or another solution that i am not aware of that would allow our customers to plug any usb bluetooth dongle into our instrument and be able to connect to their android phone without us having to implement the bluetooth host stack on our end.

10823998

10824132
folder	directory
try it make a folder called bob then in the same directory make a symlink called bob and point it somewhere it will probably put the symlink bob inside the directory bob.

10824161
filtering	grouping
i actually realized that in order to resolve this issue is to create a filtering to the table not just the row and make sure that the totals row is included in the table but not in a grouping

10824192
int	chars
edit i wasn t aware that assigning an int to a string was in fact legal as an int can be converted to a chars which can be assigned to a string although a string can t be initialized to a chars

10824240
width	height
in cases like this a common work around was instead of setting the offending metric ie width height to a percent layout we would typically bind it to it s immediate parent or something similar

10824311
dictionary	map
whenever you want to map one value to another you probably want a dictionary

10824336
plot	errorbar
the best i can do when plotting a single test point 1.0 3.0 0.25 0.5 0.25 0.5 is to get a plot of the test point with disembodied errorbar floating in nearby space

10824347
int	chars
so it looks like converting to int makes the storage slightly less efficient and all of my gains come form reducing the number of chars stored in each row

10824352
post	get
there appears to be an issue with where some methods called within the above extension live see the comments of the original blog post but it should get you most of the way there

10824356
postgresql	mysql
it is protocol-independent and can be used to stress http webdav soap postgresql mysql ldap jabber xmpp servers

10824415

10824540
checkboxpreference	multiselectlistpreference	int	boolean
i don t such a preference exist since every descendant of preference is mapped onto a boolean checkboxpreference a string edittextpreference or a string array multiselectlistpreference there are no preferences mapped onto int but maybe some of you can give me an hint or at least tell me if there are better solutions than the one i ve proposed above

10824824

10824832
gcov	lcov
i m also using gcov to check test coverage tests written with google test framework additionally i use the eclipse gcov integration plugin or the lcov tool to generate easy to inspect views of the test coverage results

10824837
int	double
the problem is that 1 and 12 are int of type int not double

10824856
unsigned	short
in line with steve s opinion that this is a bug line 757 informs renderscript to treat the index data as short unsigned 16bit but it sends it a 32 bit signed value which will be accepted due to the lack of a check and treated unsigned and then only the lower 16 bits used hence why we get something drawn when below this threshold and triangles connecting back to the first indices when we go over

10824868
folder	directory
as a last resort you could open up index.php and remove the code redirecting you the downloader folder but at this point you might be better off re-installing magento remove everything in the directory and follow the install steps again since something probably went wrong

10824872
hide	show
i ve figured out how to hide and show different content basically by setting display none

maven	pom.xml	aether	pom.xml

10824983
for-loop	loops
i m thinking something simple like another for-loop to read the number of copies and make it loops that many times if the user wants 3 copies loops will read this and loops 2 times through the print loops

is this the only way or is there a way to get it to post in a nice friendly array

10827186
pull	push
trusted users clone pull push the trusted repo

10827186
pull	push

10827323
super	extends
the other idea i had was to use the module + extends + super decorator from this post

10827336
qfile	qtextstream
since qtextstream is buffered the pos function may have to seek the device to reconstruct a valid device position. there is a chance that if you use qfile and textstream in conjunction the text stream s internal position will be out of sync with the file s position that way this seek function used inernally by pos function may go terribly wrong

10827339
accessor	properties
this code is automatically translated by the compiler to code similar to the one you posted with this code is easier to declare properties and they are ideal if you don t want to implement custom logic inside the set or get methods you can even use a different accessor for the set method making the properties immutable

10827349

after a bit more research i found that g++ is basically gcc with a few default flags and a slightly different interpretation mechanism for file extensions there may be other differences i ve glanced over

10827353
g++	gcc
i d like to know exactly which flags can be passed to gcc to amount to the equivalent g++ call

10827353
g++	gcc
the way the tool chain is set up makes it sort of difficult to simply replace the gcc calls with g++

10827354

10831018
put	get
if you where to use the auth dialog in a lightbox as an iframe or similar there would be no way for me as the user to see if the data it put into the login form which would get displayed if i m not logged in to facebook at that moment is actually sent to facebook or if you had just set up your own form that ll send the data to your server because you are trying to phish for my facebook login data â

10832606
hide	show
jquery will only call the callback function newcallback in your code if the show hide is animated

10832606
hide	show
if no parameters are passed to .show hide or if speed is undefined then jquery will show hide the element s directly and the callback function will not be executed

10832606
hide	show
jquery calls .show hide internally as part of .fadeto and recursively when doing an animated show hide so your custom events will be triggered when you may not be expecting them to

10832606

10832745
width	height
i then wish to size the sub-components of this control defined in the xaml to fill either the height width or both

10832745

10837981
post	get
upon selecting the back button i can see that the browser is attempting to perform the original request the post not the redirected request the get

10837981

how do i get it to display the title of the post proper

10838046

convert int - double carefully

10838509
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
the left and right side columns should be filling up the remainder of the width of the screen however in firefox and opera the columns have no width but in ie google-chrome and safari they fill up the remainder

10838509
google-chrome	safari
in playing with it if i remove the width parameters on the two middle cells it will line up correctly but this causes text alignment issues in google-chrome ie and safari

10838570
inherited	properties
no you ll need to modify the .designer file or inherited from it and change the behavior of that properties but i guess the auto-generated properties won t be virtual so you ll need to edit it anyway

10838586
google-chrome	firefox
the styles apply in both firefox and google-chrome but not in ie

10838599
opera	firefox
for some reason a couple of the pages do not align correctly in firefox and opera

they are spaces delimiter instead of comma delimiter

10838707
super	self
it looks like you already may have fixed the original error which was caused by super .__init__ x y as the error message indicates although your fix was slightly incorrect instead of super point self from the circle class you should use super circle self

if we don t salt the password you could have duplicate password hash

10839039
put	get
everything is good and dandy i have different views and they talk to the controller when they need to put changes into the model or get called upon when changes are reflected int he model

10839070
width	height
i added the control and setup the width height inserted my app id and ad unit id and published it to my phone

10839073
post	get
it took me awhile to figure out how to get the software setup and implement the above cross browser for example android below 4.0 doesn t support svg so i had to rely on .png sprites still and i wrote a javascript file that allowed for resizable sprites - similar to the stretchy sprites post - that s another advantage of icon fonts if you can get away with single color icons

10839141
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
first step open up the console in google-chrome safari or firebug firefox

10839157
implements	extends
implements is used for interfaces and extends is used to extends a class

10839157
implements	extends
and when you need to choose between implements an interface or extends a class for a particular scenario go for implements an interface

10839157
implements	extends
because a class can implements multiple interfaces but extends only one class

10839170
salt	md5	hash	salt	hash	md5
a salt adds an extra layer of security - the md5 hash can no longer be looked up in a reverse md5 database

10839170
hash	salt
so on your server hash your password with the salt before you input it to your database

10839178
implements	extends
you can only extends one class in your child class but you can implements as many interfaces as you would like

10839199
qunit	sinon
our testing stack looks like js code qunit sinon

10839220
folder	directory
so i exited eclipse created a new libs folder in the workbench package directory

10839240
svg	vml
it seems like i shouldn t have to change the doctype for different browsers and the reputation graph on stack exchange s user page appears to work the same way vml for ie8 and below svg for everyone else html5 doctype .

10839241
width	height
i don t know exactly how do you want the buttons to be placed on the screen but normally you would find out the width and height of the screen and work the real dimension from that

10839245
int	boolean
you don t need to concatenate string values nor do you need to convert the question number to a string - writeln has the magical ability to accept any number of variables and print them according to their default format strings int reals and boolean

10839257
int	chars
you re reading a chars from the stream and trying to print it as an int

10839264
hash	md5
for example the md5 hash of password123 is 482c811da5d5b4bc6d497ffa98491e38

10839278
mp3	wav
but this seems not to be because i am able to play all other formats including aiif mp3 wav .

10839297
post	get
i have just added a rest api to my existing spring + blazeds + hibernate server and everything appears to work when data is retrieved and serialised as json but when i try and post data to be de-serialised into a pojo i get the an exception

10839299
implements	extends
as mentioned by lots of people you extends a class and you can only extends from one and you implements an interface -- but your class can implements as many interfaces as you like

10839299
super	implements
ie these keywords and the rules governing their use delineate the possibilities for multiple-inheritance in java you can only have one super class but you can implements multiple interfaces

10839310
ubuntu	linux
i m on ubuntu linux if that matters

10839370
qobject	qmetaobject
not much is done there the slot is called by either directly calling qobject qt_static_metacall obtained at the time the connection was established or qobject qt_metacall if the qmetaobject connect was used to setup the connection

10839389
post	put	post	get	put	get
so what you could do with this project is specify table database names and the paths for get post put delete and what kinds of data you d want to put in and it would give you the actual url and any authentication stuff

10839408
internationalization	translation
i m using django internationalization tools to translation some strings from my application

10839410
spaces	delimiter
jquery binding can take multiple events just spaces delimiter

10839436
inherited	properties
an abstract class with properties can be used to represent a base class in inherited

10839462
implements	extends
of course your classes must extends happyanimal it won t work if they extends animal and implements happy directly

10839523
width	height
snap to grid will only work for your purpose in certain situations like when the connected objects are of equal height width or when the line is connected to the snapped edge

10839575
width	height
i want to have a div that is 100 width and height but with left and right margins i also want top and bottom margins but one thing at a time

10839575
margin	height	width	height	width	margin
i have been able to achieve a div that is 100 in width and height with a top and left margin but the bottom and right margins are not recognized

10839584
awt	swing
my swing awt j2d may be a bit fuzzy but the idea is that since your imagepanel is an imageobserver it can be notified asynchronously about image information

10839607
ant	maven
this may be using the google plugin for eclipse maven ant or whatever build system you use

10839611
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i guess firefox unlike google-chrome and safari isn t too picky about syntax

10839614
many-to-one	one-to-many
actually i have a project entity with a one-to-many relation on projectsworkgroups entity which have a many-to-one relation on workgroup entity

10839659
hide	show
you should either hide the partial block and load it after the user makes a selection or load for all values and use tabs or similar mechanism to hide show

10839694
maven-antrun-plugin	maven-wagon-plugin
instead of maven-antrun-plugin it is better to use upload goal of maven-wagon-plugin

10839699
hash	salt
the encryption key ends up being a sha1 hash of the salt

10839699
hash	salt
it should be a sha1 hash of the passphrase and salt

10839709
move	drag
here is a jsfiddle with a shape that should be move on mouse drag events

10839715
width	height
note however that domcontentloaded may fire before images and css sheets are done loading resulting in in-accurate height and width measurements

10839722
post	get
the back button re-executes the request before post accountdetails.xhtml which is not listed in your 1st screenshot but is according the 2nd screenshot apparently and logically a get accountdetails.xhtml

10839789
qthread	qobject
well a qthread is a qobject but you really should not derive from a qthread

10839789
qevent	qobject
posting qevents to qobject is faster than using signal-slot invocations because there are no copy constructors called and there s no marshalling done except directly by you upon construction of a qevent

10839789
profiling	benchmarking
only if profiling benchmarking shows that event posting is too slow you d want to look at using qsharedmemory

10839805
put	get
then you can get the data out of your bytearrayoutputstream and put it into the bytearrayinputstream as before

10839835
jar	war
all the above modules either generate jar or war files in the target directory of each module

10839835
jar	war
i need to copy all the generated jar or war files to a any directory ex base.dir

10839846
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
it renders fine in firefox google-chrome opera and ie9 and badly in safari on win7 the text has various artefacts and generally looks like it s shadowed

10839933
min	max
the parameters min max are easily stored as fields

10839933
int	chars
more important if you re going to pass instances of this classes over the network or attempt marshaling them to lua python .net whatever you ll consider changing std string by chars type fixed_size or even to the int type with some enumeration

10839940
width	height
i have a jpanel which for example is 500 width and 100 height

10839989
google-chrome	safari
i would love some insight into the error i am seeing in safari and google-chrome with the following line of code

10839989
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and safari have no issues with this code

10839993
hide	show
i m using jquery fancybox to show and hide loading animation on ajax requests

10839994
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome does indeed seem to handle value.tolocalestring in a different way from firefox however i believe this should be considered as a globalize bug

10840032
put	get
if you only have 2 action methods for your controller say 1 for get and 1 for put then you can just name both of your actions index either like i did above or like this

10840032
post	put
these new 4 routes all have the same url pattern with the exception of the post since you should post to the collection yet put to the specific id

10840042
box-sizing	border-box
as you can see the first three boxes render with content-box box-sizing the w3c standard and the fourth renders with border-box because it was explicitly set using css

10840045
required	placeholder
using jquery you will be able to easily hide remove the current label and use its content to fill the placeholder attribute that will then be used by the plugin if required

10840053
ant	maven
though it uses maven as an example it can be easily adopted to ant as it just runs a class with a main method

10840090
vim	emacs
emacs and vim seem to support llvm syntax highlighting

10840099
fadein	fadeout
alas since i also needed to supply a javascript fallback for older browsers i had to set the container height for these browsers anyway because of jquerys fadein fadeout actually setting display none

10840109
ciimage	uiimage
assigning the output ciimage to a uiimage does not cause the image to be processed and output rendered

10840161
int	chars
next the result of chr - 0 is an int which you then silently downcast to an unsigned chars

10840162
put	get
i m attempting to write a rewriterule to send all requests to my server to index.php and then put the request into a get parameter

10840175
hide	show
you can hide show each sub-report as desired

10840187
for-loop	loops
the above is in a for-loop that loops over a long string line by line

10840197
serializable	deserialization
when category is present in the corresponding xml file serializable deserialization works as expected

10840240
post	get
you can use this post to get you started

10840245
int	chars
another option this one is my personal favorite is the same thing that getc does return an int that either contains a chars value or is -1 to signal an error

10840245
int	chars
in the case of no error the int can safely be typecast and or stored to a chars

10840307
listview	gridview
i bind the channels to a gridview and inside my gridview i bind a listview for the programs in the tv channel

10840307
listview	gridview
the challenge appears when i want to get a reference for the first or second third etc program item in the listview which is really a gridview item

10840347
google-chrome	firefox
it works in firefox but unfortunately still is a bit jumpy not pixel perfect in google-chrome

10840349
jquery	simplemodal
jquery simplemodal two different modal contents in the same page

10840352
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
the text-indent works as expected or at least the way i expect it to in google-chrome firefox and opera - it indents the first line of the text and then performs the wrapping again to keep the padding correct

10840387
ready	each
.. ajax is used to load the contents of each page into the dom as you navigate and the dom ready handler only executes for the first page

10840406
spock	easyb
fantasy preferences using git testing done with spock or easyb or cucumber has some interesting hard-to-test plugins like the mail plugin or rabbitmq

10840410
put	get
now if you type help foo from the interpreter you ll get to see the string that i put in the function

10840464
bitblt	gdi
i recall reading an article a few years back saying that windows 7 added hardware acceleration to some gdi functions including bitblt function

10840467
put	get
be kind i am aware there is probably some goofy things in the code that i put in there trying to get around this problem

10840473
free	malloc
in my cocoa project i had a bunch of places where i used malloc free

10840569
put	get
if you are getting a 404 that results in a get request instead of a put request it s because the option relied on javascript

10840574
hide	show
the plugin uses visibility hidden visible to show and hide a modal extensively throughout its code

10840664
min	max
so you could use a size fixed graphical control e.g a label and from min to max add some content in it

10840676
keydown	keyup
i saw on forums that keyup or keydown don t make any difference

10840684
rss	feed
the error is in the rss feed of the article

10840705
selecteditem	selectedindex
use the selectedindex proprty to check if anything is selected and the selecteditem property to get the selected item s text

10840729
width	height
you ll also probably want to adjust the width and height of the bitmapdata as well

10840737
.htaccess	httpd.conf
enable mod_rewrite and .htaccess through httpd.conf and then put this code in your .htaccess under document_root directory

10840749
folder	directory
if you want all folder and files in specific directory to be writable too you have to run this command chmod 777 -r dirname

10840769
clang	llvm
i am using the latest clang from the llvm git repository.

10840772
public	protected
to get access to this protected method an attacker could create a new application references to assembly a assembly c and could make an own implementation of the public icustomprincipial interface of assembly a - haspermission returning true all the time

10840803
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
it s also very slightly faster because the for-loop caches the length of the arrays instead of looking it up each time and because it only looks up the value in the arrays once each loops not three times

10840904
getter	setter
these versions are not compatible on generated code for boolean getter and setter

10840909
button	checkbox
onfocusout validate elements except checkbox radio button on blur

10840977
spock	grails
i am writing tests using grails 2.0.4 spock build-test-data plugin for my services that work with a domain object that has a sequence in it

10840992
postgresql	mysql
at least mysql db2 sql server and postgresql don t support queries where different where clauses apply to different set clauses

10840992
prepare	execute
what you usually can do is use a prepare statement with placeholders for the variables that you execute with a list of tuples of parameters

10841063
free	malloc
personally i d continue to use malloc free explicitly instead of trying to contort my code in such a way that arc kind of sort of manages malloced memory

10841063
free	malloc
either that or i d write my code such that it doesn t have to use malloc free in the first place

10841074
post	get
a cookie that is set in response will only be available for the next htpp request a next get or post action from the browser

10841105
hide	show
i have a menu and i am trying to show and hide the submenu of each option

10841192
fgets	strtol
instead of reading choice as an integer using scanf read it as text using fgets and convert it to an integer using strtol

10841215
associativity	operator-precedence
operator have the same operator-precedence but since they are left associativity they get evaluated like the following

10841246
button	checkbox
select tag checkbox or radio button

10841267
button	checkbox
the solution will probably need to allow for the fact that each validation error could have more than one label and input that are all within the same div.control-group eg radio button checkbox 2 text fields side by side

10841273
for-loop	loops
in c# you also don t test whether for-loop or while loops inside your method works correctly

10841305
post	get
i get the following error when i attempt to make a json post request

10841433

uiview	calayer
the part that mentioned how to get a view graphics context is actually the same context obtained in calayer calayer began the display and drawincontext by using a bitmap graphics context it seems and finally calls drawrect in uiview using this bitmap context and i am not sure whether the idea that calayer is cached on the gpu actually meant this bitmap graphics context or does it mean layer.contents which is a cgimage so the caching is actually on this image not the graphics context

width	height
i think the problem here is similar to the well-known behavior where position absolute fixed div s that don t have a defined height width can often disappear

10842758
width	height
in any case you can see that defining height and width on the element with preserve-3d fixes the issue in the js fiddle

10842824
concave	convex
it s actually a lot easier to clip a convex polygon than a concave one so if your polygons are of a fixed shape then you might consider using a triangulation algorithm such as ear clipping or decomposition to monotone edges and then performing the clipping and area calculation on those rather than the original

freetype	libpng
the root of the problem is that freetype and libpng are installed in non-canonical locations by xcode in usr x11 instead of usr or usr local

10843478
freetype	libpng
all of the answers already given address the problem by re-building freetype and libpng either manually or using a package manager like homebrew

10843478
freetype	libpng
you can however get matplotlib to compile by simply symlinking the existing freetype libpng headers and libraries into the usr local tree with

but i don t think it s a bug because it renders the same way in google-chrome firefox and i think even in internet explorer

10843583
post	get
well the server told us that it s possible to get and post a new question

10843631
width	height
i have a dynamically created 2d array content which has height of _h and width of _w in my implementation row is a first parameter and column is second makes sense in context

10843631
width	height
i wrap this int value by height or width with and obviously the remainder is always 0 r max

10843631
put	get
when i look at values of v and u they re something like -7753978124 - actually having a negative number in my context isn t supposed to happen so i have yet to look for what s causing it but anyway .iget should turn it into a normal integer and _h or _w should put it into the bounds but instead i get access violation

10843639
post	put
you can put the following in your post model

10843642
portrait	landscape
it turns out that it s not the split view controller per se or the tab bar controller for that matter that s causing the portrait landscape mixup

10843642
portrait	landscape
basically if a uiwebview is taller than it is wide the os considers it in portrait mode and if it s wider than it is tall the os considers it in landscape mode

10843642
width	height
the presence of a tab bar controller was enough to make the height 768 - 20 - 49 699 just smaller than the width 1024 - 320 - 1 gutter 703

10843644
width	height
make the span an inline-block element and then set its width and height to that of the sprite

10843651
getter	setter
with its getter and setter

10843651
post	get
and when you post the form with multiple files in your controller you can have the same modelattribute field to get the list filled with multiple files

10843657
google-chrome	firefox
but i don t think it s a bug because it renders the same way in google-chrome firefox and i think even in internet explorer

10843658
portrait	landscape
basically if it s wider than it is tall it s considered landscape and if it s taller than it is wide it s considered portrait

10843672

10843744
superclass	subclassing
access a member of the superclass that has been hidden by a member of a subclassing

10843744
superclass	subclassing
when a subclassing calls super it is calling the constructor of its immediate superclass

10843744
superclass	subclassing
the second form of super is most applicable to situations in which member names of a subclassing hide members by the same name in the superclass

10843746
pop-up	dialog
your question is not very clear but my assumption is that you are getting the toolbar search functionality instead a pop-up search dialog single or advanced search

10843746
pop-up	dialog
if yes one breaking change i noticed in recent versions of jqgrid is that you must now return true from the event handler if you want the search dialog to pop-up

10843779
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i m guessing that you got that source from the elements aka dom browser in your google-chrome or safari or firefox firebug developer tools

10843842
getter	setter
sencha touch 2 does not automatically generate getter and setter for your config

10843842
getter	setter
manually create getter setter for your custom config for example you have to define something like this as a config of your view component

10843849
daemons	systemd
i would look into writing a userland daemons that runs in the systemd tray listening for http or https requests and opens the appropriate program instead

10843861
getter	setter
an interface icreaturereference would define getter and setter for all those properties

10843861

10843882
versioning	upgrade
if so then your solution is to be sure to always increase your schema versioning number every time you change the schema and to use sqliteopenhelper.onupgrade or some other means to make sure your database is always upgrade when necessary

10843911
octal	decimal
is that of a decimal constant octal constant or hexadecimal

10843998
width	margin
since the element you re setting its width to be 100 specifically is already a block-level element it will automatically take up the full width of its container by itself but by setting its width to be 100 it will not take its margin padding border into account when doing this and thus having any of those properties set to be 1 the extra width will stick out from its parent

10844004
division	logarithm
since you want to do this efficiently and these are powers of 2 you can replace division by pagesize with right-shift by the base-2 logarithm of pagesize which is 22

10844039
hash	md5
and you can make it a string and hash md5 the result

10844046
uilabel	uitextview
you could do something complicated using sizewithfont constrainedtosize to figure out the size that the various text boxes need to be at the new width to fit the text you want to put in them but probably easier would be to eliminate the uilabel uitextview s and the uiimageview and just create a uiwebview that fills the whole view and use it s loadhtmlstring baseurl to supply a html string that includes your copy and a link to your image in your bundle

10844046
portrait	landscape
typically i ll see guys who defer this sort of frame adjustments to didrotatefrominterfaceorientation rather than willrotatetointerfaceorientation because a you have the coordinates of the new orientation and because navigation controllers are different heights in landscape v portrait this can be important though maybe not in your case

10844108
jboss	weblogic
i want to write monitoring and profiling tool for java application servers such as jboss weblogic etc

10844128
superclass	subclassing
i searched some similar questions and they showed yes a superclass type variable can refer to a subclassing object

if you re using google-chrome or firefox you should always check the console for errors before you ask a question

10844559
oncreate	onstart
however i can t find anything about whether onstart will be called immediately after oncreate returns without waiting for the child activity to return or whether all lifecycle events after oncreate are suspended until the child activity returns when startactivityforresult is called from within oncreate

10845997
pop-up	dialog
if the most recent pop-up is an active window which takes focus - as is the case with dialog but not usually the case with pop-under windows - you can use a href rel nofollow getguithreadinfo null ... a to determine the currently active hwnd which might be the one you are looking for returned in the guithreadinfo.hwndactive member of the struct you pass it

10846006
spaces	delimiter
you haven t said how you figure out where the string ends but i m assuming there is some delimiter or it s right-filled with spaces or something

however browsers will try their best to read non-valid urls by treating repeat hashes as though they are escaped as you can see by checking the value of window.location.hash in ie firefox and google-chrome for

10851140
superclass	subclassing
because all those subclassing will call the superclass they will end up calling the nslog of uiview

10851140
uicontrol	uibutton
for example you need uiview for uicontrol then uicontrol for uibutton and so on

10851202
post	get
for post we can have schemalocations configuration is there something similar for get

10851217
google-chrome	firefox
works fine in google-chrome and firefox

10851231
put	get
even without thoroughly analyzing every single instruction and its use i m pretty confident to say that there aren t any unneccessary loads or stores except the ones at the beginning ok i left them uninitialized which are neccessary anyway to get them from memory into computing registers and at the end which is neccessary as in the following expression v is gonna be put out

10851235
put	get
however if your objects can be recreated each time then you just need to put enough data in the form so that when it gets posted everything can be re-data-bound to get the same values in a new object

10851264
int	boolean
so - the issue is not calling the options themselves that seems to work fine it s altering the actual output a string boolean int etc based on the needed values of the js file because as of right now it s doing diddly squat because of it

10851273
rational-numbers	integer
strictly speaking there is no such thing as integer division division by definition is an operation which produces a rational-numbers integers are a very small subset of which.

10851335
pull	push

10851378
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
tested in google-chrome firefox opera ie9 and ie9 emulating ie7

10851378
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this had the proper effect in google-chrome and ie even ie7 but not in firefox or opera

10851378
width	height	opera	firefox
however even in firefox and opera the effect was better than if the width and height attributes were left out because the width attribute still had an effect even though the height attribute didn t

10851378
opera	firefox
opera and firefox show the alt text but otherwise have essentially the same behavior as they did before

10851378
width	height
the width and height attributes do not appear to be responsible for any of these alt text woes however except in ie8 to some extent

10851390
int	double
i feel like my this method for getting the users input storing it as an int double does not work well as it is too basic and does not work in all cases

in a mvc 3 page i want to find a place to preserve checkbox state with javascript when users press the browser s previous button

10851437

google-chrome	firefox
everything works just fine in google-chrome but in firefox once you mousedown for the second time on the image and start dragging the cursor it seems that the indicator the png image i mentioned earlier drags along and messes everything up

10851818
put	get
the logic would not be better put somewhere else and as i pointed out with string immutability it is a common paradigm to get new variations from existing ones

10851831
post	get
i ve read the post here which looks very similar but can t get it to translate to my purposes

10851874
ffmpeg	libavformat

10851899
hash	salt
as for encrypting the user s personal information just like a password we can use a custom salt + hashing algorithm that s quite simple but effective on our application to use the custom hash equivalent of the userid which is expected to be permanent static and persistent forever

10851909
udp	rtp
i need to stream rtp video the comes from udp network socket so i am thinking to use ffmpeg

10852020
nunit	mstest
i changed a test class to mstest rather than nunit but still got both the above problems when debugging with resharper

10852046

a fragment can add a listener or an observer to another object in oncreate and then remove it in ondestroy thus managing the updates itself

10852054

but it turned out to be pretty easy to handle with mouseenter and mouseleave events and by using a custom copy command

10852382
jobs	cron
you could run ps as a cron job and poll the system every x minutes but you would miss threads that were born and died between jobs

10852423
serializable	deserialization
take a look at the jackson wiki for modules a jackson module can be used to create custom serializable deserialization

10852445
put	get
host app may load any of this dll-s get controls from dll and put it on self form

10852509
getter	setter
however for the moment you can only change vizualisation properties see the setgetter and setsetter in every class but you cannot move an x.object since x.object._transform attribute is private and there is no getter setter for it yet

10852509
getter	setter
that s something interesting to deal with adding a pair of getter setter for x.object s transform would allow for example an user to put medical stuff modelized by a mesh or something else in the scene and place to mesure distances or see if it will fit for an operation or something like that

10852538
tinyint	boolean
some front ends with the use boolean option enabled will treat all tinyint 1 columns as boolean and vice versa

10852538
tinyint	boolean
boolean is just a synonym for tinyint 1 and true and false are synonyms for 1 and 0

10852549
width	height
that is it must have either a width a height or a position otherwise the gradient won t be visible

10852610
spaces	linefeed
so i d say run through all characters and remove all linefeed cr and rs instances or replace them by spaces whilst avoiding double spaces

width	height
replace the value of src with the page you want to load and adjust height and width to your needs

10852726
min	max
i need not only min max count etc as provided internally in fastreport but standard deviation as well

10852726
min	max
so far the nicest solution that i can come up with involves using a filter on the main table for passed so that the user can view passe failed or all and then to build a separate stats table with the same field name columns but with min max count mean stdev as individual records

10852728
x86	64bit
honestly i would recommend just targeting x86 and forgetting the 64bit version all together and letting your application run on wow64 unless your application has a compelling need to run as x64

10852728
x86	64bit
if the os is x64 deploy the 64bit version of the dll otherwise the x86 version

10852746

10852909
getter	setter
when we design a class in delphi typically we have private fields members private setter and getter methods and a public property

10852909
getter	setter
so the getter and setter methods encapsulate the instance member and the property encapsulates the getter and setter methods

10852909
getter	setter
the getter and setter are the internals of the concrete class and shoudn t be exposed

10853000
google-chrome	firefox
when working with extjs in ie you need to consider that the ie s json parser is a lot stricter than that of google-chrome or firefox

post	get
i am trying to figure out how to get the return value to post

10853243
getter	setter
however interfaces force the use of getter setter methods

10853243
getter	setter
besides that getter and setter methods are usually private

10853243
public	protected
it is up to the class that implement the interface to define which properties and methods are visible and for who they are protected or public or published

10853278
google-chrome	firefox
my memory usage shoots through the roof in firefox but barely peaks in google-chrome

10853288
post	get
i can t find anything on setting up the right kind of db state or get post request arguments

10853388
ends-with	substr
if you are sure that this substr is found at the end of the value you could use the ends-with selector

10853411
width	height
however if you notice that when my program starts up and i open the saved shapes for some odd reason the winform is keeping its design-time width and height to display the shapes that the shapes look chopped off even though winform has plenty of paint area to draw all the shapes completely

10853411
width	height
furthermore if i reload the winform it uses its current width and height to draw the shapes

10853411
width	height
so the winform will update to its current width and height during runtime all the time

10853433

10853614
int	chars
loading 0eh into ah sets up the int 10h function teletype output which will print the chars in al to the screen

your .repeat loop will then load each chars from text_string into al and call int 10h

10853619
subtraction	addition
there should be basically no overhead for std advance and std distance - any halfway competent c++ compiler will inline everything and they ll turn into pointer addition and subtraction

10854890
client-side	server-side
i m no django expert but generally when you find yourself using your server-side code to generate javascript code there s a better way -- either by making an ajax call to load the data you need or at least defining the data up at the top of your script then placing the client-side logic after

10855383
inherited	properties
it revolves around using dependencypropertyhelper.getvaluesource to determine if a properties value for an object is inherited or not

10855383
inherited	properties
local beats inherited inherited beats default etc. you re just comparing the values of two properties sources against each other at the same level

10855383
inherited	properties
of course if this properties is subject to animations and other such things then the logic becomes a little more complex but in our case it s either going to be set locally or inherited

10855388

then the particular 3rd party dependency can be selected by your build system for vs we use a inherited properties sheet with all the dependencies named as user macro s so can just have x_inc added to the include directories for a project and x_lib added to the libs - these macros then select the version and abi required for that particular project

10855566
put	get
since the introduction of per user site-packages it s best to put your user packages there you can get the folder name with site.user_site

tostring	string.format
in lua 5.1 string.format s val requires you to manually wrap val with tostring if val is anything other than a string or number

10857215
client-side	server-side
i m sure there are some standard ways to deal with that and as currently there s no interaction server-side - everything s client-side - my main concern is that such a user cannot hurt the experience of another user by sharing his bad version

superclass	subclassing
when you create a blank subclassing the extends superclass you are creating a new class that provides the same interface with the same implementation to the parent class

10857557
superclass	subclassing
once you have this relationship established you can decide whether calling dosomething on an instance of subclassing will behave differently than the default implementation defined in superclass

10857557
inherited	properties
static properties are not inherited

10857557
superclass	subclassing
however a subclassing instance can change the static value of the superclass

10857557
superclass	subclassing
in this way a subclassing has the potential although it is the same potential any code has with the right access privileges to change the properties of superclass

10857595

overriding doesn t change a methods of superclass but change them only in subclassing

10857850
public	protected
as you know your superclass can also have variables that also can be public protected private or internal

10857850
getter	setter
you cannot override them but you can do this with getter or setter however

10857850
public	protected
you can access variables that are created as public or protected by using a word super like this super.somevariable

10857850
superclass	subclassing
so everything is up to you if you want to create a different variables of the same name in superclass and subclassing just declare one as private in superclass

10857850
public	protected	superclass	subclassing
if you want to have one variable that superclass and subclassing both can access - just declare it as protected or public

innodb	myisam
the table type you use can be of importance certain types of queries seem to run faster on myisam as opposed to innodb

10858440
memcached	apc
the big caveat here is that apc generally has less memory available for storage though. default being 32mb memcached s big adavantage is that while still fast it s distributed so if you have multiple servers running they could share this data

now when i change self to super the code still executes the same way

10864704
super	self
self and super actually both point to the same object

10866676
range	infinity
i ve got a numeric application that does a lot of work with negative logs of probabilities which since probabilities range from zero to one take the values of positive doubles or negative infinity if the underlying probability was zero

10866685

google-chrome and ie9 exhibit the desired behavior when issuing a jquery.ajax request with ifmodified true and cache true while firefox 12 never revalidates which poses a serious problem

10866758

google-chrome	firefox
this is due to an incompatibility between the firefox implementation of indexeddb which supports the latest indedexdb protocol published december 2011 and the google-chrome implementation which supports the version previous to that

10866896
google-chrome	firefox
the breaking change is how databases are created where the older google-chrome implementation uses the setversion transaction whereas the newer version firefox uses an onupgradeneeded event and callback

10867026
width	height
and works very well..also this method sets the dgv client height and width programmatically

10867026
width	height
2- in checking the needs of scrollbar code part the numbers which added to width or height are depends to screen resolution..the numbers which i add is not the best but as much optimized for 1024 768 1280 800 and 1366 968 resolution..you may need to change these added numbers

setinterval	settimeout
your next problem is that this isn t what you expect it to be inside the setinterval and settimeout callbacks this will probably be window when the callback is triggered

10867065
width	height
one thing you can do to achieve this in certain situations is add width 100 and height 100 to every intervening element and rely on the text extending out of its containing block if the image takes up all of the available space

10867243
for-loop	loops
a foreach loops and a for-loop would both work fine but you might find the foreach more covenient since you wouldn t have to count the days times to check for

after a month of trying to figure it out and posting little questions on here every week i decided to post the whole problem on here and see if i can get some guidance

10867294
inline	inlining
now on actual inlining the compiler can decide to inline or not any function regardless of whether the function is declared as inline provided that it sees the definition of that function the code that it will inline which is the reason why in general functions that are meant to be inline should be defined in the header either inside the class definition or marked inline outside

10867400
jlabel	jslider	jtextfield	jslider	jtextfield	jlabel
i have a jslider jlabel and jtextfield

10867400

10867532
tcpdf	fpdf
i started with fpdf then switched to tcpdf when i needed to include unicode characters which fpdf didn t support at the time.

10867532
tcpdf	fpdf
as eugen suggested you can hand-roll your own headers and footers more easily than using the functions built in to either fpdf or tcpdf

10867532
put	get
i know i can safely put 20 lines of items and i know my maximum single item is 2 lines then when i get to 20 lines i start a new page

it seems to work fine on google-chrome safari ipad iphone android but i m having a problem with firefox and internet explorer

10867569
children	parent
the problem is that your elements inside the dropzones are of course part of the dropzone and when you enter the children you leave the parent

10867569
children	parent
you might try adding events to the children too adding your class again to the parent

10867575
onkeyup	onkeydown
there you will find onkeylongpress as well as onkeydown and onkeyup

10867575
onkeyup	onkeydown
if you are having trouble distinguishing single click from long click you will need to use onkeydown and onkeyup and check the duration of the click

10867575
onkeyup	onkeydown
esentially you will start a timer in the onkeydown and check the time in the onkeyup

10867577
intersect	contains
the problem - to me - seems that the index is for the standard pg set-based array operators not necessarily optimized for finding one element of an array but rather where one array contains another intersect with another - for me it s counter-intuitive that size-wise and speed-wise such a wide solution is correct for such a narrow problem

10867577
int	chars
also the intarr extension seems limited to int not covering int64 or chars limiting its usefulness

10867608

all i had to do to get this to work was put my requires above the task specification and then just declare the environment flag like so

min	max
as i commented before you can do this by simply using 2 jquery ui datepickers - one for min date another for max date - and filtering the dates

10867792
for-loop	loops
and when you move to a pure function form of the for-loop list comprehensions you tend to lose the initializer et alia because it becomes a foreach loops instead

10867796

10867799
post	get
the way you get raw post data in php one way at least is file_get_contents php input

10867807
range	infinity
sometimes you can specify infinity as the end point of the range in mathematics but you won t write something like that in code usually you will check the difference between iteration and stop when the difference is smaller than a threshold

10868402
clang	armcc
and wont work consistently across compilers armcc clang etc

10868402
128bit	64bit
normally the asm solution would be when the abi changes maybe 10 years between retesting and just fix the c would be 20 years maybe when we go 64bit to 128bit

10868407
int	chars
since its an interview question interviewer might be looking at how are you handling all the corner cases like list is null only two nodes 1-char 1-int number of chars node and int node are different in number in a block etc

but as you can see gpuimagefilter inherits implements extends gpuimageinput which should allow me to use cast gpuimagesketchfilter gpuimageoutput and gpuimageview as gpuimageinput

10868579
int	chars
after asking and reviewing other answer i remembered a lesson thought in high school which states that int stores 235 chars but in reality it stores 234 chars so i always wonder that the last letter might not be stored but now in practical it is clear that it doesn t stores the very first letter 0 lol i changed the data type to nvarchar 50 it stores retrieve both with 0 chars no matter how much

10868584

10868963
background-repeat	background-image	background-repeat	background-position	background-image	background-position
as there are numerous vendor prefixes to manage it s easier to just write what is needed for the background-image part and then write once for all browsers background-position and background-repeat that doesn t need any vendor prefix

10868966
width	height
you can set the dimensions width and height of the inline frame using html attributes or using css

experimentally i am not using getter and setter in my current project

10879417
getter	setter
unless necessary don t provide getter setter

10879417
getter	setter
my reply has been when -in the future- i need to do so i will provide the getter and setter

10879417
getter	setter
the objection about incapsulation that some may raise is not really a valid one providing getter and setter breaks incapsulation in the same manner plus you have additional lines of useless code

10879417
getter	setter
bugs may also lay in getter and setter

10879417
getter	setter
thus this logic doesn t need to be in a setter getter

10879417
getter	setter
you need the getter an setter

10879417
getter	setter
i suppose that the need of getter setter is mostly cultural

10879495
width	height
whose width and height are

10879495
width	height
so in order to get the width of a any single page constituting the input.pdf we need to divide being known the height 841 points 1785 by 3 595

10879548
listview	gridview
i m trying to avoid having 5 listview with individual adapters so the idea is to have gridview which will have 5 columns representing week schedule and to attach my cursoradapter to it

it makes more sense to factor out config and use a simple ini file which uses simple key-value pairs for config parameters

10879560
versioning	upgrade
they are intelligent to not override any changed config on versioning upgrade etc

10879560

10879560
versioning	upgrade
user should not expect a config reset after versioning upgrade

width	height
i would like to avoid fixed width height of the table or any element so absolute positioning everything is not acceptable solution

if you do release such a library the uniform access principle dictates that you should use getter and setter in order to be able to change the underlying implementation later without requiring clients to change their code

in the end i have decided not to use tcmalloc and instead optimize the application code directly this means removing the allocations from the inner loops to avoid the malloc free lock contentions

the problem with this solution is that relative-sized user-controls s hosted by the tabcontrol now gets thousaunds of pixels wider than they are supposed to because the scrollviewer does not restrict their size

either way whatever the browser decides to do it will be the most optimal solution there is a limit on the number of http request most browser will do in parallel which is solved by the spdy protocol but that s another story

10881904

either way any optimizations benefit greatly from taking a look at the waterfall of your page load the image above in either firefox with firebug and go to the net tab or google-chrome hit f12 and go to the network tab showing what is loaded when and trying to get the blue line to move as much as possible to the left

since it s not clear what the last numeric part of your source date string represents my example doesn t deal with it - you may need to extend the according getter and setter logic

10886809

all that synthesize does is generate the accessor setter and getter for your properties and create an instance variable with the same name

int	chars
these are slightly different from amro s solution as the first reads in a 1d format number 1 chars int and returns a cell array c that can be converted using a much simpler cell2mat command

10887268
stdout	stderr
remember that warnings are sent to stderr whereas your output is going to stdout

10887374
min	max
if you want to define den in terms of 0.1 you can do so but you need to change the corresponding equations in min and max

10887584
post	get
as you can see in the code below i can post the xml you provided verbatim to an operation which takes the fullserviceaddresscorrectiondelivery as an input and the object is properly populated - you need to mark the operation or the contract with the xmlserializerformat attribute to get this behavior

10887592

this code works every time with google-chrome and firefox and works about 95 of the time with ie8 required support

10887642

i think you misunderstood how push and pull task queues works

10887642
pull	push
in both queues you add tasks to the queue but while in push queue the system will dequeue the task and assign it to the apropriate handler in pull queue you need to dequeue the task s using lease_tasks and handle the task

also you can set cron jobs to call that particular endpoint

10887757

10888091
getter	setter
you are not utilizing the proper getter setter methods generated by the property synthesis

10888152
getter	setter
now because of automatic setter and getter we fail to catch the error because any method the user names is valid -- even if that user made a mistake

10888152
getter	setter
it simply creates the object and passes it along to my getter setter methods

10888152
getter	setter
instead my methods foo and bar are both setter and getter

this tutorial is up-to-date as of time of writing and helped me get vimclojure set up with leiningen in osx

10888340
integer	unsigned
generally speaking you don t consider redesigning your data structure so that inserts deletes do not happen in this fashion or else use a larger integer type bigint unsigned is 8 bytes so can go up to 2 64 or 10 19

10888362
nfa	dfa
when we converting from nfa to dfa there may be result like the image below.

10888494
for-loop	arrays
i am trying to store the positions of the circles in an arrays and then checking that arrays each time another circle is created in the for-loop if the randomly created x and y is too close to a already created circle it should keep getting a new random x and y until it isnt too close to an already created circle

10888685
width	height
i don t know what the exact situation is as i m not familiar with the unity javascript interface you are using but i think there s a good chance that you need to specify an integer width and height for the player whereas your calculation is producing a non-integral number

10888693
cpython	ironpython
ptvs is compatible with ironpython and cpython which are python distributions where you run your code

10888693

safari seems to be my only exception for mac users but i m concerned that they too will follow suit with google-chrome and firefox

10888727

web browsers only support get and post so if you are building a web site there is no need for put or delete

10888819
super	extends
no built in solution mind you but they re super easy to extends and jmxmp is simple tcp socket based rather than rmi so this type of customization would be trivial

10888848
cvs	rcs
if the v contains a useful description append it to the commit message for revision 1.1 cvs2hg ignores the description - but lots of our cvs files actually came from rcs where it was easy to put the initial commit message into the description field by mistake

10888848
cvs	rcs
running cvs log on each individual v file - parsing the output and using rcs -m to change this history

folder	directory
this leads to a lot of folder all over the place under every directory we have an .exe in that has been localized

10889006
cvs	rcs
of course on a large commit someone might complain that there are 100+ nearly identical log messages one for each file and just like a big rcs cvs commit people will update and get something between the start of the commit and the finish but then you can tell them about the problems you have and the solution you were forced to resort to in order to get work done despite poor management and support

10889174
backtracking	greedy
it works by greedy matching everything up to the start of the end-of-tag the first then backtracking to match the nearest last then capturing everything after that slash the into group 1 so that you can use it during the replacement step

10889179

10889296

10889304
post	get
not ideal and not polished enough yet for a blog post but should get you started

10889489
ubuntu	linux
this works on ubuntu linux

10889504
inherited	properties
also you can take the opposite approach first create your object that inherited your methods and then extend it with the properties that are assigned in the binary.parse function

10889504
inherited	properties
if this approach works it is certainly better than my original solution above since here the resulting object inherited your methods as opposed to above where each instance contains the methods as own properties

10889507
folder	directory
finally right click on the folder you added and you should have an option that says convert to application or create virtual directory or something similar

cpu	processors
you should make these determinations from direct empirical measurements or from the cpu s pipeline specifications rather than assumptions about what processors should predict because implementations are so different

10889867
chown	chmod
seems to work except by the fact that all the files are owned by root and i don t have permission to write on the folder neither chmod nor chown seems to be working

10890244
hash	salt
i have looked through and seen about storing the salt and hash seperately and together

10890256
hash	salt
some options are to append the salt to the hash or stored as its own field

10890256
hash	salt
then when the user goes to login you grab his password break it into the hash and the salt and use your password generation function with the salt from the password instead of a random salt to determine if it matches the password in the db

still even if some copying and padding was required beforehand each individual field could eventually be hash using md5 sha-1 or whatever and those hash values could be similarly combined so this complication doesn t really categorically rule out the approach you re interested in

hash	md5

if expiration equals permanent then the button should be disabled and the checkbox checked

10898493
button	checkbox
if not then the button is enabled and checkbox unchecked

10898493

but it seems that just having the disabled and checked attributes listed at all is causing all button to be disabled and all checkbox checked

i would like to modify the code to do the same with all excel files contained within sub directory within the folder allowing me to just copy the sub-folders into the receiving temp folder and run the macro rather than opening each sub directory and grabbing the excel file and moving it manually

10899079
getter	setter
what you can t do is write a bare java class that magically is interpreted as scala getter and setter

10899079
getter	setter
the reason is that scala embeds information into the class file that it requires for its getter and setter are there zero parameter blocks or one empty parameter block--a distinction which is not preserved on the jvm or in java

10899079
getter	setter
the other alternative of course is to provide an implicit conversion from the java class to one that has a getter setter that references the real methods on the java class

10899079
getter	setter
one could argue that interpreting java-defined getter setter pairs as if they were scala ones if the classfile does not explicitly say it s from scala is a good candidate for a feature enhancement to improve java interoperability.

10901699

the mxml is generated into actionscript under the hood by the flex compiler

10901714

moreover both strategies suggested by yahma and tom fail on this particular phone as it is possible to receive a positive minimum-buffer size from an unsupported configuration and worse i ve been forced to reset the phone to get the audio stack working again after attempting to use an audiorecord class initialized from parameters that produce a supposedly valid non-exception raising audiotrack or audiorecord instance

10902429

lisp	prolog

10904912
lisp	prolog
i have since tried out allegrograph 4.6 and i found that anything missing from their prolog extension is made up for by the fact that you can use the lisp escape functor to write allegro common lisp expressions to take care of anything you need to do that isn t offered by the prolog extension

width	height
the aspect ratio of a window screen image or other rectangular object is simply its width divided by its height

10905465
width	height
also of interest if you know the aspect ratio 16 9 or 1.7778 and know the height of the screen 1080 pixels you can get the width of the screen by multiplying

10905465
width	height
similarly you can get the height of the screen from the aspect ratio and width by dividing

10905465
width	height
for example when you rotate a phone onto it s side its natural to think that the long edge has become the width of the screen and the short edge is it s height - however iirc most phone operating systems actually keep the width and height the same and leave it up to you to handle the fact that the screen is basically just tipped on its side

you may have poms set up for your projects but for the m2e plugin to work you need to have either created the project as a maven project new - project... - maven - maven project... or converted it into a maven project by right clicking it then selecting configure - convert to maven project

10906635

whenever you add a dependency to a pom.xml then the project s build path will be configured automatically although sometimes you may need to force it to do so by right clicking the project and selecting maven - update maven configuration

10906635
maven	m2e
for this to work the project must have workspace resolution enabled and the projects to be picked up need to be configured as m2e maven projects as well

10906635
folder	directory
one more thing that may help is that you should make sure that your source folder follow the maven default directory structure

10906635
maven	pom.xml	folder	directory
it is possible to configure a pom.xml to tell maven to expect your source code to be in different source folder but it is highly recommended that you follow the standard maven directory structure

ppm	pbm
since your original images are png lossless bitmaps you can convert both to long-form pbm or a related format like long-form ppm

ppm	pbm
as storage formats pbm and ppm are egregiously inefficient but they are likewise egregiously easy to manipulate and that s what you want

10906820
ubuntu	debian
the pbm 5 manpage available for example on debian ubuntu systems in the netpbm package is well written and explains the process clearly

you ll eventually have to test in firefox ie etc but not really in google-chrome because they both use the same v8 engine you might want to do a cursory glance of course

10906859
client-side	server-side
with node.js you ll also have one of the faster server-side interpreters at your command faster than python and ruby roughly equal to lua and sometimes up to java s level and somehow v8 has the fastest regex engine in the world and then server-side code matches client-side code which makes things like rpc layers much nicer to work with

10906889
swt	swing
the problem with swing is the look and feels metal nimbus gtk... the worst out there compared to swt windows mac and gnome tool kit and getting good looking widgets is utopist yet i am asking the question though

getter	setter
though properties are made generally when you need to access some variable outside of the class mean getter n setter but in objective c an additional need to make property is that the memory management goes on compiler ends so if you are using some object not primitive data types then you should use property and synthesize it and then release in dealloc if you are using manual reference counting

10909094
getter	setter
normally i synthesize a property because i want to have access to the ivar from the outside of the class and also because i want a getter and setter methods

10909102
accessor	ivar
- you can customize the accessor methods for example to lazy instantiate an ivar or do something when a setting a new value like setneedsdisplay

put	get
what you are doing can be done if you put the string in an invisible div and then from extjs code get the div html in a variable and use it in your code

10909284
getter	setter
custom getter and setter if you like you can still write custom getter and setter and you can even just write a getter or setter and let the other one automatically synthesize

10909284
getter	setter
and you can write custom logic into such a getter and setter you can reload a tableview after a property has changed

10909284
getter	setter
dot notation you can access getter and setter via dot notation if you have the property

10909284
getter	setter
if you need you ivar to be public it is simpler to write one property than writing a getter and setter for a ivar

10909350

by simple i mean classes that have no-args constructors and have only getter and setter methods that directly relate to properties that will be present in the json object as it travels over the wire

also i have a hard-coded value of 80px as a width and 20px as a height for each section you can change this to whatever fits your content

10915981
post	get
you can even do like.all and for each like get the related object a post or a micropost with like.likable

10916014
post	put
the client ends up sending something that a http 1.0 proxy doesnt understand commonly an expect header as part of a http post or put request due to a standard protocol convention of sending the request in two parts as covered in the remarks here

10916014
post	put
as covered in the other answers if the specific issue you run into is that the expect header is causing the problem then that specific problem can be routed around by doing a relatively global switching off of the two-part put post transmission via system.net.servicepointmanager.expect100continue

10916016
button	checkbox
above checkbox is type of button

10916018
haskell	scheme
smalltalk or even better self and newspeak are much better languages to learn before learning ruby as are scheme and haskell

10916020
int	chars
note alphachar is simply a typedef with unsigned int type and the function counts the alphachar chars

10916039
google-chrome	firefox
third why do you want to do a var_dump if you want to see what is being sent back from the form use a tool like firebug for firefox or developer tools in google-chrome

10916284
hash	salt
another thing i want to learn is how to create a one way hash sha256 combined with a good salt

10916296
post	get
the difference between post and get is how the server retrieves the data

10916302
client-side	server-side
to ensure that a client has in fact connected and the process of populating client object on the server has successfully completed i have a server-side method that invokes a client-side function with the number and list of connected clients derived from the connected client collection

10916303
children	parent
i think i m getting to the root of the problem probably caused by the children not able to reference the parent because they do not yet exist

10916327
base	fractions
whatever base is chosen will have difficulties representing finitely some fractions

10916327
base	fractions
base 2 can only approximate any fractions with a factor of 3 in the denominator but base 5 or base 7 do too

10916386
box-sizing	border-box
something like an experiment border-image inside with a box-sizing border-box

10916403
put	get
i think you can put a conftest.py file along with your tests and it will take care to skip all non-matching tests non-marked tests will always match and thus never get skipped

10916424
width	height
if i read the height and width of button in pixels i can see that the size is right

10916439
width	height
get the youtube link from the embedding tab below the video on youtube you can set there the width and height of the frame

10916456
rtp	rtsp	udp	rtp
only the live communication case is one that may require a rtp rtsp implementation over udp to work with the required low latency

10916506
udp	tcp
you can only reliably use two protocols through the internet udp and tcp

10916506
udp	tcp
both of them involve a process setting up a listening socket and the other sending a message udp or performing a connection attempt tcp to said listening server

10916506
udp	tcp
if anything it just means that additionally to either listening to or initiating a tcp connection all the nodes will have to be udp listening servers as well

10916530
versioning	upgrade
i d suggest you upgrade to a more recent versioning of opencv 2.4 has recently been released and try to stick with the one or other of the c++ or c style methods

10916540
atomic	compare-and-swap
in multi-threaded code it will use atomic operations if an atomic compare-and-swap instruction is supported by the cpu otherwise the reference counts are protected by a mutex

10916543
client-side	server-side
one notable difference is that the attribute performs explicit client-side validation whereas when your field does not contain a valid datetime you get server-side validation through a failure by the default model binder to create a datetime object from the posted form data

10916560
qunit	sinon
this is an excellent post on how to use sinon with qunit for mocks

10916571
google-chrome	safari
supported by google-chrome safari

10916584
int	double
compiling this with visual studio i get a warning c4244 about possible loss of data - of course because simplified the multiplication of an int by a double results in a double which is then cast to an int losing the non-integer part

10916617
int	double
and if you really want to multiply by floats double don t use int to store the result

10916713
maven	pom.xml
i have a grails project with pom.xml that is treated as maven project by intellij

10916748

it means i have m.n images whose width and height is given

10916802
hide	show
is there some simple code to show hide a div on the click of a button

10916848
jruby	rubinius
rubinius s or jruby s optimizing compiler may be able to inline and optimize away many method calls that yarv s rather simple compiler can t for example

10916899
rank	max
if you have defined max ceiling default to it to simplify the code i am assuming 0 is not a valid rank

10916900
hash	md5
for example if you use md5 you may try generating hash colision

google-chrome	firefox
check out that jquery is loaded in the page source f12 if you use firefox or google-chrome

10916921
uiviewcontroller	uipageviewcontroller
to call the method programatically from within the uiviewcontroller being displayed you could make the uipageviewcontroller a delegate of your uiviewcontroller that are being displayed then call a delegate method when the buttons are pressed

10916929
mp3	ogg
to cover support for most of the commonly used browsers you will have to stream in at least 2 formats mp3 and ogg for example

10916929
mp3	ogg
for streaming audio ogg mp3 you can use an icecast server

10916959
stdout	stderr
is stdout is stderr

10916965
explode	implode
i know it s not the most efficient way but if you want to use explode you ll need to use implode also

10916974
post	get
post and get are not equivalent

10916984
postgresql	mysql
you can import data nodes and edges directly from a database mysql sqlserver postgresql sqlite teradata using simple sql queries

10916988
textmate	sublimetext
sublimetext and st2 use the old format supplied by textmate .tmtheme

10917000
post	get
the problem here is that you are using get to retrieve the contents but the website is expecting a post

10917000
post	get
get and post are not equivalent although some programmers consider them the same in php for example you can use instead of and

10917009
qsort	strcmp
i was looking at the man page for qsort and the example does the following to convert the pointers to elements of a an array of strings pointers to elements seen as to normal char pointers feedable to strcmp

10917019
macports	homebrew
it could be installed with homebrew or macports on osx

10917030
division	multiplication
multiplication and division will be really cheap operations

10917033
range	minimum
i want to add a minimum range so the users can not slider lower than that

10917038
post	get
however it looks like there s post data you ll need to figure out in addition to the above query string arguments to get this to really return data

10917074
starttls	smtps
smtps server logs show ehlo starttls starttls and ehlo then auth mail etc

10917074
starttls	smtps
smtps server logs show ehlo starttls starttls and ehlo then nothing

10917085
post	get
whenever i fire the post i get

10917133
getter	setter
c# does not support custom bit widths but it does support binary operations and getter setter which makes it relatively easy to add a compatibility layer

10917157
gruntjs	uglifyjs
the gruntjs min task allows you to set uglifyjs the gruntjs min tool options which can give you greater control on how the destination file is mangled and compressed

10917174
google-chrome	firefox
other browsers mainly new versions of firefox and google-chrome went through the roof bounce rate of 65-90

10917183
google-chrome	firefox
the .ci_title class displays a grey background color strangely while in google-chrome firefox and other modern browsers it is transparent

10917183
background-color	transparency
i added background-color transparency to .ci_title but it doesn t work

10917186
floating-point	integer
the problem is that frames of a video are pixel-based which means there s usually no built-in way to draw lines or rectangles with real aka floating-point as opposed to integer coordinates

10917186
floating-point	integer
if the library you re using to draw the rectangle onto each frame only supports integer coordinates and not floating-point coordinates and you should check this because many graphics libraries do support floating-point coordinates which would make this task very easy for you then you ll have to roll your own for this

10917217
button	checkbox
note if you want radio button that look like checkbox then this answer will be of help

10917293
hide	show
this will show the .field-group-format-wrapper elements if they are currently hidden and hide them if they re currently visible

10917293
ready	each
fyi the reason your code snippet in your question wasn t working is because you re only checking the visibility of the elements on dom ready rather than on each click - so the event handler to show the elements will never be attached

10917346
versioning	upgrade
if i want to upgrade or downgrade i change the versioning and run the bundle update command

10917346
post	get
another situation let s suppose i want to get the last comment from a user and within the comment insert a link to the related post using the post title

10917346
post	get
in rails i would do something like user.comments.last.post.title to get the post title

10917346
post	get
if i want to the get the 5 last published post from the category programming ordered by the most accessed for example i would call them this way post.published.from_category programming .most_accessed.limit 5

10917358
width	height
in your x and y arguments you have to include the width and the height of the icons

10917369
rational-numbers	base
yet no matter what floating point system you choose there will still be lowly rational-numbers with no perfect representation 1 3 in base 10

10917379
google-chrome	firefox
as to your concrete problem i m not sure if i understand browser s 404 page properly perhaps you mean the browser-default error page which can occur when the server is unreachable or when the request has been redirected in an infinite loop that should however have been made clear in the actual message of the browser default error page at least google-chrome and firefox do that

10917397
box-sizing	border-box
if your project doesn t need to support ie7 you can use box-sizing border-box to add padding to your columns otherwise add an extra element inside each column for padding

10917420
hide	show
we should only hide the taskbar if the mashup application is show fullscreen on the primary monitor

10917434
rss	feed
also you may have better luck using curl and simplexml and getting your rss feed

10917435
google-chrome	safari
and in safari and google-chrome blocks of text are surrounded by tags

10917437
accessor	properties
a get properties accessor is used to return the properties value and a

10917462
versioning	upgrade
upgrade php - but that would require significant amount of regression testing since the openx versioning that we are using does not seem to have tested against these latest php versioning

10917465
webkit	gecko
if it s not webkit nor gecko i ll just use the standard property

10917481
getter	setter
however by using a property you can add code to the getter and the setter allowing you to do stuff like lazy loading in the getter or validation in the setter and much more

10917495
contourf	imshow
making the 2d plot seems to be possible because contourf accepts a zdir argument while i ve looked and imshow doesn t

10917505
accessor	properties
properties are just syntactic sugar so that you don t have to write accessor methods like java

10917525
mp3	ogg
the procedure is simple just request an evaluation with mp3 and ogg optimization scripts and the suite and you get the best quality compression ratio out of your audio

10917527
google-chrome	firefox
i have checked with firefox ie9 and google-chrome - and all browsers do the same

10917536
getter	setter
a few questions been asked regarding getting notified when a variable changes define getter or setter

10917571
onresume	onpause
it would then be important to unregister the listener in onpause and register it in onresume

10917577
folder	directory
for axis2 the working directory where jre is started from should be the bin folder of your apache tomcat while for your program it will depend on where you made the call to the jre to start the program from

10917581
queue	fifo
the way i have this implemented is that whenever a client wants to read a chunk of bytes the class will repeatedly read from the underlying file-like objects with chunk sizes appropriate to those objects and add the bytes to the head of a fifo queue until there are enough bytes in the queue to serve a chunk of the requested size to the client

10917581
queue	fifo
the first time the client requests 1 kib the class has to read 1 mib and add it to the fifo queue

10917581
queue	fifo
then for that request and the subsequent 1023 requests the class has to pop 1 kib from the tail of the fifo queue which gradually decreases in size from 1 mib to 0 bytes at which time the cycle starts again

10917589
post	put
put all your more specific rules first then everything else that is a single unit will go to user post something

10917605
ctime	strftime
i would consider using ctime and or strftime

10917608
put	get
the weird thing is when trying to put the same facebook https links that the app tries to use in any browser on the android device they dont load there either i get a web page unavailable

10917622
public	protected
you should only wrap the public members of a class not any protected or private members

10917622
integer	unsigned
declares another class this time briskscalespace but also provides a constructor that accepts a uint8_t an unsigned byte - which should just map to an integer in python but i d be careful to not pass in one greater than 255 bytes - i don t know what would happen in that situation

10917634
jython	jacl
equivalent to bkail s suggestion using jython instead of jacl

10917635
primefaces	richfaces
note that componenent libraries like primefaces and richfaces have already made the form the default execute attribute so you don t need to explicitly specify it in their command components

10917645
put	get
the code within the get block of a property is in fact put into a hidden get_propertyname method and the set block into a hidden set_propertyname method

10917668
width	height
i m using some images which i want to have no width or height

10917668
width	height
in other words i want to remove the auto generated css attribute that is given to each image in the slider because the inclusion of width and height in the dom on the page makes the image look pixelated for some reason

10917680
flask	django
use a web framework like flask or django to serve pages

10917680
post	get
when the user requests the job be started via a request preferably a post request because get requests should not cause significant side-effects the framework sends a message to a delayed task system like celery

10917698
versioning	upgrade
application and module versioning allows multiple versioning of the same application to exist in a glassfish server domain which simplifies upgrade and rollback tasks

10917740
client-side	server-side
it should include both client-side and server-side validation before you insert the data into your db

10917741
onclick	onchange
try to use onclick instead of onchange

10917753
box-sizing	border-box	width	border-box
you can use box-sizing border-box to make padding and border be counted inside width

10917757
jax-ws	jax-rs
one supporting jax-rs and one jax-ws

10917809
filtering	grouping
when the filtering changed from q1 2012 to q2 2012 customer name 1 and name 2 would be under existing customer grouping

10917815
jar	war
i have a jar that suddenly needs to be re-packaged as a war don t ask why

10917956
background-image	background-position
because the ui-widget-header s width is set dynamically you need to dynamically change background-position of the background-image with slide callback

10917984
postgresql	mysql
i ran bundle --without production since i m using mysql on local machine and can t compile the gem postgresql properly

10917987
idictionary	icollection
not sure what you are asking here but if you need this method to handle dictionaries differently you can test to see if the icollection is also an idictionary

10917996
pull	push
i have a server hosting a repo that we pull push to

10918006
mouse	keyboard
we can create update populate tables etc by either sql commands or by simply clicking the options command with a mouse keyboard in sql server management studio express 2008

10918046
children	parent
foo has navigation properties parent of type foo children of type and bar of type bar

10918046
children	parent
now what i want is to be able to such that bar is loaded up for all the parent and children of a foo as well

10918055
put	get
get parameters are not inherently unsafe all rest services rely on data being put in the url

10918055
post	get
parameters get or post are unsafe if your user detail page in your example does not check if you actually have access to user account 12

10918055
post	get
also don t think post parameters are any harder to manipulate than get parameters

10918068
filtering	grouping
you can grouping the link table by object and filtering for only those grouping containing one record

10918083
g++	gcc
if your on linux or mac learn to compile from terminal using gcc or g++

10918102
ggplot2	ggmap
fyi i m fairly new to ggplot2 and ggmap so i apologize for the sloppy code but it is the only way i ve been able to plot sets of groups of points where each group has it s own color

10918174
superclass	subclassing
when you create an instance of the subclassing by calling new on the sub class type then immediately its superclass constructor is called and it keeps going till the object class this is called constructor chaining

10918174
superclass	subclassing
and most important is that when constructor of subclassing it called it goes to its superclass and so on till the object class then 1st creating the object class object then the class under it till it reaches the subclassing on whose class new was called you will see that the constructor of the superclass is called first then its subclassing s

10918192
mp3	ogg
if you extract the raw audio data from a diverse range of formats like wma m4a mp3 and ogg you ll be left with no context for how to use the data later unless you re planning to store the context elsewhere like in a database

10918204
post	get
you can make codeigniter filter all post and get by changing the option in your config file or you can ask to filter manually by doing this

10918211
width	height
your suggested method will work as long as you make sure that you always use the height width properties to set _height and _width

10918211
accessor	properties	width	height
as matã as stated you could make your height and width properties have accessor with different access modifiers so that you could read but not write to your height width properties outside of this class

10918217
portrait	landscape
in regards to the rotation remember that the ios rear cameras are mounted landscape left and the front cameras landscape right so for a portrait orientation you need to rotate the incoming video frames

10918235
goto	break
in the cleanup even in normal case scenario i would regard the use of goto as being clearer than the do while 0 constructs among other things because the target labels themselves practically cry out look at me far moreso than the break and do while 0 constructs

10918242
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
links to the subsections work cause the content to scroll to the correct height but using the back button does not re-scroll to the correct section in firefox v13 ie v9 or opera v11 it does work in google-chrome v20 and safari v5

10918244
squash	merge
i merge a tree onto a my repository by using git subtree add without the squash option

10918247
google-chrome	safari
this works great in safari google-chrome but there s one case that doesn t work in google-chrome if there are no options to load via ajax so only the disabled edit... options are visible it will not fire an event on the edit... option being selected

10918264
int	chars
for your question 3 there is the char2seed function in the teachingdemos package which will take a chars string alhpa numeric and convert it to an int and by default use that to set a new seed

10918273
hide	show
click on the visibility pane and select show or hide based on an expression radio button

10918288
free	malloc
as far as a simple implementation of malloc free goes k r c has a good one

10918291
super	abstract	super	implements
have abstract method in super class to create the components sub class will implements these methods to create the component

10918329
richfaces	omnifaces	primefaces	richfaces	primefaces	omnifaces
you d need to look at 3rd party component libraries like primefaces or richfaces or omnifaces

10918345
superclass	subclassing
it s like having an animal superclass and dog and cat subclassing

10918354
google-chrome	firefox
the problem was that for some reason in firefox not google-chrome there is room to scroll even though the renderer is set to the window size so firefox was scrolling when using the arrow keys

min	max
i want to take the second to last column and find the min max and average

10918370

10918370
min	max
i figure once i do that i can use min and max function

10918373
post	put
in rails button_to will try to do a post or put so it is not actually a regular button you can style your link to look and act like a button

10918378
subtract	add
then you can add or subtract your time zone offset ist is utc+05 30

10918394
super	abstract	super	implements
have abstract method in super class to create the components sub class will implements these methods to create the component.

10918397
width	height
the executive summary is that for this variation yuv 4 2 0 planar each pixel in the image gets a y sample note that the y loop iterates over every x y pair while 2x2 pixel quads each share a u cb sample and a v cr sample notice in block seven that the iteration is over width 2 and height 2

10918402
for-loop	arrays
then you can sort as per usual and you can even include the two arrays in the same for-loop

10918405
pecl	pear
here s one pecl pear thing i never used it

10918405
postgresql	mysql
postgresql will treat uuid as 128-bit values and presumably do optimized binary operations whereas mysql s char 36 solution is looking at 36 bytes 288-bits ansi or 576-bits utf8 plus-or-minus bits bytes for office-keeping and presumably do much slower multibyte-char-by-multibyte-char string routines

10918405
hex	binary
and my conclusion was that you d want to write up a stored function that converts the hex representation into the binary representation for storage and that would make all select statements require a conversion back into hex representation.

10918417
width	height
lets assume i want to calculate the rotation 90 degrees of a shape with x 1 y 1 topleft point and a width of 4 and a height of 6 around its center 3 4 x1 y2

10918420
put	get
not sure i put all the type casts right everywhere but you get the idea

10918436
post	get
i couldn t get this to work properly but i did find out the first author brian sallans is currently affiliated with arc seibersdorf research gmbh information technologies seibersdorf austria and i think i have his email address though i m not sure if i should post it directly on so - but you can find it on this paper -

behat	mink
i ve been following this guide and installed everything through composer and am attempting to get behat + mink working but everytime i try and run bin behat i get the following error

10918475
behat	mink
and my vendor behat mink behat.yml file contains

qnetworkreply	qnetworkaccessmanager
i think the internals of qnetworkaccessmanager invokes different implementations of the qnetworkreply depending of the protocol used http ftp ...

10922702
qnetworkreply	qnetworkaccessmanager
considering the fact that qnetworkaccessmanager createrequest must return a qnetworkreply object i cannot see any combination of subclassing that permits tampering in the replied byte array

you don t appear to be using bufferedinputstream bufferedoutputstream in your io pipelines so it is quite possible that data is being read and written one byte at a time

10925382
hide	show
in your php code you ll want to check the value of the deleted field for each post and then hide or show the post accordingly

10925423

again if you post some example code you ll probably get much better advice on how to refactor it

10926172
public	protected
i thought that the derived class won t have access to the member properties or method of its parent class but after i try not to call parent constructor it seems that the child class still get access to its parent public protected member

10926200
inherited	properties
childclass obviously inherited the uiview properties but in childclass i know for certain i ll only be using a uiscrollview for this properties

10926240
filtering	grouping
if only filtering when a grouping is selected make the groupuser datasource disabled

10926263
public	protected
all public and protected member properties and methods are available even when the parent constructor is not called that is correct

10926299
inherited	properties	inherited	subclassing
if you re subclassing parentclass that has a properties of a uiview and you need childclass to inherited a uiscrollview

10926299
inherited	properties
you should just make a uiscrollview properties in parentclass so childclass can inherited and use it

10926301
int	chars
thus to get a list of all of the lengths you would first need to compute the number of partitions of n that is the number of ways you can write n as an unordered sum of one or more not necessarily distinct positive int and then for each partition create the corresponding string and compute the number of distinguishable permutations of the chars in that string

10926361
backtracking	greedy
its simple backtracking imo.why complicating it with greedy or dynamic

10926366
backgrounding	multitasking
generally it s safe to say if your app is a recently opened app or even on a phone where someone clears the multitasking menu often that the device will not terminate your application in the backgrounding

10926369
public	protected
this way public will be the web accessible directory and everything below it including the zf application files will be protected

10926397
opencart	vqmod
for changing or adding functionality you should consider using vqmod it allows you to change things without modifying the opencart source code directly which is ideal if you do upgrades or want to port your changes to other opencart installs

10926432
postgresql	mysql
mysql postgresql hsql sql-server

10926464
hash	salt
all you have in database is salt hash

10926533
versioning	upgrade
in macos x this is similar to windows only that there s no separation between opengl interface and driver client that s the reason why macos x is so slow to keep up with new opengl versioning it always requires a full operating system upgrade to deliver the new framework

10926572
width	height
i have a simple fabric.canvas element which has a background and i have set its width and height equal to that of the above image

10926619
pop-up	dialog
so you have to use a pop-up dialog like jquery ui dialog

10926641
post	get
i haven t tested it but you could try to post a runnable where you would get the newly inserted row s height and then scroll the scrollview by that amount so it stays at the same position

10926729
hide	show
i made a script that onclick show hide a dropdown list here is the code

10926737
versioning	upgrade
i can t currently upgrade the versioning as several other developers are involved in the project

i m using uipinchgesturerecognizer for this subviews and uiview animatewithduration method but the size of view doesn t change

10926975

you don t need to call addclass and removeclass separately for each class just use comma separated values

10927022
versioning	upgrade
the scenario is that i need to control the risk that a newer versioning of ios is potentially incompatible with the app considering that the networking based methods are not always available or reliable and that i must notice and force the users to upgrade the app to the latest versioning which is tested to be compatible with the latest versioning of ios

10927321
width	height
i have tried formatting the odd column s like width 200 height 50 style overflow scroll but still that shows the scrollbars including on cells which don t need it and it is actually still expanding the height to accommodate all text the scrollbars are visible but not usable

10927326
hide	show
you can load every possible div into the client page and hide all except one the default one and then show hide the appropriate div based on the list box selection but you do need javascript or similar language for this

10927365
width	height
my approach to get the desired effect was to change the style for the divs from to and then i swapped all my height and width styles

10927446
mef	prism
managing the complexity of a large project is rather hard also in silverlight - we used prism mef and a couple of other libraries to better organize the code and get the job done but the project was just large - couple that with some not so fortunate decisions consequence of the lack of web development skills made navigating within the project a problem

10927446
put	get
i ve also seen nice lob apps in sl - the 9 months we ve put in also led to a rather nice application - but by switching to mvc 4 we could get more people on the project and i have to confess that the mvc app looks just as nice as the sl one

10927460
post	get
3 if you really need the client s date your only choices are to use ajax requests get parameters in urls or html forms with post or get data

10927482
folder	directory
when i try to save images to a directory it s not saving to my folder

10927513
implements	extends
i started with the soft keyboard example which implements uses and extension of the keyboardview object which extends view

10927556

it loads perfect in google-chrome and firefox but i am receiving this javascript error in internet explorer 9

10927727
setlocale	strftime
to format dates in other languages you should use the setlocale and strftime

10927749
sorting	filtering
however you will get a performance hit building a list if you don t already have it - it is much better to ensure that you are passing ienumerable from the linq statements directly as it is only realized when used - which can have major benefit with long lists and when using sorting or filtering because you can modify the ienumerable before it is realized

10927752
submit	submission
i am having new customer page wherein the user fills information abourt customers what i was planning to do is i wanted to display a popup where the user is asked whether he really wants to submit the information if he clicks yes then the information processing is continued and if he cancels then the submission wont continue.the popup i am talking wont be a javascript confirm.so how do i go about this should i use clientscript.registeronsubmitstatement to show my popup or is there any other alternative any suggestions are welcome thanks

10927762
unsigned	short
if you have really large tables vectors or any other contiguous representation you might consider short or even signed char or unsigned short or unsigned char if you re concerned with the bitwise representation

10927775
superclass	subclassing
when you create an instance of a subclassing you must invoke a constructor of the superclass

10927899
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
a subclassing inherited all the members fields methods and nested classes from its superclass

10927899
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
constructors are not members so they are not inherited by subclassing but the constructor of the superclass can be invoked from the subclassing

10927933
greenhopper	sprint
sprint planning stories are selected for upcoming sprint and using greenhopper we create add the stories to the sprint

10927933
greenhopper	sprint
we use greenhopper functionality to create and track stories and sprint but for task progress etc we use a whiteboard - much more visible and better for the daily standup

10927952
pull	push
i dont know what happened but i am not able to push pull from my git repository

10927964
superclass	subclassing
when you instantiate a subclassing constructor it first invokes its superclass default constructor before performing its own task

10927977
width	height
now if ill switch from height to width - new image is smaller and everything works

10928002
children	parent
leafs of these trees can have several children parent

10928002
children	parent
however the nodes point to one parent and many children

10928073
width	margin
you need to set your body width to 100 your to whatever size you want eg 720px and its margin to 0 auto

10928169
width	height
make sure that the image has width and height styles removed before setting new src

10928201
fossil	git
while i am a die-hard git aficionado for this particular case i would rather recomment fossil with its fossil server or fossil winserv modes or mercurial with its hg serve mode

10928239
children	parent
you can have inner outlets so when entering a parent state you could bind an application view being the layout and having sub-outlets named as needed which content will be set by children states

10928250
google-chrome	firefox
i know it works on ie8 and firefox google-chrome etc

10928282
put	get
this function is reffered in the code.if i don t put breakpoint and just want to step into it from the place in the code where it is called i get null pointer assertion

10928299
versioning	upgrade
if you are worried about running the conversion on lots of records as part of an upgrade you could come up with some ways to make it more efficient for example add a column to the table that contains the message schema versioning so you can efficiently target messages that are out of date

10928323
post	get
simply use either get or post method in your controller according to your form method like

10928333
int	boolean
the boolean conversion of pointer-to-members always happen in an integral context because there is no cast from pointer-to-member to an int in c++

10928378

10928420
google-chrome	firefox
i m using jquery sparklines to draw charts it s working very well on firefox google-chrome

10928430
strlen	strcpy
since we have now made this information available by calling strlen we don t need to call slow functions like strcat and strcpy that search for a null termination

10928430
memcpy	strncpy
we could use strncpy or memcpy instead

10928430
memcpy	strncpy
i picked memcpy since the extra feature in strncpy appending additional null terminations is useless in this case

10928461
many-to-one	one-to-many
use fetch joins to load the one-to-one and many-to-one relationships in your find method and add extra methods for loading the one-to-many collections like addresses

10928503
x86	64bit
look for -arch and below it you ll see either x86_64 meaning 64bit or x86 meaning 32bit

10928513
nsmutablestring	nsstring
technically it is no problem to return an nsmutablestring instead of an nsstring

10928513
nsmutablestring	nsstring
since the former is a subclass of the latter an nsmutablestring instance supports everything an nsstring does

10928549
width	margin
what you can do is to either center body by using margin 20px auto or by setting body s width to be 100 to fill the entire viewport

10928549
width	margin
you will have to set the width of #divmain to be smaller than 720px 500px - the only way for a child to be centered horizontally within its parent using margin 0 auto is for the parent s width to be larger

10928592
for-loop	loops
in loops but rather just a regular for-loop

10928600

many-to-many	one-to-many
however to answer your question in general in database design you wouldn t use a linking table like you describe for a one-to-many relationship only for a many-to-many

10930260
many-to-many	one-to-many
a many-to-many relationship would need a linking table but a one-to-many does not

either change named linuxcontroller to to make it pure jsf or change viewscoped to something else like seam s conversationalscope or sessionscope or in your case i think requestscope is just fine

10933554
portrait	landscape
i saw few apps that do it take for example skype iphone app the messages tab is portrait only - then if you press to enter the message itself you get a view controller that support landscape also because it make sense to enable landscape mode when user is chatting - then if you press to view the persons profile a new view controller will be pushed but in portrait

to get the most of the block you might use a power of 2 as the limit for a 32 bit unsigned integer type you would set your threshold to 2 31 or you could set it to 2 32 but it depends on where and how you are storing the overflow to pass over to the next element

10933831

google-chrome	firefox
this works fine for firefox and used to work fine for google-chrome as well

10937266

stores in an int through read the number of chars read and i believe the last 0

10937328

after that i put it in a variable with the post method and the i try to at least echo the array out to ensure that my variable has the choices but it prints this error

10937339
min	max
i would like to get out the values of max med min

10937355
onfocus	onblur
you should implement onfocus and onblur like below

10937406
min	max
by add here i mean make sure this state is tracked and update max min as needed if it was not tracked .

10937406
min	max
note with a modest modification you can figure out not only what the max and min are but exactly how many solutions there are.

10937415
factors	matrix
this returns a 3 x 3 matrix of dataframes with their loss column multiplied by the desired factors

10937420
width	height
you need to make the width and height of the button

10937442
min	max
you should define a class or struct with max med and min as properties and initialize a list of its instances from your method

10937445
folder	directory
so i can use applescript to say when a file is dropped into this desktop folder create a temp directory move the file there and the do other stuff

while it s technically possible to mix get and post forms by appending a querystring to the url in your form s action attribute i doubt thats what you re trying to do here

10937630
hide	show
please note that it s always css what hide your element or show your background etc

10937634
post	get
you can get the command output by the way above as this post said

10937640
for-loop	loops
then use a for-in loops or a simple for-loop to change the background for all of them

10937645
min	max
i usually use simple linear search to find the min max in a list which for me seems to be simple and adequately optimal

10937647
min	max
unfortunately i don t know how to get max med and min returned in separate entries in a list within the linq query

10937647
min	max
what you can do though is have your linq query put min med and max into a list object and then return the first row

10937647
min	max
- your end tags for min max and med are formatted incorrectly the should be before the name not after

10937677
hide	show
hide asp.net button by default display none and show it if gps api is available

10937685
bibtex	latex
it sorts out whether running of pdflatex latex bibtex makeindex etc

10937758
min	max
as with many problems there are multiple ways to solve it and there are also multiple ways to obtain the min max of a list

10937758
min	max
conceptually i would say that linear search is better when you only want the min or max of a list as the problem does not call for sorting

10937760
post	get
i pass this value from one page to another and get the value using post method inside a for-loop as follows

10937790
int	chars
the problem is that you start with a simple chars and then you need to print it so you use printf then perhaps a sprintf to parse it because std stream would be a pain for just one int to string

10937799
width	height
with place you specify the exact x y location and exact width height for a widget

10937799
width	height
it has some nice features such as being able to use either absolute or relative coordinates for example you can place a widget at 10 10 or at 50 of the widgets width or height

10937867

10937930
mouse	keyboard
this allows the leonardo to appear to a connected computer as a mouse and keyboard in addition to a virtual cdc serial com port

10938022
post	get
to do this i ve set up a django server to handle the data i m using javascript to get the click tap position send that via post data to the server then draw it using processing.js my boss is big on processing and this is really a test for interactivity with processing on a big screen via cellphones etc

10938037
stdout	stderr
in case you want a variable you can redirect stderr to stdout and assign the command output to a variable

10938039
mouse	keyboard
you re posting 10 times that many messages to the queue and not handling any before you stop so even if the queue was completely empty before you started which is unlikely since you re probably triggering this functionality from keyboard or mouse input you d only get one-tenth the messages

10938072
division	modulo
where is the modulo and is integer division

10938074
stdout	stderr
cp doesn t normally output anything though this would capture stdout and stderr

10938090

10938112
portrait	landscape
it s not perfect - still checking why it draws over the right boundary of the cell in portrait and does not scale in landscape when i rotate the device.

10938127
unsigned	short
in your case either as an unsigned short or a

10938127
unsigned	short
then you interpret it as an unsigned short

10938127
unsigned	short
which means that when your code looks at an unsigned short it thinks 0x03 is the least-significant byte

10938127
unsigned	short
so your 2-byte unsigned short is interpreted as 0x0203

10938130
min	max	range	min	range	max
it takes in two arguments a max number and a min number and spits out a random integer within that range including both ends

10938130

10938209
move	drag
this happens when you drag object to end of right side then drag another object to right side it can move beyond the div

10938218
post	put
the best alternative in this situation is to force link_to to put or post

10938245
getter	setter
atomic does not universally mean multithread safe. it just means that the when you use the getter then you will get an extra retain autorelease pair on it so it can t vanish during your runloop and it ll be synchronized with the setter so that you can t get half-an-object if setting and getting collide

10938245
getter	setter
this is all only true if you use the getter and setter

10938255
sqoop	hadoop
hadoop is absolutely suitable for such big data..you can use it with hbase that allows us to expand to millions of rows and billions of columns and provides great horizontal scalability as well..it is suitable for real time random read write access..on the other hand hive is good for batch processing so you can run hive jobs in back ground for other tasks..we should not mistake hadoop as an alternative to traditional rdbmss but it really helpful in dealing with huge data sets..you can use another apache project sqoop that allows us to import our data form existing databases to hadoop cluster without much pain

10938287
google-chrome	firefox
on a regular browser such as google-chrome firefox and ie it works fine

10938306
int	chars
basically if i read the standard right there s no guarantee that 0 will represent the int 0x30 yet u8 0 must represent the chars sequence 0x30 0x00

10938336

turns out that the only place httpd.h s max and min macros get used is in httpd.cpp so i just moved those #defines into httpd.cpp where they really should have been in the first place

10938812
min	max
at any rate the current mjpg-streamer code has #ifndef guards around max and min and also has them in a separate utils.h file here that just gets included in httpd.c here not httpd.h

10939417
int	chars
the main problem is that the int bytes within that file do not actually map to meaningful text chars so where the mapping fails to render portions of the alphabet it will render whatever your text encoding dictates which looks to me like a lot of garbage

10939444
disk	ram
if you do have gazillions of rows you probably work for a big company that can spring for a bigger mysql server with fast disk and multiple gigabytes of ram

10939463
hash	md5
this is because you hash the password in md5 and that changes the password variable to a 32 characters string

10939468
hash	md5
when you send the password in the md5 function that function actually creates a 32 character hexadecimal number hash and so your checking is useless

addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition
this scale should permit addition and subtraction operator+ ... but not multiplication

if you use the typical project layout where the project is in a folder under the solution folder these properties will be configured so that the two directory are different

10941029
gif	png
while png is definitely better that gif occasionally there is a use case for needing to stay in gif format

10941029
gif	png
with gif or 8-bit png you have to address the problem of quantization

i m going to create a for-loop and add to a list each time it loops until the page is all read and then add them to the .mp3

the problem with timed functions triggered by settimeout and setinterval is that the browser attempts to execute the functions when the time is due but this actually happens only if it s idle

10941587
backbone.js	zepto
i d recommend backbone.js and zepto for an html-based app

10941587
backbone.js	zepto
you can use zepto for css3-based animation transitions and events while backbone.js helps you organize your code in a sane way

10941587
backbone.js	zepto
for a more traditional business-y app i think zepto backbone.js is perfectly viable

10941976
children	parent
parent views are in charge of initializing rendering hiding showing and or destroying their children as the app requires

10941976
children	parent
often parent maintain references to children but sometimes it is unnecessary more on this below

10941976
children	parent
views essentially have 3 functions 1 render themselves and their children when told to do so by their parent or in response to events or in the case of a root-level view when initialized by a router or a main function etc. 2 respond to ui events from dom elements within their el but not within the el of any child view by updating models or collections or triggering custom backbone events and 3 observe and respond to backbone model collection etc. events that require something to be rendered or changed within their el but not within the el of any child view. one sometimes-useful trick is that child views can trigger events on themselves this.trigger customevent that parent views can observe childview.on customevent this.handler this

10941976
children	parent
as a general principle views should be blissfully unaware of each other with the exception of parent minding their children when it makes sense

10942090
width	height
what i am trying to do is add a relative layout to a linear layout and i can do that just fine the problem is that i can only set the height and the width of the relative layout and can t align it below any views in the linear layout

10942108
nowjs	node.js
node.js still responds fine but nowjs stops responding

10942108
nowjs	node.js
i think that nowjs which is an abstraction layer on top of socket.io creates it s own server along side my node.js server

10942108

10942822
lxml	html5lib	lxml	beautifulsoup	html5lib	beautifulsoup
beautifulsoup can deal with some sloppiness on its own and if it can t it will give an obvious error about malformed html or something of the sort and that would be an indication to install html5lib or lxml

express	node.js
now it would be a good idea to do let node.js or express handle chat function

10950628
put	get
or you can put it in a static class somewhere if you need to get to it from multiple files

10950639
range	max
i have several different numbers in a group that range in sizes and would like to calculate which group the numbers should go in based on the max size the group can be

10950714
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
i used objectinputstream and objectoutputstream and it worked fine

10950765
portrait	landscape
if the parent view controller of the view you want to force into landscape mode is portrait only you ll have to create a new new navigation controller

10950851
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
note after doing some benchmarks i found that sorteddictionary is faster for removal but sortedlist is faster for adding and indexing by key

10950928
width	height
if these are grids you can fake it 99.9 of the way with two border s which have their width set to the cornerradius and bind their height to the actualheight of the top right panel

10950967
equals	compareto
use compareto bigdecimal.zero instead of equals

10951020
button	checkbox
i m creating checkbox and button dynamically

10951034
int	chars
that way someone who reads your code knows exactly what you mean printing a chars as an int without having to look up the definition of a custom function

10951035
capistrano	rvm
my setup is using multi stages and is using the rvm capistrano plugin

10951053
mouse	keyboard
you would have to somehow intermingle drawing with the chaos that is a monkey bashing on screen keyboard mouse while effectively maintaing a notion of transactional integrity

10951101
ienumerable	ienumerator
using visual studio 2012 i was able to create async versions of ienumerator and ienumerable

10951126
min	max	minimum	max
roughly speaking your code will appear to work if the uninitialized variables min and max just so happen to hold values that compare in between the actual minimum and maximum values encountered in test

10951136
nunit	mstest
my impression is that pex is a supplement to traditional testing frameworks like mstest or nunit rather than a competing framework

10951150
post	put
from another post here i received the suggestion to put a toolbar there since the navbar only allows one left bar item

10951168
equals	compareto
alternatively i think it is worth mentioning that the behavior of equals and compareto methods in the class bigdecimal are not consistent with each other

10951183
hash	md5
now it s 32 chars like an md5 hash which this also works with

10951212
put	get	onresume	onpause
create a broadcastreceiver in your activity register it inside the onresume of your activity and unregister it in onpause .after completing the network update create an intent put in all the data that you want to send to your activity and fire it.if your activity is in foreground then only it will receive this intent.from onreceive of broadcasereceiver in your activity you can get all the data and then update the ui

10951233
google-chrome	firefox
it seems to work in ie8+ and firefox but google-chrome displays it wrong maybe it s right who knows

10951233
google-chrome	firefox
i am not sure if ie firefox are masking an issue and if google-chrome is being honest with me

10951238
for-loop	loops
in the i for-loop it seems work but only in j loops it only write once

10951241
installation	upgrade
i m trying to upgrade a freetype installation from 2.2.1 to 2.4.9

10951267
versioning	upgrade
the code used to work fine in 5.3.8 versioning but after upgrade to 5.3.13 it stopped working

10951271
keydown	keyup
it s worth pointing out that having more keydown events than keyup events is actually expected behavior when you hold a key down the os reports that as multiple keydown s one for each time that a character would be inserted in a normal text input though this happens even under mac os 10.7 with its default key-holding behavior

10951295
distance	polygons
in the case of convex polygons d a b is the maximum of the distance from vertices of a to any point in b

10951295
distance	polygons
therefore the hausdorff distance is not too hard to calculate if you can calculate the distance from an arbitrary point to a convex polygons

10951295
distance	polygons
to calculate the distance from a point to a convex polygons you first have to test whether the point is inside the polygons if so the distance is 0 and then if it is not find the minimum distance to any of the bounding line segments

10951295
distance	polygons
the result i am trying to prove is that in calculating d a b with both polygons and b convex it suffices to find the distance from the vertices of a to b

10951295
distance	polygons
this distance is 0 only if a and b are the same polygons in which case it is clear that we achieve that distance at a vertex of a

10951295
distance	polygons
that is why it sufficed to find the maximum of the distance from the vertices of the polygons to the other polygons

10951305
google-chrome	firefox
if you are testing your form out on firefox or google-chrome i would suggest using firebug or developer tools to see the data that is passed to the server

10951337
hash	md5
in both cases the size of the zip files were exactly the same however the hash md5 were different

10951375
sikuli	selenium
or selenium combined with sikuli to have even more power.

10951388
versioning	upgrade
my guess is it was just working in the earlier php versioning but broke after the upgrade

10951398
google-chrome	firefox
everything works great in google-chrome firefox ie7 8 9 and kindle but android does not seem to respect a particular z-index on a div that we create dynamically

10951398
put	get
i ve tried numerous things to get this menu to show on top of the modal dialog such as asking for the z-index after the menu is displayed which is correct the highest z-index of all absolute items assigning a new higher z-index after it is displayed moving the order of the divs around etc and nothing seems to put it on top of the dialog as it does in all other browsers

10951419
unsigned	short
short unsigned short

10951432
implements	extends
then for any other class that you would need to add more fields you would create a class and have it extends your abstract class so now it is a jpanel with all common fields already created and laid out and implements an interface with your extra fields

10951439
hash	salt
i guess you could store this in two database on two servers and use multiple server with salt and hash but the correct and accepted way is simply to encode using an algorythm like i said and compare

10951444
int	double	int	chars
simple types bool byte chars short int long float and double

10951475
versioning	upgrade
the plugin can have a url that points to the most recent versioning and screwturn can check this but there are time-delays involved and i ve found it just easier to manually upgrade each time

10951524
google-chrome	safari
it works fine on google-chrome and safari but i can t make it work on safari mobile

10951537
hash	salt
the password is â saltedâ concatenated with the salt that is stored for the user then that salt string is hash and verified with the users hash password in the database

10951537
hash	salt
this almost certainly guarantees unique hash and makes the hash table of passwords much harder to reverse engineer back into logical passwords because the output of the hash function relies on also knowing the custom salt assigned for each user

10951537
hash	salt
if anyone knows why linkedin doesnt salt their hash i would love to hear from you

10951622
int	double
one of long long and double is bigger than 3 int and a multiple of 8

10951673
coalesce	isnull
since you are assuming a row without an amount is to be summed as zero then you can just filter out rows without the amount and don t worry about the isnull or coalesce

10951714
cruisecontrol	teamcity
currently pushing the code to each environment is a manual process wondering how something like cruisecontrol or teamcity could streamline this process

10951738
cgpoint	cgsize	cgpoint	cgrect	cgsize	cgrect
as for the accessing the struct s internal vars cgpoint and cgsize to be exact just use regular old dot notation after storing the frame into a cgrect var like so

10951740
salt	md5
now i ve learned that md5 is not the safest to use however what i think can be done to be safe is salt it i know this is nothing new

10951740
salt	md5
then after successfully putting the information in database i create the password that is going to be stored in auth table this way the password is not the md5 of the password the user enters rather its the md5 of the salt and the password user enters

10951740
hash	md5
and the decrypting websites don t actually decrypt the md5 they just have the md5 hash of millions of strings

10951757
post	get
you should try debug this- request to see the results of passing the data with get or better yet use a post and check out this- request- data cakephp 2 or this- data cakephp 1.3

10951785
awt	swing
i just took a peak and saw a bunch of swing and awt classes for example

10951785

tomcat is hosting the same on https ssl already configured and running fine

10951851
min	max
to get that you can go through the quarter of the perimiter of your disk and caclulate the min max distances as appropriate to your needs

10951868
svg	vml
this works fine but of course in ie8 raphael uses vml instead of svg and this solution fails

10951870
hex	binary
you have to convert the binary data to hex or base64 or something like that and embed that in the document

10951923
hide	show
of course in real use you d wrap up hide most of the ugliness i ve show here

10951961
cpu	hyperthreading
because of the cost of cpu cache synchronization between cores it makes sense to limit your http worker threads to the physical cpu cores ignoring hyperthreading

10952041
children	parent
that is to say for each parent produce children then move on to next parent etc

10952058
google-chrome	firefox
browsers tested google-chrome ie 8 firefox 12 under windows...this is all i have access to atm

10952078
cldc	midp
you must pay attention to cldc and midp versions and which classes they bring

10952081
width	margin
try giving the width of your progress bar 515px and remove the right margin of your red box

10952149
inherited	properties
yeah the idea with mvc is to keep things decoupled in your case you re ultimately smashing everything into one chain of inherited where you ll end up with one type of object that inherited all the properties from another object that inherited all the properties from another object so you ll have an instance of this thing that represents everything which is why this isn t a great pattern to go with

10952149
mouse	keyboard
control being the modification of the model in this case it would probably also be where you register listeners for user events keyboard mouse whatever

10952159
gif	png
to determine if an imagine is jpeg png or gif you can use either though i would generally go with imagetype

10952173
superclass	subclassing
you want that whenever a subclassing object is created the subclassing class object should be passed to the superclass

10952210
for-loop	arrays
instead of writing out 3 system functions i am trying to learn how to pass a string arrays that holds these commands to the system function or a similar function exec in a for-loop

10952213
hash	md5
my solution that i believe will work is to do an md5 hash on the userid field which is unique ...which would should guarantee a unique value in that field

10952213
hash	md5
what is the best way to get a unique value in the employeenum field possibly based on an md5 hash of the userid field on all the rows in which a value isn t already present

10952281
mouse	keyboard
this allows you to type away as normal but as soon as you select anything using mouse or keyboard you ll see you can extend the selection across divs as usual

10952282
google-chrome	safari
it also works perfectly fine on google-chrome safari and ie with and without the cdn

10952284
ftell	fread
you d be better off using an fread into a fixed size buffer type solution or ftell then file and read it all in at once for best efficiency and then do your reading off the buffer

10952284
realloc	malloc
not to mention all the overhead of malloc and realloc they do add up

10952288
onclick	onchange
once within the onclick function of the drop down list the other within the change_fruit_color that s called via the onchange event in the radio button box

10952311
cos	sin
values of sin a and cos a are rational numbers only for particular angles see so you can t store values of sin a or cos a as decimals without losing precision

10952311
cos	sin
this defeats the purpose of converting sin and cos values to decimal and having built-in functions that return sin and cos values as decimals

10952341
post	get
i followed another post to get it set up

10952361
hide	show
the issue is that when we use chosen it hide the original select element and renders its own dropdown instead and when we focus out the validation isn t called and also when the validation message is show it is show with the original select element so positioning of the error isnt also correct

10952391
inherited	properties
create a base class from which your pages inherited and add properties to the base class

10952393
addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	division	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction
basic order of operations from math is multiplication division then addition subtraction

10952411
division	subtract	division	multiplication	subtract	add
bodmas brackets orders division multiplication add subtract

10952436
addition	multiplication
php will perform the multiplication first and then the addition

10952453
folder	directory
the environmental variables should point to the installation directory of each program respectively and their corresponding bin folder should be added to the path

10952461
g++	gcc
if a static library exists you can use g++ -static -l somelib -o myapp myapp.cpp to tell gcc to link statically

10952466
google-chrome	firefox
the above code is working for me in ie9 google-chrome 19.0.1084.52 m and firefox 12

10952480
tex	mathjax
original tex formatting replaced with ascii art i tried to get mathjax to render the tex for me but it wasn t working

10952482
post	get
however both the get and post versions of this page are wrapped by the same lift-generated form which has its action set to the same snippet in both cases

10952489
pull	push
if i just set up a normal build it will pull the most recent source code and use that to push to the production server

10952496
inherited	subclassing
that s because circle is a subclassing of shape and it would mean that all the members of shape will be inherited by circle and in some cases because you re using c# and overriding the members isn t always the rule like in java overridden

10952497
width	height
to make the worksheet cells automatically adjust themselves to the best height and width for their content

10952498
post	put	post	get	put	get
put an object get and object post an object

post	get
on further investigation with wireshark i realized that this piece of code is making a http post request instead of get from behind and hence the conneciton refused

10952544
hash	salt
most hash algorithms are designed to be fast but this makes it easier to create rainbow tables for every salt

10952544
hash	salt
this salt has to be stored together with the hash but is not secret can be plain text

10952544
hash	md5
it is not for high security sites only and using it can be as easy as using an md5 hash

10952548
boyer-moore	rabin-karp
i am not sure precisely what adobe is using but i would guess that it was some known fast string matching algorithm perhaps rabin-karp boyer-moore or kmp probably run in parallel across all the document pages at once

express	node.js
i recently started working with node.js + express + mongodb

10952579
src	attr
i am stuck as to how fade in and out images when changing the attr src using jquery and json

10952691
onclick	onchange
changing onchange to onclick is not a solution because i use it with jquery-mobile and it wraps the inputs with label so the label is getting clicked not the input

10952703
folder	directory
the problem is i also have sub directory in that folder and i want to execute those reg files as well

10952749
jar	war
downloaded it to my machine and unpackaged the war file eclipse adds a bunch of boilerplate and structuring and i have no confidence in my ability to further complicate it with new tools like ant or something to do the compiling i m very comfortable with javac javah and jar thank you very much

10952752
int	double
in regex the metacharacter d is used to represent an int but to represent it in a java code as a regex one would have to use d because of the double parsing performed on them

10952855
uiview	subviews
apple doc for uiview property subviews

10952939
post	get
i ve search for other ideas and one of them is to get a timestamp of when the user last logged in but i actually need to keep track of the post they ve seen as opposed to post that have happened since they last logged in

10952944
post	get
how can i get the video to show in the post

10953028
onkeyup	onkeydown
you could then attach this function the controls change onkeyup or onkeydown event so that if the length of the password field was less than what you want it to be it will hide the label that contains the message that the strength has not been met

10953028
onkeyup	onkeydown	onchange	onkeydown	onchange	onkeyup
you would probably want to add the onchange onkeyup or onkeydown event to your control like so code behind

10953028
onchange	onkeydown
additionally i was having some problems with onchange in chrome so opted for onkeydown instead as adriano pointed out above

10953073

to get the order on the server side assuming you re using php you can send items_order as as a post variable and parse it

10953201
int	chars
i understand that if the array was a chars array there would be bank conflicts but im not entirely sure what happens if its an int array

10953257
width	height
just add the following class to your html and specify your width and height

10953272
puts	gets
i ve set up a test program that puts and gets items in at different varying speeds of different number of items and it seems fine but i ve seen evidence of a getter blocking on .get with items still in the queue so i m lead to believe there is a problem

10953294
folder	directory
next you are parsing the directory to get the index of the file in the folder

10953310
for-loop	loops
but try to reduce the scope of the variable if it is needed only in the for-loop then declare it inside loops itself

10953311
jpa	javax.persistence
jpa annotations are in the javax.persistence

to get the behavior i was looking for i removed that attribute from the gridview and instead added an onclientclick attribute to the submit button for my search form

10953627
versioning	upgrade
i recently upgrade my publisher subscriber solution to nservicebus versioning 3.2.2 using nuget

same results in android and ios but works fine in both google-chrome firefox and safari on the desktop

10953732
strncmp	strcmp
to do compare strings you can use strcmp strncmp or better yet use string.compare

10953740

it seems that is special cased to avoid this kind of warning since calloc free etc

10953766
multiplying	add
now add 1 to value y 6 and then multiplying with eax

10954226
jobs	cron
if you re worried about 2 instances running the same cron jobs i would suggest disabling the cron process in the ami then edit them to run after the instance is created

10954226
jobs	cron
if it s too late and the cron jobs are already in the original ami you ll probably want to spawn the new one at a time between when the jobs run so you have enough time to log into the 2nd machine and turn them off before they run again

10954253
width	height
i know the width and height of textview and font size also now i just want to know the number of characters that can show this textview

10954553
gridview	radiobuttonlist
i have a few reasons that i need this to happen but suffice it to say that when i use the event handler for the radiobuttonlist the sender object returns as just the radiobuttonlist and i need more information from the gridview because that s how i can uniquely identify which record my radiobuttonlist is tied to

10954584

int	chars
if i write a chars 4 or chars array 4 0 to stringstream and then read it out to int i i don t get back the 4

10954724
folder	directory
the answer depends on several things how many cpus the machine running the client program has whether the log-checking-per-server is getting right into the log folder on each server or is checking every directory on each server and if so how big the file system is on the servers and how deep the folder go in what is probably recursion through directory.getdirectories in your snip of code

my suggestion would be to create a programmatic proxy using the cmd line tool wsdl.exe or svcutil.exe to create the .cs or .vb proxy that you could then add to the solution

10955025
int	boolean
java is strongly-typed an int isn t a boolean and a boolean isn t an int

10955025

10955267
int	chars
i d also be interested in hearing if there are perl built-in functions that could accept a list array of int specifying chars positions and return an array containing the split sections

10955295
for-loop	loops
what i would do is factor out all the code that does not depend on n into another function which hopefully is the entire body of your for-loop and then have both your templated and non-templated versions call that within their loops

10955296
hide	show
i ll be outputting this with php attaching the ip list with that count to the query count display click to show hide a modal with the info populated

10955376

10955644
hash	md5
i m writing a little utility in cocoa to compute md5 sha-1 and other hash functions of a file

10955644
hash	md5
if understand correctly at least the md5 algorithm can be realized in such a way that i ll only need to load small portions of the file at the same time â which seems like a good idea because i wouldn t want to occupy all the user s ram and then some just to compute hash of a 10-gb archive

10955685
mergesort	in-place	quicksort	mergesort
parallelizing mergesort is simpler than quicksort in-place

10955685
mergesort	in-place	quicksort	mergesort
if not using the in-place then the space complexity for quicksort is o n which is the same are mergesort

10955685
quicksort	mergesort
the other general time to use mergesort over quicksort is if the data is very similar that is not close to being uniform

10955697

i want to get the images that members of a facebook page post

10955839
aggregate-functions	sum
a group by clause without any aggregate-functions in the select clause sum count avg etc. doesn t make sense

on screen it looks like this and as you get closer to the character limit the text gradually turns redder and once the micropost is overlimit the post button disables finishing like so

10955864
ember.js	backbone.js
or would it be better to continue to use mongo for the rest of the app and rely on client side js backbone.js ember.js to handle view updates etc

10955947

map arraylist mymap new linkedhashmap arraylist

10955956
children	parent
parent are shown with a purple background and children with a yellow background

10955956

but keep this in mind in order tickinterval to work you have to provide at least one of the min or max values

10956063
width	height
resize each large image to the desired height of the sprite sheet scale the width to maintain aspect ratio

10956077
maven	pom.xml
you are going against a maven principle which is that a pom.xml supposedly represents a self contained project generating a stable artifact avoid parametric builds that cannot be reproduced easily

10956077
maven-install-plugin	pom.xml
if that s really what you want i would use maven-install-plugin as a lifecycle step and specifically install-file and parameterized that rather than try to parameterize the artifactid of the pom.xml itself

10956148
macports	homebrew
you can get it at but it s also available from homebrew or macports

integer	fractions
note that the comparison compares the sequence number to the total of rows times that fractions cast back to an integer

10956300
sorting	grouping
i know these functions are features in r as well but i am not sure how to write the code to solve this particular grouping and sorting problem

10956305
public	protected
one approach would be to expose this filed through protected or public property in baslik.cs

10956323
width	height
the control has a stackpanel with the name canvas and height and width set to 400

10956335
bash	zsh
i have virtualenv installed and it works fine with bash and zsh

10956336
nswindow	nspanel
i think what you really should do is use an nspanel a floating palette -- a special kind of nswindow that will do exactly what you want in a way that s consistent with the os rather than trying to fight intended behavior

10956345
rss	feed
there are many different rss feed but a tab bar changes the views dictating which rss feed is viewed

10956368

it works on all other browsers google-chrome firefox safari and even ie 7 and 8

10956489
authorization	access-control
setting appropriate access-control headers to only allow verified domains can alleviate this risk. instead we create a disposable hash based on the timestamp so that mydomain.com can verify the authorization

10956490
folder	directory
it is trying to create your temporary directory with the prefix which if you do you ll see is var folder .

10956512

this is covered extensively in so so i apologize in advance ...however i ve gone through the post and can t get this to work

10956515
width	height
i want to decrease an 480 x 480 bitmap image size to 30 x 30 pixel size but keeping the whole height and width intact

10956515
width	height
i do not want to scale or use height width property

10956515
width	height
let me put in more simple way - i am trying to reduce pixels in an bitmap image from 480 x 480 to 30 x 30 the height and width remain same and i expect some amount of distortion after converting image to 30 x 30

10956515
width	height
i did scaling but it reduces width and height if i again increase width and height it just regains normal pixels

10956541
filtering	grouping
scheme and python also have a reduce function that s often grouping with map and filtering

10956546
calloc	malloc
malloc does not have provisions for dimension info calloc - explicitly 1d

google-chrome	firefox
i am dynamically adding borders to a table with this code on jsfiddle and it works in firefox and google-chrome but doesn t work or throw any errors in ie8

10956574
firefox	safari
i ve tested this in safari 5.1.7 and firefox 12 both on osx

10956586
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
but you will have loops the outer arrays in order to get it to work which would be better done with a for-loop so you reference both at once

10956613
maven	pom.xml
below is part of a very simple pom.xml that uses the maven execution plugin to auto-deploy to glassfish as a function of the build

10956622
width	height
you can use a snoop for wpf equivelent for silverlight silverlight spy to examine the visual tree and see which element s increase the width height vs the inner control or even if that control has the wrong settings due to an unexpected binding

10956636
width	height
currently in order to make the icon fit its parent container its width and height need to be explicitly defined and match the width and height of the parent container

10956636
width	height
if i change the width and height of the parent container i need to change the background-position sizes as well

10956656
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and safari both use webkit as well

10956707
int	chars
gives back the ascii int representation of the i th chars

10956708
webkit	gecko
in quirks mode gecko webkit when no dtd is declared the webpage is rendered fine

10956797
post	get
this led to further questions in a follow up post an issue i have not resolved related to my get element id on hover or mouseover

10956812
expander	grid
easiest would be to have expander in the main crud s grid

10956822
google-chrome	firefox
this works in ie and google-chrome but not in firefox

10956830
implements	extends
to implements this extends scrollview and then override the onscrollchanged method inherited from view

10956849
flatmap	concatmap
in addition to that the bind operation on lists concatmap flatmap only looks at one element at a time and offers no way of reusing the result of previous steps

10956867
nsstring	nsdata
property lists do not store colors and apple recommends you store them as nsdata not as nsstring you should probably do the same

10956878
versioning	upgrade
update git repo add tagged commit and upgrade build versioning

10956898
concave	convex
finally something to remember is that box2d can only work with convex shapes not concave

10956907
width	height
if you re wondering why i am actually the person who wrote the code is looping through all the w it s because i think w has the biggest width and height in the entire character set so the person who wrote the code is trying to guess the maximum area needed

10956916
int	chars
the assignment given by our teacher was to create a program that asked for asked for two int x and y and one chars z

10956916
multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract	subtract	add
the letter entered for z could be a and it would add the two integers s would subtract them m multiplying and d divide

10956920
median	minimum
the first thing i would do is to use weiszfeld s algorithm without rigidity constraints to find geometric median of individual points define lagrange multipliers corresponding to deviations of edges of the object from expected values and use gradient descent to find a constrained local minimum

10956989
salt	md5	hash	salt	hash	md5

xmlserial unit object and record serializable and deserialization to xml from robert love

10957074
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
safari firefox and google-chrome

10957096
hash	salt
so this is the point even if you change the salt after every login and do some weird re-hashing of the password it changes nothing because as soon as an attacker gets the database he has both hash and salt if it s stored there together which is necessary if you always use a different salt for each user which is something you should do

10957116
subtraction	addition
edit also if anyone has any tips for to addition subtraction methods i would be grateful

10957118
children	parent
the reason for this is that android creates a new canvas or reuses the old one depending on how your parent and children are rendered and where in the cycle of processing it is being called

10957137
for-loop	arrays
i ve read elsewhere how inefficient a for-loop is compared to other methods as for example in copying an arrays

10957157
post	get
the virtual machine s application accepts post get methods for an end-point

10957157
post	get
the problem is when i try to access it from the other application local machine deploy with a jquery post get i get the following

10957220
jar	war
so essentially i am using maven to organize my project in the same way i have always done but i am getting an error in catalina.out telling me that it cannot find the stringutils class in com.mysql.jdbc even though i can see that the jar is in the war classpath

10957244
opera	google-chrome
there may be user-specific content login buttons for some users a personal greeting for others advertising browser-specific content css3 for google-chrome css2 for opera a drive-by-download-exploit for ie6 users

10957279
floating-point	integer
a - a floating-point value to be rounded to an integer

10957298
getter	setter
traditionally a bean had properties defined as a getter and or setter

10957366
post	get
am i supposed to submit the authtoken via get post variables each time i want to communicate with the api

10957394
for-loop	arrays
if you need to create those arrays a lot of times and they are very big instead of continuously iterating in a for-loop you could create all the arrays once and then copy them

10957421
mongoid	mongomapper
mongo and rails integration with mongoid mongomapper is pretty good

10957452
salt	md5	hash	salt	hash	md5
suppose you have a database that contains password hash for the n users of your site and for each user you have salt si and hash hi where hi was computed with some algorithm such as sha1 or md5

10957452
hash	salt	scrypt	salt
for each user you first create a new random salt value s i and then compute a new hash h i using the formula scrypt s i hi and store the new salt and hash in the database

10957452
hash	salt
so you are left with two salt values and a new hash

10957452
salt	md5	hash	salt	hash	md5	scrypt	salt	scrypt	md5
when user i logs in and presents password p you use your old weak hash algorithm let s suppose it was md5 salt password to compute a hash for comparison as follows scrypt s i md5 si p and compare that with the h i stored in the database

10957452
hash	salt	scrypt	salt
once the user has logged in successfully with password p you can completely eliminate any trace of the old weak hash by choosing a new random salt value s i and computing scrypt s i p and storing that in the database

10957475
portrait	landscape
you should create separate layout for landscape and portrait mode.see this

10957491
post	get
also if i just try what is generated as the default i.e get sessions new instead of post or post_via_redirect without trying to test a username and password it works fine

10957527
queue	fifo
mq is priority based queue not fifo

10957591
httprequest	httpresponse
asp.net simply exposes httpresponse httprequest to ihttphandlers which really the most control it allows

10957592
switching	screens
if you don t want to switching to using a different layout depending on screens orientation you could do the following

10957681
folder	directory
look into copying the file you wrote to the first directory to the second folder

10957701
width	height
resizing other elements say by modifying the width or height of an img element using script will not raise a resize event

10957720
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
window elements in firefox opera google-chrome and safari

10957727
children	parent
finally a common case of circular referencing is bidirectional parent-child relationship a parent a ui panel holds a reference to an array of its children and each child buttons tables etc. holds a references to the parent

10957727
children	parent
the parent needs to send motifications to its children to tell them that it became enabled disabled visible or invisible

10957732
ubuntu	linux
my best guess is that you are running a 32-bit x86 linux distribution that does not have support for x86_64 binaries i just tried to disassemble an x86_64 binary on my x86_32 ubuntu 11.04 distro and it worked fine

10957738
express	node.js
now i want to use this library in a website i have build using node.js and express

10957752
google-chrome	firefox
i m sure google-chrome does it differently from ie or firefox and vise versa

10957801
hide	show
it uses hide and show but you could substitute in addclass hide etc

10957806
opera	google-chrome
i expect this to be the solution and it works in google-chrome but in opera the validation is ignored

10957808
ready	each
each time the user deals with a database i open the database and create the required cursor and i call cursor.getcount in another thread to tackle the laziness issue of cursors and make it fully ready for future operations

10957844

they are the standard width and height of the path essentially defining the path s bounds and relating directly to the coordinates you define your path at as specified in the pathshape constructor here

10962526

i just can t understand why the variable i can not increase to 6 when k 0 outside the for-loop and loops will repeat again and again

this is pretty easy to do accidentally since executing adb with any command will launchd the daemons if it isn t already started

10963589
daemons	launchd
using the root user to manually launchd the daemons is fine as workaround but tools like eclipse that automatically start the service will still attempt to as an unprivileged user which will cause the reported problem

if someone enter a real campus in the url but put a get method with a wrong campus the test will pass but all the information will be wrong

10963704
stdout	stderr
means make filehandle 1 point to wherever filehandle 2 does currently â stuff that would have been written to stdout now goes to stderr

10963704
stdout	stderr
but filehandle 1 isn t affected at all so stuff written to stdout still goes to stderr

10963704
stdout	stderr
the correct thing to do is which will make writes to both stderr and stdout go to errors.txt because the first operation will be open errors.txt and make stderr point to it and the second operation will be make stdout point to where stderr is pointing now

10963958
equals	gethashcode
iequalitycomparer is meant to replace the default implemenation of gethashcode and equals every .net object already has

10963958
equals	gethashcode
if your object is used in dictionaries and hashtables as key you should first to override equals and gethashcode to let the sets dictionaries use the default comparer the one you call equalitycomparere.default for your object which does call equals and gethashcode of your object anyway

10964899
nullpointerexception	runtimeexception	nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception	illegalargumentexception	runtimeexception
so with this order i am making sure the exceptions are caught correctly and they are not tripping over one another if it s a nullpointerexception it enters the first catch if a stringindexoutofboundsexception it enters the second and finally if it is something else that is a runtimeexception or inherits from it like a illegalargumentexception it enters the third catch

10965470
width	font-size
the answer to the question for clarity appears to be a combination of box-sizing and its vendor-previxed variants in order to include the border-width and padding in the defined width of the elements s rather than their width being defined-width + border-width + padding and font-size 0 for the parent element which removes the errant space between the two input elements although the space is technically still there

inherited	properties
instead of adding another yacht properties to your utility class you just need to inherited from leasesubject and it could be contained within the leasesubject properties on utility class

10965542
int	chars
so in the above if i is the int in decimal say 3 then i would want to add 0x03 so this is not the chars given in decimal as 48 + 3

10965805
prepare	pdostatement
prepare is a method of the pdo object and it returns a pdostatement object .

10965811
min	max	range	min	range	max
i want to populate the table into redis in order to complete this kind of query most efficiently given a min value and a max value for each column count the number of rows that are within the given range

10965811
disk	ram
i also tried creating a ram disk and saving the my mongodb database into the ram disk it shortened the query time from 10s to 9s far from acceptable for my real-time application

10965837
google-chrome	firefox
by default google-chrome displays the text using left alignment whereas firefox displays the text using center alignment

10965837

in the interface builder connect the button to the view controller for both the ibaction and iboutlet

10965942
width	height
i don t think you ll be able to change the width or height of a chart once it s rendered because it uses an iframe which you won t have access to although you could re-draw the chart if the page width height changes

10965942
width	height
below is is code i use to generate a chart based on it s containing div s width and or height

10965942
width	height

instead draw in the paintcomponent graphics g method of a jpanel or other jcomponent and then add that jpanel to the japplet s contentpane

10966045
hid	keyboard
this tells me that your scanner is programmed for keyboard emulation mode sometimes called hid mode

10966063
implements	extends
let s assume that it is called addzone . the tab3 class should not implements onclicklistener and should extends view not viewgroup as above

10966070
public	protected
to allow subtypes of non-serializable classes to be serialized the subtype may assume responsibility for saving and restoring the state of the supertype s public protected and if accessible package fields

10966076
getter	setter
second it isn t save to access member fields directly always use setter and getter even within the class functions this makes the code much more maintainable

10966088
internationalization	localization
if you are mixing data with different implied code pages japanese and chinese in same database or you just want to be forward-looking for internationalization and localization then you want the column to be unicode and use nvarchar data type and that s perfectly fine

10966109
knitr	latex
i often have a main r markdown file or knitr latex file where i source some other r file for data processing

10966132
oncreate	onnewintent
i am not sure where does it points to but the outcome is that when the user authorize my twitter app and return to the android app the activity will be started all over and called oncreate instead of onresume or onnewintent

10966132
post	get
if i do not start the activity as a child but a new activity everything is fine.i can get back to onnewintent and successfully post tweets

10966133
qtcpsocket	qiodevice
i think qiodevice which is a parent for qtcpsocket has a signal named readyread which gives you the signal when new data are available

10966188
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
i have an objectoutputstream and objectinputstream that is created when i make the connection however i am not sure how to pass it into the new class when i try to open one up

10966188
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
if i do the new objectoutputstream and objectinputstream like i did in startup i will create a new connection to the server

10966290
papyrus	objectaid
if you re a designer then papyrus is your best choice it s very advanced and full of features but if you just want to sketch out some uml diagrams and easy installation then objectaid is pretty cool and it doesn t require any plugins i just installed it over eclipse-java ee and works great

10966290
hide	show
to show the class elements variables functions etc right click on any class - filters - show hide contents voila

10966290
post	get
and will get back to this post again when i try other free tools

10966326
put	get
after you get the helper class created you have to put your db into the assets folder

10966347
entities	entitymanager
since entitymanager closed the entities in b s a list is out of date which means when a update itself b doesn t know a updated

10966349
dictionary	map
i have tried the json serde that amazon provides for emr instance and works great if you need to address map json dictionary fields to columns

10966379
min	max
here is another solution which uses 2 helper functions to calculate for each node the min and max value in the subtree using the helper function minvalue and maxvalue

10966397
geany	gedit
i really don t want to have to pull in gtk+3 to get the current gedit from the repos arch linux. currently i m using geany for all of my text editing needs however geany is a bit heavy for editing config files

10966397
vim	emacs
i could configure emacs or vim or something but that seems to me to be more of a hack then a proper solution

10966401
getter	setter
if your exposed api consists of getter setter then you can intercept an unknown method call with an autoload method

10966441
hash	md5
i have no experience in database but i ve heard of md5 sha256 and i was thinking of writing the hash or encrypted password to a text file and then reading it but i am not sure if this is safe

10966446
hash	md5
i know that there are libraries for md5 hash but i am trying to learn about how the hash works and eventually hash collision

10966455
width	height
each element has a width and height of 140px which means that each line row can contain 7 elements before they are pushed down to the next line row

10966467
folder	directory
in order to use the zf files you need to preserve the directory structure they use at the very least you need a zend folder with all the zf files in there

10966467
folder	directory
zf folder path should be the path to the folder that the zend directory is in but make sure not to actually include the zend folder in the include path since zend does require_once zend file.php

10966471
pull	push
unfortunately when the book was released it focused mainly on pull mechanisms ajax and its only suggestion for push based mechanism was a long-living ajax session via things like comet

10966504
maven	pom.xml
i downloaded spring mvc + shiro + mybatis + jsr-303 validation example from apache shiro doc page and i want to run it with maven jetty plugin so i open the pom.xml and put things like this

10966518
google-chrome	safari
the error can be seen in google-chrome and also does not work in safari

10966543
apache	nginx
you ll have to run a webserver like nginx or apache

10966606
width	height
remember that when you have padding on both sides then you would have to subtract top and bottom pad to get the remaining height or subtract left and right to get remaining width

10966607
post	get
however by deviating from the rest and the canonical http usage you ll lose some of the features of the protocol such as caching which can be applied for get requests but not for post

10966607
post	get
your example of using two requests post with parameters + get to get the results seems overkill

10966608
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
if using the current google-chrome firefox and safari when switching between

10966609
switching	screens
we swipe right left to switching between multiple screens we have

10966613
int	boolean
each object has specific details like x and y int boolean strings ect

10966613
for-loop	arrays
attached to them block 0 .x block 0 .canwalk block 0 .name and i was wondering if there is an easy way of saving these arrays to a file without having to use a for-loop and save each part

10966643
hide	show
crawlers are apparently not very good with javascript and many users have js disabled anyways so perhaps have the content show by default then hide it with js css hover

10966672
google-chrome	firefox
so it renders the page with a layout engine just like another browser like firefox or google-chrome have

10966687
int	chars
note i only really care about cells within the and the column reference can be an int not an alphabetic chars i ve only done this to easily highlight the problem

10966688
width	height
this works 100 tested for the division itself i just hope that the browser will recognize your embeded pdf as part of the if not you can also adjust the height and width of the division to the same of the pdf to make sure that the link covers the complete area of the pdf

10966740
superclass	subclassing
the fetchedresultscontroller delegate methods are in my superclass and work fine in other subclassing

10966783
swt	swing	awt	swing
java web start jws is the oracle corporation technology used to launch rich client swing awt swt desktop applications directly from a network or internet link

10966865
put	get
then you can use map#put k v and map#get k to put and get values

10966869
google-chrome	safari
when the page loads in google-chrome or apple safari the header content overlaps the content div below the header until i resize the page

10966896
put	get
when i check myxml_xml.item_id 0 .item_size when put in a string var i get medium

10966920
mouseover	mouseenter
you can see from the example that mouseover fires for every child object while mouseenter fires just once

10966939
cout	cin
if you leave out that line and refer to vector string cin and cout by specifying their namespace explicitly with std you wouldn t have encountered this conflict

10966953
viewdidload	viewwillappear
what can you is declare a nsstring property in secondview and you can set value of this property from firstview and then you can set this value to the label in viewwillappear or viewdidload method

10966963
setinterval	clearinterval
i m not 100 sure what the issue is however in order to remove the setinterval you need to make a call to clearinterval

10966973
hash	salt
you d normally use a random generated salt and then store that hash along with the encrypted password

10966973
hash	salt
it doesn t matter that the attacker also gets access to the salt - the purpose of it is to prevent a lookup table to be used thereby forcing the attacker to brute force each hash individually

10966973
hash	salt	crypt	salt	crypt	hash
crypt just stores the salt and hash into a single string along with the algoritm to use

10966994
profiling	benchmarking
to know the exact effect on your program there s no other solution than benchmarking run the program with and without the println calls and measure the time it takes for both versions or use a profiling

10967017
post	get
i have also read this post related to my problem but i couldn t get anything

10967034
post	get
the intention is that knockout prevents server post get and instead calls mykosubmitaction

10967067
uiview	subviews
i want to send a subviews out of my super uiview with animation it works fine but when i tried to change the size during animation any uilabel that i have in my subviews suddenly become too small

10967108
google-chrome	firefox
the only thing you need to do wrt closure s websocket object is change the constructor for the wrapped socket to whatever firefox s websocket is for firefox can t remember what it is but it s not websocket or at least that s what you used to have to do but it works with google-chrome anyway

10967108
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
websockets work with google-chrome firefox opera but not ie but you can use a lib that fixes things to use flash if ie is that important

10967156
google-chrome	firefox
checked both in google-chrome and firefox

10967206
post	get
small edit if you try to use usertransaction as the other post suggests you will get an error because a standard entitymanager that you are probably using uses the so called cmt container managed transactions

10967215
profiling	instrumentation
if that doesn t help profiling using the time profiling in instrumentation

10967222
google-chrome	firefox
all i m interested about them is the way they make web-page live reload in web browser be it google-chrome firefox or whatever from within itself when file changes are written to hard-drive

10967233
int	chars
if you don t mind about storing the leading zero and the format is always 4 chars you can use int and when showing the numbers format them accordingly

10967253
mouseover	mouseout
the problem is that mouseover and mouseout events bubble up and this means that when your cursor enters and exits from elements that are descendants of your button the event listener defined on the button is triggered too

10967253
mouseleave	mouseenter
in internet explorer and now in opera too there are these events mouseenter and mouseleave that behave very similarly but don t bubble up

10967258
hide	show
i am working with jquery and creating show hide lists i need hide all the child list items that follow the 6th child in the ul

10967364
apache	nginx
this works fine with nginx and although i haven t used it in apache - i don t see a reason it shouldn t be possible with it too maybe you ll need some additional apache mod to install

10967376
draggable	droppable
i am trying to use a draggable and droppable plugins of jquery ui

10967381
try-catch	exception-handling
in languages like c++ java c# it can be easily done by having f1 f2 and f3 throw an exception-handling and enclosing the computation in a try-catch block while in languages like haskell we can use monads instead

10967407
primefaces	richfaces
the modal panel is already implemented in richfaces and primefaces libraries

10967409
floating-point	integer
it makes sure 1.0 is a floating-point literal and not an integer one

10967409
floating-point	integer
the result of this division is the integer 0 which is then converted to a floating-point value 0.0

10967412
draggable	droppable
you have plenty of examples both for draggable and droppable

10967450
put	get
with the old data the user will get confused because he actually put in more than 20 characters and the old data will show it

10967468
put	get
when i put a breakpoint in the onrenderframe function and inspect the frameeventsargs parameter i get really large numbers for frameeventsargs.time

10967483
implements	extends
this allows android to work with any type of displayable object as long as it implements extends the view interface so you can create your own custom ui objects and android doesn t need to know about the fact it is a new type only that it can interact with it like any other view object

10967508
for-loop	arrays
i can create the buttons using a for-loop and an arrays

10967537

free	malloc
the rtoss that i employ in my applications do not have free and malloc and other calls like assert sometimes they could be available but i prefer to have everything static in my system

10967838
post	get
you can send the same variable multiple times in get and post

10967855
getter	setter
in languages like java it is usually recommended to always write getter and setter in order to have the option to replace these functions with more complex versions in the future

10967879
opera	firefox
it works well in firefox and ie 7 but in opera both the new window and the original window loads new content

10967882
udp	tcp
when communicating with tcp or udp the socket is distinguished by a 4-tuple

10967887
for-loop	loops
that isn t going to happen until your for-loop has long been exited since node s event loops won t even run until you ve gotten out of your loops

10967962
drools	optaplanner
drools planner has been renamed to optaplanner

10967994
google-chrome	firefox

free	malloc
in programming there is a general rule introduced by kernighan ritchie saying that you have call a free for all space allocated by a malloc

10968060
disk	ram
automatic error-correction is implemented in various hardware components ram disk controllers etc. but nevertheless hardware failures still happen - creating cascading errors and or failures in.

10968086
free	malloc	free	calloc	free	realloc	realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	calloc	malloc
if you use malloc as well as calloc or realloc â you are dynamically allocating memory that will not be free except if you explicitly call free

10968115
stdout	stdio
stdout is defined in stdio that s why it fails only when this file is included

when this code is inserted at the top of my pageinit handler i see the url in the location bar of the browser firefox google-chrome changing to and the page is apparently reloaded so i get a 404 error since it must have a number after shop and it should have the value 1

10968235
google-chrome	firefox
the url change only show up with google-chrome and firefox not in ipad android or ie9

10968265
mouseleave	mouseenter
what i think you are doing is highlighting on mouseenter and removing the highlighting on mouseleave but what is actually happening is different

10968335
web-inf	wab
i successfully tested to include primefaces.jar into the wab by putting the .jar file into web-inf lib directory but i want to use primefaces as osgi resource not as jar resource into the web-inf lib directory

int	chars
the program functions correctly text.at returns a chars which you implicitly convert to an int

i decided to have a baseentity with these properties and then have all of my other entities inherited from this one

10968350
post	get
i get errors in my logcat which i will post at the end of this post

10968354
accessor	properties
then properties make excellent accessor

10968363
post	get
therefore if you join friends to post with a left join which is an outer join you will get all the links from friends not only user 5 s which is probably not what you want

10968365
free	malloc
but you can even provide your own malloc and free implementation or statically linking with the appropriate memory management library

10968371
ant	maven

10968411
put	get
i spent many hours trying to figure out how to get people to log in and in the end put

width	height
i only want to show a part of that image something like 400 1000 ensuring that the width is the dominant attribute and having a scroll bar for the height but when i set viewbox it increase the width to display the added height

10968456
put	get
first of all do proper exception handling as ejp suggested a reason might be you get a connection timeout or something similar - so put an e.printstacktrace into the catch blocks and let s see if we get sort of an error message btw you gonna stop creating empty catch blocks really quickly when you debug a suppressed exception for 2 days

10968487
margin	height
adjust your texblock height and then give textwrapping wrap .it will work.before this you have to check texblock margin

10968490

i spent some time a while back investigating this for targetting java 1.4 and you can use the eclipse compiler either directly inside eclipse or as ecj which is a javac drop in replacement from the command line which can be used inside ant or you can use retroweaver which actively converts byte code to an earlier version

when you turn an attribute into a property you just define some getter and setter that you attach to it that will hook the data access

10968880

thanks to this very clever and powerful encapsulation mechanism in python you can usually go with attributes without a priori encapsulation so without any getter nor setter unless you need to do special things when accessing the data

10968880
getter	setter
if so then you just can define setter and getter only if needed and attach them to the attribute turning it into a property without any incidence on the rest of your code whereas in java the first thing you usually do when creating a field usually private is to create it s associated getter and setter method

i d like to get dimensions of image and if it is width 0 and height 0 then print error message

10971339
width	height
if that image is coming from a local database then you should recreate the fetching logic or make it usable via function call so that it doesn t do the http request and simply works internally within your script and then pass the data to gd s imagecreatefromstring which ll accept any known image type then use the imagesx and imagesy functions to get the height width

10971384

put	get
it looks good in the grid but 2 delete http requests actually get sent to the server and no put

10999197

ubuntu linux 11.04

11000187
post	get
however after about 5-10 minutes of inactivity the next request to the app experiences a network exception i m at work right now and don t have the exact error messages on me so i will post them when i get home if people think they re germane to the discussion this causes the internal messagequeue to close which results in every subsequent enqueue throwing an exception the queue is closed

second animatewithduration is a uiview method not a uiwindow method

11000726
uiview	uiwindow	inherited	subclassing
i guess the compiler allows what you wrote because uiwindow inherited from uiview but sending a class message to a subclassing that does not implement that method is a bad idea

11000735
int	chars
again because each h value is generated from the linear sum of some int representative values of chars therefore a particular h value can be achieved by different linear sums that is different strings

11000755

iprincipal	iidentity
i m using a custom iidentity and iprincipal in my asp.net mvc application via ef 4.3 as expalined here and follow accepted answer s solution

11001260
put	get
if i put the buttons on top i get just the game board filling the whole screen and no buttons

11001264
int	double
with the cast that bad stuff is undefined behavior most likely double is bigger than int and it overruns the memory for i

11001264
int	double
your version with actually works provided that double can accurately represent every value of int

11001264
int	double
which with an ieee double and an int smaller than 53 bits it can

11001329
ant	maven
from your script you don t mention if it is ant maven gradle etc. you should be able to find a way to get that value out of the .classpath through some plugin or custom code

this returned this is stdout n this is a failure on stderr n as expected

11001373

lets say over http via put get post etc

11001386

when i started using so i usually put up questions like below but ended up cutting down to the bare minimum as i usually didn t get an answer on thourough questions.

11001462
post	get
so i post in the code and everything seems to work great until i actually hit play and get an error

11001464

the uitableview is working correctly but the uipickerview which is supposed to dynamically pull the data it is supposed to display using a web call is showing up but appears completely blank

11001507
uipickerviewdelegate	uipickerviewdatasource
i ve posted the code below for the uipickerviewdelegate and uipickerviewdatasource methods as well as the method that is supposed to pull the data in the model

11001522

you should offer some way to access width and height and your conversion constructors should use such access methods to create the new rect

11001541
versioning	upgrade
i ve recently upgrade to the new versioning of the excellent signalr library and moved all my dependency injection from structuremap to ninject as ninject seemed to be better supported

11001583
nsurlconnection	nsoperation	nsurlconnection	nsoperationqueue
exactly how to do this is a little beyond the scope of an answer and partly up to you but you probably want to look into either nsurlconnection or nsoperation and nsoperationqueue

11001592
gson	jackson
although closed this so post can help you understand the differences between jackson and gson

11001629
vim	emacs

11001704
width	height
note that this won t be necessary if you add accessors for width and height as k-ballo suggests -- then you can just use those accessors in the conversion constructor and forgo the friend definition entirely

11001715
int	double
like all numeric types int may be cast into other numeric types byte short long float double

11001750
factors	matrix

vb.net	vb6
so the main comparison should really be between vb6 and vb.net because that s where you ll find the big differences

11001769
vb.net	vb6
vb.net includes a lot of functionality that has been around in other languages like c++ for ages and is by some considered way to different from vb6 even to be called vb anymore

11001769
vb.net	vb6
when it comes to compiling vb6 compiled to native code while vb.net compiles to cil common intermediate language which makes it a lot easier to reverse engineer however you can obfuscate the code in order to make it less readable

11001774
width	height
it s also inefficient for my purposes because i ve got views with a specific width and height that encapsulate text fields

11001787
ubuntu	debian
it is possible to assemble bare binary debs from a simple directory as you are doing but their usefulness is quite limited since they are difficult to reproduce port maintain autobuild and generally violate all sorts of debian ubuntu policies

11001833
int	chars
will write sizeof int pieces of chars to stdout

11001833
int	chars
if we assume a 32-bit int it will print the chars corresponding in the ascii codetable to and which is possibly four non-printable chars

another way to think about it is that instead of immediately averaging which does throw away the variance in the data you can produce 40 graphs like your lower one in your posted image from each horizontal row in your spectrum image all these graphs are going to be pretty similar but with some variations in peak position height and width

11009805
width	height
you should calculate the position height and width of each of these peaks in each of these 40 images then combine this data matching peaks across the 40 graphs and use the appropriate variance as an error estimate for peak position height and width by using the central limit theorem

post	get
i m guessing by this - writes are performed using post and reads are performed using get

11014810
put	get
if you put cache control headers last-modified expires etag you cannot be sure that you css will get refreshed when it changes

11014810
put	get
with the url hash the worst case scenario is that the client does not put your css in cache but user experience is not altered as they always get the latest version

11014812
filtering	grouping
if you are going to be running on a windows-based server connected to the same domain you are authenticating with then you should look at waffle which provides a servlet a spring security filtering a jaas plugin and a few other ways that you can implement windows integrated authentication which uses native windows methods to load the windows identity and associated active directory grouping

11015198
button	checkbox
windows uses the marlett font to render checkbox ticks the window frame button and other scalable ui elements

entity-relationship	diagram
if you wish to continue with the manual process perhaps this entity-relationship diagram of the drupal database will help keep in mind it is a bit dated and was likely based on earlier versions of drupal 7

11015385
put	get
you can get along with the answers these guys put on here but for the sake of simplicity i would do the sorting with the help of query like

11015396
pop-up	dialog
if you want a real pop-up not a dialog

11015403
int	double
since java is a statically typed language i would expect that a abs-method which takes an int returns an int if it expects a float returns a float for a double return a double

11015464

11015704
cells	tablecell
there is a new instance of tablerow for each row and a new instance of tablecell created for each table cells

11015704
cells	tablecell
the reason i ask is because it appears that you cannot reuse the instance of tablecell for multiple table cells and tablerow for multiple table rows you cannot do something like this

11015713

and i know that rspec works great for tdd in data models via failing tests but can capybara do this as well

11015834
getter	setter
to create such a property in your case xfraction and yfraction you need to build your own getter and setter associated to this property name

11015834
getter	setter
then you need to build a custom view that wraps the framelayout objects and write your getter and setter

11015869
rspec	minitest
that s where test unit rspec and or minitest come in

11015953
portrait	landscape
if you set the width to a fixed number of pixels then rotating portrait to landscape just changes the scale because the number of virtual pixels remains constant

websphere	ibm
i think that there s something wrong with the websphere 7 plugin developed by ibm

11016217
put	get
i have put breakpoints in my vs solution but it dsoesnt even get to call the method

11016252
spaces	delimiter
but it s neccessary that the options are parsed as only one token therefore you need to escape all standard batch-parser delimiter spaces tab

11016395
jar	war
to do this i need to be able to scan all of the .class files from the project location jar war or just a folder

11016400

at the moment i can only get 1 variable to post back due to the ajax function below

11016605
google-chrome	safari
unfortunately afaik it s only supported on webkit browsers right now safari google-chrome android ios but it could be good to learn how to use this and also an orm like persistencejs which is a jquery plugin that creates an orm for sqlite and can work on the client or server-side

11016606
hash	md5
and would like the id field of sensitive table to be obfuscated somehow like an md5 hash or something similar so that people querying the view can t see the actual id

11016618
width	height
i played around and by putting the button at the very top for expansion collapse of height from top to bottom or left for expansion collapse of width from left to right everything worked as planned

11016618
width	height
soon enough i hit a wall if you put the button at the bottom or right for expansion collapse of height or width respectively the buttons stay where they are on.

11016620
put	get
also it will get much slower if i put a too large number in order to get accurate calculations

11016647

11016799
post	get
you could post the whole controler so we get a clearer view of your code

11016829
children	parent
the difference is that delegate applies an event handler to a parent element someelement and watches for bubbling events from children

11016835
getter	setter
use a single getter and a single setter function as that s simple simplest and neatest api for client code to call

11016885
mouse	keyboard
as to disable mouse keyboard it s not very user-friendly either

11016885
mouse	keyboard
it is likely that the user will see that sometimes the keyboard mouse stops to work for apparently no reason since he doesn t understand what s happening

11016895

11017328
post	get
at after the line you remain logged into the website and could create more post or get requests without having to log back in

11017330

i get a facebook response with a post id too.

11017450
alarmmanager	wakelock
for best battery life use the alarmmanager class to queue a future event in a such a way that the phone is not prevented from sleeping in the meantime - if you tried to do it with an ordinary timer you would have to hold a wakelock

11017458
next	except
all of the examples that you provided except 4th only prevent your code from progressing to the next line which is perfectly ok

11017493

i am thinking of a recursive solution where the minimum running time is o max x2 y2

11017511
onkeyup	onkeydown	int	boolean	keyevent	onkeydown
and you can t assign an action to the button but you can implement your type of edittext assuming that the text fields are of type edittext which overrides the public boolean onkeydown int keycode keyevent event and or public boolean onkeyup int keycode keyevent event methods or any other you find suitable for your goal

11017544

with various browsers mostly google-chrome 19 but also firefox 3.5 to 12 ie 8 9... but only 1 of the trafic

11017609
google-chrome	firefox
all theses facts make me think the problem occurs silently in the browers probably triggered by a buggy add-on antivirus a browser bar or a crappy manufacturer soft integrated in browsers updated yesterday but i didn t find any add-on released yesterday for google-chrome firefox and ie

11017626
inherited	properties
probably the simplest example of where we don t have inherited context links is across random properties elements

11023447
post	get
for example if you on a post request return the full entry as it now looks in the database you can immediately store it on the phone with the correct id and you can use the same code for rendering the content as you would if it had been downloaded using a get request

11023610
width	height
you could wrap each element in an element of the same width height

11023623
mouse	keyboard
the biggest reason is that you re using so-called native events when you re using the ie driver which simulates mouse and keyboard events at the operating system level rather than just within the browser using say javascript and the way ie processes native events is sometimes compromised if the browser window doesn t have focus

11023653

when i profiling my app in instrumentation 4.3 i get a bunch of leaks

11023670

before now we were using the application folder for monitoring but as security permissions are required to copy the file inside the application root directory we decided to change its path to be the my documents folder

the error of width and height not being defined is because they are not local global variables but bound to the class and or the instance of the class therefore in their namespace

you could also convert it to a string parse the the month chars and then convert back to an int

11024573
jtextfield	jpasswordfield
in this case just replace jtextfield with jpasswordfield

jtextfield	jpasswordfield
also you don t have to worry about listeners or method calls on the text-fields they will still work because jpasswordfield is a subclass of jtextfield

int	chars
your switch statement is incorrectly trying to match the int position value to the ascii chars 0 and 1

11025141
width	height
but it sounds to me like the width and or height of your radio button or the containing element around it is too small for the size of image you re using

11025141
width	height
if so a css declaration specifying the appropriate width or height should fix it

11025170
width	height
for example let s say your designated initializer is initwithx y width height but you find yourself writing things like this all over the place

11025185
submit	submission
