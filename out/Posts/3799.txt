i had to look up some jquery selectors to figure this out but that doesn t disprove it s validity basically it first hide all the span elements in the element which holds them which will need an id of containerelement starts an interval for the brandchange function which fades out and hide the four current brands then fades in and show the next four brands while incrementing the i variable to keep count then it waits for the interval to happen again in five seconds

viewdidload	viewwillappear
to manually correct set self.view.bounds to the right co-ordinates in your featured view s viewwillappear or viewdidload if you use manual coordinates viewdidload is fine but i think you need viewwillappear if you re using parts of self.navigationcontroller like the position of navigationbar

width	height
the height changes on rotation but it won t fill the width

7681538
serializable	deserialization
this would work if the jsonproperty and jsonignore attributes only took affect during serializable but not deserialization however unfortunately that is not the case

7681538
serializable	deserialization
essentially the logic is that a client may provide any documenttype so during deserialization the server needs to ensure this matches the expecteddocumenttype and then during serializable when the server sends this document to the client the server knows the correct documenttype so needs to populate it with the expecteddocumenttype

the main idea behind post redirect get as the article you linked to points out is to avoid users resubmitting data most of the time

post	get
prg or post redirect get is just a pattern you can use to prevent the message boxes

7682051
postgresql	mysql
it is better to use postgresql but if you want to use mysql innodb then probably you ll need a workaround for loading fixtures with forward references the bugfix is already present in django trunk and i ve also ported it to django 1.3.1 see django 1.3.1.1 on github

stopwatch	nstimer
if you programming a stopwatch you could use the nstimer to display the results to the user while an nirtimer one of my favorite classes keeps track of time

7682116
onresume	onpause
this is further complicated because this is an activity in a tabhost and tabhosts call both onpause and onresume every time you load a view so this breaks lifecycle functions

7682133
for-loop	loops
i tried wrapping the for-loop around the linkitself but it obviously breaks hell as it is reused in a loops creating a loops within a loops and destroying my layout

avoid byte short chars explicitly convert them to int before any calculation

activemq	rabbitmq
if you want to use the same model as what you described with activemq installing brokers on both your client and server machines then install the two brokers and connect them using the rabbitmq shovel plugin

7682251
sorting	grouping
let s say you re sorting a list integers into a tree but instead of comparing them by precise numeric value you wanted grouping all numbers into chunks of 100

7682251
sorting	grouping
you might use partial ordering to basically grouping things together into larger chunks even if the total natural ordering doesn t result from the sorting

7682259
helpers	actioncontroller	post	get
there is also a actioncontroller testcase helpers that adds for methods like get post etc

7682260

this image control is height 600 and width 800

7682311
post	get
i think rather than connect to a database remotely you want to use rest services to get and post data to your remote database

7682311
post	get
in your android app you can do an http get or post to consume the aforementioned service

7682369
jquery	scriptaculous

mouseup	mousedown
coulda sworn this wasn t how it used to work but with jquery my click event is firing even if i return false on both mousedown and mouseup

7682398
subtract	add
you don t actually need the since you re subtract but i ve included it on the assumption that at some point you might want to add 1 at which point you ll run into string concatenation issues unless you convert the string to a number first.

7682403
mouseup	mousedown
because a click event is a mousedown followed by a mouseup

7682501
int	chars
mysql_real_escape_string is pointless - after int there will be no bad chars

accessor	properties
you use retain in two situations 1 in the implementation of an accessor method or an init method to take ownership of an object you want to store as a properties value

7682720
hide	show
basically you hook into the drop-down s change event and when that happens you check the value of the drop-down and either show or hide the text-field based on what was selected in the drop-down

post	get
i ll update this post later as i get a better understanding of the problem

mongo uses special data types in addition to the basic json types of string int boolean double null array and object

7682772

it is able to get the width height after loading the image

7682772
width	height
but once you alter the width it still logs the old height

i separate it out to 4 cron jobs every minute to blast them out each cron job sends 1 000 messages 300 messages per each connection to apns server

7682810
google-chrome	firefox
an interesting side-effect of the problem was that firefox and google-chrome didn t seem load the css file

7682810

width	height
i am already using screen height and width to set position and size of ui objects but most of times i should do a new design for ipad

7682861
width	height
you didn t change the height yet because your image s height width make

7682861
width	height
when you change the width in ie8 it will only resize the width but in chrome it will both change the width and height i think this is browser depended

now that i ve added the form collection to my post actionresult and get the selected value using

7682907
post	get
there is a nice pattern called post redirect get

7682907

width	height
now i am having problems with resizing adjusting width height of the grouped select

7682914
width	height
this is my code to position it on the screen even if i add width and height to this it seems like it is not updating

7682922
mongodb	bson
mongodb stores data in a binary format called bson which supports these numeric data types

7682922
floating-point	integer	mongodb	bson
it s worth mentioning that the mongodb shell - being a javascript shell - doesn t recognise the distinction between integer and floating-point values it treats all numbers the same because javascript represents all numbers as 64-bit floating point regardless of their underlying bson type

7682943
width	height
instead of setting width height you can try to set image.style.maxwidth image.style.maxheight then image will resize with preserving aspect ratio

getter	setter
that gives you a private-by-visibility support class only available in your implementation with an instance variable and setter getter methods on your class that are not visible outside the compilation unit either

7683233
put	get
if you don t want to put that in the __unicode__ method which does get used for other things you can easily put it in some separate method and directly call that one rather than implicitly calling the __unicode__ one

7683282
int	double
you need to call next on resultset before using the getxxx methods where xxx can be int string double etc.

7683285

7683336
ienumerable	ienumerator	ienumerable	idictionary	idictionary	ienumerator
foreach on an idictionary will use the idictionary.getenumerator function which returns an idictionaryenumerator internally this tells the ienumerator function on the internal enumerator class which type to return. whereas the cast function operates on ienumerable which will make it return a keyvaluepair

7683366
factors	matrix
you want to use blas for basic linear algebra operations like summing or multiplying two matrix and lapack for more computational intensive algorithms like factors matrix

7683496
width	height
then you should not worry about the height of the width because the div1 would be extended based on its contents

7683793
unix	solaris
it seems that all the major investment banks use c++ in unix linux solaris for their low latency high frequency server applications

7683806
typedef	struct
for example it may not be reasonable to use a simple typedef to mimic a windows event object on unix so you might use a container struct for events.

7684628
superclass	subclassing
as the method returns superclass you cant directly assign it to a subclassing

you could explicitely cast the return value to subclassing which will fail as soon as the factory returns another subclassing of superclass and will throw an exception during runtime

i did find make a connection to a https server from java and ignore the validity of the security certificate as well as disable certificate validation in java ssl connections but the accepted answer to the first is for httpclient 4.0 unfortunately i cannot upgrade unless someone can point me in the direction of how to use two different versioning of that same library within the same project although it does have another answer with little more than a dead link that supposedly went to a 3.x solution

7686255
automapper	webactivator
i would suggest you install webactivator nuget package and set up your automapper using it

7686255
automapper	webactivator
what is more you can keep your automapper code in a separate dll ie. in a service layer and webactivator will still run your code without modifying your mvc project at all

if this is your versioning you may need to upgrade or mod the app

the titlelabel property of uibutton is read-only so you can t replace it with your own uilabel subclass

7686443
lxml	elementtree
you can use the elementtree which is implemented in the python standard library and in the lxml library

7686446
getter	setter

width	height
i would like to make a gallery with 3 columns with the same width so the images are resized to fit in but they keep the ratio so they height are different

7686738
width	height
if using this on a frame then make sure to give it an explicit width and height

7686739
maven	m2e
my theory is that if you specify empty elements then command-line maven 2.2.1 in my case doesn t send authentication information so it works with my proxy whereas perhaps the maven 3 embedded in m2e sends the auth headers but with blank info which gets rejected by my proxy

7686761

i can obtain the width and the height of the image before downloading it using getimagesize and if i could use this info to work out the total file size i could break out before the image resizer gets going and suppliment the image with a nice no image available alternative

7687058

7687081

just multiply height by width by 3

7687082
free	malloc
as far as i have understood this it is impossible to implement a sane memory allocator that follows these rules because malloc can never reuse free memory as the memory could be used to store different types at each allocation

7687102
superclass	subclassing

also icollectionview that sits above the observablecollection is actively aware of the changes and performs filtering grouping sorting relatively fast as compared to any other source list

7687111
gif	bmp
an image in memory always weights the same weight compressed in jpeg or gif or bmp

7687111
width	height
so if you want to calculate the size of an image in memory take the width the height and the bit size to get the bit weight divide by 8 and you get the bytesite

7687137
free	malloc
once an allocated block has been released back to the heap with free there should be no references to it and it can be given out again by malloc

7687137
memcpy	memmove
if a value is copied into an object having no declared type using memcpy or memmove or is copied as an array of character type then the effective type of the modified object for that access and for subsequent accesses that do not modify the value is the effective type of the object from which the value is copied if it has one

i noticed that adsize.banner works adsize.iab_banner doesn t show in portrait only in landscape

width	height
make height and width of your listview fill_parent and give it weight 1 and then below your list view add a horizontal linear layout consisting of your edit text and button

7687721
free	malloc
if size is 0 then malloc returns either null or a unique pointer value that can later be successfully passed to free

7687721
free	malloc
so there s no guarantee that malloc is not allocating any space when you pass it 0 and you have to free the pointer that it gives you if it isn t null

7687729
ant	maven
it seems that ant is trying to download some jars from a maven repository on the internet in this case on jboss site

7687735

you only need to use the -u option the first time that you push - it just sets up some helpful default config options so that git pull works without additional arguments for instance

7687758
webkit	gecko
if not are there any ruby bindings preferably cross-platform and actively maintained to open source rendering engines such as gecko and or webkit

7687820
git-rebase	amend

ffmpeg	handbrake
also a usable gui for you to play with settings is handbrake which is effectively an ffmpeg wrapper

7693233
ffmpeg	handbrake
handbrake bundles ffmpeg with its installation so i would get it from there

7693233
ffmpeg	handbrake
be mindful of the licensing on ffmpeg handbrake as they are distributed in france and i m not sure you can distribute it with your application but you may be able to use it server side

7693302
min	max
in standard sql you must choose the value you want if there is only one you can type min or max

7693312
width	height
you just add helper elements with zero width so they are pushing your floaters with their height but as they have zero width the text flows near them almost perfectly

7693328
prepare	execute
santiago if you still want to write it in dynamic sql you should prepare all of the statements first then execute them

7693402
put	get
such that check 2 but i get thrown an error in sub two complaining about a lack of values in globalarray in fact even sub one complains that there is no globalarray to put things in

7693425
opera	google-chrome
i tested in internet explorer 9 by enabling option and then it s fetching fresh copy of html from server but in other browser s like google-chrome and opera it s caching every time

7693491
freebsd	linux
currently supported platforms are linux and freebsd

7693523
int	chars
you should probably be using unsigned chars for x instead of either int or chars

7693528
firefox	safari
also this has to work in ie firefox and safari and it can t contain a doctype tag to take it out of quirks mode

7693534
oncreate	onstart
the flow of a android application is to call oncreate then onstart

7693536
keydown	keyup
the solution was to use the keyup event don t use keydown because the text property won t be updated yet

7693568
put	get
i then call getservingurl to get the url of the image that i programmatically put in the blobstore

7693578
adium	ichat
adium ichat and pidgin all support xep-0231 which allows you to send the provide binary data including images to this purpose

adium	ichat
i do know that adium and ichat at least use it to request the data

7693609
textmate	sublimetext
sublimetext 2 supports textmate syntax definition files

7693622
filtering	grouping
facebook grouping and filtering content based on a variety of factors

7693689
put	get
just remember to put session_start at the top of each page or you ll get a load of undefined errors

7693691
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
uitabbarcontroller is a subclass of uiviewcontroller

7693722
put	get
i use autoloading to find the helper files i need so the class is only ever included once then in theory the file shouldn t get searched included again that way i don t have to put include statements in the script and i believe the file isn t loaded unless the class is used

7693732
dbcontext	objectcontext
i could imagine that this is the main reason why the dbcontext api doesn t have an explicite detach method in contrast to objectcontext - detaching is considered as an advanced feature which does not behave as one might expect

7693779
websphere	ibm
i ll definitely ask folks internally to check whether there are plans to release an mqtt 3.1-compatible java client - i know that websphere mq telemetry commercial product from ibm does provide that but i don t believe the ia92 supportpac has been updated to that level right now

7693790
getter	setter
where resourceholder is a simple bean with getter and setter for inputstream and file

7693790
getter	setter
s and g stand for setter and getter - you specify what you expect to set and what the client expects when he calls get

7693883
translation	localization
their approach to type safe localization avoids many common issues with translating to languages with different word orders different pluralization rules and so on and again the compiler can warn you if a message lacks a translation

7693909
windows	wow64
since windows server 2008 r2 wow64 is an optional feature which can be uninstalled

7693950
google-chrome	firefox
if the content of the contenteditable is an empty div - selecting it with a range works on firefox for example but on google-chrome the text is inserted before the div

7693950
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
with the additional br firefox google-chrome safari all generate an single empty line where all input ends up inside the div but internet explorer tested version 9 shows two empty lines

7693955
setinterval	settimeout
i would suggest any setinterval is too many you should always use settimeout instead

7693994
int	chars
i have an int int the range 0-255 and i want to create a string of length 1 so that the ascii value of this single chars is the specified int

7694012
int	chars
assuming the int is as you say between 0 and 255 you ll get an array with a single chars back from character.tochars which will become a single-character string when passed to string.valueof

7694012
int	chars
using character.tochars is preferable to methods involving a cast from int to chars chars i for a number of reasons including that character.tochars will throw an illegalargumentexception if you fail to properly validate the int while the cast will swallow the error per the narrowing primitive conversions specification potentially giving an output other than what you intended

7694015
stdout	stderr
normally a process will start out with file descriptors 0 1 and 2 assigned to stdin stdout and stderr and the first file descriptor that you explicitly open will be 3 so you ll get away with it

7694021
public	protected
the protection classes public protected and private exist to provide protection for data

7694027
public	protected
having declared as protected the static variable can only be accessed with in it s member functions and it s derived classes public protected inheritance

7694050
integer	unsigned
not that i think this is a good idea but in c at least you can check if your unsigned integer is greater than int_max for two s complement anyway not so sure about the sign magnitude and one s complement variants but they re probably rare enough that you could safely ignore them until a problem pops up

7694050
integer	unsigned
this is of course assuming it was read in as an integer and converted to unsigned somewhere - if you use customised input routines expecting only unsigned numbers they may barf at the presence of a leading - sign

7694055
maven	m2e
i am used to m2e workspace dependency resolution for plain java maven projects and i d love to see something similar working with grails

7694055
maven	m2e
as far as i know that s a feature coming from m2e but enabling this one on the grails project just causes sts to crash and i assume that it would still conflict with grails even if i would use the grails maven plugin

7694056
integer	unsigned
use columndefinition attribute and set it to integer unsigned

7694085
equals	charat
i am trying to get all 0 values to equals 11 in the array of nums and print bob every time it does that but for some reason the first if statement doesnt seem to be executing even when charat i equals 0

7694106
int	chars
you compared int and chars my mistake

7694162
webkit	gecko
it s important to note that with the invention of tools like firebug gecko and inspector webkit you don t need to download modify and the view the html page

7694186

it renders correctly in google-chrome and firefox but ie 7 butchers it

7694201
g++	gcc
i should clarify that i m using gcc g++ 4.4.5

7694201
g++	gcc
however with gcc g++ 4.4.5 this gives invalid use of pack expansion expression

7694210
hash	md5
however it does have libraries for md5 and sha1 hash and rsa encryption

7694210
hash	md5
from what i understand to verify the certificate first compute the sha1 hash or md5 of the certificate

7694210
hash	md5
sha1 hash produces a 20 byte value and md5 produces 16 byte value

7694252
pop-up	dialog
i want a service to pop-up a custom alert dialog

7694252
pop-up	dialog
a if i can pop-up an alert dialog from a service simply haven t tried yet dont know what context to give it

7694252
pop-up	dialog
c if i can pop-up an alert dialog from outside the app it is a niche application the users will be expecting pop-up alerts

7694294
google-chrome	firefox
for example firefox with firebug or google-chrome with its developer tools

7694365
width	height
otherwise its width and height will be zero and so it won t show

the root of the tree is uiwindow mainwindow notice that uiwindow is a subclass of uiview

7694365
uiview	calayer
each uiview has a layer property of type calayer which actually holds its visible content

7694365
uiview	calayer
uiview is just a wrapper around calayer to add things like touch handling ability

7694377
xsd.exe	svcutil.exe
you can add annotations specific for code generation this only works for svcutil.exe not for xsd.exe to your xsd file

7694377
xsd.exe	svcutil.exe
if you use svcutil.exe instead of xsd.exe then the generated code will by slightly different

7694378
implements	extends
when i try get the methods to be implements while implements a interface or extends a abstract class i have tried using the eclipse feature to auto generate the method skeletons for the to override implements methods and it never worked for me but the compiler complains that methods need to be overridden

7694416
hash	md5
when you want to break a md5 password what you really want to do is a first preimage attack find any password m such that hash m matches stored hash h

7694449
post	get
posting news items only by friends was slightly different because i was getting data directly from the database and using select subqueries to only get post by friends of the current user

7694484
profiling	debugging
it s got intellisense debugging profiling etc.

7694503
jobs	cron
the best option would be cron jobs

7694517
hide	show
i m not sure how well this would work but possibly you could write a subclass of whichever class is causing the keyboard to be show ex edittext where you either track when the keyboard is show or take over the calls to show and hide the keyboard overriding at least onkeyup and ontouchevent

7694521
ant	maven
i m a maven newbie have been studying maven for a week now have 5 years experience using ant so i m able to come up to speed without trouble

7694558

portrait	landscape
this could be possible even if your app is locked in landscape orientation for instance - occasionally a portrait draw could still happen - even if it s not visible to the end user

7694649
apache	nginx
right now the dev server setup has nginx and apache

7694649
apache	nginx
it seems node is not like apache or nginx where there s an independent server that serves up code

7694649
apache	nginx
but if this is becoming a blockage to our current infrastructure i m willing to try other technologies and servers that is similar to how nginx or apache works--so that it is independent of the app code and can be compatible with our current development environment

7694653
getter	setter
if not can you make sure the getter and setter are correct

7694676
hash	md5
md5 and sha1 are one way hash

7694676
hash	salt
it is merely obtaining hash values of a string that has been encrypted with a salt key three times

7694698
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
that s the whole point of inherited to be able to use in superclass behavior that is refined in subclassing

7694704
folder	directory
you could monitor parent directory and set filter property to your folder s name to get only events for the folder and set includesubdirectories to true

7694709
lxml	beautifulsoup
use a parser either lxml or beautifulsoup

7694714

setcontentview	findviewbyid
setcontentview r.layout.something put this first after write findviewbyid function then you will not find this null pointer exception

7694939
setcontentview	findviewbyid
you need to call setcontentview before findviewbyid or it will return null

7694948
ceil	floor
when i use functions like floor abs ceil and other simple floating point operations i get warnings about values being truncated

7694954
children	parent
this function gets passed all the information it needs to create a new board and then it should add the pointer to that new board to the end of the parent board s children list

7694964
folder	directory
on the other hand if your javaloader is on a different hard drive and tucked away deep in folder then you ll have to change directory to get to it

7695030
explode	implode
of course you can use implode and explode to convert between the two output formats

7695032
button	checkbox
i want to create custom button in table view.in that by clicking on that button the label will be create with current date.in that button i also have to implement checkbox functionality

7695094
nhibernate	queryover	nhibernate	massive
but using a native sql query like this is not a good idea becouse here comes the beauty of nhibernate this what we should use nhibernate for to eleminate these massive sql statements and to express our tables in some oop flavor.so for a basic query like this you better use hql query language or queryover .look at your sql statement how much lines you wrote but with nhibernate you could do that with a few words you only use native sql statement for the queries you couldn t achieve with nhibernate

7695120
uiview	subviews
i want stuff that drawrect draws appear above the subviews of my custom uiview

7695183
uiview	calayer
each uiview has a calayer that its content is drawn in and that layer has several implicit animtions setup to animated changes to certain properties such as the frame or position properties

7695191
int	double
the double is then put into the local var f and truncated to an int

7695213
hide	show
once you want to disable the flash-button just hide it show the substitute image

to restate i m trying to modify what a button does based on whichever checkbox is ticked basically i m just trying to change what file it operates on

7695302
pull	push
i have been able to push and pull from both public and private repositories

7695345
setcontentview	findviewbyid
looking at your code it looks like you are trying to findviewbyid before you have set the content of this activity by calling setcontentview r.layout.main

7695345
setcontentview	findviewbyid
make sure you call setcontentview before you try any findviewbyid

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in firefox safari google-chrome all is well but in ie the forms lack their box-shadow

7695449
stateless	stateful
not sure if this applies in your case but when switching a stateless service or generally any component to being stateful you need to consider a few issues

chr x returns the ascii chars with int index of x

7695560
pthreads	fcntl	unix	bsd
the other answers cover perl flock locking pretty well but on many unix linux systems there are actually two independent locking systems bsd flock and pthreads fcntl -based locks

7695560
fcntl	fork
fcntl provides range-level locking within a file and network locking over nfs but locks are not inherited by child processes after a fork

7695560
sysv	systemd
sometimes sysv systemd flock is emulated using lockf or fcntl

7695561
hide	show
actually for show hide i am using uiview animation

7695584
aggregate-functions	sum
also if you are using any aggregate-functions like sum max etc then you cannot use where clause on the field in this case the field is uniqueid which is being used in the group by clause

innodb	myisam
innodb is good for creating reliable data-driven web application and myisam is good for performance

7695792
uiview	subviews
depending on your specific requirements you may need to have a plain uiview as the background container view with your existing subviews in there and then your custom view as another subviews added to the very top so it has the highest z-order

7695818
innodb	myisam
for example is a statistical thing myisam can answer instantly while innodb actually does a count

7695825
textview	imageview
and i am using a baseadapter class to put the data into the appropriate places of the listview which consists of an imageview and four textview but i don t think that is relevant now

7695825
textview	imageview
without the progressdialog all textview and the imageview of each row of the listview is loaded properly

width	height
both solutions second and third link create temporary elements or and fill them succesively with text calculating their height width

7695909
inherited	properties
i ve tried inheriting the classes to add a new properties id so each stroke+polyline has the same id but i cannot inherited because these are sealed classes

7695937
post	get
edit 2 you should probably implement some sort of tracking for the traffic you get from facebook custom links etc. and use that as a metric and not wall post for individual users where there are numerous reasons on why the post might not appear

7695948
versioning	upgrade
it has a servlet listener which can automatically upgrade the database when a new versioning of my app is deployed

7695966
udp	tcp
udp headers has no info for ordering and there is no guarantee that some won t get lost more info so you have to provide your own ordering in the payload or switch to tcp

folder	directory
longer you really need to set the working directory to the folder where the folder a

7696079
solaris	bsd
the file system structure of not only linux but any posix-compatible system including bsd solaris and to a lesser degree even mac os x are standardized in the fhs

7696079
ubuntu	debian
specifically for ubuntu have a look at the debian policy for java and the packaging guide of the ubuntu-java team

7696086
width	height
this should return the correct width and height

7696086
width	height
so the width and height is not calculated yet

7696086
width	height
to get the height and width

7696104

maven	pom.xml
i am trying to deploy my web-application to tomcat using maven 3.x here is the snap shot of the pom.xml file

7696196
equals	gethashcode
in this case it is probably better to use other methods than equals and gethashcode to implement this kind of equality as it really changes over time

7696246
width	height
most examples out there specify exactly the width and height of the popup window

7696246
width	height
i want them to be wrap_content - since the content is dinamically determined so in the constructor i set -2 for both width and height and show it via showasdropdown view anchor

7696277
winpcap	pcap.net
pcap.net uses c++ cli to wrap winpcap which is considered more efficient than pinvoke

7696282

7696330
awt	swing	children	parent
part of the problem is an impedance mismatch between the locale resolve mechanism between awt vs swing the former resolves up the parent chain expecting most of the children to have a null locale property the latter explicitly sets the default as returned by jcomponent.getdefaultlocale very early in its life in jcomponent constructor

7696333
int	boolean	int	double
double precision floating point this handles int longs dates times currency etc string boolean error

7696342

my first bit of code is to allow users to select single and multiple files using keyboard commands arrows and shift and mouse click and shift click

7696359
post	get
after processing a post request redirect to another page using get

7696363
getter	setter
anything a getter setter does a public field does better

7696363
getter	setter
first if you want public data make it public get rid of the getter setter methods to reduce the number of methods the client has to wade through and make it cognitively simpler for the client to change it s value by eg

7696363
getter	setter
where the client must now check the getter setter method to see if it has any side-effects

7696363
getter	setter
imho the moral is to name methods to say exactly what they do follow the srp and get rid of getter setter

7696363
getter	setter
if there s problems without getter setter tell objects to do their own dirty work inside their own class instead of trying to do things with them in other classes

7696367
viewdidload	dealloc
i just made then an assigment in viewdidload and release in dealloc

quicksort	shellsort
bubble sort provided much better performance than others such as shellsort quicksort and a native javascript functionality

7696525
spaces	delimiter
i do the assumption that views are stored in a single cell spaces delimiter and if a view consist of more that one word - are place in between for example city-center

7696551
width	height
this seems fairly easy with absolutelayout since i can get at runtime the defaultdisplay s width and height and so i can position objects in an absolutelayout relative to the display metrics

7696669
memset	malloc
until you call malloc you don t own what it s pointing at so you can t really memset it

7696675
post	get
because you haven t mention method type either use post or get by default it will use get method

7696729

i m starting to doubt that in the context of a popupwindow that -2 -2 actually means wrap_content rather i think that its just interpreting it as width -2 height -2

7698709
width	height
if all else fails measure the width and height of the textview and then use setwidth and setheight as expected

7698709
width	height
okay so i took your code you posted and verbatim tried it on my device and you were right it didn t work because when android is determining which views to layout to put it in it relies on the width and height you provided

7698709
width	height
what that means is since you are using 0 and 0 as your width and height android will come along and say oh look the box is only a 0 by 0 box so i can display it as a popup below the content. this isn t what is desired though

7698709
width	height
see screenshot that s because android knows that the width and height are 1 as i set in the constructor and that the available screen space below the list item is 0

7699194
post	get
ie a row with a notification_type of post and an id of 1 should get the the data from the post table where the id is 1

7699550
width	height
first you need the width height of the box containing the rotated image

7699583
free	malloc	free	memset	memset	malloc
somehow malloc circumvents the issue above because the malloc inside of ld.so does not have a functional free it just calls memset

7699609
free	malloc
it s not the best way and probably you want to stick to using malloc but this way you won t have to free the array later

7699621
width	height
i m putting an img tag in a document without knowing the width height of the corresponding image

getter	setter
the trouble with getter setter is they try to fake encapsulation but they actually break it by exposing their internals

7700073
getter	setter
imho needing getter setter to make something work is often a symptom of bad design

i used the splinter module for my program which of course is a new high level framework to interact with other frameworks like selenium and every time i try to compile it there seems to be a file called webdriver.xpi that is always left out from the final package and therefore when the program attempts to execute the web-driver it fails with an io error saying that the file webdriver.xpi was not found....but other than that the gui and everything works perfectly fine

7702145
getter	setter
i have to try and change the setter getter name repeatedly and test until it passes through without errors and this can be going through 5-6 different names and becomes such a waste of time

7702152
listview	gridview
use a gridview listview instead of having a lot of imageview

7702153
getter	setter
setter must be set + capitalized field same for getter

7702153

dlsym	dlopen
afaik the quake3 engine which is used for urban terror implements a custom dynamic opengl loader system the binary doesn t link against libgl.so directly but uses dlopen to load libgl.so then dlsym to retrieve all the opengl symbols

7702251
dlsym	dlopen
i recommend also intercepting the dlopen and dlsym calls and for functions you intend to hook into return your trampoline which will ultimately call the requested function instead returning the function pointer directly

7702252

7702312
width	height
btw i think the code won t get correct width and height until the resource the picture actually gets loaded

7702312
width	height
so you d probably need to wait for event.complete before checking on height and width of photoloader

tcpclient has the serversocket codings whereas the clientui has the ui components which calls the tcpsever method to accept a socket and for requesting purpose

7702837
put	get
another alternative to get the toolbar put your table into a uinavigationcontroller

7702838
for-loop	loops
the reason i ask is that i m writing the data in a for-loop and flushing after loops i m guessing that flushing after every iteration of loops would destroy the point of using buffers and when the data gets too big 4mb atm my file isn t coming out correctly

7703351
super	self
the expected thing happens self.super will just hold a super object that acts just like super caselessdict self

7703351
super	self
you could name the attribute __super so it gets mangled but i recommend just calling super caselessdict self as everybody else does

7703373
getter	setter
going through self.name will call getter or setter functions which you are attempting to override

7703446
getter	setter
they have been declared private declare them as public or even better create public getter setter for encapsulation

7703468
getter	setter
also at least from whatever we see there seems to be missing getter setter for accessing it

7703468
getter	setter
while a quickfix for this is to add getter setter and access the field using them or an ugly way is to make the field public

screens	mdpi
if screens compatibility is turned on by setting minsdkversion to 3 it works correctly even on the s2 because it s emulating an mdpi screens

7703592
mdpi	hdpi
does it actually fall back onto mdpi if it cannot find the resource in hdpi

7703595
getter	setter
this implies that 90 of all getter setter exposing in class must be deleted and replaced by behavior-contained method

7703595
getter	setter
indeed it corresponds to tell don t ask philosophy because client is not expected to treat behavior itself through help of poor getter setter methods

7703595
getter	setter
one visitor implies class structure to provide getter setter so that visitor can modify object s states without touching to class itself

7703617

int	double
most likely your double is too big to be converted correctly to int

initialize the variable to a value that you aren t going to use for example -1 if you re going to use unsigned integer values and an empty string for a string

7703674

7704013

how this relates to super is that as of python 2.6 super aclass self added the check to make sure that the self reference was indeed an instance of aclass

7704304
super	self
the a.a class had changed to something that my existing instances of a.a were no longer instances of and so super a.a self would begin to raise typeerrors

7705907
getter	setter
i had a problem once that wouldnt update my uri just try to actualize when you can not sure how to go about your particular problem but i had a problem that when i changed teams in my app the main page wouldnt update the statistics when you returned to it so i just added a method that retrieves the value once more i use nested classes with setter and getter so its all handled for me

i have a pretty large directory var www on my linux ubuntu server

7706011

for filtering and sorting a good approach is to use json for the ajax response then sort filtering based on that on the client side if you are talking about a smallish number of items probably upto 1000 items

7706037
firefox	safari
the user agent of safari and also firefox in lion is something like

7706096
width	height	google-chrome	firefox
this demo shows that in google-chrome the entire jsfiddle area contains the iframe but if you try this sample in firefox the iframe will occupy all width but not all height

7706096

7706127
ssl	https
charles is an http proxy http monitor reverse proxy that enables a developer to view all of the http and ssl https traffic between their machine and the internet

7706136
uinavigationbar	uinavigationitem
note that the uinavigationbar does not deal with the controllers it should be the other way round rather it deals with the uinavigationitem s which will look different according to if they are on top of the navigation stack or not

7706187
translation	localization
in practice you would rely on localization to provide whatever text includes quotation marks and for example a string would get translation to une â chaã neâ in french

7706199
disk	ram
most computers have larger disk storage than ram and in many cases can support a single file too large to fit into ram

7706210
inherited	properties
when building each node it will compose the methods from the code with the inherited properties schema and any non-default properties from the node defined in the mybar struct itself

7706210
inherited	properties
the goal is to create a a system that given a node from an instance of tree can self-analyze its own properties inherited path and identify at which level the properties is defined

7706210
inherited	properties
this is to allow editing of the mybar structure and indicate which properties are inherited as defaults from the base schema and at which level and which ones are explicitly defined in the mybar structure

7706240
16-bit	64bit
the only guarantees are that size_t and unsigned int are both at least 16-bit but likely to be bigger uintmax_t is at least 64bit assuming c99 rules and uintmax_t is at least as wide as any other unsigned type

7706246
post	get
what will happen is that you first call server with your get post request and if the server requires authentication and credentials were not provided inside htttp header it will hopefully respond with 401 response

7706254
typedef	struct
note that it may be anything from a typedef to a class it may also be a simple c-type struct or an enum or a #define

7706276
clang	llvm
except perhaps for a few high-level as in aware of high-level language features or details that aren t encoded in llvm ir optimizations clang s backend does little more than generate straightforward ir and run some set of llvm optimization passes on it

7706284
folder	directory
try changing directory to the folder that git has created

7706307
sorting	filtering
in this case datedisplay column will be shown in original data and filtering will be done by this column but sorting will be done by the values in the datesort column

7706321
avro	thrift
you could use a library such as apache s thrift or avro to handle the binary serialization for you --- in this case you won t have to worry about your raw data being inconsistently encoded in binary

7706334
translation	localization
you would need to store a content id as well as a language id for each the compound key paweå dyda refers to in a separate localization table that provides the translation versions of each content

7706354
ubuntu	debian
i want to build an application that will be compatible with say debian lenny libc postgres oracle and other libs on a different debian ubuntu release

this seems to work fine in ie and google-chrome but firefox 3.6 does not seem to work every time

7706418
firefox	safari
using safari instead of firefox works

7706434

keep in mind however that a you don t know whether the image will be portrait or landscape and b that if you allow to take an image from a photo album you don t have control over the resolution ratio at all

7706438
google-chrome	firefox
is much faster in firefox and google-chrome than

7706440
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	calloc	malloc
does the heap always allocate contiguous memory when we call malloc calloc realloc

7706444
hide	show
there is just one annoying problem when the player show the video it sometimes show the top panel and sometime hide it

7706451
free	malloc
how malloc and free work is implementation defined

7706451
free	malloc
the great thing about malloc and free is that you don t need to know how they work

7706470
webclient	httpwebrequest
maybe you should use webclient or httpwebrequest instead of sockets

7706486
folder	directory
you are trying to create a filestream object for a directory folder

7706539
opera	google-chrome
according to sitepoint google-chrome is not supported here only opera and ie 8 buggy .

7706634
background-color	transparency
the background-color of the other tabs is set to transparency padding and borders lost too

7706656
folder	directory
the reason for this has something to do with sqliteopenhelper copying the database from the assets folder in the apk to the application s data directory on the phone if it doesn t already exist

7706665
listview	gridview
on the listview gridview are 3 coloumns name age grade

7706683
submit	submission
you need the grade function on the form s submit handler and it needs to be with grade returning false when it doesn t pass to prevent form submission

7706709
getter	setter
as others have said what you ve shown there is a property which is implemented as one or two methods behind the scenes one for each of the getter and setter

7706712
post	get
this is my first post so lets get into it

7706722
google-chrome	firefox
i just tested this with a larger paragraph in ie9 google-chrome 14 and firefox 7 and it looks like only ie9 works as expected

7706770
sysv	systemd
the sysv init systemd in modern ubuntu is legacy support the main startup systemd is upstart which allows you to specify a dependency on mysql

7706770
daemons	systemd
start and stop are controls for daemons managed by the upstart systemd - the control configuration files for these daemons go to etc init

7706840
width	height
in the first example the width and height are from the uicomponent class which actually represents a measured value as provided by the flex framework

7706840
width	height
in the second case the width and height are the actual size of the rendered shape as provided by the flash player

7706840
width	height
if you open the uicomponent s implementation you will notice that it is actually hiding the original meaning of width and height into width and height and provide their own implementation to it

7706840
width	height
every time you draw something in a graphics context the width and height will update accordingly

7706840
width	height
compute the width and height yourself

7706849
multiplying	transpose
instead of multiplying by your transformation matrix you have to multiplying by the transpose of the inverse of the matrix matrix4.transpose matrix4.invert transform there s a good explanation on why here

7706854
uitableview	reloaddata
i think you need call reloaddata method for your uitableview after assigned jokesarray

7706858
min	max
there will be 20 max 10 min users per game

7706858
min	max
specifically how do i poll for a room to have met the requirements i.e 20 max 10 min users

7706886
speex	ogg
i m looking for examples on how to wrap the speex format with the ogg format

7706941
min	max
in the getintwithinrange method you should allow min and max to be valid

7706952
getter	setter
i don t get why i can do all this without having made any setter getter beforehand

7706973
versioning	upgrade
i recently upgrade my php versioning on my host and i think it is causing this error

7707023
getter	setter
the synthesized methods getter and setter are needed to access the instance variables from outside the class

7707060
min	max
diff max angle1 angle2 - min angle1 angle2

7707083
folder	directory
in fallback location you can either put a path like c temp or if you leave it blank then vs will use the temporary directory in your appdata folder

7707085
getter	setter
in objective-c getter and setter are collectively called accessors

7707085
accessor	properties
you don t need to define accessor for simple properties

7707085
accessor	properties
defining a properties will cause the compiler to generate accessor

7707085
getter	setter
for more complex properties getter are nullary methods with typically the same name as the property and setter are unary methods with set prepended to the name

7707085
accessor	properties
the actual accessor may use locks rather than synchronized blocks which can have an affect with recursive properties and exceptions

7707085
getter	setter	accessor	properties
you can override the default accessor names using the getter and setter attributes in the properties declaration

7707092
hide	show
but if i hide the batch.. panel and show single.. panel changeviewbutton click event then the requieredfieldvalidator dropdownlistfieldvalidator doesn t fire up and page is always considered validated

i can put the name using post method but i must check if the user is registered in the database and only then i send it s schedule

7707172
int	chars
however this conversion from chars to int is cumbersome and fragile

7707192
superclass	subclassing
superclass implementation is only visible to direct subclassing

7707207
for-loop	loops
you shouldn t need a foreach loops for this if the for-loop is providing the indices

7707213
int	chars
int a and the data chars array are laid out sequentially in the stack there is no dereferencing involved

7707245
erlang	scheme	erlang	lisp	lisp	scheme
lisp and erlang atoms ruby and scheme symbols

7707324
folder	directory
i then store the msbuildcommunitytasks folder in a tools directory in source control

7707360
children	parent
what i m struggling with is the fact that both the child and parent elements are surrounded by another element children and parent respectively

7707363
superclass	subclassing
putting the convergence functionality in a common superclass would mean that the associated behavior and its performance impact would now exist in all subclassing which is definitely not what i want

7707438
post	get
i will post an update once i get further along..

7707521
getter	setter
there is class that makes a string name int age int grade and has getter and setter methods

7707568
jobs	cron
the cron log will tell you when cron jobs are run and changed

7707603
min	max
format is min avg max n number of timer samples in milliseconds

lisp	smalltalk
sure symbols in ruby come from symbols in smalltalk which in turn gets them from lisp

7707657
rss	feed
everything seems to be working fine but the results show as rss feed in both ie9 and firefox 7

7707657
rss	feed
so apparently browsers have xslt template that makes it appear as rss feed

7707733
pseudo-class	visited
pseudo-class allow it to add and a css name to an element like in a.menu visited

7707736
int	chars
how this works is that the functional part of my program parses a line of input and puts it into the item chars int object

put	get
edit also player is abstract and i get an error in the child class when i put some of your code in

7707807

dotnetnuke	n2cms	umbraco	n2cms	umbraco	dotnetnuke
edit i can see that mostly n2cms umbraco orchard and dotnetnuke are referenced everywhere

7707843
int	chars
all you really need to do is cast the chars to an int

7707870
nsurl	nsstring
your problem is that the nsarray returned by contains nsurl objects not nsstring objects

7707870
nsurl	nsstring
since nsarray returns an id there isn t any compile-time checking to make sure your cast makes sense but you do get a runtime error when you try to send an nsstring selector to what is actually an nsurl

7707870
nsurl	nsstring
you could convert the nsurl objects to nsstring and use your code mostly as-is but there s no need for you to handle the url decoding yourself

7707882
post	get
you are setting the method to post and then setting up the url you are posting to as a get

7707918

7708023
parsley	robotlegs
personally my choice has either been parsley or robotlegs

7708101
min	max
i m reading that the aggregate functions min max and count operate on strings plus other nonnumeric data types

7708109
innodb	myisam
this happens most often when you have one table that is myisam and one table that is innodb

7708109
innodb	myisam
the fix is to either make both tables innodb or myisam and not to mix them

7708125
integer	fractions
so the slider accepts integer numbers and then transforms them into your fractions see onchange function

7708251
post	get
the bookmark image is fine however if clicking on the post i get the story s popover and a different image is shown

7708255

i am trying to figure out the best way to set a max width height of these images and make the check before they get uploaded

7708389
width	height
document.getelementbyid #image_id height + width to see the size

7708418
mouseover	mouseleave
try could even try using using instead of handling the mouseover and mouseleave events individually.also if possible use delegation instead of using live

7708435
ant	maven
tfs build server can build anything you want you can use it to launch ant or maven or javac.exe if you want

7708573
consistency	acid
the c in acid consistency

7708667

gmail	hotmail
the google first send the reconfirm email to the user email and if direct email from hotmail yahoo or gmail then google directly add the person as a member

in your case you could use an avplayer and avplayerlayer to play your movie and an avcapturesession an avcapturevideopreviewlayer and an avcapturemoviefileoutput to record

7708802
getter	setter
given that we know the name of the object property the form component can then easily bind the result of that form field to the respective object property using getter and setter

7708861
for-loop	loops
this problem does not occur if i don t do it in for loops however i d like to do it in a for-loop

7708893
portrait	landscape

7708893
portrait	landscape
the original zxing scanning mode is in landscape but my requirement is in portrait mode so i changed the landscape design in to portrait

put	get
the problem is there s no route for a get to that path since devise changed it to delete and capybara doesn t support put and delete without some js workarounds

7708914
width	margin
if you set the caption s left property to 50 and then give it a negative left margin equal to half its width it should center it perfectly

7708984
width	height
then simply divide the world coordinates by the tile width and height to get the map coordinates

7709070

width	height
actually i don t know that there is available any php function to crop and re-size a image with given parameters x1 y1 x2 y2 width height and image name

7709249
width	height
in other words imagecopyresampled will take an rectangular area from src_image of width src_w and height src_h at position src_x src_y and place it in a rectangular area of dst_image of width dst_w and height dst_h at position dst_x dst_y

7709249
width	height
if the source and destination coordinates and width and height differ appropriate stretching or shrinking of the image fragment will be performed

7709254
folder	directory
i think if you copy index.php and .htaccess from the zend framework public folder and put it in your public_html or equivalent directory

7709264
post	get
your each web service request is simple http get post identified by a unique http uri

7713113
freemarker	velocity

7713411
postgresql	mysql
for the stress testing i ve heard about but haven t used super smack which is a benchmarking and stress testing tool for mysql and postgresql

7713475

filtering	grouping
it does this so that there is a notion of a selected item s filtering grouping etc none of which are supported by the ienumerable assigned to the itemssource

7713939
listbox	icollectionview
upon further investigation it appears as though setting issynchronizedwithcurrentitem really only applies to the selected item and all other properties across the two icollectionviews are still synchronized even though each listbox has its own icollectionview - changing the filter or adding a sortdescription to one will add it to the other you learn something new everyday

7713939
listbox	icollectionview
to change this behaviour you need to create the icollectionview for each listbox yourself and then directly modify the filter property for example

7713945
onitemlongclicklistener	onitemclicklistener
i have tried to register some listeners directly on the listview instance onitemlongclicklistener oncreatecontextmenulistener onitemclicklistener but none of them is called

7714127

7718274
haskell	scheme
since you don t have those benefits with haskell lists its main raison d ãªtre is gone and you might as well use merge sort which guarantees o n log n whereas with quicksort you either have to use randomization or complicated partitioning scheme to avoid o n 2 run time in the worst case

inherited	properties
every function has a prototype properties it s assigned when the function object is created it points to a newly created object that inherited from object.prototype and it has a constructor properties that simply points back to the function itself

7719184
inherited	properties
the purpose of the prototype properties is to give a way to implement inherited using constructor functions

7719184
inherited	properties
this properties is inherited by the instances of foo so you can know which constructor was used to create an object

7719184
inherited	properties
another similar case is when you have two or more levels of inherited using constructors the most common way is used to denote the inherited relationship between the functions is to assign the prototype properties of the second level

7719184
inherited	properties
the above code has several problems first it executes the logic of the parent constructor to create the inherited relationship but that s another story in the above example the constructor properties is also affected since we replace completely the child.prototype object

maven	pom.xml
i think being able to write your scripts in any other language than xml is pretty cool and it is not clear to me whether polyglot maven pom.xml files are still a feasible option

7719804
int	chars	unsigned	short
4.5 integral promotions conv.prom 1 an rvalue of type chars signed chars unsigned chars short int or unsigned short int can be

7719804

many-to-one	one-to-many
one-to-many and many-to-one relationships are structurally the same just mirror images of each other

7720058
single-quotes	double-quotes
note that what i did was to disable the single-quotes around the parts and add double-quotes around them in case the environment variable contains spaces which awk wouldn t want to see splitting its argument into pieces

7720061

recently i have been investigating compatibility with other browsers to allow the system to be used via ipad and have found that there is a problem with this function when using safari or google-chrome

don t what to diverge your attention to the wrong direction but i thought there was something fishy with the equals and gethashcode but i couldn t prove it so far - no repro using a unit testing framework

7720133

if you don t want that wrapping too you can use a different div for the content and restrict it s height and width and give it a right float

7720173
button	checkbox
if you run this code up check the checkbox and click the button you ll be returned to the form with the checkbox still checked even though the bound model property is false

7720206
width	height
img02 is displayed as a vertical image despite of width height and image format is correct

7720276

7720283
ant	maven
the migration from maven to gradle isn t as easy as from ant to maven at the least at the moment

7720298

metaclass	subclassing
the trouble is that any subclassing of myclass0 has to be an instance of the same metaclass which means myclass1 gets created with mymeta.__new__ so its methods get processed and wrapped in the timing code

one thing i noticed is that c# doesn t like to do bit manipulation and use boolean operators on anything other than int

i tested it with gcc 4.6.1 with g++ and with no optimization g is shorter

7720829
int	boolean
another note since you tagged this c as well in c if you don t use boolean from but rather int s then the advantage of one version over the other disappears since both now have to do some sort of testing

min	max	range	min	range	max
note that using has a few drawbacks if max - min + 1 is not a power of two it will slightly bias the results towards the low end of the range because it will not divide rand_max+1 evenly

7721084
serializable	deserialization
you d need to write you re own serializable deserialization code and plug it into wcf

min	max
i am putting together a program that takes 20 random numbers sorts them into 4 sections and calculates the min and max values for each section

7721442
min	max
the issue i m having is getting the min and max values to reset to default after each run through

7721442
min	max
the error with my code is that i have no way of handling the max values once the highest value or min values have been processed whether it be at the beginning of the file or in the middle

7721479
min	max
you can reset max and min after they are used - inside the if block after the printing

7721498

if you placed img1 in the middle of the composite image then you placed it with its upper left hand corner at img2- width img2- height

7721531
width	height
make a translation matrix 1 0 img2- width 0 1 img2- height 0 0 0

7721543
min	max
while working with section 1 you get max 9 and min 2

7721543
min	max
what your code is doing is continue to work with section 2 without reseting max and min to appropriate values

7721543
min	max
you should reset the max and min value just like the way you have done it at the beginning

7721543
min	max
the right place to do it is right after you have used the min and max value

7721551
next	except

say the first 4 bytes is a unsigned int the next byte is chars the next 4 bytes is signed int and the last 2 bytes are unsigned short int

7721791
feof	fread
secondly feof fread etc require a file handle not a curl handle or the returned data which is why your error message is showing that you re sending a string through

i ended up using keycode.js but am building a whole event-managing system around keydown keypress and keyup events because just one of the events keydown is not enough to determine which character was entered and which key was pressed if there is no corresponding character

for width and height use

7722600

to exclude a whole directory just create the following .htaccess file in that folder

7722631
wav	caf
the best advantage of caf over wav is while recording when you can have files more than 4 gb and also in caf you don t need to update the wav header after each packet recording

7722631
wav	caf
and as justin said i do believe that wav will be the better option as you can have more support for wav than the caf format

edit#2 it turns out that the decoder httputility.htmldecode will work for your purpose but the encoder will not since you don t want angle brackets to be encoded

7722847
inherited	properties
the for-in loop will loop though all inherited properties of an object as well as its own properties

7722847
for-loop	arrays
the recommended way to iterate an arrays is to use the normal for-loop

7722866
int	chars
so basically will return the int value of the second chars typed

7722892
drawimage	putimagedata
i take no credit for putting this test together but you can clearly see the performance of using drawimage with both a canvas and an image as well as the performance of putimagedata here

7722892

as of right now drawimage is much faster than putimagedata

inherited	properties
this ensures the properties was directly invoked on the object and not inherited somewhere along the prototype chain

7723095
folder	directory
dont forget that urls dont then have to reflect folder structure- i would suggest you lay your directory folder out in a way that is ordered for someone creating maintaining the site more human readable locations can then be handled in .htaccess

7723104
pop-up	dialog
i have a dialog that pop-up as result of an error condition

7723104
mouse	keyboard
i want the dialog to remain open for at least 30 seconds and close 30 seconds after the last user input mouse or keyboard is received

7723104
pop-up	dialog	mouse	keyboard
i can implement this by checking the value returned by getlastinputinfo and closing the dialog when this is more than 30 seconds ago but if the dialog pop-up when the user hasn t been at the mouse or keyboard for 30 seconds the getlastinputinfo test passes immediately and the dialog closes again immediately

7723149
post	get
in this instance your .php page could include js javascript in the head whether linked or inline which would contain details for launching an ajax request- namely how often or on what trigger button press etc by what means post or get what is sent any other variables you wish what the target script is the script which will handle the request and output your required content data and what to do when the response is recieved which element on the page should be updated with the response

7723152
inherited	properties
in essence an object inherited all properties of its prototype but an object s own properties has higher precedence than those of its prototype

7723152
inherited	properties
thus both t1 and t2 inherited its properties

7723152
inherited	properties
this operation will create an a properties on the object itself it s own properties this will override the inherited a properties on test.testobj.prototype

7723193
rtp	rtsp	udp	tcp	udp	rtp
generally rtsp is based on tcp and rtp is based on udp

7723193
rtp	rtsp
if rtp session is closed that does not mean that rtsp connection should also be teardown whereas rtp channels must be closed on rtsp channel teardown

uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
the app structure is a uitabbarcontroller with a couple of uinavigationcontroller inside it

7723422
int	boolean
another error is that you are directly comparing boolean and int value

7723442
int	boolean
int and boolean are two different types and can never be equal to each other

7723442
int	boolean
an int has 2 32 values whereas a boolean has only two true and false

7723457
slug	permalinks

pyuic	pyqt
if you want to create a gui using qt you may build it up with qt designer a tool in the qt creator ide then convert forms in python code by using the pyuic compiler that comes with pyqt

7723780
getter	setter
in that case it would seem to be better to just a create a pojo simple object with those fields and the appropriate getter and setter and or constructor as you wish

7723851
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
if you have an objectoutputstream at one end you must have an objectinputstream at the other end

i always been interested on how we can accomplish this hide show the main menu using the alt key and now some applications do this very often

7724006
width	height
a div tag by default will be flexible in height and width it adjusts itself according to the content placed inside it

7724006
width	height
you should be fine as long as you do not set the height and width css properties explicitly

7724006
width	height
just a note in case of nested divs just be sure that you do not set the height and width property of the inner div

7724323
shadowing	named
it also has the practical effect of avoiding shadowing of instance variables from argument named which also occur in some situations

7724335
getter	setter
when you synthesize a property and you do not provide your own getter and setter methods in which case there is no need to synthesize then there is always a new instance variable created

7724335
getter	setter
when you make something a property best practice says you should always access it through self.propertyname except in your init and dealloc methods and any custom getter and setter methods

7724337
maven	pom.xml
pom.xml file is disabled hence i can not select it and create a maven project

7724367
apache	nginx
i have a problem with nginx when migrating from apache

7724394
mojolicious	catalyst
and mapping the url to the dispatch would highly depend on the underlying cms model view controller framework which is why frameworks such as catalyst mojolicious and other already provide this feature

7724395
post	get
but what you can do is trigger only the required method with a post get variable from jquery

7724395
post	get
means you have to add as you did before a post call to the file with the functions and yes - change the method so that it gets triggered as soon as a certain post get variable is included in the call

7724428
cassini	iis
it s not possible to launch cassini or iis via md s configuration options but monodevelop s open-source so you could add that feature if you want

std ostringstream is for formatting and there s no

7724544
width	height
when specifying the coordinates and height and width of the new pixmaps i require that all units be in pixels

7724544
width	height
sadly the last two numbers of the tuple are interpreted as width and height when passed to drawpixmap qrect qpixmap which are in the units cm

7724544
width	height
either by passing a pixel width and height or the two pixel coordinates of the corners of the dimension box

7724544
qpainter	qrect
i can t find a way in the qpainter or qrect class references

7724554
multiplying	add
you could substitute any kind of reduction operator you like for the floating point multiplying add summation operation which a dot product uses and the code should work ok

7724616
ant	maven
your best bet is to use ant findbugs or maven findbugs plugin to generate the findbugs xml report perhaps daily using a hudson job based on what build mechanism you use ant or maven

7724616
ant	maven
in the same job if you have the findbugs plugin enabled you can configure it with hudson by specifying the findbugs result xml location generated by the ant or maven task and hudson will prepare the report

7724653

to be able to print it you need a string representation binary hex decimal base64 etc.

7724858
db4o	eloquera
eloquera is multihreaded in opposite to db4o

7724874
jobs	cron
you may need to have a look into cron jobs if you want that script query to be executed automatically

7724896
sysml	uml
if it s an option you might look into using sysml instead of uml

7724896
sysml	uml
sysml was designed for systems analysis design and as a consequence does not have all the modelling elements to represent fine detail that uml has

7724906
mouseleave	mouseenter
when checking for mouseleave on a i check if there is a mouseenter on the div

7724950
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsitem
it s a jigsaw puzzle game which basically cuts a pixmap into smaller pixmaps puzzle pieces and displays them as qgraphicsitem s in a qgraphicsview

7724950
qgraphicsitem	qobject
the items inherit qgraphicsitem and qobject and have q_property macros for the pos and rotation of the qgraphicsitem to enable animating them with the qt animation framework

7724957
inherited	properties
now any instanceof any class which inherited member when calling the membername properties will return the right representation

7724968

google-chrome	firefox
well all of this works properly in every browser google-chrome firefox ie6 ie9 except ie8 the nivoslider loads only the first image shows no caption no navigation

7725021
mouseleave	mouseenter
i would suggest that you add a mouseenter and mouseleave callback to you element as well and have them set a global variable that tells your other callbacks how to handle their events if global variable is true don t hide the popup on mouseleave otherwise hide popup or something like this

7725112
public	protected
i couldn t think of a good naming convention for a protected property with a public getter so i tried to do this

7725133
implements	extends
another differnce between the two is that a class my implements many interfaces but can extends only one abstract class multiple inheritance

7725143
jar	war

7725217
inherited	subclassing
in the class implementation of common state and behaviour that will be inherited by subclassing

7725217
abstract-class	superclass
for any abstract methods declared in its superclass must be declared as an abstract-class

7725253
post	put
it definitely is much better to write a php script which the iphone app can interface to with a simple api and sending the details as parameters in a post request or put request rest style api rather than interfacing with the server directly

7725253
post	get
in your iphone app you would then create a native register form using uitextfields and the like and then once the user hits the register button it will execute a post request to send the data to the server and will get back a response which you can see if the data the user entered is valid

7725266
implements	extends
remember a class can extends only one class where as it can implements more than one interface

7725266
implements	extends
you can t extends more than one class in java where as you can implements any number of interfaces

7725267
queue	fifo
in the case of a priority queue the elements are sorted so the first element off the queue is the element with the highest priority or if all the elements have the same priority it leads back to your first question which is no it will not be guaranteed to be in fifo order since many implementations use a heap-sort and the results of the sort will be ambiguous for objects of equal priority since a heap is a linear-representation of a binary tree for two equal child objects there becomes an ambiguous choice between the two children of the root to choose as the new root node when removing the root node from the queue during a pop .

7725267
queue	fifo
in other words objects of the same priority will be grouped together but the order they are popped from the queue may not be in fifo order

7725351
children	parent
pushing and popping any item on a heap simply updates the elements in it in such a way that there is no node where its children are larger than the parent for max heap

7725351
children	parent
in the case where both children have the same priority and one of them must take the place of the parent there is no distinction made on choosing which node to promote

7725362
folder	directory
it is easier to just change apache virtual hosts to point your project folder as the base directory instead of having 2 copies of the same thing and syncing

7725415
boyer-moore	knuth-morris-pratt
however swapping std search for an implementation of a non trivial algorithm boyer-moore as mentioned above or knuth-morris-pratt should have an impact that is larger by several orders of magnitude compared to fine-tuning the return mechanism

7725424
listview	gridview
listview provides both an alignment layout of gridview and virtualization

7725495
mouseleave	mouseenter
i believe the problem with your implementation is that the mouseenter on the div will fire shortly after the mouseleave from the a

7725501
post	get
i would not recommend this for the simple reason if you are integrating with other systems web services in different parts of the organisation or third-party vendors you ll end up having to deal with strings and int s anyway and you ll have to make your code even more complex by having to wrap names in name objects when you get them from other systems and unwrapping them when you want to post them to other systems

7725507
cvs	svn
i m writing an eclipse plug-in that visualizes the history of a project so i m looking for ways to programmatically use the cvs svn git plug-ins in eclipse to get the source-code history of a project

i have created an application which required to support landscape portrait mode

7725662
portrait	landscape
for that i have set portrait layout in layout folder and landscape layout in layout-land folder

7725662
portrait	landscape
landscape and change layout but when again change mode then simulator change in portrait mode but layout is not change it is used landscape layout

7725684
post	get
first of all lets get your example running your post data is json and the datatype is json but your ci implementation is accessing post variables

7725692
union	distinct
union already returns distinct results so there s no need to do it explicitly.

7725700
textview	imageview
i need to rotate a layout has a textview and imageview and it should be placed align right and top in relativelayout

7725701

profiling	debugging
a common approach to debugging memory leaks in .net is to use the sos -extension you ll find some tutorials like this if you do some research or to use a memory profiling like this one

7725791
profiling	debugging
i would try debugging managed memory issues with the clr profiling

7725806

cakephp	kohana	codeigniter	kohana	codeigniter	cakephp
cakephp is pretty straightforward like codeigniter and kohana

7725929
post	get
however this always goes through as a get request not a post request and the api server consequently rejects it

7725990
swt	swing
toolkit--like swing or eclipse swt

7726034
integer	fractions
i agree with this for integer numbers of seconds and for format flag s but i think the behavior should be different for format flags that are designed for fractions parts of seconds

7726034
integer	fractions
this would not affect anything for integer numbers of seconds because those are always represented precisely but it would more naturally handle round-off errors for fractions seconds

7726034
integer	fractions
this is how printing of fractions parts is handled in for example c because integer casting rounds down

7726034
integer	fractions
most constructs are designed for integer numbers of seconds and the fractions parts are an afterthought

7726130
post	get
i m pretty sure most of what i did there is wrong so any help would be appreciated even if it is some directions to post which treat simmilar issues so i can try and get it from there

7726145
typemock	moles
you could also use typemock to do the same thing although the licence cost is prohibitory for most people and moles works just fine

7726160
ilist	icollection
secondly arrays implement ilist of t and icollection of t but the methods are implemented explicitly you have to cast and the add insert remove throw not implemented exception

7726168
pop-up	dialog
when the dialog pop-up i click on a file having chinese characters in its path

7726175
post	get
a single http request according to the protocol is either get or post

7726280
queue	fifo
1- if you want to enforce the fifo ordering when elements have the same priority add a field t to your class it s says when element is added to the priority queue and in operator compare t if two elements had the same priority

7726330
width	height
that is something with a width and height

7726330
width	height
you ll have to pass along the width height with the pointer for safe use

7726330
width	height
you can also avoid this by simply creating a struct to store your image being sure to always initialize maintoin the width and height correctly

7726330
width	height
another trick could be to overallocate float to store the width and height in the buffer itself

7726331
width	height
you can get the browser viewport width and height with javascript and submit them using ajax to the image creation script

7726344

post	get
as i understand from the question below it should be possible to use different models for get and post actions

7726416
post	get
related question using two different models in controller action for post and get

7726437
nsdictionary	restkit	post	get
it seems to me that restkit is the easiest way to do this i m trying to avoid converting objects into a set of nsdictionary objects and then using some json encoder to get json which i can post to the server

7726503
post	get
get and post controller actions can easily use whatever types they need to

7726530
post	get
however in development mode i m having trouble doing so - it seems that every post request i make is somehow turned into a options one so i never get the response i want

7726563
post	get
right now all my attempts show either duplicate dates - if there are 3 post in october then i see october 2011 3 times or i only get back one month year combo say oct 2011

it might be jpeg png or gif

7726600
hash	md5
by default amazon s3 objects have their etag set to the md5 hash of the object

7726600
hash	md5
we can then specify the md5 hash of the xml document inside the getobjectrequest.etagtonotmatch property

7726600
hash	md5
this ensures that when we make the amazons3.getobject call or in my case the async version amazons3.begingetobject and amazons3.endgetobject that if the document being requested has the same md5 hash as is contained in the getobjectrequest.etagtonotmatch then s3 automatically returns the http status code 304 notmodified and the actual contents of the xml document is not downloaded

7726603
x86	64bit
i can t remember exactly but the tortoisesvn version might have been 32-bit version and the tortoisegit version was 64bit located in program files not program files x86

width	height
i m trying to split a large html page into smaller fixed height and width chunks pages

7741033
width	height
but one important thing i noticed here thanks to matthew steeples answer here is that since the block of code that i have tested has not used the variables height and width except for assignment in the if-else and if blocks of code block-1 and 2 respectively the compiler has optimized the il code by completely removing the if and if-else blocks in question thus showing invalid results for our test here

7741033
width	height
i have updated both the code blocks to write the values of both height and width to a file thus using them again and forcing the compiler to run our test blocks i hope but you can observe from the code that the actual file writing part does not effect our test results

7741081
ready	each
it explicitly shows in a ready format what the strings should be for each case

inline	member-functions
without reading the passage it s a little hard to say exactly what s going on here but if squarematrix is a templated wrapper class around a template base-class squarematrixbase and the purpose of squarematrix is to basically pass the appropriate template parameters to the base-class as well as provide a couple non-static data-members for the functions of the base-class to operate on then you can since the member-functions of squarematrix will basically be simple functions that are just calling the functions defined in the base-class inline all the member functions for squarematrix

i m writing some automated tests using capybara rspec i choose configure the driver by using this little bit of ruby

7742868
post	get
you need to use to get parameter from a post form

7742882

7742912
vim	emacs
both of these integrate with emacs and vim

7742936

7742947
mouse	keyboard
select isn t meant to be used this way â there are hacks you can use to get this kind of behavior in most cases like tracking mouse and keyboard events on the select but thereâ s no guarantee theyâ ll keep working or work on every platform

7742956
ienumerable	ilist
if you want to preserve changes you have to materialize your data first using tolist and then return the list as an ienumerable or ilist

7743109
getter	setter
this behaviour in the case of byref vs byval usage is easily solved by choosing appropriate byval keyword however hase recently noticed a more insidious behaviour one that has caused a stack overflow of repeated calls since the setter call would update a value that called the getter only

7743109
getter	setter
in the previous example calling dosomething would fire the aproperty getter method but then after that usage would fire the setter method which by program logic calls dosomething again

7743114
min	max	range	min	range	max
for example if you are going to only have integers between a range of min and max values as a criteria then the problem becomes simpler

min	max
you only need to know the field name and the min max values to describe a criterian not the full where statement.

7743205
put	get
that said you can put an opc server client architecture on top of that to get a bit more powerful communication

7743262
awt	swing
addendum this overview suggests how pervasively the interface java.beans.propertychangelistener is used throughout awt and swing

7743340
jtextfield	jlabel
i have created a jtextfield and inserted a jlabel above it and defined the lock icon for the jlabel

7743340
jtextfield	jlabel
if the jtextfield is editable then the jlabel appears fine as the image above shows but if the jtextfield is not editable then the image does not appear at all

7743383
serializable	deserialization
serializable deserialization can be tricky especially when you have lots of nested components

7743402
versioning	upgrade
before i ve been using carbon emacs as the versioning 1 of starter kit recommends but versioning 2 does requires me to upgrade emacs 24

7743449
width	height
i have the width and height set with vertical-align middle

7743470
hash	salt
hash hash password salt salt2 timestamp where hash password salt is stored in the database and salt2 is newly generated makes sure than an attacker can t get the password or any data which will be useful for logging in after the timestamp expires it alone does not prevent an active attacker to hijack the session after the authentication and send any soap requests wanted and intercept the responses

7743470
hash	salt
if you have only one message to send you can instead use the mac as a kind of symmetric signature using the password hash salt and generated with a slow hash function as a mac key

7743491
zend-paginator	zend-db
loosely couple zend-paginator to other zend framework components so that users who wish to use it independently of zend-view zend-db etc

7743543
pop-up	dialog
usually my wpf dialog are all contentcontrols that get displayed in a pop-up

7743595
hide	show
i usually try avoid global variables within jquery plug-ins for functions like your show and hide but the critical part is elements

7743597
int	chars
unsigned chars will be promoted to unsigned int

7743617
isnull	nullif
or isnull something nullif ... 0 0 to get null instead

7743667
int	double	nsinteger	double
otherwise use a pod like nsinteger int or double

7743742
weka	libsvm
you can also use svm directly from libsvm which weka actually wraps

7743743
lisp	scheme
i m baffled by trying to create the equivalent of this trivial in common lisp macro in mit scheme

7743743
lisp	scheme
also references to good tutorials not references on scheme s macro system that start with small simple examples and build up with ample commentary and in particular show how to convert backquote-comma style lisp macros which to me are highly intuitive to scheme s syntax macro system would be great

7743762
put	get
i just need to get my welcome message to stay put on every page

7743842
int	chars
it s only a modifier for int short chars

7743842
int	chars	unsigned	short
the unsigned keyword can be used as a modifier for int short chars or long

7743852
stdout	stderr
the standard streams stdout and stderr cannot be closed and you silence the warning with quiet

7743855
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works in ie9 google-chrome firefox and safari but client is stuck on ie 7 and 8

7743859
int	double
the precise size of these variables depends on your system s architecture 32 bit verses 64 bit so you need to confirm the correspondence between int floats and double in c and fortran on your system

7743865
int	chars
i think it was chosen as a separate keyword since it can be applied to any int type chars int long long long thereby achieving with one keyword what would have required four more

7743876
intersect	contains
two arrays contains objects is not returning intersect when using between the arrays

7743907
post	get
after reading a few post as well as the official google blog i understand that a valid mobile site that will get indexed in google mobile search is made with different markup languages than html4

7743980
google-chrome	firefox
edit this seems to be firefox specific a quick solution is to use google-chrome instead

7744033
unsigned	short
the keywords signed unsigned short and long are type modifiers specifier and when one of these type modifiers specifier is used by itself a data type of int is assumed

7744047
opera	firefox
unfortunately firefox and opera do not easily support multi-line tooltips

7744168
spaces	delimiter
in fact i just now ran it and it also read the line that you indicated would not work and it reads just two words since the operator in that case will use white spaces as a delimiter for the string

7744168
spaces	delimiter
a possible reason for the failure is if the line preceding the +lda #5 line has more than three words delimiter by spaces

7744192
inherited	properties
in the real world as commenters have stated you would typically not use inherited in this scenario but instead use properties to differentiate based on age or gender

7744193
public	protected
in this case auth_person1 2 would be private check_person1 2 would be protected and get_person would be public

7744197
eazfuscator	dotfuscator
you could also use .net reactor another obfuscator service that goes well beyond both eazfuscator and dotfuscator in capabilities but it does have a cost

7744220
put	get
i ve tried a variety of different things but i really don t know what to put in for data and keyfunc and get it to return the groups of data i want in a print statement

7744229
ssl	https
the browser does a lot of work for you regarding ssl certificates when you visit a site using https

7744263
public	protected
everything bellow the method private is private until you call one of the other methods private public or protected

7744350
client-side	server-side
however as detailed here dart is intended for server-side as well as client-side use

7744382
stdout	stderr
a simple way can be redirecting both stderr and stdout to the file like this

7744400
ubuntu	linux
i work in my office on ubuntu linux operating system

7744414
post	get
for example what if the feed includes a paragraph of text it ll be impractical for me to post that as a get request and then urldecode the entire thing

7744432
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i html validated it and it looks just the way i want it to in firefox but in google-chrome and safari the #main div doesn t have the background color showing and the break tag with css set to clear both doesn t clear the way it does in firefox

7744436
int	double
also i would like to receive different var types int long double and still be able to use the same code

7744479
jar	manifest.mf
if it were a jar file then it had to be specified in the class-path entry in jar s meta-inf manifest.mf file

7744489
rtsp	sdp
i ve tried sending the same rtsp packets to a port 5006 on localhost over udp then providing ffmpeg with the sdp file that tells it which local port the video stream is coming in on and how to decode the video if i understand rtsp streaming correctly

7744493
oncreate	ondestroy
the safest bet is to cancel the notifications you have running in both the ondestroy and oncreate methods

7744498
width	height
you can see that to handle sizing child views which supply match_parent as the height when the linearlayout is set to wrap_content the linearlayout pretends to have an absolute height recalculates the child height and then reuses the child width from the previous measure pass

7744498
width	height
basically your image is calculating height and width unconstrained and getting default width and height and then having height recalculated but being forced to use the old width

7744542
wordpress	mybb
it utilizes mybb as the base forum package but integrates seamlessly with wordpress

7744575
unsigned	short
note what s missing no signed or unsigned keywords no short long or long double

7744575
unsigned	short
when other types were added later it made sense to add specifiers like unsigned short and long to the existing type names rather than introducing new keywords which might have broken existing code

7744575
integer	unsigned
perhaps there would be a single keyword for each fundamental type that s the approach taken by c# for example or perhaps the fundamental type names would use some more coherent scheme rather than a jumble of keywords say int 2 for a 2-byte integer unsigned 4 for a 4-byte unsigned integer

7744583
hide	show
the active class is working but the hide show is not

7744588
disk	ram
reserving 4gb of ram may require mac os to expand swap space and you may not have the disk space to do this

7744590
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in google-chrome and firefox but i get this error when running it in ie8

7744655
codeigniter	kohana
alternatively you can use a fork of codeigniter which is specifically designed for hmvc called kohana framework

7744703
for-loop	loops
my guess is in the parser there is a for-loop over the csv file that constantly updates the session on the bright side at least they realized to comment out initializing the models in the iteration loops and add them before

7744713
width	height
canvas .attr id options.id .css width options.width height options.height

7744713
width	height
you are setting the css width height of the canvas when you need to be setting the width and height attributes directly

7744713
width	height
note that changing the width or height of a canvas clears it so this must be done before using drawimage

7744720
subtract	add
don t complicate this by trying to add forms and subtract forms

7744726
ubuntu	centos
i m using centos and ubuntu

7744758

7744788
vsto	add-in
i m working on a vsto add-in for outlook that if another custom vsto is loaded will perform a specific action

7744804
width	height
detecting whether the text is wrapping is easy enough in principle -- you set the iframe width wait for the fb code to adjust the content and then read the height

7744920
range	minimum
however i wish to add another condition of minimum stay if the date range has a date in it and rateid form another table called minimum stay

7744920
range	min
the rate table already has a min stay but on certain dates i want to over ride this if the date falls within the date range i pass

7744939
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
we are having absolutely no issues with every browser ie firefox safari except google-chrome

7744945
int	boolean
it s because when you compare a string to an int they don t both get converted to strings or to boolean - they get converted to int

7744949
boost	stl
if you become a professional c++ programmer boost will become one of your best friends outside of the stl

7744961
move	drag
the goal is if they click on an and drag less than 20 px the link fires otherwise the drag should just move the panel

7744972

debian ubuntu etc hostname

7744972
redhat	fedora
redhat centos fedora etc sysconfig network

7744999

vmware	virtualbox
i am studying rdtsc and learning about how it is virtualized for the purposes of virtual machines like virtualbox and vmware

7745547
put	get

7745639
ant	maven
and maybe replace the the cvs and ant with subversion and maven or perhaps something else

7745656
google-chrome	safari
i managed to get the desired effect working perfectly in google-chrome and safari on my local machine

7745752
post	get
before the block where you get the data from post and replace every equal sign after the where in your query with the keywork like

7745755
dictionary	map
i think the underlying issue is with the way dictionary are handled after the map definition has been compiled

7745810
google-chrome	firefox
this works great in google-chrome and ie9 but for some reason firefox sees the input elements as undefined

7745818
hide	show
also it would probably be better practice to show and hide your content rather than adding and removing html

7745823

put	get
i have tried so hard to put things in the center in css but i just dont get it

7745919
ssl	https
the best thing to do is to perform this action over ssl https so that the entire transaction is encrypted and the authentication only happens on the server

7745919
hash	salt
the web server decrypts the data and passes it to your server-side authentication function where you look up the user and associated salt perform password + salt + hash and compare it to the stored hash for a match

7745919
hash	salt
this means that the hash and then salt never need to be transmitted from the server at all

any large scale flash flex app can get pretty unwieldy without a micro-framework adobe has pushed cairngorm but i personally prefer robotlegs there s also puremvc which i used before robotlegs i prefer rl because it uses native as3 events as well as dependency injection which is easier to test

7747076
sorting	grouping
ok so i am sorting a grouping of dashboard widgets with jquery ui and would like to retain the new order of the widgets

7747077
realloc	fgetc
fgetc gets anything else and line is already completely filled then you realloc new memory for line and grow the current line to be more specific it is practical to double the size of line in this step

7747077
realloc	fgetc
so basically you need to inform yourself about fgetc and realloc and combine these two functions and some auxiliary functions to get what you want

7747133
firefox	safari
the problem does not exist in firefox safari or ie9

7747180
width	height
first you should set the maximum width height equal to the minimum width height in ib

haskell	agda
because we re talking about an injective function that takes a function haskell s forall can be seen as a type-level function and that s how it s encoded in agda i use point-wise equality the âˆ i â x i â y i because agda s logic won t let me prove that x â y directly

7747289
x86	64bit

children	parent
just remember in a nested set all children s left values are greater than and right values are less than the parent

7747334
comparator	comparable
date implements the comparable interface therefore you can use the method comparator to compare between two dates

7747341
int	chars
i thought shift operator shifts the memory of the int or the chars on which it is applied but the output of the following code came a surprise to me

7747410
getter	setter
the only alternative way i can think of would involve editing or extending and creating your own db set the db_result class to use getter setter instead of direct fields - perhaps with call_user_func_array

7747451
put	get
but because there are 100 settings and their respective get set functions i didn t want to put them all under the circuitcontroller class

7747468
waitpid	fork
fork is thread-safe as long as you only execute async-signal-safe operations such as execve and _exit in the child process and only call waitpid with an explicit pid to avoid stealing a zombie from another part of the program

7747484
versioning	upgrade
the best would be to upgrade to the latest versioning if possible

7747512
octal	hex	octal	decimal

hash	salt
when you first store the password hash the password with a stored salt as is commonly done

hash	salt
the client will hash the plaintext password with the stored salt then the random salt and send the hash to the server

hash	salt
the server will hash the stored password with the random used in that request salt and compare

7747925
hash	salt
this is secure because it ensures that the hash being transmitted is unique to the request it uses a single-request random salt so a login cannot be faked in the future simply by sending the hash again

then you take the first map it to its meaning 0..15 multiplying it with 16 and add the second one mapped as well

7757048
width	text-align
the difference in the way text-align center works between the two is down to the width

7757048
width	text-align
in a block element because the element s width is independent of the content the content can be positioned within the element using the text-align style

7757048

7757346
getter	setter
when you use properties calling self.property actually calls the generated setter and getter and those work as specified on the property

7757359
std	ostream
a better and probably sane overload would be for std ostream as

std	ostream	ostream	istream
they re also commonly overloaded as streaming operators then means stream out stream in â with stream type on the left side std ostream or std istream and any other type on the right side

7757369
put	get
if other people view your webpage in a browser that does not have the console.log function they will get an error and your js will stop running it is normally a good idea to put calls to the console.log function inside a conditional that checks for the existance of that function

7757495
lseek	ftell
calculate the size using lseek ftell

7757518

this works fine in firefox google-chrome co but doesn t work in internet explorer - the image returned is too large

equals	gethashcode
dictionary uses gethashcode of the key to determine in which data bucket to store an object and then equals to make sure that the objects are actually equals

7757783
equals	gethashcode
in other words for this to work you will need to implement gethashcode and equals for your type

7757795
equals	gethashcode
you need to implement gethashcode and equals in the key class or provide an implementation in the constructor of the dictionary

7757795
equals	gethashcode
in the case of the comparer you would define proper gethashcode and equals methods inside the comparer for test with the benefit that these implementations are not universal for all test objects but can be used at will when necessary such as for use in dictionaries hashsets various linq queries etc. by decoupling the equality and hashcode functions from the class you are then free to use different implementations of the comparer as the need arises

7757809
spaces	delimiter
for the above i might say threshold .3 and delimiter are spaces and

7757882
width	height
i don t know how you re placing the image size you may need to change the height and width by and

7758027
subtract	add
to answer the second part of your question if you want to add a padding of say 5px around the edge of your .ad-basic-cell divs you ll need to subtract at least 10px from the width in order to do so

7758033
for-loop	loops
the for-loop is completing before any of the divs are clicked so i is equal to the final value from loops for all the click handlers and as a result all the id s are set to the same value

7758356
width	height

one solution is to use bash s process substitution to get the input to the while loop to run in a subshell instead

munin	cacti
also look at monitoring tools such as cacti munin collectd so you can understand the load on your servers

7760409

the reason why your original code works in google-chrome but not in ie and some versions of firefox is that the tag has a click method in the latter two but not in google-chrome

margin	height
what i ve noticed is that it applies the first height and margin from the first image to all of the tags

i did it in the mouseover event since as soon as the mouseenter my element i want it to be draggable not selectable

7761070
mouseover	mouseout
while dragging the mouseover mouseout event might be called

7761070
mouseup	mousedown
to counter that in your dragging mousedown event set a flag_dragging to true and set it to false when dragging stops mouseup

7761082
inherited	properties
you ll note all that we have done is change the class being inherited to contentcontrol and added a label dependency properties

7761084
hash	md5
since identical is otherwise difficult to check most people content themselves with checking if the contents of the file when run through a cryptographic hash function such as md5 or sha-1 or better sha-224 sha-256 sha-384 or sha-512 functions

7761084
hash	md5
md5 is really tempting though since tools to create and validate md5 hash are very widespread md5sum 1 on most linux systems md5 1 on most bsd systems including os x

7761086
post	put
the form sends a post request to the server but your route is for put requests

7761097

if the .slide container has a constant height you could apply display block and margin auto 0

7761148
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works in firefox google-chrome safari internet explorer 8 and 9

7761158
stdout	stderr
you also have to redirect stdout and stderr to somewhere in order for this to work correctly

7761232
google-chrome	firefox
this seems to work just fine in firefox and google-chrome although google-chrome keeps telling me i cant print within a certain amount of time

7761237

7761558
getter	setter
i want getter setter so i can make sure these constraints are being kept

7761558
getter	setter
the natural way to do this is to use an object instead of a dictionary so that you can write getter setter logic that s part of the class and wrap them up as properties

7761564
public	protected
i thought that a public inheritance would still give me access to protected methods and variable and assumed the same would be true for structs

7761564
public	protected
i checked to see if this was the only issue by changing the protected to public but the same errors still pop up

7761571
pop-up	dialog
then when you want it to pop-up i would use jquery ui dialog on that hidden div to pop it up in a dialog

7761594

7761680
folder	directory
basically i ll have a bunch of video files on a usb drive or a dvd in separate folder and when the command button is clicked i would like it to open the relevant directory in a windows explorer window

although not covered by checkstyle if pmd may be an option there is a beanmembersshouldserialize test which complains if there are any non-static and non-transient fields which have no getter and setter following the java naming conventions

7761698
ready	each
each element is created after an ajax request so basically nothing in the dom is available to bind sortable on dom ready

7761725
stdout	stderr
to reuse your as3 code stdin stdout stderr sockets pipes cgi etc

7761771
accessor	properties
i believe apple actually recommends using these accessor either dotted as you ve shown or bracketed object properties properties as opposed to the typical alternative getvalue forkey when accessing attributes properties

the various alternatives calloc realloc work roughly the same way calloc is easier to use when dealing with arrays and zero-fills the data while realloc is useful when you need to resize a block of memory

7762045
google-chrome	safari
from testing on safari google-chrome it seems it s watching the background color of the body element and the body element only

7762048

pop-up	dialog
you use an oauth dialog which has a pop-up style you can select with a parameter and include a redirect_uri parameter as the final destination for the user

strlen	calloc
will never format anything because logbuf is all zeros having been allocated by calloc and so strlen will return zero which makes vsnprintf never format anything because you told it to print at most zero characters

7762556
inherited	properties
so you have to create a new class that inherited from details view and shadows the fields properties using its own private _fields field

7762733
getter	setter	defineproperty	getter	defineproperty	setter	accessor	properties
this can be solved with accessor via defineproperty or simply named accessor methods if necessary it appears that that is what you re looking for just add all properties to the functor with defineproperty via getter setter instead of just functions if you don t need cross-engine support backwards compatability

7762738

profiling	debugging
i can see through profiling the query is actually being called and the time stamp changes each time but my debugging session shows stale data from the previous state for the person item

7763214
post	get
for that you have to issue a get request and not a post request

7763214

google-chrome	firefox
it doesnt work in very old versions of firefox + google-chrome though

7764299
getter	setter
while the code in the loop is pretty simple the application is not at all small with abuse of singletons and getter setter and it hardens the debugging so i wouldn t be surprised of it

7764301
profiling	debugging
if you want to debugging that you ll need to run that tomcat server with debugging enabled and set up a remote debugging profiling in eclipse

7764326

7765018
put	get
however in var_dec when i try to put the first element of the list i am using only get 0 just to see the return value from dec_list rule i can iterate it later that s not my point into mapping i get a whole string like

7765037
punctuation	words
the levenshtein distance has been suggested to me but this seems like it wouldn t cope well with longer strings considering differences in punctuation choices whitespace etc.--missing the first words would wreck the entire algorithm even if every other words were perfect

7765043
int	chars
i think you can use atoi to get the chars converted to int

7765059
awt	swing
the first advice i would offer is don t mix swing awt components

7765059
awt	swing
try updating the oracle forms jar to a swing version or failing that use only awt components in your code

ant	maven
what i am currently considering is using fabric with cygwin on the windows machines and use ant tasks in maven to orchestrate it all

use a different named variable in the query to the one used to contain the post value in order to make sure that content you put in the query is only the content that you have sanitised or crafted yourself

7765336
implements	extends
another more risky approach is to implements your own database class by copying or extends the sqlitedatabase.java from the android source and reimplement or override the critical parts which are

7765382
ubuntu	linux
behaviour occurs so far on ubuntu 10.4 and on custom openembedded linux

this number can be either a int double or any other numeric type

7765903
ccscene	cclayer
so you might be able to create a cclayer to use as your root layer and add two children to it - a root ccscene and a cclayer for your gui with a higher z order

7765903
ccscene	cclayer
if you give it the ccscene child of your root cclayer it may not draw the cclayer and its gui child

7765918
int	chars
i m pretty sure you can t capture a chars into an int

7765918

i know that with a traditional desktop esc of the keyboard and double click with left button of the mouse allow to exit from fullscreen like youtube

7766162

no keyboard no mouse

7766192
g++	gcc
if you compile cpp code with gcc and not with g++ you must link with -lstdc++ so that option is definitely missing

7766231
google-chrome	firefox
for some reason this works fine in google-chrome but it wonâ t update in firefox

7766231
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine on google-chrome but just wonâ t change anything on firefox inside the updatepanel

7766246
range	max
else if you need max performance and if it is acceptable you can document your setter and state that all values outside the range are just ignored

7766256
int	double
hence arithmetic double int will fail

7766298
mouseleave	mouseenter
using jquery prototype or probably several of the others also gives you the mouseenter and mouseleave events which are normally ie-only but they re emulated by libraries like jquery and prototype on other browsers which are useful for hover effects because they don t bubble

7766303
google-chrome	firefox
my code must work in firefox google-chrome and ie8 - i experimented with sendasbinary but unsucessfully

7766331
selecteditem	selectedindex
unfortunately selectedindex selecteditem are not virtual so you would need to hide them with the new modifier and reproduce the logic from the base class

7766424
put	get
get the one navigation controller and that put into appdelgate.xib and which view after loading to display that class is set on them after into appdelegate.h file you create the object of the navigation controller and then after into appdelegate.m file following code to implement

7766644
width	height
the weights are just relative ratios of the entire span width height

7766644
min	max
in this case you must set the layout_height of the linearlayout to wrap_content and you will be subject collapsing depending on the whim of the layout system meaning you need to then use min max constraints

7766670
decoder	encoder
i think i need some decoder encoder

7766673

7766857
interpolation	splines
i am referring to this article for cubic splines interpolation

7766884
cvs	svn
if you have used any source control management like cvs svn mercurial or git that would have saved you

i love stackoverflow.com because i can post questions and get

7766968
put	get
anyway i want to thank those who put in the effort to get past their paranoia as somebody said in the comments

7766968
put	get
just to get things clear and put some people s hearts at ease i know the reasons for not using goto

7766974
portrait	landscape
you can use separate xml for portrait and landscape mode

7767063
int	double
and for double and int validation use int.tryparse and double.tryparse methods

7767153
ireport	subreports
you can check subreports sample in ireport folder ireport_home ireport samples subreports

7767184

7767262
pylons	pyramid
i know python quite decently and some of its frameworks pylons pyramid django tornado

7767287
folder	directory
you ll have to move into into another directory mate everything in the initializers folder will get included at boot time

7767307
width	font-size
when styling fluids layouts and resizable text web pages you must have always in mind the relevant font-size for em s units and containing block width percent units of current styled elements

7767307
width	font-size
that s a loose of time to always have to be alert of which is the width of the parent element or if you have modified the font-size for the current element or one of its ancestors

7767323
datamapper	activerecord
implements something similar to datamapper instead of activerecord

7767447
jobs	cron
so currently i can not setup cron jobs to run my code as php5

7767450
int	chars
note that there is no need to convert anything to hex - you can just compare chars or int values directly since a hex constant such as 0x3f is just another way of representing an int value

7767463
google-chrome	firefox
my web app works fine on firefox or google-chrome but not in ie

7767539
width	height
i accomplished this by determining the window dimensions then setting the dialog width and the iframe height accordingly

7767539
width	height
the following code may not be the nicest but it works and can easily be altered to make the width and height a percentage less than the window

7767582
put	get
try to get file from resources then put in uri.fromfile

7767610
implements	extends
try having your activity extends the below abstract class instead and then implements the abstract methods next and previous with the functionality you want for the fling

google-chrome	firefox
i have used xdebug pugin for firefox and google-chrome extension but both seems not working after i have installed them

7767633
uilabel	uibutton
using uibutton instead of uilabel might help

7767673
int	chars
in addition if the expression is a constant expression â 15.28 of type byte short chars or int

7767686
int	double
so structs fall into the same category as int double etc

7767772
httprequest	httpresponse
this isn t fun to hand-code you may want to look at using httprequest and httpresponse classes instead to handle this for you

7767789
iprincipal	iidentity
the attribute works when the thread principle and the httpcontext user object are set with a suitable iprincipal and iidentity

7767789
iprincipal	iidentity
also since thread s iprincipal and iidentity are used by microsoft it could have been any large company with a large user base it s battle tested code

7767792
profiler	yourkit
i think a good practical approach is to use a memory profiler such as yourkit

7767811
portrait	landscape
i have a view controller in cocoa touch that detects when the device rotates and switches between the views of the 2 view controllers it has landscape and portrait

7767811

7768006
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome has both google-chrome and safari inside useragent string

7768043
client-side	server-side
how to get the value of a function that is on the server-side on to the client-side .responsetext

7768043
client-side	server-side
this function is on the server-side and i would like to get that answer onto my client-side in order to desplay it

7768063
move	drag
so for example sort by price ascending on one column in the table however for some reason the user wants to manually move a more expensive option to the top so they then drag that to the top of the list

7768093
textview	imageview
the custom title bar contains a textview and an imageview in it

7768134
int	chars
in the string.java file we can see that internally a string instance has four fields a reference to an array of chars values and three int one is the index of the first string chars within the array the second is the string length and the third caches the string hashcode

7768141
width	height
instead of giving height and width as wrap content give height and width according to your wish using dip

7768182
put	get
you could put the links in a string array and get them by position according to what language it is

7768200
google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari
in opera google-chrome safari works too

7768209
google-chrome	firefox
in both firefox s firebug and google-chrome s debugger the nodes are shown as expected with the and nodes as siblings

7768226
google-chrome	firefox
works with google-chrome wasn t in firefox

7768250
put	get
make a new string then where ever you get n put the characters to new string up till this n and append required spaces after n

7768253
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in ie8+ google-chrome and firefox but the alignment is off in ie7

7768276
cpython	ironpython
i know there are other languages that may be better suited but i am only curious about python jython cpython ironpython etc

7768300
serializable	deserialization
see now you now longer have to worry about any manual serializable deserialization

7768395
tabcontrol	tabitem
i have a scenario where i have user controls on tabitem of a tabcontrol in the view

7768396
min	max
or to show the first time they ordered that product choose min instead of max

7768436
children	parent
the only way to get a collection of parent with a filtered children collection in a single database roundtrip is using a projection

7768436
children	parent
ef s context will also populate the children collection of the parent automatically if you don t disable change tracking using asnotracking for example

7768436
children	parent
will contain your filtered children for each parent

7768436
children	parent
the code above would return all parent and include only the children with age 5 so potentially also parent with an empty children collection if there are only children with age 5

7768442
getter	setter
the advantage is pretty much the same as getter and setter methods it allows you control over when a property is requested and when it is set

7768477
put	get
the advantage over a simple public field is that if you at a later point decide that you want to put additional logic in either the get or set method you can do that without having to recompile the dll s that use your class

7768509
nscache	uiimage
uiimage does a lot of this for you already but nscache would allow you to free all the data rather than just the uncompressed data

7768518
int	chars
attrname and attrvalue are both pointers and chars is a type of int so the assignment operator will simply copy the value of the pointer the address not the content

7768522
datediff	difference
you can then trivially figure the difference between start and end times with datediff

7768523
textview	imageview
you can access the textview and imageview by declaring them public static in the tabactivity

7768523
textview	imageview
then in the sub-activity you obviously access the public static textview and imageview like

7768590
int	boolean
the compiler expects datarow int boolean

7768603
width	height
and set the width and height of the wrapper and let the other divs float

7768629
min	max
a third option is to simply store on the front end the min and max values for whatever your sorting column is in the list

7768655
implements	extends
how i currently achieve this is by having an interface for the settings which are common to all pages and then extends classes which implements the properties specific to the type of user

7768697
spaces	delimiter
selects elements that have the specified attribute with a value containing a given word delimiter by spaces

7768750
filtering	grouping
i have three ad grouping that the users can potenially be a member of and i d like the global filtering to check for one of those three grouping as well

7768753
inherited	properties
and when i save for example an instance of customerorder that inherited this properties

7768759
nfa	dfa
i have a scenario where i have designed the nfa and using jflap i have converted it to dfa

7768759
nfa	dfa
i have seen some examples which do this using switch and if statements but i can t see any relation to dfa nfa design and how to use it to implement in java

7768789
nfa	dfa
this java package contains a dfa nfa finite-state automata implementation with unicode alphabet utf16 and support for the standard regular expression operations concatenation union kleene star and a number of non-standard ones intersection complement etc.

7768802
width	height	subtract	add
if it s one of the corner points subtract add half the view s frame s width height to the coordinates

7768806
ant	maven
we re currently using ant with ivy for build and dependency management but there s an interest in providing template starter projects like maven provides using archetypes

7768806
ant	maven
however we don t want to go the maven route for building and dependency management as ant ivy suits our needs currently

7768839
jobs	cron
there is also a cron job that runs hourly and processes the jobs - i would need to query the queue for items that need to be processed at this exact hour minutes are not important

7768864
google-chrome	firefox
i have tested this in ie firefox and google-chrome and all seem to be happy

7768891
postgresql	mysql
if you dont t know this database i suggest you use mysql postgresql or some database you are familiar with

7768987
uiview	subviews
add this new uiview as a subviews

7769011
versioning	upgrade

now google-chrome and safari have corrected thier behavior and then they changed spec nice move

7769102
jtree	jtable
in my swing application i would like to display the same date using jtree and jtable

7769102
jtree	jtable
if button is pressed then jtree should be shown if not then jtable

7769123
sequence	permutation
i am sure there any many valid sequence according to your criteria once you switch to a random permutation i doubt you ll have to do many rejection iterations

7769181
int	chars
using int or fixed chars type for storing dates like 14420101 for 1 1 1442

7769186
sorting	filtering
being queryable the data tables produce faster results with sorting and filtering with their defaultview dataview

7769219
nsurl	nsstring
when dealing with uploading and download files from a server to my apps i m constantly torn between using nsurl or nsstring for all things path related

7769219
nsurl	nsstring
if someone has the deeper insight for when to use nsurl instead of nsstring for your own classes handling file paths and remote urls please do share

7769265
sequence	permutation
generating random sequence according to some rule like hop by twos or threes then fill in the blanks will probably be faster than generating random permutation and testing and the chance of overlap will still be small if the number of toes is large

7769314
hide	show
i am trying to achieve an image switch effect using the animation function in jquery and two nested show hide functions

hide	show
my problem is that the images show hide perfectly fine when kept outside of the callback function however when i put them inside the show hide function does nothing at all

7769314
hide	show
hide and show callbacks work correctly

7769314
hide	show
if i put those those show and hide calls inside the animations callback nothing happens to the images

7769325
portrait	landscape
as soon as i go back to portrait the width stays the same as it was in landscape and the layout gets jacked

7769338
icomparable	gethashcode	equals	icomparable	equals	gethashcode
note also that unlike iequatable t which is logically bound to implement semantics very similar to equals since objects whose gethashcode implementations return unequal must compare unequal there are a number of cases where icomparable basetype should logically return equals even though icomparable derivedtype should compare unequal in such cases a derived type should typically implement icomparable derivedtype but not reimplement icomparable basetype

7769338
equals	icomparable
note that if icomparable t .compare returns zero that does not imply that the objects are equals but merely that neither one definitively ranks above the other

7769339
nsurl	nsfilemanager	nsurl	nsstring
generally for path related operations you should prefer nsurl over nsstring because the path information can be stored more efficiently in nsurl according to the class reference for nsfilemanager

7769361
ftp	telnet
protocol or scheme http ftp telnet ssh

7769369

7769651
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome

client-side	server-side
however this does not work with server-side code only client-side code it throws an error saying that gwt.create is only usable in client-side code

7769693
ostringstream	std
one thing that pops up immediately is that you are doing both input and output with the std ostringstream which i believe is only meant to do output

7769752
width	height
put the image inside your div or similar and then use css to position absolutely set the z-index to force below the content and stretch the image to the width and height of the element

7769760
getter	setter
i m writing a small api to deal with objects that have specific traits in this case they all have an interval of time and a couple of other bits of data so i write an interface timeinterval with some getter and setter

7769791
superclass	subclassing
now i know why this happens it s because the field of the superclass is initialized and then the constructor of the superclass is called before the field of the subclassing is initialized

7769799
folder	directory
i am a little under educated in the issue but from what i read i need to make a blueprint folder and add a blueprint.css file both within the app assets stylesheets directory

7769815

a redirect will always to be a get not a post

7770011
inherited	properties
to check i looked at the template properties in the properties grid and the origin of the value is referenced as defined in style instead of the classic inherited when a custom control is defined in the same assembly

7770024
hide	show
if you are wanting to hide show the views based on this condition you should already have the appropriate frames set before the conditional and just call sethidden on the views with the appropriate argument

7770058
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
be able to support it but most other browsers firefox opera google-chrome seem to say that the filename is supported but the path is hidden for privacy security reasons

7770080
min	max	range	min	range	max
i m using a jquery mobile slider and i have a problem when the value that is entered into the text part of the control is outside of the range of the min and max values that i ve set

7770080
min	max
when the control loses focus it resets it s value to either the min or max value whichever is closer to the invalid entered value

7770080
min	max
however because the slider resets the value to either min or max as soon as it loses focus when the submit button is clicked this is the value that is actually saved and not the user entered value

7770093
post	get
in this post the excellent balusc pointed out the use of c foreach to get the parameters at build time

7770127

both firefox and google-chrome handles it just fine

7770336
for-loop	arrays
if you want to do anything other than read the information you will need to use a for-loop to address the arrays elements directly

the issue of the jobstorecmt versioning not starting and triggering jobs was caused by a mixture of a missing transactional thanks tair and more importantly a need to upgrade quartz

7770801
min	max
min max minmax minmax is c++11

min	max
some of the missing stuff isn t range-related like min max and minmax which operate on two elements or one initializer lists of elements and iter_swap which works on two iterators

7770836
textview	imageview
if it doesn t need to be editable by the user it is going to be easier because you can make your custom view a linearlayout and add textview s and imageview with the proper text and images set in them

7770837
ant	maven
i know java really well i m ok at ant but i don t know anything about j2ee jsp servlets tomcat maven hibernate jpa and i ve never made any kind of website using java i ve made lots of applications in java but all websites i ve made were using php

a qpushbutton and qtoolbutton have a number of states that can be styled so you want to make sure that you make your button noticeably different for each state so that the user can tell the difference

qtoolbutton	qpushbutton
so if you are styling buttons always put the qpushbutton or qtoolbutton selector around them the same should apply for other things you are styling too

7773455

7773799
google-chrome	safari
latest ok i have played around with safari and google-chrome and the issue is not to do with the caching

7773807
implements	extends
i haven t tested this but i believe that if you implements the reflection code in the abstract class in runtime you ll get the info of the actual class that extends your abstract if you use something like this.getclass .

7773848
put	get
i didn t have time to put together a working demo webpage but i hope you get the idea

7773905
oodbms	db4o
questions tagged oodbms should usually be tagged with the relevant database system for instance db4o or zodb

7773907
scikit-learn	nltk
python libraries nltk or scikit-learn + django

7773951
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
when the url was accessed by it was google-chrome ie safari or firefox

7773993
folder	directory
don t do any copying of the boost folder to your compiler s include directory because it may make upgrading boost harder in the future

7774025
gridview	radiobuttonlist
the problem is that you are setting the text of the gridview table cell to an empty string rather than setting the visibility of the radiobuttonlist control to false

7774025
radiobuttonlist	rowdatabound
clearing the text property is removing the markup for the radiobuttonlist on the first load but on postback the rowdatabound event is not fired and the radiobuttonlist control is recreated and displayed again

7774058
disk	ram
a ram disk or ram drive is a block of ram primary storage or volatile memory that a computer s software is treating as if the memory were a disk drive secondary storage

7774059
disk	ram

i m really curious as to why this is just an ie problem it works fine in google-chrome and firefox

7774172
subclipse	visualsvn
i installed subclipse to back up my own non-prime-time stuff to a local repository using visualsvn

7774237
inherited	properties
asp.net pages and controls ultimately inherited from control which has a properties named page which refers to the current page the control is on or in the case of pages the page themselves

7774244
children	parent
you should only need to do addobject for the parent object if the children are set correctly

7774247
postgresql	mysql
my mysql database fails to push to herokus postgresql datbase

7774251
post	put
as then put will mean update post will mean create

7774263
ppl	tbb
concurrent_vector works with std sort and both tbb ppl in the sample pack offer parallel sorts that can be used with this

7774267
children	parent
if you have to sort them manually all you need is a simple recursive function to check the parent for children based on their id with 0 as root in this example

7774290
multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract	subtract	add
could be add subtract multiplying divide

7774294
children	parent
relationship 1 parent to many children

7774295
put	get
so for example if i put certain context component-scan tags into configuration files that are below applicationcontext.xml it could cause certain classes to not get scanned

7774301
lisp	scheme
does scheme lisp provide any lib

7774308
post	get
post is usually used to patch but it is not rest-standard as far as i know but you can implement it if you get that convention in your environment

7774326
folder	directory
hi guys i recently accidentally removed all folder files from my .vim folder in mac os x home directory

7774328
post	get
use a post http verb instead of get

7774328
post	get
pekka suggested to serialize data and break into chunks if post is not an option sending a large parametrized data set as a get request

7774338
int	boolean	int	chars
basically you can t use primitives int short long chars boolean byte with generics

7774355
pop-up	dialog
both the login and fb.ui dialog are being blocked by the pop-up blocker even though they are working on every other website with facebook login

7774361
irc	xmpp
you should consider implementing or using a library for an already existing protocol such as irc or xmpp

7774402
min	max
if i use the histogram data command then i get a nice enough histogram plot where the x-axis is the divided evenly into ten buckets midpoint values of the ten equal intervals between the max and min values of the data and the y-axis records how many occurances occured for each bucket

7774414
hide	show
the issues are that when you hide rows and the height of your grid is set to auto it will not adjust the size properly also if you show rownumbers in your grid they are not sequential anymore

7774420
cos	sin
you should first normalize each vector so each point is in cos t_n sin t_n format

7774420
cos	sin
then calculating the cos and sin of the angles between each points and you reference point

7774443
free	malloc
i have been trying to free memory allocated via malloc using free

7774542
vundle	pathogen
another tip is that you really should look in to using a plugin manager such as vundle or vim-addon-manager or at least the runtimepath manager pathogen

7774558
google-chrome	safari
however in google-chrome and safari there is about 20px worth of space between the left side of the ul content box and each of the li content boxes

7774574
client-side	server-side
it s of course client-side check and not server-side one

7774579
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and ie do not automatically run a declared function unless called but firefox apparently will run the declared function onload even if it is not called all in lowercases

7774597
put	get
therefore--i m just guessing here--if you loaded all your beans into the dispatcherservlet context as i described above but put the in the root context you might have a bean in the root context that s correctly transactional but it s not the one being used because the duplicate is closer to the servlet in the parent child hierarchy and the context it s in didn t get a configuration

7774667
post	get
i ve seen other post where they create the navigation controller and do everything in the app delegate but i ve used the interface builder so it s not obvious to me how i can get access to it

7774689
memcached	apc
memcached or apc

7774697
nsmutablestring	nsstring
since an objective-c string literal is always immutable an instance of nsstring but not nsmutablestring there s no way those messages can be sent to the object you re using

7774711
switching	screens
this screens manager would be in charge of adding removing switching between views while making sure that all your view controllers are released properly when done with

7774715
pull	push	put	get
the correct way to resolve this is to first pull to get the changes that someone else put out there and then push the result

7774722
atomic	interlocked
however if your platform does not have such a guarantee you need to synchronize access to the variable using a lock an atomic variable or an interlocked operation

7774744
mouseleave	mouseenter
i really would prefer to avoid using codebehind mouseenter mouseleave events

7774752
post	get
i assume that facebook determines that this is a local url and therefore sends a get in place of the post that it would normally send to a public url

7774761
folder	dir
my solution is that every time before you want to install something new make a copy of dir in the path and then upgrade or install something by excecuting android.bat in the copied tools folder

7774773
post	get
you can use java.net.httpurlconnection or maybe apache http client to send a post get request to the other servlet

7774819
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
if not the web inspector in google-chrome or safari is great as is firebug for firefox and you ll see it complaining

7774889
setinterval	settimeout
i m not sure about the details but replacing all the instances of setinterval with recursive functions using settimeout -- that also checked to make sure the animation wasn t already running -- solved the problem

7774927
squash	merge
you can squash the commits with git rebase -i or git merge --squash see squash my last x commits together using git

7774983
matplotlib	scipy
in general i highly recommend using ipython when doing interactive work in python with numpy scipy matplotlib etc

7774986
google-chrome	firefox
it doesn t work in firefox and google-chrome because the edit boxes you see in them are rendered by the html engines in the browser and not by the operating system

7774998
jboss	weblogic
this will be slightly different under tomcat vs jboss vs weblogic so you really need to test to make sure your particular use case is covered

7775019
profiling	debugging
for added debugging help try turning profiling on

7775093
unix	bsd
rsync is a file copy utility which runs on posix systems including linux bsd unix and windows via cygwin

7775094
unix	bsd
rsync runs on posix systems including linux bsd unix and windows via cygwin

7775100
put	get
but then we get to the last problem you should put this line inside the event handler

7775165
int	double
solution in that case is to use a wider floating point type double although technically you may find an implementation that has a 256-bit int type in which case you ll have to find another way -

7775217
implements	extends
the main problem is that you are having router extends service while you aren t actually implements a service

7775218
google-chrome	safari
this works in safari google-chrome and ie but not ff7

7775291
put	get
you should get the value from the form put it on the php mail + your new values hidden value

7775318
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
but different browsers ie firefox safari and google-chrome return different values probably viewbox scale not inches

7775446
for-loop	loops
i m trying to create a for-loop with json data that s already been decoded the problem is adding my loops variable in this case i to the end of the element that i m referencing

7775460
getter	setter
1 add getter and setter for properties of movierating

7775480
dbcontext	objectcontext
your repository class implementation ie productrepository.cs that implements iproductrepository has a reference to your objectcontext or dbcontext is using ef 4.1

7775482
getter	setter	put	get
the second thing will be to put getter setter these are methods who has access to your private values and will be used to assign get the values from them

7775492
lua	scheme
you could also use an interpretative language like embedded scheme or lua

7775497
post	put
4 this is un-oo related and just a preference but i would put both pre and post conditions before the methods

7775506
children	parent
you can see in the activerecord code there is a ton of logic surrounding the issue of how to handle children when a parent is saved

7775506
datamapper	activerecord
otherwise spend time studying the activerecord association code directly or consider datamapper which afaik gives you an activerecord-like interface including associations with the ability to change data stores

7775538
folder	directory
it s assuming the form was posted that it was successfully populated that will contain only the strings 1 or 2 and that your script is running in a path which is one folder deep to a directory containing config.php...and that regardless of the condition the same config.php will be loaded and miraculously know what it needs to do

7775578
width	height
width and height

7775587
width	height
img src images myimage.jpg width 200 height 150 class size-full

7775593
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
the fat filesystems doesn t have a rich set of file permissions like ntfs does so depending on what you need to do with these permissions you might be out of luck

7775594
background-image	background-size
and my current background-image workaround using css3 s background-size

7775599
int	chars
i recently asked a question here on stack overflow about how to cast my data from a 16-bit int followed by an undetermined amount of void -cast memory into an std vector of unsigned chars for the sake of using a socket library known as netlink which uses a function whose signature looks like this to send raw data

7775599
int	chars
for reference here s that question casting an unsigned int + a string to an unsigned chars vector

7775623
jgrapht	jung
jgrapht jung jts are very good but again for concurrent access i will have to synchronize it externally which is becoming a pain

7775624
put	get
my question is if it s possible to put a unique constraint on the combination of the fields instead of having to use a composite key and thus having to implement the get and other functions

7775649
folder	directory
the vimclojure directory should either be extraction on top of your .vim folder or in a bundle folder if your using something like pathogen which you should

7775733
move	drag
having grown tired of writing functions to move sprites and characters diagonally and assigning keys that do not flow with the 4 main directional keys up down left right such as w a s d is a bit of a drag and a bore

7775755
put	get
he suggests a few options to get around this normally i d put some code here rather than just a link but he explains is in some good detail and external links

7775771
put	get
just put your setupdatelistener method on the service and call it once you get onserviceconnected with the service

7775790
implements	extends
edit i also tried changing the implements runnable to extends thread then changing the .run in the server to .start but that gives me this error

7775849
cagradientlayer	calayer
well you can do that by creating a calayer or a cagradientlayer based on how you want your glow and add it as a sublayer to the label s layer at the location of the touch

7775880
innodb	myisam
in my project database some of table has engine type innodb and some others myisam

i want salt md5 encryption on the clientside

7775950
touchesmoved	touchescancelled	touchesmoved	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchescancelled	touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchescancelled	touchesended
i think in that case you d be better off just using touchesbegan touchesmoved and touchesended don t forget touchescancelled

7775958
pop-up	dialog
the dialog pop-up perfectly it has the link so no problem.

7775981
screens	mdpi
with different devices you should have same image but with different size and density.for you can search in internet the specifications of devices.if density is less than 160 then put image in ldpi if 160 then use mdpi and if 240 or above use hdpi.also change the size of image to the screens size of corresponding device.hope it will help

7776000
innodb	myisam
myisam has full-text search index while innodb has not

7776000
innodb	myisam
in light of these differences innodb and myisam have their unique advantages and disadvantages against each other

7776000
innodb	myisam
because innodb has to take care of the different relationships between tables database administrator and scheme creators have to take more time in designing the data models which are more complex than those of myisam

here is a good conversation to get you started myisam versus innodb

7776045
hide	show
to show hide navigation bar which works fine

7776052
width	height
this should return the correct width and height

7776052

in an example is given how to calculate an md5 hash of string

7776137
hash	md5
md5 is a hash not an encryption mechanism

7776159
switching	screens
you may notice i m defining a small and a large size here - double tapping the screens allows you to switching between the two

7776166

i ve tried making them float and then animating the parent div s width and height

7776182
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
both firebug the extremely popular addon for firefox and web inspector built into google-chrome and safari the de facto web development tools for each browser include complete performance profilers

7776198
yslow	pagespeed
yslow and pagespeed as plugins for firebug for example i think there is an extension for chrome as well or you can install firebug lite on chrome can also prove useful if you haven t found them already

7776200
yslow	pagespeed
you can use firebug or yslow or pagespeed

7776218
comparator	comparable
treeset always keeps the objects sorted by how the objects comparator comparable interface is implemented

also once he is accessing ear 2.0 screens there will be a drop down in 2 screens from where he can switching to plant having lower version

7776255
jboss	glassfish
after playing around with many different as servers glassfish jboss and a few others i have come to the conclusion that j2ee limits me in a few things which cause cause problems down the line see this previous question

hide	show
in this my image is show but when the nstimer is called image get blink or get hide i need the image until the touch the method called

7776285
getter	setter
and get set will be run through a magic getter setter

7776295
hash	salt
for the hash you could use anything dynamic like the date combined with a salt

7776298
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it only works in firefox but not in safari or google-chrome

7776367
int	chars
so what it s trying to do is index on the string but the index is not an int so it tries to convert the string to an int yielding zero and then it s accessing the first chars of the string which happens to be f

7776374
phpgraphlib	phplot
so far i have tried two tools one phplot and phpgraphlib

7776387
google-chrome	safari
then check the page in google-chrome or safari

7776393
width	height
you can do this on browsers that support the new file api from the w3c using the readasdataurl function on the filereader interface and assigning the data url to the src of an img after which you can read the height and width of the image

7776393
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
currently firefox 3.6 supports the file api and i think google-chrome and safari either already do or are about to

7776408
google-chrome	firefox
a website i m currently designing displays and works perfectly in all mac browsers and windows firefox google-chrome and ie 8

7776428
put	get
if i put that while loop outside of the keyboard input loop i ll never get anything back from the server

7776436
for-loop	arrays
it is usually a better idea to use the size of the arrays in the for-loop

7776463
post	put	post	get	put	get
first off you ve got to figure out whether you re using get put or post and in the latter two cases what is the content type or types that you are consuming as both put and post are typically dealing with a document incoming

7776463
post	get
the first deals with a get on a url like and the second deals with a post to a url like create

7776503
rss	feed
i am using xelement - linq to xml to parse some an rss feed

7776516
x86	64bit
this is typically located in c program files microsoft visual studio 10.0 common7 ide c program files x86 microsoft visual studio 10.0 common7 ide for 64bit users and it is called wcftestclient.exe

7776544
width	height
setting width and height using css will actually crop the image

7776544
width	height
but if you use img tag the image will be re-sized to value of width and height

7776575
public	protected	accessor	properties
i think this is bad design you should declare name as private and create a properties with get set accessor where you can chose if get or set could be public private or protected otherwise protected will allow any classes of the same namespace to access a field or properties

7776607
nsinvocationoperation	nsblockoperation
use nsinvocationoperation nsblockoperation with a completion block

7776638
tax	shipping
for some reason lifetime sales average orders revenue tax shipping and quantity as well as the graph are all returning empty data sets

7776648
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
this works in google-chrome safari opera but doesn t work in firefox ie

7776650
klocwork	coverity
there are multiple companies selling products that do exactly what you are describing among them vericode coverity fortify klocwork and grammatech

7776651
hash	md5
you need 128 bits to represent the md5 hash and i would suggest to use the tostring 16 method of biginteger itself to create a string representation of the biginteger instead of using that format

7776675
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
the not selector is only supported by modern browsers firefox safari and opera not ie

7776720
folder	directory
you can create a directory named binaries in ogre folder

7776749

if i access them as shape then i get two similar shapes which have same x y width and height values

7776796
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
ie users don t need to upgrade to windows 7 to get the benefits of html5 and css3 they can instead simply switch to firefox or google-chrome or opera or safari

7776829
777	tmp
by this i mean for example not requiring any app tmp directory with 777 access

7776831
implements	extends
plus you don t have to extends implements any special classes interfaces

7776895
int	chars
since copying an int is typically not slower than copying a chars on most machines i suspect this will give you roughly a speed increase of a factor 3

7776896
int	double
the specifier d expects an int and you are passing the address of a double

7776896
int	double
because printf takes a variable number of arguments a + b which is a double can t be converted to an int

7776900
int	double
d is for reading int use f or lf for float double

7776904
int	chars
if you want to accept a float input use scanf and printf with the lf formatting chars not d which is for int

7776908
comparator	comparable
implementing one of these two is enough to solve your problem -- both comparable and comparator can be combined though using a comparator will override any natural ordering defined by comparable

7776924
freemarker	velocity
with spring and other frameworks you can also use velocity and freemarker on the view side

7776944
maven	buildr
i read in a blog article that buildr a ruby based build tool was two times faster than maven for a simple build

7776956
textarea	textbox
i am trying to write some watermark text on textbox and textarea

7777010
onclick	onmousedown
blue and grey circles has to drag individually by onmousedown and orange one is for group moving by onclick

cpython	pypy
cpython and pypy automatically resize your list and overprovision space for future appends and thereby speed up the append furthermore

7777082
spaces	delimiter
once you have your identified you can use the following pattern to extract all attributes taking care of the value delimiter single quote double quote spaces

7777118
free	malloc
where is stored in memory is important you will often want to use the free store malloc it for the argument otherwise you may corrupt the stack of the thread which called pthread_create

7777121
daemons	systemd
having a 777 ed directory on a shared hosting is unsecure because the http daemons is run for all clients under the same systemd account

7777148
width	height
alt width 493 height 278

7777153
width	height
you should not pan on an absolutely positioned element because the window s width and height keep changing according to the image

7777180
portrait	landscape
the problem is the constructor page orientation that create confusion to the system default portrait is ok i have only to change the add page orientation to landscape and the problem is solved

7777201
viewdidappear	viewwillappear

although i recommend using a chars array for phone numbers as long isn t very well suited for such storage as it can t hold as many digits as you like you might consider using two int longs

basically each child would be set to inline-block with their set width height and then you could add a margin-right to each one to space them apart from each other then add a margin-left to the parent so that the left also has the appropriate amount of spacing

7780163
children	parent	width	height
then based on the height of the parent calculate how many rows of children the parent can have in order to calculate how wide you need the parent to be for the children to collapse correctly keep in mind that you should not include the margin-left of the parent in the width

7780173

the answer provided by n rohler works well only in internet explorer with some bugs prior to ie8 - but i guess it won t be a problem for you since you re using a canvas and pagex and in opera if the padding is 0 and in safari google-chrome if the border width is 0 too

7781229

7782876
portrait	landscape
i have two layouts for portrait and landscape in layout and layout-land

width	height
but it doesn t scale the width and height of the images proportionally so the result is a very distorted image

7782886
width	height
using the example in the answer below from kyle i think the problem is occurring with images that have embedded width and height attributes

7782886
width	height
modified with width and height added to the first image link

7782886
width	height
as a matter of fact in this case link it looks like the image is first scaled up by the width and height attributes followed by the width being scaled down by the css max-width

so when i get the answer of that other question right the only way to get rid of this warning is to either not customize synthesized atomic properties accessor or to omit the synthesize completely and do it all by hand the accessor and the mutator

7784191
button	checkbox
note label is a property which only applies to certain items button checkbox etc so you might what to include a test for the item type and perhaps grab the prompt_text instead if that s appropriate

if you declare an property that is atomic -- the default -- you must either use dynamic let the compiler synthesize everything or provide an implementation of both the setter and getter

so i strongly suspected that it was that my write operations in the for-loop didn t have enough time to complete before next loops starts

7784983
int	chars
however worth saying that fscanf has some drawbacks see so another approach is to use fgets to get each line the advantage of fgets is that you get to specify a maximum number of chars to read so there s no danger of overrunning a string buffer length and then sscanf to read from the string into your int variables

7785615
clang	llvm
i d guess the clang llvm move from apple doesn t support that but thinks it s gcc still

7785736
width	height
this way you ll have a image resized proportionally dependson what you need first the width or height

7785736
width	height
leaving only width 100 in css it means that image will be resized to fit the div by width and height will be resized the same times as the width so the scale will be respected

7785736
width	height
well..if want them resized by width and height then you ll have a image distortion due to different scale

7785736
width	height
you can paly with width and height of img style to change them and fit one image but when another one is added with different sizes you l get again a wrong displayed image

7785736
width	height
i would go for width to keep it resized cause in the height there is always space under the screen

7785739

hide	show
show this window and hide the primary app window whenever you need to display the credentials view

width	height
this happens because the default filter effects region as defined by the x y width and height parameters on the element is 120 of the bounding box of the filtered element not 100

7786192
width	height
this for example is why the defaults for the filter effects region are x -10 y -10 width 120 height 120

7786235
lxml	beautifulsoup
under the hood beautifulsoup uses lxml for parsing xml

7786253
inherited	properties
the reason i m trying to do this via a properties instead on through a constructor is so that i don t have to duplicate the constructor in every controller that needs access to the unitofwork properties since constructors are not inherited

7786261
daemons	launchd	daemons	systemd
the problem is that launchd daemons started by the systemd don t have access to aqua so your daemons process can t access the desktop environment

7786261
daemons	launchd
have the agent connect to your root daemons or have the root daemons look for an instance of the launchd agent

7786261
daemons	launchd
when signaled by the root daemons have the launchd agent launchd the graphical part of the application

7786277

nsstring	nsobject
use to print values from objects nsobject subclasses like nsstring

7786415
put	get
it s a tad confusing because the key you get when you run your app in eclipse is not the same key you ll be using to publish it and the key generation will look like it s giving you the correct result even if you put in the wrong password so you have to be super duper sure that

7786420
postgresql	mysql
for example in the past -- it still may -- postgresql required that each thread had its own connection but mysql had other ways to work with threading

7786430

it sounds like an extension facebook is using for its rss 2.0 feed

7786669
rss	feed
i agree with martin to use xdocument linq to xml to parse the rss feed

7786697
udp	tcp
netty simply helps you with the general boiler plate code that goes into setting up a server any kind of server since netty is transport agnostic so you could implement it to use tcp ip udp etc.

translation	localization
i don t need more than 2 localization now english and portuguese but i might need more later so it should be easy to add a translation if my app gets used by an russian site it should be able to send welcome emails in russian and with the name of the site brand that uses my app so i supposse what i want to do is something like a whitelabel product

7786782
jobs	cron
however my experience says that it s much better to make 2 cron jobs one for each translation than one cron job for many translations since a request could accidentally get the wrong cookie due to cookie cooruption or likewise

7786782
translation	localization
so this translation task is also for completeness and consistency even though the first attempt works for english and is easily exandable to 2 languages a complete localization with gettext is something i think is good to have

7786862
vmware	virtualbox
you can install osx on virtualbox or vmware they both have support for osx up to 10.7.x

basically you get the current value if it s available from the post data and then mark the selected element selected it if it s there

7787044
portrait	landscape
i have an app that uses two drastically different layouts for portrait and landscape

7787044
portrait	landscape
the landscape layout is just an informational view of whatever was last selected in the portrait view and consists of a viewpager filled with webviews and some of the same views as in the portrait mode but not all of them

7787044
portrait	landscape
when i run the app in debugging mode from eclipse and i rotate from portrait to landscape back to portrait and then back to landscape it crashes on the last rotation to landscape every time stack printout in logcat below

7787171
implements	extends
it looks like you could try to extends some of the functionality of either html or implements your own taghandler but i am wondering if there is not a more fundamental limitation that will force you to do something completely different like with the mail api or something

7787171
spanned	charsequence
it turns out that when things are written to the parcel that is sent to the email intent textutils.writetoparcel does some special checking to root out the bold italic stuff by first checking if the charsequence is an instance of spanned and then asking for the spans via spanned.getspans

7787171
spanned	charsequence
textutils.writetoparcel charsequence cs parcel p ... will if cs is an instance of spanned write those spans only if they implement the parcelablespan interface.

7787279
hide	show
to accomplish your cascading list you could show and hide the select inputs based on the change of the previous one

7787288
inherited	properties
may be some extra level for future and all of this classes inherited from base class like permisionaccessbase which has one method currently with this information checkaccess as virtual and one properties which is of type access level enum all other classes inherited it in the way they want can override base method but you can have a chance to call to your base

7787294
hide	show

7787310
post	get
i read that post is preferable to get

7787313
int	double
that s why you can say x+1 and it will work whether x is an int or a double or whatever

7787361
post	get
but after that there are no more updates even if i change anything it is like all control s autopostback get set to false after the first partial post back so nothing happens when i change the selection a second time

i found the solution nsurl instead of nsstring

try-catch	exception-handling
i ll add to ryan s answer that you can handle all critical exception-handling without the need to wrap most of your code in try-catch

7787788
google-chrome	firefox
the code works fine in firefox but in google-chrome only the last location.href command and so only the second piece of javascript code is executed

7787792
width	height
the solution to this problem based on the fact that google chrome fails to properly render the height of the dynamically generated div s as ulima69 observed is to give the wrapping div .slideshow a designated width height that is congruent with the images width height

7787799
hide	show
since is a big and dynamic form selections in some fields hide or show other fields i have problems when submitting the form since validator doesn t permit send the data to the server because is validating also the hidden fields

7787876
for-loop	loops
so the for-loop outside the while loops needs to come in

7787876
for-loop	loops
actually it is better to move the select outside and enclose the block starting with the for-loop setting up the read_set and ending after the while loops in another loops - so that at every select return you process all signaled descriptors without going into select again

7787897
keystore	jks

punctuation	words
in the most basic sense because you have not quite specified what to do with punctuation you can split each line into a list of words using line.split which splits on every space

7788209
spaces	delimiter
if you have other delimiter you can substitute that in instead of the spaces

7788218
visualvm	yourkit
i think you may have more luck with tools specialized with profiling such as yourkit or visualvm

7788244
rss	feed
you would need to setup a cron script of some sort that pulls down the rss feed creates the jekyll files runs the jekyll command and uploads it to the web

7788271
int	chars
the console.read returns a chars value which can be implicitly casted into int

7788276
salt	md5
this uses in essence the evp_bytestokey function to derive the key from the provided string with md5 empty salt and count 1 and then do the same as cipherinitiv which is called by createcipheriv and uses iv and key directly.

7788391

7788707
translation	pluralize
if you ll decide to translation your application into many languages this link will help to pluralize correctly

7788739
google-chrome	firefox
a good way to catch this sort of thing is to use a debugging tool firebug if you are using firefox or the google-chrome developer tools - a quick look at the console reveals several requests which don t find their file

it s not clear to me why you would want both mutability and the equals gethashcode overrides but if you do and understand the risks you ll probably have to roll your own

stdout	stderr
i want to create a program that can create a process for any arbitrary exe file while having that exe file s stderr and stdout captured redirected to my program

7793475
stdout	stderr
if it sends 10 char to stdout then 10 char to stderr and then 10 char back to stdout my program needs to recognized the fact that the child is alternating between stderr and stdout rather than simply treating stderr and stdout as 2 independent streams

7793475
stdout	stderr
stdout 10 bytes stderr 10 bytes stdout 10 bytes stderr 3 bytes .......

7793475
stdout	stderr
i know the standard way to redirect stdout and stderr is to create 2 anonymous pipes and having that 2 pipes inherited by the created child process

7793475
stdout	stderr
if i use 2 threads in the parent one for reading the child s stdout and another for reading the child s stderr i cannot tell the fact that the child is alternating between stdout and stderr the sequence information listed above is lost

7793475
stdout	stderr
i have no idea what the mozilla build system is doing nor why it needs to use some python scripts to invoke cl.exe which apparently analyze the stdout stderr of the cl.exe command

7793475
stdout	stderr
but all i know is that it must invokes cl.exe lib.exe and link.exe in the end and the interfaces to these commands must be command line arguments env variables and stdout stderr

7793475
stdout	stderr
so i need to write a proxy cl.exe which calls the real cl.exe and supplies my own command line arg s and returns whatever stderr and stdout to the caller as transparent as possible

7793475
stdout	stderr
the characteristics of cl.exe is that it may return error messages in stderr and normal messages in stdout

i m wondering how to accept keyboard and mouse input in c++ using visual studio 2010 for windows 7 32-bit

the background properties is not inherited by children by default

7798359
hgrc	hgignore
then you can use the main repo s hgignore as the main one by including this in each subrepo s hgrc file

7798359
hgrc	hgignore
the reason why doing didn t work for you in your global .hgrc and won t in repo hgrc is that having simply hgignore is a relative file path and its resolution to an absolute path depends on the current working directory used when invoking hg

7798377
width	height
as you can see only difference is that one is a hyperlink in my case with fixed width height and background img and second one is hyperlink with img

7798458
profiling	instrumentation
use instrumentation to profiling and detect zombies instead

7798473
nfa	dfa
since a regular expression is a representation not a description of a regular lenguage you can not tell that regex1 is equivalent to regex2 just by looking at the expression to prove it mathematical proof you can convert those regular expression into a nfa nondeterministic finite automata or dfa deterministic finite automata and compare the diferences

7798501
dpkg	apt	dpkg	aptitude

at the very low level the keyboard and the mouse are hardware devices that generates some interrupts in the form of electric signals to the cpu

7798760

width 320 x height 480

7799069
maven	pom.xml	put	get

7799094
portrait	landscape
you would need to set your wrapper width to 320px for portrait mode although the user will have the option to view the web app in landscape mode so if you can get away with using percentages you ll be better off

children	parent
sheep can be made children of other sheep by selecting an id from the jcombobox editor of the parent id column in the jtable

sometimes i ll have a block of public member functions that belong in a member group and that i feel are self documenting getter setter so i don t want to write doxygen syntax for each one

7799148
fadein	hide
so either use display none css rule or hide function to hide it first and use the fadein effect

7799152
getter	setter
all you need is a separate datastore property to store the actual value much like with other languages that use getter and setter

7799152
getter	setter
however i ve found that using getter and setter on existing dom properties often simply won t work due to the special handling of these properties internally

7799194
postgresql	mysql
a while back i asked about changing a mysql query into postgresql

7799205

typedef	struct
i ve defined a struct network typedef to network which contains a pointer to an array of doubles and a pointer to an array of pointers to neurons which is another struct

7799363
oncreate	onstart
from my understanding of application lifecycle including services it should go oncreate onstart onresume

7799363
oncreate	onstart
based on this understanding if you shut down the cycle with a this.stopself in the oncreate it should never fire the onstart

7799363
oncreate	onstart
however logcat clearly shows that the onstart still runs in spite of the service being terminated in the oncreate

7799383

7799422
google-chrome	firefox
the following works in firefox and google-chrome

7799422
google-chrome	firefox
incidently both firefox and google-chrome are playing the ogg format although google-chrome recommends webm

7799422
post	put
i put the check for browser support of ogg first only because other post have mentioned that firefox prefers the ogg source first

7799440

7799459
mouseover	mouseenter
i have also tried using mouseenter instead of mouseover but with the same results

7799466
google-chrome	firefox
surprisingly this works very well in google-chrome and ie but miserably under firefox

7799466
google-chrome	firefox
apparently google-chrome and ie are able to optimize if you only want a small pixel area but firefox doesn t appear to be optimizing at all based on the desired pixel area

7799474
width	height
create a container element and set the width height of the container to whatever you desire

versioning	upgrade
this separation also provides the basis for clean upgrade between versioning of tomcat as well

i have an imageview that is bigger than a textview and i want to center the textview on top of the imageview both vertically and horizontally

uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
all i added to this template was a uinavigationcontroller with a uiviewcontroller pushed onto it

7799832
portrait	landscape
if i change this setting to landscape the view in the .nib editor changes to landscape but when i run the app it runs in portrait mode and still refuses to rotate

7799847
sorting	grouping
digit grouping might need sorting so i sorted them if agepartner comes before partner i just did a a-z sort + reverse

nsmanagedobject	mogenerator
another option is using mogenerator which instead of categories maintains a private auto-generated nsmanagedobject subclass and a public subclass of the auto-generated subclass that you can add your own methods to

7799867
profiling	instrumentation
at first sight the time profiling in instrumentation offers this kind of tracking ability with many details but sampled call stacks seem to be presented in a random order - or maybe i get it wrong.

7799876
accessor	properties
try using a private field with the properties s accessor methods along with the field nonserialized attribute

7799883
octal	decimal
any number that begins in zero is interpreted as an octal base 8 literal and octal 13 8 1+3 11 decimal

it will destroy your memory if there s more than 100 chars on a line or more numbers than array can hold but you won t get a faster routine to read in lines of unsigned int

7800974
portrait	landscape
so i decided that maybe android just wasn t recognizing that it was in landscape since i overrided it but changing the layout to something ridiculous like a layout for a dialog doesn t cause a force close or anything it stays the portrait layout which is stretched as a result so i know there is something wrong with how i m inflating the layout

7800979
stdout	stderr
after fork i open a per process file set the stdout stderr of the created process to point to that file and then exec the intended program

for-loop	loops
i don t know how to use do statements so i was thinking of using while loops or possibly a for-loop

7801200
hide	show
originally i wrote code to manually show hide each of the controls like this

7801200
hide	show
i was looking at panels to organize the controls but since the controls that need to be show hidden in scenario 2 and 3 aren t generally adjacent to one another the best that that idea yielded was being able to put each label and corresponding textbox into a panel and show hide the panel

7801217
hide	show
then simply hide and show the textfield from the textfielddid methods but show the actual display value in the label

7801236

7801462
post	get
from my web application i am not able to post my updates through the access token i get

7801506
pop-up	dialog
the admin can click a button to delete it then a jquery dialog box should pop-up to confirm

7801550
put	get
another alternative is that instead of using slice of any type just use slice of interface in all your code then you can use the normal slice operators on it and you can put any elements in but cast when you get them out

7801567
button	checkbox
i have been trying to modify the softkeyboard example to insert a custom layout of button checkbox radiobuttons etc but i was unable to do so

versioning	upgrade
django used to come with an older versioning and django 1.5 deprecated django.utils.simplejson entirely. if you can t upgrade for some reason the jsonencoderforhtml code is relatively small and could probably be pulled into earlier code or used with python 2.6+ s json package -- though i haven t tried this myself

7801806
super	self
you want to override the __init__ method like you did with the save method and call self.get_thumbs before you call super photo self

7801812

7801910
hide	show
i want to hide this after the page is redirected and show the next div that i have

7801918
folder	dir
after deleting this dir you can go to visual studio create asp.net website and click on your app_data folder and choose add new item and then choose sql server database and it should work

7801934

processors	hyperthreading
however the situation is complicated by hyperthreading cpus which actually present to the operating system several processors for what is actually a single core physical core

7801979
implements	extends
edit to implements this you would make a java class that extends either broadcastreceiver or intentservice depending on if you want the class to run on the ui thread or as a service respectively

min	max	range	min	range	max
given an array of size n i need to find the min number of values that will sum up within a min and max range

7802047
dbcontext	objectcontext
you also loose the benefits of inheriting objectcontext dbcontext inheriting properties row versioning ect and controlling the poco object non code generated so you don t have to worry about partials + metadatatype attribute as in 4.0

7802071
put	get
depending on what you re going to do with that information you might want to then put a message on a queue and then delete the row so it doesn t get noticed again the next time you check

7802476
pull	push
read about push pull here

7802476

7802480
memcached	apc
database results can be cached in an appropriate caching layer memcached apc etc if performance begins to suffer from query abuse

7802489
getter	setter
also for the variable as it is now i m not even sure what the getter and setter would be in javascript

7802544
prepare	execute
on top if that is too sow you should fire them off async - prepare statement 2 while statement 1 execute or even fire them off a number of worker threads in parallel

7802579
put	get
i tried to put together a public example on jsfiddle and i can t even get a proper example to work as the image sprite also fails to show up

7802591
min	max
for instance if you have an array that looks like 1 2 4 5 9 and the min 11 and max 14 then your algorithm will check 1+2 1+4 1+5 1+9 then 2+4 2+5 2+9 4+5 4+9 before coming to an answer

7802609
gson	jackson
you should use either gson or jackson

7802707
width	height
the resulting bitmap has height and width of -1 which indicates that the createbitmap function didn t work

7802897
getter	setter
naive setter getter methods are really a corruption of object oriented programming

7802897
getter	setter
by adding getter setter you are basically exposing how the class works without actually exposing member variables which isn t really such a good thing

7802936
int	chars
two int will use more space varchar should be replaced with chars cause you size is fix

uitableview	reloaddata
to put a log statement to see confirm when reloaddata is being called on each of my uitableview

client-side	server-side
you are misunderstanding the distinction between server-side code such as php and client-side code ie javascript

7803286
client-side	server-side
i would recommend that you need to know a little more about web development in order to understand the disctintion between client-side and server-side code so that you properly understand why this won t work at this point

7803288
rubygems	rvm
however you can use rvm to manage the rubygems version so if you install it and have a project specific gemset in your .rvmrc file

remember that optimization is only possible because we know nsstring instance is not going to change and the same tests with nsmutablestring most likely will to create new string instances

7803402
children	parent
update having looked back over code i realised that you actually only want to wrap some of the children of parent in the new span

7803407
getter	setter
now since you have written property getter and setter methods for uilabel you can set its value from your first class only where you create object of second class

7803456
children	parent
you can make regenerating the path caches more efficient by only updating the changed node and its children using its parent s cached path

7803483

7803524
portrait	landscape
actually it s exactly like normal portrait .storyboard but all screens are in landscape mode

7803534

the documentation states that the library has been tested on firefox 2+ safari 3+ opera 9 google-chrome and internet explorer 6 7 8

7803934
width	height
but if you use the realtocomplex or the complextorealfunction pay attention to the fact that the image will be stored in a matrix of dimensions height x width 2 +1 and if you want to do some intermediate calculations in the frequency domain they will become a bit harder.

7803946
google-chrome	firefox
both seem to work on google-chrome firefox -

7803971
int	chars
i know that a is casted to a pointer to a chars and then eventually casted to a pointer to a pointer to an int but it was unclear what dereferencing a pointer to a pointer to an int actually does.

7803992
mamp	wamp
4 if you are hosting locally using mamp wamp xamp or something similar skip this step

7803993
width	height
another approach would be each widgetview having its own resize handler but then i have to pass around the width height to the sub-views that need explicit values

7804016
put	get
im trying to get this program to take the users input and put that into a public function and assign it to the privatevariable then i want it to return the value of privatevariable to main and output it to the screen but all it displays is the value of an undefined int -858993460

7804070
onmouseover	onclick
you seem to be using onclick which sounds like the wrong event i d suggest looking at the onmouseover event and possibly also the onmouseout event instead

7804075
lisp	prolog
i don t know haskell or lisp but there might be similarities to prolog so maybe you can get some ideas from there

7804092

7804127
put	get
i would like to make maze object put some man objects inside it and call solve for each to get out of maze

viewmodel	caliburn.micro
but the problem here is that agfx also provide a base viewmodel while i ve already had one which inherits screen of caliburn.micro

7804227
getter	setter
do not use setter getter to the viewwrap class

7804260
mouseover	mouseout
i am trying to create a menu system that slides left on mouseover or hover of parent element and slides right on mouseout - but that also ensures that the element that slides out is accessible as it will contain a menu of options for the user

7804260
mouseover	mouseout
also i noticed that the animation was a little buggy - after several mouseover mouseout events the inner div elements height would change and you would need to refresh the page to reset it

7804271
nsurl	nsstring
moreover in method if you will need it you should pass nsstring as a first parameter but you are passing nsurl

7804302
pop-up	dialog
for instance you can make a pop-up that dynamically loads a _createcar partial view using jquery dialog or similar component

7804323
folder	dir
now i hack it by editing files change dir name for default folder django core management commands startapp|project.py but think this is bad idea

7804331

7804443
int	chars
i have a table with this columns timestamp timestamp count int name chars varieing

7804468
django	turbogears
so i am tempted to use a 3rd party cms like symphony or even going in the direction of turbogears or django as i have been looking for an excuse to get on with a python build for ages

7804488
mdpi	hdpi
the image s put inside here when linked to will be considered the optimal source for displays which are mdpi or hdpi

7804493
getter	setter
the other things like addprev and previous are just getter and setter

7804502
int	chars
wildly typecast the chars pointer to a pointer-to-pointer to int

7804518
calloc	malloc
memory allocation in java is 5x to 10x faster than malloc calloc etc

7804570
ubuntu	debian
how do i write a bash script to install and configure postfix for debian or ubuntu

7804599
octree	quadtree
there are datastructures like a 2d quadtree or 3d octree supporting this task much better

7804637

the problem in your case arises because parameter for is nsstring and you are passing nsurl and method trying to get the length of the supposed string by calling -length which exists for nsstring but not for nsurl

7804644
tolower	toupper
the only way to compare them is to toupper or tolower but it s better to toupper as written here both part of the comparison

zoo	xts
packages zoo and xts are very useful but if all you want to do is plot the data i get the date time information correctly formatted set-up as a date or posixt class object and then ii just plot it using standard graphics and or or if you want to see the observation times

7804697
hide	show
i ve used a java script to show hide a drop-down menu which is actually a hidden div with more links

7804718
google-chrome	firefox
it works perfectly on google-chrome ie8 and firefox

7804721
getter	setter
set the name for the cookie and use getter and setter

7804761
hide	show
then you can hide and show the label

7804856
width	margin

button	checkbox
i m using a radlistview and i want to click a checkbox button it displays as a checkbox but its designer code shows it as a button

7809542
hash	md5
as long as you do the exact same md5 salting process on passwords everywhere they re used and only store compare the resulting hash in the database then your comparisons will be valid

7809548
csv	tsv
tsv or csv parsers in python will be able to parse it

7809567
google-chrome	firefox
everything works fine in google-chrome and firefox

7809578
vb.net	vb6
i recently uninstalled vb6 necessary for clean installation of vb.net and i think this may be at least part of the problem

7809598
portrait	landscape
if the user physcially rotates the device then layoutsubviews gets called and works correctly -- so a user starting the app in landscape draws incorrectly rotates to portrait draws correcty and then rotates back to landscape now draws correctly

7809601
client-side	server-side
if you are concerned enough to do validation you must always do server-side validation in addition to client-side

7809612
do-while	goto
the you cannot derived from classes that don t have a virtual destructor litany if that s the reason you say you cannot extend it it like the dont use goto dont use do-while don t multiple return don t use this or that feature

7809612
goto	break
like it is stupid writing dozens of nested if to avoid a multiple return just as its stupid introduce dozens of state flags to avoid a goto or a break

7809622
accessor	properties
the reason i know is that i added a messagebox.show ... on the set accessor of the properties and i don t see any message boxes

7809622
put	get
if i put break points - they never get reached

7809692
width	height
it s quite useful because it s easy to use fast and you don t have to calculate text height width

7809757
width	height
the cells have different height width depending on the content

7809757
width	height
i would like to constrain them to exactly 50 of the width and height

7809779
getter	setter
then you can assuming you ve set up standard getter and setter use where is a managed tag entity to get the number of articles attached to that tag

7809780
hash	md5
your particular query is safe but realize that when you run a string through md5 any sql escaping you did on the original string is destroyed - md5 s output character set does not include sql metacharacters so if a user s password does contain any of the metacharacters you ve now hash not only their password but any escape characters that were added in

7809781
pop-up	dialog
when i run the code in ie9 a file save dialog pop-up asking if i want to save the file

7809795
stdout	stderr
it looks like your error message is coming from stderr not stdout

7809816
pow	sqrt
b sqrt exp pow sigmaeta 2 -1 sigmanu

7809817
hash	md5
my solution is to hash the url using md5 or sha256

7809897
hash	md5
the reason i d go for md5 is because you are very unlikely to run into collisions and even if you do you can structure your queries with where urlhash hash and url url

7809909
factors	mean
otherwise i d now need to scale down all my images by some constant factors 1.6 which would mean resizing all the 45 levels which took days and days of designing and testing repositioning gui elements etc

7809914
vtk	paraview
vtk is good for scientific visualization plotting values onto a mesh with a given colour scale and all that goes with it axes filters and so on it has quite a few tools for mesh processing and other things which paraview gives a front end to if you want to experiment

7809933
getter	setter
i m not sure what you mean but if you re trying to set the circle colors from an outside class then make the array a property of the class with a setter and if needed a getter

7809967
subtract	add
you need the bitwise-not and add subtract

7809993
versioning	upgrade
if ezpdf is however recreated magic_quotes behavior then it s definitely time to upgrade versioning or switching to something better

7810017
hash	md5
in your case i wouldn t use any of the cryptographic hash functions md5 sha since they were designed with security in mind they mainly want to make it as hard as possible to finde two different strings with the same hash

7810034
subtraction	addition
you ve still got to use an addition or subtraction to produce the correct result though

7810045
background-color	transparency
nsstring embedhtml body background-color transparency

7810071
writetofile	nsdata
save data to nsdata and then with writetofile save it to main bundle

7810102
put	get
i m developing some asp.net website and i m trying to run it on my iis i published the web under build option and put it under wwwroot but i get this parser error below

7810143
google-chrome	firefox
but i can only get it work in firefox or google-chrome wich is useless cause they already support border-radius

7810150
gif	png
pagespeed probably refers to static resources like js css png gif etc

7810180
button	right-align
2 assume your menu system calls for various button and images to be right-align exactly with the right border of the screen

7810180
button	right-align	width	height
instead of figuring out the individual positions for each image button it is easier to simply right-align them by modifying the anchorpoint to 1.0f 0.5f and then position the images button at exactly the screen width and variable screen height position screen width 100

7810180
width	height
let s assume the following image s position is at screen width screen height 2 with a default anchorpoint 0.5f 0.5f

7810180
width	height
the position remains the same screen width screen height 2

7810180
button	right-align
just for comparison if you wanted to right-align this image menu button or label without modifying the anchorpoint you would have to set its position according to this formula

7810184
fast-forward	merge
for the same reason git has the concept of fast-forward merge something that does not apply to mercurial because you wouldnâ t have created a separate branch in the first place

7810192
outputstream	inputstream
eunfortunately there is no easy way to use a randomaccessfile as an inputstream outputstream looks like aix may have a good suggestion for adapting randomaccessfile to inputstream outputstream but there are various example adapters available online

7810192
outputstream	inputstream
you can set the position of the filechannel directly then use the channels utility methods to get inputstream outputstream adapters on top of the channel

7810199
post	get
when i post something from my iphone app to facebook everything works great except the part under the post where it has like comment get my app name

7810213
profiling	debugging
i can not override the physical path for the file on a configuration profiling basis so i need to add a new sqlcmd variable that i can specify the physical path on a configuration profiling basis but need to alter the schema to use the variable instead of the string the string of the physical path in my debugging environment.

7810229
toggleclass	slidetoggle
however on the iphone the slidetoggle works fine but the toggleclass never removes the class

7810258
button	checkbox
i think one tricky part of this is that the entire list item is a button meaning you don t have to press directly on the checkbox to check it you can press anywhere on the list item

7810290
rss	feed
if you are getting data from a feed aka rss xml then you should be using an xml parser like nokogiri to process the xml

7810306
public	protected
you can call their public and protected member functions and for that to succeed their data members certainly have to be initialized - which is just what base class constructors do

7810311
ubuntu	debian
i know is an old question but actually the example that you found is the recommended way to do that start stop restart in ubuntu and debian

7810321
inherited	properties
if that s the case then you d create a base class to include methods and properties that will be common to the classes that inherited it

7810321
inherited	properties	inherited	subclassing
then maybe you d maybe create a sportscar subclassing that inherited the car class and adds properties such as spoiler turbocharger etc

7810414
freemarker	velocity
you re looking for a template engine like velocity freemarker sitemesh etc

7810426
x86	64bit
exit code -1 message to after alot of google search i found out that my eclipse was only for 32 bit europe 3.3.2 and i had windows 64bit so the path to my jdk was to my 64bit programfiles folder not to programfile x86 folder and i changed that in my eclipse.ini to

7810475
actionscript	mxml
but i want this button as an itemrenderer to be written in actionscript and not mxml

7810484
post	get
if i set up as post and call it as an ajax call with jquery this is the end result i am hoping for as i need to pass some data to the service if necessary i can pass the data points in the url and use get

7810504
folder	directory
this time downloaded jogl-linux-amd64.7z fresh within it opened java-jogl-src.zip and copied the contents to librambo jar again to see if i could just get it to work in this folder 100 errors because the directory structure didn t match

7810525
arcgis	proj
i could solve the problem for the display in arcgis by using the proj tool data management toolbox projections and transformations toolset raster

7810554
hide	show
what you are looking for is asynctask where you can show hide the progressdialog in onpreexecute onpostexecute

7810567
min	max
dbcp let s you specify a min and max number for idle connections see link

7810567
min	max
i can specify a max and min pool size but that appears to be it

7810567
min	max
if not does anyone know if c3p0 has a default for max min idle connections or does it not limit them

7810688
versioning	upgrade
if you are willing to upgrade to delphi xe xe2 you might have an included light versioning of aqtime already if so check it out

7810700
getter	setter
making the various setter synchronized or the underlying references volatile still doesn t let you publish consistent state it just means that the object will always see the latest value for each getter on each call

7810701
getter	setter
i would like to save the getter and setter in prop any suggestion for this approach is welcome

7810745
folder	directory
the only caveat is that you have to be at the top level of your working directory the same folder that contains your .git folder for this command to work since the paths you pass in to git diff -- at the end via xargs are relative to that

7810823
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
an uiviewcontroller has a property called uinavigationcontroller

7810826
rubygems	rvm
but recently i switched to using rvm rubygems current as per the rvm site but as of this writing rvm doesn t know about rubygems-update 1.8.11

7810826
rubygems	rvm
site says i could use rvm rubygems head but i m a bit afraid irrationally

7810826
rubygems	rvm
can someone who knows more about this than i chime in and either alleviate my fears or tell me how you approach rvm rubygems when they fall out of sync...as it seems to be happening more an more.

7810835
google-chrome	firefox
we could throw in the portable version of firefox or google-chrome and customize the xul for firefox or open google-chrome in app mode

7810873
post	get
i have a facebook application and when i try send a post to wall of some users i get this exception from faceboo last api for php

7810885
submit	submission
so for the first time while submission form by clicking its coming in this method and it is preventing form values to submit and after fixing al those values when i am again trying to click on submit button then its not working in console i am getting this error-

7810941
post	get
a useful pattern is post redirect get aka redirect after post

7810942
google-chrome	firefox
you can see the correct effect in the jsfiddle link via firefox moz however it doesn t work in google-chrome webkit

7810942
google-chrome	firefox
looking at the firebug code in firefox the -moz-animation 2s ease 2s normal none 1 ooze appears in the css of the .logoanim - it doesn t appear in the webkit version in google-chrome

7810983
post	get
as for the difference between get and post it is as simple as get is used to send a get request

7810983
post	get
there is hardly any tradeoff in using get or post

7810991
post	put
changing the state on the server adding changing deleting stuff altough recently some web applications use post to change put to add and delete to delete.

7810991
post	put
however you should use post put when transferring data

7810991
post	get
get and post are very different

7811037
int	double
the input parameter for this should not be double int

7811037
int	double
it should be double int

7811037
for-loop	arrays
if you declare this function with just a double like you did then the program will allocate enough space for one double on the stack and your for-loop will be writing on important memory and by that i mean it will most likely just crash for arrays sizes bigger than one

7811037
int	double
void inmatrix double matrix int n

7811041
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
i also want compatibility with all major browsers ie7-9 firefox google-chrome safari opera ...

7811080
post	get
i ll post an update to the code when i can get some free time to do it

7811192
versioning	upgrade
an aspect oriented approach so that we can back out when you upgrade it to the versioning of spring which fixes this issue

7811199
int	double
double have 52-53 bit precision whereas a long has 64 bit precision for int only

7811199
int	double
your number is 19 digits long whereas a double can only store roughly 16 digits of decimal int data

7811215
onresume	onpause
it happens that when the activity is no longer visible because the notification window is on top of it it doesn t call the onpause event as i expected and when the notification window hides again and the activity goes foregrond the onresume method is not called either

7811239
range	median
my original code with stack 1 size stack 2 1 size stack 3 1 3 didn t make any sense it is exactly the same as stack i was just lucky with median s default option of using the 1st dimension for its working range

7811258
client-side	server-side
i m looking for specific code on how to send a file from the server-side of a gwt application so that the client-side user can save it on his machine

7811306
post	get
i have a facebook application that send some contents to users wall that authorized my app but some users dont have my application authorized obvious and i want check if it before send post wall becuase i get an error and instead of send a post i want send a application request

7811310
button	checkbox
it is perhaps a clue that the checkbox and button i have in the layout do not return null

7811310
put	get
i can interact with my views and put content into them and everything but i can t get a reference to them in my code

7811311
draggable	droppable
best use the jquery ui draggable droppable

7811315
implements	extends
all you need to care about is that it s something which implements the given interface or something which extends the abstract class

7811324
folder	directory
i am trying to modify the mine craft launcher to check for a minecraft folder in the current working directory and if none exists then use the established routines to crete and download the needed files

7811401
error-handling	exception-handling
the usual error-handling for these exception-handling is simply to retry the connection

7811434
hash	md5
an md5 hash is a 128bit number 16 bytes of raw binary data

7811439
hash	md5
the raw output of md5 is the plain binary string of the hash

7811514
ssms	sqlcmd
if your xml result set is still being truncated even after changing ssms options use the sqlcmd utility with xml on option prior to running your xml statement

7811535
mouseleave	mouseenter
the location is confusing the mouseenter mouseleave event used in hover

7811578
processors	hyperthreading
until now i wrote a mapping n_th thread to n-th logical core but it s not the most smart thing to do due to multi-socket processors and hyperthreading

7811596
teamcity	jenkins
this proved to be easy to do in teamcity and i m thinking it should be just as easy to do in jenkins as well

7811603
hash	md5
i need to put an index on a md5 hash column in the database

7811603
hash	md5
will storing a md5 hash work better in a binary column or a char 32

7811639
int	chars
the binary type will likely be smaller whereas the chars type will encode the values as int

7811649
post	get
this is because the browsers only support two http verbs get and post

7811649
post	put	post	get	put	get
rails uses tricks javascript - i think to pretend the browsers are sending put and delete which would be routed to associate with different actions to those of get and post

7811656
free	malloc	free	calloc	free	realloc	realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	calloc	malloc
i m trying to interpose malloc free calloc realloc etc with some interposers via ld_preload

7811656
free	malloc
in my small test only malloc seems to be interposed even though free is detected see output

7811672
content-length	content-type
i ve seen this happen with proxy servers in 2 conditions when the mime type content-type is set incorrectly in the web server and when the http headers content-length don t correctly include the length missing or wrong values

7811699
pull	push
important if other developers have been pulling from your repository this method will generate errors for them the next time they pull from your repo or you push to their repo

7811808
post	put
on my website i have a form to put post on wall by logged in users

7811808
post	get
i want the users to get notification in the android app whenever a new post is posted

7811814
int	chars
guids are in the format xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx where x is an hexadecimal chars but are internally stored as 128 bit int so they occupy very little amount of space and are very very fast for queries

7811814
int	chars
guids works much better than chars or binary they are fixed size and are often used as keys indices instead of int when more bits are needed due to their very high speed and low space consumption

7811818
free	malloc
this will pull in declarations for malloc and free with an extern c wrapper telling the compiler not to name-mangle

7811818
free	malloc
the reason malloc works is probably because or pulls in a declaration for malloc but not free

7811818
free	malloc
thus malloc is unmangled but free is mangled

7811822
coverity	pc-lint
static source code analyzers for example pc-lint under some configurations coverity prevent grammatech code sonar etc. detect most cases of undefined behavior like you have illustrated

7811831
subtract	add
the same way that you can add or subtract integers or divide floating point numbers without truncation the functions you put in your class determine how it is used by your program

7811879
int	chars
they happen to be strings containing chars also used to represent int in other contexts but they are strings nonetheless and so this is valid json

7811895
opera	firefox
demo here updated to work in firefox and opera

7811904
postgresql	mysql
worth to mention is that heroku uses postgresql and i use mysql locally if that matters

7811915
hide	show
use the version of toggle that takes a showorhide parameter to show #test when the selected option is not 3 and hide it when it is 3

7811934
google-chrome	safari
latest google-chrome safari are even worse they hide both boxes behind the iframe

7811963
yourkit	jprofiler
two good options are jprofiler and yourkit

7811972
allegro	sdl
the project also contains thin bindings header files to some popular 3rd party libraries such as the c runtime library allegro sdl opengl gtk+ the windows api and many others as well as example programs for many of these libraries

7811988
width	height
you can check the width height of the view with the visible part of it

7812022
hide	show
there is no builtin hide show column way in listview as much as i m aware of so one of solutions can be just remove that column form ui

7812037
folder	directory
i m trying to get xcopy to copy an entire directory tree and all its files however one of the directory paths includes a hidden folder and although you can use the h parm to specify copying hidden files this doesn t seem to apply to hidden folder

7812078
gridview	sqldatasource
what you should be looking at are gridview and sqldatasource from web forms

7812078
gridview	sqldatasource
sqldatasource is where gridview get the data from and sending the data to which has to connect to the database using a connection string

7812108
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
but i can t find any api on either uitabbarcontroller or on uinavigationcontroller with which to access these children and uimorenavigationcontroller is not a public class so i can t rely on any methods exposed on that class

7812144
post	put
you need to call update on the spcontext.current.listitem that s where the post data gets put

7812152
ocean	petrel
currently this is not supported by ocean for petrel

7812179
button	checkbox
but i need to know when for example someone checks one of the checkbox in the list view or when someone clicks on a button

7812183
cpu	hyperthreading
if the first number is equal to the cpu number 0 in this example then it s a real core if not it is a hyperthreading core

7812183
cpu	hyperthreading
however we are checking cpu13 and the first number is 1 so cpu 13 this is an hyperthreading core

7812205
for-loop	arrays
.subscribe could take an arrays of publishers and push it through a for-loop to subscribe to multiple points of data

7812205
implements	extends
you re just using some dude s widget and one day your widget crashes because you were extends it or implements it based on non-interface methods or non-interface data which happened to change as of v1.2.1

7812230
inherited	properties
if called this way this will refer to an empty object which inherited from the constructor function s prototype properties somefunc.prototype

7812232
16-bit	64bit
since 64bit versions of windows do not support 16-bit programs natively you will have to find another way

7812232
16-bit	64bit
your friend could install the so-called windows xp mode which is microsoft s supported method of running old 16-bit programs on a 64bit operating system

7812247
postgresql	mysql
heroku uses postgresql which has some specific quirks - so if you are working with sqlite or mysql in dev then its possible you might get different behaviour on heroku

7812272
awt	swing
i m just starting to learn awt and swing

7812283
folder	directory
i deleted the derived data folder in the project directory

7812307
profiler	yourkit
there are open source profilers available such as or commercial profilers such as yourkit java profiler

7812317
sorting	grouping
i do see that if you use it sorting them becomes disabled for any column that is in a grouping

7812317
sorting	grouping
does anyone know if there is any work around to this as i can t turn off sorting as its being used today but i would like to be able to leverage this new feature to grouping sets of columns

7812347
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i m not a javascript or jquery guru but i have it working perfectly in ie7+ firefox google-chrome and safari pats self on back

7812364
exponent	modulo
where s is the signature or the message e is the public exponent n is the modulo and m is the encrypted message or decoded signature

7812365
inherited	properties
it is a simple inherited properties

7812366
google-chrome	firefox
the reason it appears to work in google-chrome and firefox is because they support border-radius natively which does work on img elements

7812493
javassist	cglib
other options for handling interfaces would be dynamically creating an implementing object using jdk dynamic proxies or a mock framework like mockito and for handling abstract classes javassist cglib or again mockito

7812502
maven	pom.xml
for reference the needed change is to the compatibility library dependency in the maven pom.xml file to be like this

7812511
width	height
with a set height and width and have its text be vertically and horizontally centered

7812805
free	malloc
i am trying to malloc and free a small array table of single letter strings

7812805
free	malloc
i know that this can be done in an array but i want to try and do this with a malloc and free

7812886
division	modulo
you need to use division and modulo

7812902
comparator	comparable
if the java treeset is set with a comparator to deal with the objects sorting logic but the objects class also implements comparable and have valid comparator method implemented on it

7812906
google-chrome	firefox
any reason why this would only play in google-chrome but not firefox 7.0.1 or ie8

7812933
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i have several uiviewcontroller loaded via a uinavigationcontroller where i override loadview and setup a custom view to display

7812933
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i think that either the uinavigationcontroller or the uiviewcontroller is able to force it s view to fill the screen when displayed

7812957
put	get
since earlier ios versions ignore public.text our solution is to put all three versions on the pasteboard public.text and public.utf8-plain-text will both get you the plain text and public.html will get you the html text

7812980
chown	sudo
try sudo chown ben ben eclipse_indigo to set yourself as the owner as well as the group-owner

7812987
rss	feed
browsers typically prevent javascript from dynamically loading an xml rss feed unless that feed is on the same domain

7813053
put	get
you ve to manually put get the values in from the map yourself and or use the reference in el which basically refrences the map

7813053
jsf	seam
seam faces has however hijacked the jsf specific javax.faces.bean package for its flashscoped annotation but this is definitely not from standard jsf api

7813073
codeigniter	pyrocms
i have been using pyrocms and codeigniter for quite some time and truly love it

7813086
nsstring	nsdata
i suspect if you are detecting a limit it is really a limit on the size of an nsstring or nsdata or whatever it is you re supplying to uipasteboard

7813124
admob	inmobi
other providers like admob inmobi mopub all have similar listeners you can set

7813147
versioning	upgrade
i would like to upgrade but i can already tell this is going to be a nightmare and i can t find any definitive source of the compatibility issues between each versioning from 1.2.6 to 1.6

7813178
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
the framespace for the uiviewcontroller becomes smaller because uinavigationcontroller manipulates the view by adding a uinavigationbar which is 44.0f in size

7813196
int	chars
void something float a int b chars c

7813196
int	chars
float int chars

7813282
width	height
just draw a rectangle with a width and height of one

7813298
post	get
i have three possible http post returns that i m trying to get an array out of with php 5.1.6

7813414
vsto	add-in
i have an outlook add-in project that was first developed in visual studio 2008 using vsto 3.0 and targeting outlook 2007

7813460
mdpi	hdpi
the answer my question though i just need to do 2 things a set the imageview scaletype to centerinside and b duplicate all drawables from the mdpi folder into the hdpi folder as explained above the will make it work

microsoft typically places a copy of assemblies intended to be referenced from the gac in folder under the programfiles reference assemblies directory but these are only used at design-time

7822256
filtering	grouping
i could be totally wrong here but i think people missed the fact that your title used the word grouping instead of filtering and the part that said starting from its date property

7822261
range	median
in fact the median returns a single value computed on a conglomerate of all the range you cared about and every data i point is replaced with that single value

there are ie hacks to make min and max width work

7822600
hide	show
i ve been able to hide show the final column based on the authenticated user s role but i can t seem to figure out how to list just the users who have reviewer access

7822616
min	max

7822623
jruby	mri
obviously the platforms method in bundler knows how to figure out if i m running mri or jruby

7822770
equals	gethashcode
with your overrides of equals and gethashcode in place if you have an existing list that you need to filter simply invoke distinct available through the namespace system.linq on the list

7822770

this is useful when overriding equals and gethashcode directly is either impossible you don t control the source or does not make sense your idea of equality in this particular case is not universal for the class

7822770
equals	gethashcode
the idea is that you submit a lambda expression directly and omit the overrides of equals and gethashcode or the custom comparer entirely

7822773
jsf	seam

i actually get the post that i would expect and mirrors the actual facebookjapan s page

7822790
versioning	upgrade
the obvious possibility would be if you want to target a number of different versioning of visual studio and be able to directly generate the correct files for each instead of generating files for the oldest versioning you want to support and then depend on visual studio s upgrade feature to convert those to the target versioning

7823604
folder	directory
the reason that you must copy these library files into your instance specific directory structures also know as catalina_base s is that in tomcat 5.5 and early 6.0 versions tomcat could only use a single folder as the classpath source for the libraries found in shared server and common

if there s a element next to a radio button or checkbox and its id is used as the for attribute within the clicking the will select its corresponding radio button or checkbox

7824785
button	checkbox
the issue here is that jquery scrolltop doubles the calculated position but only when you click on a which selects a radio button or checkbox

7824785
button	checkbox
it scrolls the proper distance when you click anything else including the radio button or checkbox itself

7824816

the decision of using tomcat which from my point of view is more a lightweight container versus a heavy one jboss glassfish ... depends mainly on what you need to do

however i also want my page to automatically update should the source that is supplying the rss feed change

7825510
rss	feed
for example assume that the intial page load consumes the rss feed and it contains two items george washington and john adams

7825510
rss	feed
thirty seconds later the source that supplies the rss feed now contains three items george washington john adams and thomas jefferson

7825510
rss	feed
the most obvious answer is to use window.setinterval and have the page check the rss feed at given intervals to see if it has changed

7825510
rss	feed
my ignorance is astounding when it comes to the rss atom feed world so don t assume that i already know it because i most likely don t

7825547
put	get
unless you can somehow get a callback when the feed is updated which the feed owner would need to provide and which would require a server-side solution like node.js to put the callback through to the client the setinterval way is the only way

7827967
bash	zsh
printf is probably available as usr bin printf and or bin printf and it s also a built-in in some shells bash and zsh anyway but its behavior is much more consistent

7827994
submit	submission
if you are going to trigger form submission using js and there is almost never a time when doing so is better than having a submit button then you need to manually fire any other functions you want to run at the same time

you can check information about indexeddb which is already implemented in webkit google-chrome 12 as window.webkitindexeddb and also firefox has implemented it

7828159
many-to-many	one-to-many
imho the missing link in your understanding of modeling data with an rdbms is grokking one-to-many and many-to-many relationships

7828172
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this link works fine on google-chrome firefox internet explorer and safari on windows

7828388
lxml	elementtree
if you don t have lxml installed you can use elementtree which is included in the standard library

7828402
udp	mtu
the ideal is that of the mtu of your network for normal ethernet that means an udp payload of 1472 bytes

7828419

try-catch	exception-handling
in netbeans and probably eclipse if you simply enter the code without any try-catch block the ide will hint to you what exception-handling will be thrown and offer to wrap the statements in a try-catch block

7828611
prop	each
i managed to temporary sort of workaround by setting condition above on hidden prop on details band of each table and it kinda worked except it shows me department header categ header for all dept categs combinations no matter they have or no details records - which obvious is not good

7828646
spweb	spsite
the creation of my spsite spweb objects is wrapped in a call to spsecurity.runwithelevatedprivileges and i have other code that runs which finds deletes updates attributes on folders etc.

7828660
sorting	filtering
sql by itself is not very efficient but the storage engine for sorting filtering presenting is

7828669
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
if you are really really paranoid you could catch runtimeexception that should get all unchecked-exception that you would want to deal with--it s not a recommended tactic but can prevent your program from failing from some unknown unseen future bug.

7828772
inherited	subclassing
for example if there is a single table inherited base named actors and a subclassing commenter the actor factory file could require a nested file for commenter

7828915
integer	unsigned
if your compiler supports an unsigned 64-bit integer type unsigned long long or whatever microsoft calls it use that

7828915
hash	md5
if there s some kind of order non-randomness predictability in the uuid values that makes that unsuitable you can compute an md5 or sha-1 hash and discard all but 64 bits

7828915
hash	md5
if you re restricted to a 32-bit integer you can xor the four 32-bit quarters of the uuid together or discard all but 32 bits of the md5 or sha-1 hash

7828924
openssl	libcrypto	hash	md5
through experimentation i found in openssl 0.9.8r that libcrypto has 2 algorithm dependencies md5 for the random-number generator s algorithm in crypto rand_lib.c and sha-1 for printing certificate hash in crypto asn1 t_x509.c

7828924

7829181
int	chars
because int comparisons are more efficient and simpler than unicode chars comparisons

7829181

min	max
mongodb is slated to get native aggregation functions for things like sum avg min max in version 2.1.1 currently slated for nov 1 2011

7829361
many-to-many	one-to-many
i see this as a one-to-many relationship as each item in the second table can have many comments but no two items can be associated with the same comment entry in the itemcomments table so a many-to-many relationship does not apply

7829387
udp	tcp
i then usually read random values of ports tcp udp whatever and paste it into random places in my router setttings page and repeat this process until the damn thing starts working

i would instead like to make it a semi-static drawing platform that display one or more images using gtk gdk and i would like to imitate the excellent api principles of tikz the latex package

7830145
gtk	cairo	pygtk	pycairo
unfortunately the cairo gtk pycairo pygtk documentation that i found --- i don t know who it s written for but not for me

7830145
gdk	cairo
the point is that gdk make a temporary double buffer when you draw things in gdk including using cairo

7830145
gdk	cairo
so it would be much nicer if cairo could write to a permanent double buffer rather than a temporary one and then that permanent double buffer would be exposed with gdk

7830145
gtk	gdk	gtk	cairo	gdk	cairo
what i really care about is creating a permanent double buffer pixel array between cairo and gtk gdk instead of a temporary double buffer pixel array

7830145
gtk	cairo
it seems that the easiest way to do that is to make the gtk window a cairo surface and make the double buffer another cairo surface

7830147
hide	show
like pretty much all of the apex visualforce tags apex outputlink has a rendered attribute which can be used to show or hide it and this can use a merge field formula for the value so you ll be looking for something along the lines of

factors	matrix
then you want to do an eigenvalue decomposition on you can use 1 size amm 2 -1 as a scale factors if you want an interpetation as an unbiased covariance matrix with

7830529
memcpy	malloc
you can either declare an array of a really large size that would not possibly be filled by the user input then use scanf or something like that to grab the integers until you hit n or you can grab each integer at a time allocating memory as you go using a combination of malloc and memcpy calls

7830534
setinterval	clearinterval	setinterval	settimeout	clearinterval	settimeout
you can clear the previous interval using clearinterval or use settimeout instead of setinterval

7830899
gtk	gdk
most the drawing stuff in gtk is done at gdk layer

7830899
gtk	gdk	gtk	cairo	gdk	cairo
although my experience with python bindings for gtk gdk cairo is nil but i think that google will provide you with some good resources if you look up gdk-cairo sample

7830954
free	malloc
i am currently having to write implementations of malloc and free and am given a driver program that will run my two implementations

7830954

i have the line and line number from running gdb but i need to know if malloc and free have been called more than once to confirm that there is indeed at least one case where it runs smoothly

7830957
cout	cin
do not suggest that i use c++ strings or cin cout because that will not help me for this assignment

7831001
width	height
there is also many other cvpixelbufferget methods to enquire width height etc for knowledge of the size of data to be transmitted

7831037
unicorn	webrick
if i place it into the initializers it works once then it won t continue to work on any rails server webrick unicorn but it works fine in the console

7831177
disk	ram
use create tablespace to create a db cluster on the ram disk

7831177
disk	ram
obviously your ram tables will not persist across system reboots unless you save the ram disk

7831203
int	double
you can think of delegates as a cross between value types like int or double and arrays of method addresses

7831203
multiplying	add
when you then call something like c 4 2 you are effectively calling both add multiplying and because the delegate returns a value you only get back the final delegate s value - in this case from multiplying - and that s what makes it appear that the pointer changed to the multiplying method

7831203
multiplying	add
now if you change your add multiplying methods to look like this

7831230
jar	war
i put rebel.xml in src hot but it doesn t work i tried modifying build.xml to copy rebel.xml to the war s web-inf classes and the root of jar i opened the .ear file with winrar checked the war and jar files are in those locations but still nothing

google-chrome	safari
this only take place in google-chrome and safari

7831454

7831669
strncpy	malloc
note that if the path leading to the command name is 50 characters or more you won t have a null-terminated string - the space allocated by malloc is not zeroed and strncpy does not write a trailing zero on an overlong string

7831708
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
it differs with the answer below in that it subclasses qgraphicsscene not qgraphicsview and it uses so there isn t a need to manually map coordinates

7831708
qgraphicsview	qmouseevent
you need to subclass qgraphicsview to be able to do something with mouse presses or with mouse releases using qmouseevent

7831708
qgraphicsview	qmainwindow	qgraphicsview	qwidget	qmainwindow	qwidget
if you don t use a qmainwindow and a form you can add it to a qwidget if you set a layout for it and then add your qgraphicsview to that layout in a similar manner

7832233
hide	show
this will hide all show divs except the one you clicked

7832268
dictionary	map
as far as why this is good the reason should be simple when you have a design where things map from one thing to other and this mapping will always be static it is obvious to represent it as dictionary rather then if else or switch case which hides the intention that it was just a mapping

7832273
inherited	properties
i have a view which inherited the navigationcontroller properties but when i click an image inside this video i need to present a viewcontroller modally

7832552
qgraphicsview	qscrollarea
when you set a widget or qgraphicsview to a qscrollarea you change that widget s parent

7832552
qgraphicsview	qscrollarea
so if you wanted to set up your qgraphicsview inside a qscrollarea your code would look like this

7832552
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene	qgraphicsview	qscrollarea	qscrollarea	qgraphicsscene
when using qgraphicsviews with a qgraphicsscene instead of setting the margins using a qscrollarea s setcontentsmargins i use the qgraphicsview automatic scrolling and just set the scene rect to have a larger margin that the size of my content like so

7832789
rdf	owl
as a very crude approximation you can think of owl and rdfs rdf schema being in the same category and you can think of rdf as the underlying somewhat abstract language that is used to express everything in the world of semantic web including actual resources as well as descriptions in owl and rdfs

7832818
post	get
it looks like you just need to post an updategl right after you get the new position values

in fact in my experience php is faster than any dynamic language i have benchmarked it against - python perl ruby tcl are all slower performing than php

7834195
int	chars
if it is a value stored in a different type lets say int then just simply remember the fact that hex encoding needs 2 chars per 8 bits to encode the whole value range

7834252
width	height
for media types that require a running stream you can also play the stream extract the media parameters such as width and height and then setup your graph correctly

7834252
width	height
depends on the decoder some decoders just require you to stream the media and then setup everything correctly others may require that the width and height etc be correctly configured

7834258
inherited	properties
your second snippet basically means that a baz is-a foo so a baz instance in addition to its own properties has the same properties as a foo instance inherited

you can use and mix many hash methods with additional salt which can be based on domain+other logic that will be very difficult to guess or crack depends what hash algorithms you will use and other things unless someone knows how its done

7835067
post	get
do i have to register my website as somewhere that might get post

7835089
width	margin
you need to specify a width otherwise the margin won t know how to centre.

7835124
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
tested this on ie 7 8 9 firefox google-chrome and safari on a win7 box

7835244
int	double
roundto double value double towards int numberofdigitsbehindcomma

7835248
converter	multibinding
this could be done using a multibinding with a converter that returns true if the index is equal the count false otherwise

7835258
width	height
i have set enough height and width for it in ib but it looks like the tableview appears on screen with very narrow one row and it does not resize when the tables fills with rows

7835287
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
i am working on a new website which should be perfect - compatible with ie6+ firefox google-chrome opera safari

7835287
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome 14.0.835 firefox 7.0.1 ie9 when zooming out - the top right box size is changing atleast it looks like it and then it is not right aligned with the box below

7835287
width	height
explanation the zoom function on every browser changing the width height of the div but not the border size therefore it cause this glitch float

7835321
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
if the database is configured as case-insensitive then you cannot get it to do a case-sensitive comparison on the password unless you resort to tsql tricks

7835321
hash	salt
you should not be storing a password - you should be storing a salt hash ideally salt per user

7835323
helpers	actioncontroller
i assume that view_factory is a helpers method defined in a plugin and it is included to the application helpers with something like actioncontroller base.helper factoryhelpermodule

7835371
int	double
i m trying to get all the double after the into a vector which i can do if they re int but once a . is entered it seems to stop

7835389
post	get
i ll post the code links here it s just a small and silly project to test if i can get it up and running so that i can use hibernate in the future

7835438
hide	show
to show the dialogo you should first hide it i think

7835446
getter	setter	textview	imageview
i define an xml layout .at run time i am get linearlayout from xml layout file i am creating a listview at run.at run time in listview i am adding many relativelayouts as shown in picture # 5 this relativelayout contains different other ui component like textview imageview etc its working fine but when user press back button i am saving listview object using setter method in beans when user comes on activity resume again i am getting listview from getter method and adding it again to my linearlayout as i add above but its giving me exception as java.lang.illegalstateexception the specified child already has a parent

7835463
post	put
after that put up a captcha only after some time interval or some number of post by him her

7835481
primes	modulus
the length of each primes factor must be no more than half the length of the modulus

7835481
exponent	modulo
the private exponent must not be longer than the modulo

7835481
exponent	modulo
the private exponent reduced modulo p-1 resp

7835481
exponent	modulo
technically there are infinitely many possible values for the private exponent d and similarly for exponent1 and exponent2 because all that mathematically matters are the value of d modulo p-1 and q-1

7835481
integer	unsigned
the public exponent here encoded within the rsapubkey field must fit in a 32-bit integer unsigned

7835526
folder	dir
this will create the folder structure a b c in current working dir

7835566
google-chrome	firefox
i put together a site that generally works well on firefox google-chrome and ie8 yes i m new to this

7835599
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
you should generally not directly add the views of uinavigationcontroller and uitabbarcontroller as subviews of your own view controllers

7835599
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
this is normally a uinavigationcontroller uitabbarcontroller etc

7835633
inherited	properties
accessing a field via an object properties instead of a direct reference allows you to use prototypal inherited

7835638
put	get
to get around this before your foreach statement put

7835651
gmail	hotmail
however when i did this the mail did not arrive at hotmail and gmail accounts

7835651
gmail	hotmail
if i add more html like a table it still gets rejected by hotmail and probably gmail too

7835671
button	checkbox
i created a web user control using a checkbox and invisible link button

7835740
width	height
note that in flex components that have not been added to the stage may not lay out properly until you give them a width and height and call validatenow on them

7835766
rss	feed
i am trying to aggregate several rss feed and when i try to convert the publish date i get from the feedds i get an exception as the date is in the following format

7835771
width	height
and probably a good idea to include the height and width options too

7835788
width	height
the size of each sector is known sector width and sector height and also the amount of sectors rows and columns

7835788
width	height
all sectors are of the exact same size width and height

7835851
put	get
i didn t get what you mean exactly because your background depends on the users display resolution but generally if you set the width and margine of html to auto it will scratch all over your page wether user maximize or put in any resolution for scrolling you can also reach what you looking for

7835852
prepare	execute
the fastest way to do it with dbi is to prepare your sql insert statement and then execute it multiple times

7835853
textview	imageview
if you have a textview or imageview inside of your xml for the dialog you can simply just change the helping text image by defining it the same wat as with the button and changing it when appropriate

7835878
primefaces	richfaces
the standard jsf implementation does not offer something like to represent dynamic columns but component libraries richfaces and primefaces have respectively and for exactly this purpose

7835917
width	height
as mentioned by others ctrl+w _ ctrl+w | to maximize within the current tab window layout while respecting min height width settings for various other windows

7835917
width	height
ctrl+w resizes all windows to equal size respecting the minimum height width settings

7835933
range	minimum
if you have a minimum width requirement 1 for non-empty columns remove it 15 times from your 320 pixels generate the numbers in the new range and make the necessary adjustments

7835935
octal	decimal
its called one of bitwise operator it treat their operands as a sequence of 32 bits zeros and ones rather than as decimal hexadecimal or octal numbers.bitwise xor a b returns a one in each bit position for which the corresponding bits of either but not both operands are ones

7835944
fadein	fadeout	fadein	hide	hide	fadeout	hide	show
the content of the second uiscrollview consists of one ore more uiviews which are animated via cabasicanimation fadein fadeout show hide

7835987
spaces	delimiter
but if this is a string or another byte array with a significant delimiter you can check for the size not for the allocated spaces

7836032
datalist	repeater
actually i want to bind repeater inside a datalist s databound event due to which repeater s bound event is called twice

7836064
int	chars
on windows i get the int and then some chars or byte data

7836107
unsigned	short
in windows wchar_t is the same as unsigned short while in unix it s 4 bytes long so you should create your own vector type to make your code portable

7836109
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome return me the code correctly

7836113
integer	unsigned
a 32-bit unsigned integer type 1

7836113
integer	unsigned
a 4-bit unsigned integer type realized as a bitfield 2

7836122
width	height
when you use float xxx browsers can not calculate the height width of element properly you have to use clear both an element that resides after floating box

7836138
ssl	https
i m using ssl too so i have to tell the app it should use the https scheme

7836142
unsigned	short
everything works fine it s just that wchar_t is a synonym for unsigned short on your platform and so the debugger doesn t know what name to display there

7836165
int	chars
in chars class public static chars fordigit int digit int radix does the same

7836174
maven	m2e
and maven 2 as build tool m2e plugin

7836174
maven	m2e
so question is how to control eclipse or the m2e or maven or whatever is causing the problem not to generate those folders and why i get them in first place

7836187
int	chars
microsoft just wants to facilitate inspecting wchar_t values which are short int s and represent utf16 coded chars on windows so their debugger shows short int s as wchar_t s

7836191
rss	feed
i found this site that allows to convert rss feed into json

7836198
ocl	uml
the object constraint language ocl can be used to define invariants queries pre- and postconditions for mof meta-models including uml models

7836198
ocl	qvt
beside constraint definition ocl is used as a query language in model transformation approaches like qvt

7836216
centos	linux
working under linux server centos remotly in local network my rails server working there too

7836222
post	get
post vs get - post is meant to change state of server whole get is for reading results -

7836222
post	get
you should use get to retrieve news and post to post comments

7836222
put	get
first update will get everything you may also put a limiton amopunt of news retrieved in single batch

7836234
min	max
i have think about length obviously bounds the square obtained joining min latitude min longitude max latitude and max longitude tortuosity average speed average elevation

7836263
getter	setter
you can t use kvo and do custom getter and setter with instance variables other than that they are very similar when using arc

7836268
accessor	properties
you really should be using properties accessor to handle the memory management for your lastindexpath1 variable

7836348
subtraction	addition
the foundational things that you get with languages tend to be very mathematical and symmetric like an integer is unlikely to have addition but not subtraction

7836352
ant	maven
i would start looking in your maven ant environment properties

7836352
ant	maven
the java_home and other options set int your maven properties or ant properties will be used for the compile and build

7836359
highcharts	highstock
format highcharts xaxis for stock data problem when using the highstock library when the candlestick type is used

7836377
hide	show
in that case storing the data as a rawsxp can be appropriate typically as a slot or element of an s3 or s4 class with print show methods to hide the gory details from the user

7836377
free	calloc
perhaps the downside is that the rawsxp is allocated and managed by r subject to garbage collection whereas the content of an external pointer would likely be allocated more directly via calloc and free

7836405
put	get
i noticed that if i put double quotes on my input boxes that get passed to php via json json_decode will return null

7836414
next	document.write
this is because they can modify the html document including for example adding further scripts that must be loaded and executed before the next script in the original html document via calls to document.write

7836501
pull	push
the table structure seems simple enough but would rather pull from azure than push

7836503
folder	directory
i m able to create any other files and see them in the folder but when i try to create a .htaccess i don t see that file in the directory

7836534
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
i am benchmarking java functions over a local network via object serialization objectinputstream objectoutputstream

7836574
put	get
following put s get an error as response because response is added to the model

7836579
nsurl	nsstring
nsurl url nsurl urlwithstring nsstring stringwithformat

7836598
hide	show
it works great and show hide its as needed

7836610
pull	push
by and large when it comes to vendor software products they are used interchangeably and do not have the strong distinctions in terms of push or pull as you describe

7836618
post	get
you might spot that i get a mention in his post since i love messing about with those hidden methods

7836691
google-chrome	firefox
this works well in firefox and google-chrome however the content doesn t load in ie

7836744
width	height
with identity.ortho 0 width 0 height -1.0f 1.0f you were on the right track

7836775
google-chrome	safari
btw im using google-chrome on ubuntu 10.04 if that matters this might be a safari desktop issue

7836820
udp	tcp
anyway imagine a normal server using tcp udp put here your favourite wsgi sip classified information server etc

7836841
webclient	webrequest
i know there is a timeout property with webrequest class but i am not sure if just can replace webclient with webrequest but keep the functionality

7836859
google-chrome	firefox	inherited	properties
the function of code is to swap text-align of all tags in firefox google-chrome this code do perfect work but on ie i have a problem on it i think it read inherited text-align properties after changing parent properties and swap it again

7836875
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
all work perfect in firefox and google-chrome - plugin return correct hours until end date but ie and safari shows just nan nan nan

7836923
hide	show
once the date has been established figuring out a way to show or hide the specific image based on date

7836986
hide	show
as to how you d show hide the images i d be inclined to conditionally add a class to elements to be hidden or show

7837036
pull	push
reject pushes where changeset authorship doesn t match authenticated users using a hook in practice this sucks because developers pull from one another and push one another s changesets all the time

7837038
jfreechart	windowbuilder	swing	windowbuilder
it s not a requirement but i have had good luck with building standard swing interfaces with windowbuilder so i d like to go further and include jfreechart components with them

7837047
width	height
there was a new innercontainer class that sets the height and width to 100 to ensure it fills the containing box and thus the borders are where they are wanted

7837051
swt	swing
you can then add a ui layer say swing or swt onto the business logic layer to create a client application similarly you could create a web-app

7837065
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
newer browsers implement json.stringify ie from version 8.0 firefox from version 3.5 google-chrome from version 4.0 safari from version 4.0 opera from version 10.5

7837103
google-chrome	safari
the problem is that google-chrome and safari both don t do anything on loading refreshing the page - you have to click out- and then inside the window for them to start the animation

7837147
width	height
i have used a 1x1 transparent pixel set the width and height as 100 and it works

7837188
pop-up	dialog
at a high level - the app has a main screen and several modal dialog -type screens that pop-up to manage various user interactions

7837223
.htaccess	httpd.conf
i have checked through my php.ini httpd.conf and .htaccess and error reporting is set to e_all but i must have missed something to enable fatal error logging

7837245
client-side	server-side
the hook could be either server-side which wouldn t prevent commit but would prevent pushing that change to your server-side repository or client-side which could prevent the commit but the hook would have to be installed locally by each developer

7837256
folder	directory
note that this will only work if your storedprocedure folder is in the topmost directory of any files that might need to include the files it contains

7837259
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
after a few hours of fixing the browser compatibility bugs in the reportingservices.js file i managed to get it to work on firefox google-chrome opera and safari as well as ie

7837281
put	get
the normal way to do this would be to put restrictions check-constraints triggers and stored procedures in the sql server db but i would like to avoid that in order to keep my code in one place and get syntax checking etc

7837317
textmate	sublimetext
if you aren t opposed to using a different editor there is a liquid mode for textmate which i think may also work on sublimetext if you aren t using a mac

7837317
vim	emacs
then of course there s surely got to be an emacs or vim plugin

7837323
portrait	landscape
upon further testing if i load the navcontroller in portrait with the first view being the table view then switch it to landscape then select the cell then press back it works fine

7837323
portrait	landscape
so the problem only happens if i start the app in landscape and never turn it to portrait

7837327
folder	directory
i would like to find a way that automatically loads a file if it is found inside the specific_modules folder file2.php when called if it is not found it should load file2.php normally from the modules directory

7837334
disk	ram
they use methods of delaying disk write they keep cached copy of data they need to write in ram so that they can achieve fast insert rates

7837338
vim	emacs
the vim o o command is a two key command in emacs

7837354
put	get
if i put following embed code i get the proper preview of the embed code

7837379
google-chrome	firefox
basically i want a program that can generate the list of files google-chrome s network tab in developer tools can make or firefox s firebug plugin

7837407
spaces	delimiter
if you needed to check for multiple words and do it without regular expressions you could use stringtokenizer with a spaces as the delimiter

7837451
maven	pom.xml
and since i m using maven the relevant bit from the pom.xml

7837517
folder	directory
this new location should be the parent directory of the source folder

7837522
pop-up	dialog
if i understood you well on the receiving end a service will be monitoring for events on bluetooth or wifi and should pop-up a dialog requiring user to accept or deny a transaction

7837558
width	height
first i used videoview but the device eken m003s played the video in full screen not within the videoview which i set both width and height by 272 x 153 dp

7837558
width	height
i entered width 272 and height 153 to force width and height of the .mp4 video to be of that size but eken m003s continues to play video in full screen mode

7837587
post	get
i have read the post how to stop wpf tabcontrol to unload visual tree on tab change but i could not get it work i must have missed something

7837597
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
you want to use nsdatecomponents in combination with nscalendar s datefromcomponents method

7837623
width	height
the move limit should be properly enforced once you specify the container option and your container has a set width and height

7837637
hash	md5
to get the md5 hash in php use

7837648
margin	height
for example if the whole screen is 320dp height and you want the horizontal list view to be 80dp height you need to set the top margin to 240dp

7837652
hash	salt
salt string salt to add to the hash

7837659
post	put
second i realized that the requestmethod for submitmodifyaccess should be post or perhaps put

7837659
post	put	post	get	put	get
first i believe that in order to do a rest put or post you have to have a get of that exact same url

7837717
width	height
i think you need to explicitly set the width height in the label

7837717
width	height
you can set it to width auto height auto but it has to be set

7837718
for-loop	arrays
i would also prefer that you use a for-loop in this situation as you are looping over a static arrays where the amount of times you need to iterate is known from the beginning

7837744
implements	extends
i have looked into implements this yet we have faced issues in extends the baseexpandablelistadapter due to the java.lang.object being the return type of the method signatures

7837795
vim	emacs
if you re really desperate check whether vim or emacs is compiled with x support in which case you could automate them into handling it for you but this is a longshot

7837808
put	get
i m new to android and im trying to put a httpclient and writing to sqlite table to a service and i just cant get it right

7837827
button	checkbox
the requirement is when this checkbox is checked and the save button is clicked then one popup is opened

7837827
button	checkbox
if checkbox is unchecked and save button is clicked a simple save action is called no popup is open

7837841
pull	push
currently what i do is push pull changes between the repositories in the two

7837843
post	get
the documentation states post or get as valid options

7837851
content-length	content-type
an array of http header fields to set in the format array content-type text plain content-length 100

7837884
int	double
once for each type int and double

7837887
folder	directory
for no particular reason i will name the folder hera and put it into my home directory

7837928
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
it s simple and it works in ie6 7 8 9 google-chrome firefox opera safari etc.

7837929
google-chrome	firefox
this sample code renders differently in firefox and google-chrome

7837996
getter	setter
developer s guide doesn t recommend using getter when you can use direct field access avoid internal getter setter

7838020
put	get
the data originates as an xml file which i ve managed to extract and put into a php format but i m struggling to get the insert and checking functionality working

7838045
hide	show
it might me easier to create the button in markup and then hide or show it programmatically

7838048
min	max
i don t think jquery has any tools to quickly get min max value but it is pretty trivial to write yourself

7838101
for-loop	arrays
i want to assign float variables to nsmutable arrays in a for-loop

7838124
hide	show
i would hide pager on rowediting and show it again on cancel or update

7838143
button	checkbox
the problem is that for my froyo device the resources in ...platforms android-8 data res drawable-hdpi and ... drawable-mdpi do not look like the checkbox or radio button i see on screen

7838143
button	checkbox
specifically the widgets i see have a larger green fill circle in radio button and checks that extend outside the box for checkbox

7838171
post	get
i was able to get this to happen via ajax specifically calling jquery s .ajax function see with post type but no data

7838182
uiview	subviews
like i said in the title i am trying to animate a uiview that has several uibuttons as subviews

7838224
post	get
i ve searched on how to get the page id i ve obtained and used this id 123397591098452 for page but the post is not working

7838254
setinterval	settimeout
minimum setinterval settimeout delay on background tabs

7838304
ienumerable	iqueryable
i am accessing a remote data source and found that a group join causes an iqueryable query to be transformed into an ienumerable

7838310
post	get
holds all incoming parameters from both get and post

7838328
lxml	beautifulsoup
use a proper parser like beautifulsoup or lxml in python

7838333
sorting	grouping
then set the sorting at the appropriate level details grouping or a parent group.

7838340
getter	setter
imo you re better off finding the variables and renaming them using the rename variable refactoring which will also correctly handle getter setter renaming if applicable and so on rather than relying on a relatively ignorant search-and-replace

7838365
move	drag
i would like to also have the user move the picture with a drag gesture

7838420
min	max	range	min	range	max
it does need to know which fields it s doing what with--which fields are like versus equals how to handle min and max fields that define a range etc

7838437
put	get
i try to put the gem install activerecord-postgresql-adapter in my gem-file but when i run bundle install i get

7838437
rubygems	bundler

7838468
slackware	archlinux	debian	centos	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian
as far as i ve experienced it works on ubuntu debian redhat centos slackware and archlinux

7838478
ienumerable	iqueryable
edit for clarification calling toarray on an instance of objectquery iqueryable or ienumerable does hit the database and retrieves a result set

7838534
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
firefox and opera looks fine but google-chrome not.

7838557
button	checkbox
however i can t work out how to make radio button and checkbox checked depending on the stored xml data

7838582
width	height
so if i wanted a plane facing up with a width and height of 1000

7838634
int	chars
it tries to convert this string to an int because item.bill_to is a string and string.remove expects an int argument the position from which to remove chars but you pass a string instead

7838643
children	parent
this enables code-reuse and is generally more stable in terms of life cycle then children calling functions from their parent

7838643
children	parent
parent add children but children calling parent implies both objects must be aware and handle type definitions

7838643
children	parent
programmatic implementation should be passed downwards with the parent maintaining control of children

7838670
inherited	properties
incidentally i would suggest that it might be good to define an interface ireadablecustomer in which the properties just have getters and have icustomer inherited from ireadablecustomer icustomer would have to add a new qualifier to its properties definitions to avoid silly ambiguity messages

7838699
portrait	landscape
so it seems if you load a photo which was taken a photo in portrait upside-down it loads in that orientation if you take a photo in landscape left it loads in that orientation

7838749
mef	prism
i have a silverlight app i ve composed with prism using mef to dynamically load modules

7838782
decoder	encoder
the serial ports connect directly to ir encoder decoder hardware which then connect to the ir trancievers

7838791
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the webpage requires authentication and to make things simpler for the user i would like to pass along their authentication information to safari firefox google-chrome that is stored in my application

7838871
width	height
i started with jhoff s solution but rewrote it to use width height parameters and using arcto makes it quite a bit more terse

min	max	range	min	range	max
until i saw results for min and max that were outside the range of my data i was unaware that summary has a digits argument to specify precision of the output results

7840073
min	max	range	min	range	max
applying summary and range we get the following output - notice the discrepancy in the range values versus the min and max

7840073
min	max
to clarify my issue relative to the answers on the link provided by brian excepting the answer by brian himself it s not that the behavior is undocumented but it s flatly wrong to denote as min and max values which are not min and max

7840073
min	max
maybe one could argue whether min and max should be renamed as approximate min and approximate max but let s not go there.

7840084

you also can use the spine.js instead backbone.js

7840516

this could be accomplished most easily with using the push method but i m not too familiar with ajax push or comet technology so i ll give you a pull solution

7840650

with this new versioning tortoise developers now are forcing us to upgrade the folder in order to use it

7840680

7840680
cos	sin
there are 8 different ways you can do the sin cos of these two components with varying signs

7840707
width	height
it is because you are setting height and width in onload event which will occur only after image is totally loaded

7840707
width	height
but if u remove that the height and width values are not set and so it would not work

7840710
mp3	ogg
because of licensing issues mp3 is not available on firefox audio tag you will need to store your files as ogg in order for them to work on firefox

7840723
versioning	upgrade
previous versioning of tortoisesvn would just upgrade your working copy to the latest svn format without checking with you

7840749
width	height
then you hit the window.open line which needs width and height which are not yet defined

7840749
width	height
a few milliseconds later your image loads and so do your width and height

7840783
uninstall	upgrade
i ve personally had upgrade issues several times in relation to using xcode 4.x where the only thing that solved my problems was to completely uninstall the existing dev tools reboot and then install the new ones

7840809
accessor	properties
you can also make your life miserable by creating an interface implemented by both base classes and using di to intercept method and properties accessor calls which would then be routed to some kind of common surrogate class that actually provides the implementation

7840861
fast-forward	merge
occasionally as there are changes in a i will need to be able to pull them down and merge them into b s x_master which if i understand this should be a fast-forward as they will be the only changes in x_master branch on b and then be able to merge those changes into b s master and thus onto anyone cloning b s master when they pull

7840876
bluetooth	usb
android service to pass the commands to the pc via bluetooth or usb

7840888

i have a subclassing of this super that inherited the particular function but would rather it return a new version of the subclassing

7840920
hide	show
we have some sample code called honeycomb gallery you can take a look at here which has a two-column-plus-actionbar layout and the ability to show hide the leftmost column

7840920
hide	show
this should give you a good head start in figuring out how to do layout for multiple fragments and show hide them

7840944
google-chrome	firefox
i got it to work in firefox and google-chrome with no problem

fork wait and waitpid are defined by the pthreads standard and windows is not posix-compliant

7841251
sse	avx
every time you improperly switch back and forth between sse and avx instructions you will pay an extremely high 70 cycle penalty

7841251
sse	avx
when you compile without arch avx vs2010 will generate sse instructions but will still use avx wherever you have avx intrinsics

7841251
sse	avx
therefore you ll get code that has both sse and avx instructions - which will have those state-switching penalties

7841251
sse	avx
therefore you should use either all sse or all avx

7841251
sse	avx
it sounds like you re trying to make multiple code paths one for sse and one for avx

7841251
sse	avx
for this i suggest you separate your sse and avx code into two different compilation units

7841251
sse	avx
if you need to mix sse and avx be sure to use _mm256_zeroupper or _mm256_zeroall appropriately to avoid the state-switching penalties

7841252
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in google-chrome firefox but not in ie8 or lower

google-chrome	firefox
the problem i m trying to solve is i cannot make a authenticated web service request through openam without using cookies and i cannot figure out how to place the cookies in the flex file upload request well actually this works in ie but is broken in firefox and google-chrome - i read that this is because ie uploads the file in the same browser thread while some other browsers spawn a new thread and the cookie information does not get passed along

7841654
width	height
replace height by width top by right and bottom by left

7841665

when the user is at the bottom of the page and clicks on the links dialog pop-up but the main page jumps up to the top

7841678
ubuntu	debian
it s also available as ubuntu and debian package in official repos

7841705
stdout	stderr
you probably don t have an easy way as a subprocess to know what filedescriptors are useful from the parent process unless you pass that along with command line arguments and you certainly don t want stdin stdout or stderr so its perfectly reasonable to before doing anything else close all open files

7841710
hide	show
add the show and hide buttons and make sure it works

7841783
maven	m2e
a standard maven multi-module structure as a single git repo works perfectly fine for me in eclipse indigo with m2e and the git plugin that shows up in that environment.â you can t ask eclipse to do your fetching for you but once you ve pulled from command line you use team share say git

7841800
put	get
that would get put in workbook sheet2 cell a1

7841804
button	checkbox

7842078
verilog	vhdl
vhdl verilog are the target languages since i hope to work on an fpga

7842078

ceylon	kotlin
nowadays that more and more strong rivals appear kotlin ceylon it becomes obvious to me that groovy has already passed even its zenith - even its core team is trembling you should see their discussions on grumpy mode

7842153
int	chars
i know that it starts the sequence of chars which are int representation this sequence could be of any length including 0

7842153
int	chars
after the int sequence follows sequence of chars which are not int representation

7842156
multiplying	division
multiplying both sides by the square root eliminating division inequality is preserved because square root cannot return a negative number

7842176

i m doing it like this in google-chrome and firefox

7842176
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox this works perfectly

7842194
strtol	atoi
atoi should do what you want to although a more robust implementation would use strtol

7842206
google-chrome	firefox
i test the code in google-chrome ie and firefox

7842216
strtol	atoi
try atoi or the complete strtol

7842302
put	get

7842312
portrait	landscape
when i rotate from portrait to landscape and back the cells in the uitableview resize perfectly on-the-fly while the rotation is occurring

buffer overflow vulnerability in master due to strcpy instead of strncpy it shows you how things work

7842331
classname	inherited
square.h error expected classname before token for the inherited it does not identify shape

7842339
actualheight	actualwidth
you can use the window s updatelayout -method to have actualwidth and actualheight validated

7842360
move	drag
the reason for doing this is that when drag calls move start and up the this object isn t going to refer to your object

7842407
submit	submission
the default action when you hit enter in a text field in most browsers is to submit the form so your browser is submission it after it calls the js because your handler is not suppressing the default action

7842553
tablet	galaxy
i ve created an android 3.1 tablet app running on a samsung galaxy tab 10.1 that renders an html5 app in a webview using scrollable divs overflow-y scroll

7842563
width	height
you could take a step further and make height a property you take in so you could use for height or width like so.

7842590
pop-up	dialog
i am working on this site and i would like the login dialog pop-up box to pop-up whenever the user clicks on the log in link

google-chrome	firefox
this issue repros in both firefox google-chrome for me

7842732
put	get
i ve currently got my code working when i have already put in the data but i would like to get this data from a database

post test.php - returns programmer but get test.php returns null

7842833
pecl	pear
edit pecl also has one similar to the pear version bbcode parser

7842848
folder	directory
underlying reason unable to open destination file var folder 05 d7xltrms59j0n1bplx_nvwr0000gn t protocols.ipa payload protocolssmall.app info.plist no such file or directory

7842848
info.plist	ipa
looking inside the ipa info.plist is certainly in there

7842850
int	chars
when reading values from a stream byte by byte the stream.read returns the ascii code of the current chars so you first need to convert it to a regular chars and then parse it as a int

7842885
screens	tablet
this version is an adaptation for larger screens to better support tablet

7842930
folder	directory
i set tbbroot variable to the directory in my bash_proflie and i unzipped the tar file and navigated to the bin folder and run tbbvars.sh file

7842941
post	get
i am trying to get latest 10 post from discussion board in sharepoint by using spquery

7842979
listadapter	simplecursoradapter
then with a simplecursoradapter you connect the matrixcursor to the listadapter

7842991

is there a way to inherited properties from parent pom

7843025
inherited	properties
there is no way not to inherited properties from a parent pom

7843025
inherited	properties
inherited properties won t work for that

7843028
listview	gridview
you should probably run a new activity which pulls the contacts of the phone and let s the users select multiple items gridview or listview

7843040
rss	feed
i found this site which you authenticate and it will then give you a working rss feed

7843134
post	get
edit sorry i ve just realised that probably hasn t come from get post cookie and so get_magic_quotes_gpc is probably irrelevant

7843135
floating-point	integer
however in the popular programming languages like c c++ c# java pascal 120 and 120.0 represent different numeric constants the former being an integer constant and the latter being a floating-point constant

7843135
int	double
the value always has a type so an int value is something completely different from a double programmer s term for floating-point number value

7843135
int	double

7845374
put	get
if you put this all together you get this

as a hint what you want to be doing here is somehow discerning between which of the links has been clicked by say binding the click to each link rather than the dialog and then only showing one of the pop-up at a time depending on which link was clicked

getter	setter
these packages are almost entirely pojos mapped to hibernate objects and the difference seems to be in the coverage of getter and setter

7847617

your issue is because you were calling realloc with a pointer to memory that was not allocated with either malloc or realloc which is not allowed

7851468
multiplying	modulo
you may consider multiplying the results of the modulo comparison by -1 before returning it

7851488
button	checkbox
if you want to add support for multiple selections you can use checkbox instead of radio button

7851529

when i tried to use the same part of code for portrait in the landscape mode it gives me a weird result seems to be completely wrong

7851548
pull	push
any machine can host a git repository for people to push and pull from

7851579
multiplying	add
in order to calculate the result we do not need to know anything about the matrix other than how multiplying int int and add int int work

7851599

you can also implement the comparator if you wish but a more correct and formal approach is to use the icomparer from my point of view

you are logging urldata an nsdata object instead of results the nsstring

7851817
icmp	udp
i ve got an icmp ping working nicely but i ve run into a snag on the udp implementation i can construct send and receive the packet without problem the issue that i m seeing is that linux doesn t like the udp packets being sent back from the remote system and always sends an icmp destination unreachable packet even though my python script is able to receive and process the packet without any apparent problems

the image in chrome did not use width and height in this particular browser

if you upgrade to m2e plugin from versioning 0.xx to versioning 1.0 thats probably what caused the issues you are having this may be helpful it is intended for springsuource tool suite but i fixed an regular eclipse following the advices at the end on the section called uh ohâ my projects no longer build

7852016
post	get
i don t need to affect any other jeditables just get the currently active one to post back as if enter had been hit

7852059
post	get
you are using post but you re not posting any data - use get instead

7852059
post	get
the post get may fix the problem - get is much more lax with security than post

it s pretty hard to explain what happens but it just looks like it doesn t set the height and width the right way

7852341
strcpy	strncpy
for instance the safe variants of strcpy strncpy strlcpy strcpy_s simply truncate the string if it s too long which in this case would make you try to load the wrong font

7852341
memcpy	strcpy
at which point strcpy becomes safe because you know it s not too long although i prefer memcpy because it makes it obvious to future readers of the code that i ve thought about this

7852360
width	height
this works pretty well by using the prerotate method with the values width 2 and height 2 of the bitmap and 1 or -1 degree as rotation factor

7852365
post	get
i ve seen post on so on how to get the user identity but not the full profile

7852683
width	height
for everything to look correctly on the iphone we have to reverse the width and height of the backbuffer which seems very strange

7852685
curb	libcurl
you could always make one from rails but that seems messy or you could have an external process that does it with something like libcurl or the ruby curb library

7852691
width	height
if you give your link or tag the style display block and give it a specific width and height it should work just fine

7852703

is there a way to cascade non-inherited properties like text color to child elements in a webpage without explicitly telling child elements to inherited from parent node

7853118
inherited	properties
my current understand is that this is an issue of inherited and not all properties are automatically inherited form the parent container and for the style to be inherited one has to change the color to inherited by doing something like

7853123
hide	show
you can use .toggle instead of show hide then you could get rid of the if else construct

7853124
equals	gethashcode
however you can define an implementation that allows you to specify appropriate equals and gethashcode implementations external to the actual model class itself

a rather large problem that i frequently encounter is that when generating the csr to get our certificate the keystore sun formatted jks keystore does not output the .key or provide any facility for obtaining the .key

7854773
keystore	jks
so i always had ended up with a .pem .crt with no way of using it with apache2 which cannot read a jks keystore like tomcat can but instead requires a unpackaged .key + .pem .crt pair

7854773
keystore	jks
to get this working and if you already have your jks keystore file that you use for a tomcat application server follow the following steps

7854773
pem	pkcs#12
now you will want to convert it to pem format which is more widely used in applications such as apache and by openssl to do the pkcs#12 conversion

from what i can see on msdn dbcontext wraps an instance of objectcontext as a facade not exposing this specific event

width	height
while justin king s answer works if the width and height are known before hand it doesn t work if they re not set and the parent control dynamically lays the rectangle out

7862944
actualheight	actualwidth
unfortunately in silverlight you cannot use binding with converters on actualwidth and actualheight as they are calculated properties

7862944
actualheight	actualwidth
what this means is that when actualwidth and actualheight change a property changed event is not raised internally so the binding wouldn t propagate the changes to the source

7862979

pascal	delphi
since pascal and by extension delphi uses a nominative type system rather than a structural type system the two types are not the same - they have different names as shown in the error message

7863571
client-side	server-side
from what i ve read a jquery is a js library that makes coding in javascript that works across all browsers in one go easier b node.js is a basically a server-side javascript environment c javascript is the root programming language of the aforementioned ones and is client-side

7863594
for-loop	loops
changing the the for-loop to 2 loops instead of 3 stops the weird behaviour

7863646
client-side	server-side
one facilitates server-side javascript the other provides an abstraction library for client-side javascript

hash	salt
in trying to figure this out the problem i am having is that if i pass up a challenge word in an html form then hash the entered password with that word i can authenticate the password on the server but i can not separate the password from the challenge word so i can validate it against the salt password on the db

7863732
width	height
i have then placed a list within the first tab and set its width height to 100

7863738

7863831
getter	setter
ie8 doesn t understand getter backgroundposition but it understands setter

7864006
width	height
i m going to guess that the problem is that image_height and image_width are being populated with the original height and width before the resize

7864006
super	self
without looking at the imagefield code i m also going to guess that this will be fixed if you move the super resizedimagefield self .save to the bottom of your new method after you resize then image rather than the top

7864011
opera	firefox
and netscape and early versions of firefox and opera

7864038

pop-up	dialog
if you do that with a domain user as the service account there s a pop-up dialog telling you that you need extra ad administration

7864292

background-image	background-size
i m trying to mix background-image and background-size properties in a shorthanded background property

7864448
background-position	background-size
based on w3c documentation background-size should come after background-position property separated with an slash

7864631
boost	allocator
to optimize the app i used boost pool library but extended it so that my allocator actually contained a collection of boost pool objects each responsible for allocator one specific size from 16 bytes up to 1024 in steps of 4

7864631
boost	allocator
this provided almost free o 1 complexity allocator free of these objects but the catch is that a memory usage is always large and never goes down even if we don t have a single object allocated b boost pool never frees the memory it uses at least in the mode we are using it in so we only use this for objects which don t stick around very long

7864653
post	get
i also saw this blog post which explains how to add a custom display mode to a content type other than the default and teaser ones that come by default but i can t get it to work the way i want to either

7864701
fadein	hide
simply hide body and then fadein

7864736
getter	setter
i m writing a c++ wrapper around a c library and as such need to use getter setter methods to call the original c functions

7864745
getter	setter
it is not considered bad style to have getter and setter for some variables and not for others

7864745
getter	setter
but adding getter and setter and then making your variables private for your other variables will protect the users of your class from future changes to the internals of your class

7864769
feof	fread
using fread and feof but feof is breaking the loop early so what s the best technique to keep reading from the stream

7864802
getter	setter
if you define getter and setter for all of your variables and make the variables private future changes to your code would be much easier

7864802
getter	setter
this is one of the principles behind getter setter in oop

7864802
getter	setter
people wouldn t have direct access to your members and you don t have to worry about how they use it because you control how they will be used via getter and setter

7864802
getter	setter
if i were you i d definitely use getter and setter

7864813

macports	homebrew
you can use either macports or homebrew to install the icu package and have cabal refer to the custom header and library path

7865054
put	get
let s also say that for example all the function will do is get the bytes in the right order and since the system is little endian it will just swap them and put them into the float to return a value

7865065
getter	setter
you are assigning it to window.name which already exists and has getter setter functions that do weird stupid things

7865071
xmlhttprequest	jqxhr

7865847
mouseleave	mouseenter
moving and resizing setbounds fired mouseleave event of the parent and a mouseenter event of the single panel

7865862
int	chars
in the particular case of binary you can use another direct solution for each digit that is non-zero set the corresponding bit in an int type large enough in your case unsigned chars suffices and the value of the variable at the end of the loop will be the result of the conversion

7865882
hide	show
in that case you could show a dialog - loading and in the callback of the ajax you could hide the loading dialog

7865902

7867560
setinterval	settimeout
because you will be dealing with asynchronous callbacks settimeout calls at the end of a full cycle to start the process over again will be a cleaner way of handling the interval if you were to use setinterval and the server took longer than expected to return you could see the client start to race on itself

middle one is clip by uv draw from px1 and crop only width 34px height 33px right one very long rectangle draw from top to bottom from px0 to px480 width 34px height 1px sorry for virtual code but you know what i means

7867912
for-loop	loops
as of c# 5 it s likely that the foreach loops behaviour will be changed to avoid this being a problem - but the for-loop equivalent would still be an issue

7867944
width	height
explicitly specify a width and height style attribute for the div in which the chart will be drawn

7867970
vmware	virtualbox
i would suggest setting up a virtual machine using vmware virtualbox or something similar

7867977
rss	feed
reference sites with different formats in rss and atom feed

7868005
width	height
to move a view around i call setx sety and some other functions that set width and height and call either invalidate or requestlayout at the end of each of these functions

7868031
profiling	benchmarking	inline	inlining
you should inline a function if the compiler doesn t and profiling with a realistic data set shows you re spending a significant amount of time in the function the algorithm using said function is an efficient one and if inlining it shows a speed improvement in a benchmarking with said data set

7868062
google-chrome	firefox
i have gone through the horrors of flash caching files as well however it was firefox and google-chrome that gave me the most trouble

7868074
post	get
this will not only be cleaner but it will keep you from using get parameters in a post request

7868074
post	get
and if for some reason you must use a get query string with a post request then you d want something like this

7868101
onclick	onchange
even my onclick onchange functions are working without a problem dynamically added form elements it is just doesn t seem to work

7868106
put	get
also i made a try to put the same code in application didfinishlaunchingwithoptions but i get a warning at self.view addsubview themovie.view

7868108
put	get
when you print out the values later you re just printing this same copy of the data over and over again via different pointers to it -- so you get whatever you put in sh the last time you modified it rather than what was in it when you set the pointer

7868108
free	malloc
you ll need to remember to free them later along with everything else you ve malloc ed though

7868110
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i have a function which is use to check chinese input in a textarea then set the maximum length it works with ie opera google-chrome except firefox

7868116
webclient	httpwebrequest
i ve read that you cannot change the timeout property of webclient and people who have this problem should use httpwebrequest instead

7868176
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
the attribute works well in latest versions of firefox google-chrome and opera i ve just tested it

7868176

i have a qdockwidget object in my application which contains a qwidget object inside it

7868252
textarea	textbox
i am working on a asp.net page that has a button clicking on which adds a new section of markup for the user a section of markup is a combination of dropdown list textbox and textarea

7868258
prng	random
the rand needs to be either truly random or a cryptographically strong prng

7868291
required	placeholder
the only snag i can see is that since the asp.net model binder required the names of variables in arrays from your description it sounds like you will be accepting an array of sections to be explicitly qualified with an index you would need to replace a placeholder index in your master copy with a new dynamically generated value before adding the html fragment to the dom

7868306
webclient	httpwebrequest
instead you should use the webclient or httpwebrequest classes

7868330
google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari
uses css3 and works on recent 2011+ mozilla opera google-chrome safari and perhaps ie eventually

7868352
free	malloc
to get maximum speed you end up doing things like writing frond-ends for malloc where multiple objects you know you never have to free get allocated permanently within a malloced block

7868403
google-chrome	safari
i discovered that on facebook with the theater photo view google-chrome and safari the url looks static like this

the page sheet in landscape has a height of 100 and a width of â 70

7868435
width	height
the form sheet has a height of â 70 and a width of â 50

7868437

i mean sizeof chars is 1 and sizeof int is 4 on my machine

7868462
ceil	floor
or floor ceil and then truncate if you really want to round it up to the closest integer

7868500
width	height
then ppm image has a magic number p6 and then a # comment char and then height and width

7868505

7868536
for-loop	loops
i have a for-loop a very simple one in my program and i want it to loops through and do something for some minimum number of times

it should exit the for-loop but it does not execute the next print instruction nor does it execute loops again

7868540
int	chars
i mean sizeof chars is 1 and sizeof int is 4 on my machine

7868567
wordpress	joomla
this is a huge problem since most dristributions of oss-software for php has this included in their htaccess by default wordpress drupal joomla and many others and most guides in htaccess-rules always recommend followsymlinks since it s needed for mod_rewrite - it does work just as well with symlinksifownermatch

7868569
fflush	gets	puts	gets	puts	fflush
just puts out on the output-buffer and won t actually print out until the output-buffer gets fflush

7868590

but my directory structure is more organized its more like app lib mypackage folder

7868627
getter	setter
a bean property see propertydescriptor consists of a getter and or a setter method of the same type return type of the getter must match single param type of the setter otherwise they are not mapped to the same bean property i m guessing the first method in the class wins

7868627
getter	setter
so your integer getter string setter approach can t work as the string setter will not be detected as belonging to the integer property

7868646
post	get
you can use client-side javascript to make a form to do the post direct the output to an iframe and use cross-window iframe messaging to get the result

the chartpanel extends jpanel so can be added to a jframe japplet jdialog jwindow jpanel jdesktoppane ..

7868705
cpu	processors
all modern x86 processors are actually internally a risc design with a major chunk of silicon dedicated to taking the x86 instructions coming in and converting them into the cpu s own internal micro-ops which is basically a risc instruction set

7868706
xmldataprovider	listcollectionview
now i want to group the data in the datagrid but having looked at examples i still don t get how to do it with an xmldataprovider how where to create a listcollectionview off of the xmldataprovider

ninject	spring.net
it s also where you normally choose an ioc container autofac ninject spring.net castle unity and wire up all the specific implementations to the abstract types

7868784
qiodevice	qfile
i found the reason because the qfile object that i had created is in text mode so when qfile want to write file it changes n to r n the code below is the previous code that have problem in binary because of existence of qiodevice text

7868809
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
but am having a problem with thumbnail images not re-sizing in safari mobile or desktop that work in ie 8 and firefox 7.01 and opera 9.5

7868846
put	get
the semantics are supposed be different in that put like get is supposed to be idempotent -- meaning you can the same exact put request multiple times and the result will be as if you executed it only once

7868846
put	get
when you put a resource at a particular url what happens is that it should get saved at that url or something along those lines

7868846
post	put
as for modifying the properties of the stream you can do that with either put or post

7868846
post	put
basically only use put when the operation is idempotent - otherwise use post

7868846
post	get
note however that not all modern browsers support http verbs other than get or post

7868871
rss	feed
in my case the solution was a no-brainer since madam had already been installed in order to allow normal rss readers to securely access rss feed on the site

7868882

7869017
postgresql	mysql
developing on top of mysql or sqlite and then deploying on top of postgresql is just asking for trouble postgresql is thankfully a lot stricter than sqlite and mysql

7869017
postgresql	mysql
mysql will silently truncate your data and sqlite ignores length on string columns postgresql does neither of these things

7869058
mouseleave	mouseenter
you should use mouseenter and mouseleave

7869110
post	put
second simply put clientaccesspolicy.xml in root directory of your service implementation as explained in this blog post

7869136
emacs	aquamacs
this is happening the same way in emacs on a terminal and aquamacs

7869195

i m a long-time user of opera as a browser for general usage and due to various annoyances with firefox i decided to give dragonfly a look

7869282
post	get
you just change the get call in the example on that page with post

7869289
implements	extends
implements mouselistener on your class is one way to do it but if you just want to react to clicks it s easier to use an anonymous class extends mouseadapter

7869324
getter	setter
it can be extremely helpful and meaningful in case of getter and setter

7869353
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
on firefox opera and google-chrome it works good on ie is problem

7869398
richtextbox	tabcontrol
what can happen imho is that tabcontrol doesn t resize so its children richtextbox too do not change their client area size

7869422
ilist	icollection
edit corrected icollection instead of ilist error

7869422
ilist	icollection
if your collection only implements icollection and thus is not indexable then you should consider using a viewmodel exposing an ilist instead of the model you currently use to make the above valid

7869438
google-chrome	firefox
will allow you to effortlessly inspect the error object in decent browser like google-chrome or firefox with firebug

7869560
onresume	onpause
save in onpause load in onresume and you ll only lose data when the phone dies with your activity up front

7869586
hash	md5
another example a new cpu by intel can support md5 hash checking it doesnt mean you can t use md5 it means a library developed which uses md5 instructions will work faster because the cpu has a separate entity inside which will execute the operation efficiently

7869586
multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract	subtract	add
not for the good old add multiplying subtract or divide because your programming language is already using them in the most efficient way possible

7869752
hex	binary
the binary file is written out in big-endian format i can verify this by opening the file in a hex editor or viewing the network traffic using fiddler

7869752
google-chrome	firefox
note i ve tested using google-chrome 15 and firefox 8 and they both behave the same way

7869757
memcpy	memmove
now i can memcpy and memmove with this array and that works fine

7869758
serializable	deserialization
however if you use the typemodel instance to perform serializable deserialization you can have multiple differently configured models for the same types

7869777
disk	ram
a page fault is when virtual memory needs to get read back into ram from disk

7869778
multiplying	add
the service should add two integers together as well as multiplying two floats together and return the results

7869797
config	ini
as a side note the logging config in an ini file is not inheritable.

7869812
super	self
now since i ve not included super base self .delete in base.delete no actual sql is performed which is fine

cvs	svn
i wondered if there were still any reasons to prefer cvs over svn or git nowadays

put	get
have the gui thread put an okay value and have the worker do a blocking get to receive the okay signal

7869940
width	height
you have an error on your picslider.css sheet the width and height are not properly set

7869947
content-length	content-type
if the content-type is not set or set to the wrong format or content-length is not equal to the filesize make it so

7869976
verilog	vhdl
a as an alternative approach there are some c-like languages that compile down to vhdl or verilog

7869976
verilog	vhdl
you should start with the basics mess around with vhdl or verilog and light up some leds for instance implement a binary counter

7870028
folder	directory
this directory is meant for publicly viewable files folder

7870041
filesystems	hfs+	filesystems	ntfs	hfs+	ntfs
i m thinking in particular of filesystems like hfs+ osx and ntfs windows where you can access the same file as foo foo or foo even though the file case is preserved

7870044
equals	compareto
in order to compare the input string with the string q you need to use compareto or equals

7870054
multiplying	subtract
if the number is negative subtract 0.5 or multiplying and divide by negative ten

fadein	fadeout
what i m trying to do is simply fadeout all images inside containers replace #next1 s image to #active and after that fadein all images again

7870276
pop-up	dialog
it works just fine except the situation when the embedded web browser may be displaying a pop-up dialog window say during saving of contents

7870284
onclick	onmouseup
what i would probably do -- depending on the exact requirements -- is instead of setting an onclick handler set an onmouseup handler and instead of having the handler open the link have the handler set the link s href -- and not override the browser s default behavior

7870317
getter	setter
i tend to favor read-only properties for things which can regardless of object state be examined without risk of exception read-write properties for things which can regardless of object state be examined or set to any object value which is ever valid the set of valid values shouldn t depend upon the object state and getter setter methods for other things

7870345
accessor	properties
then in the accessor for that class properties do something like this

7870351
cifs	smb
switching from smb to cifs

7870377
gridview	sqldatasource
the gridview is set up to retrieve rows from a stored procedure via a sqldatasource

7870388
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	calloc	malloc
realloc only works if the pointer you pass it was one returned earlier from malloc calloc or realloc or is null in which case it works exactly like malloc

7870388
free	realloc
now you can call realloc on f.x but the cost is that you must also call free on f.x when the struct is no longer needed

7870465
textview	imageview
if you really don t want to use a webview and all the nice layout engine stuff it has you re going to have to figure out how to arrange individual textview and imageview yourself

atmel provides also an avr toolchain which is a collection of tools libraries used to create applications for avr microcontroller

for-loop	loops
i know there s something wrong with my code because the page never loads so there s somethign wrong with either the for-loop or foreach loops

7870561
post	get
the 1st is per-request application level parameters stuff you might set in one method and use again in another method and the 2nd are the parameters from the get query string or the post body of the request

7870563
postgresql	mysql
it s support oracle sql server db2 mysql ms-access teradata and postgresql

7870680

free	malloc
that is not safe because malloc doesn t call the constructor and free doesn t call the destructor

7870724
qgraphicsview	qgridlayout
the qgraphicsview will be resized by the qgridlayout after the widget is shown and can be also resized later when the window is itself resized

7870724
qgraphicsview	qgraphicspixmapitem
you probably don t want to change the pixmap size in the scene but rather adjust the view matrix so that your qgraphicspixmapitem fits perfectly inside the view with qgraphicsview fitinview

7870739
google-chrome	firefox
you should look into using a javascript console like firebug for firefox or the google-chrome developer tools comes stock ctrl+shift+j to open them

7870760
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
or define a serializable object that contains the tuple and just serialize that with objectoutputstream and deserialize that with objectinputstream

7870766
width	height
so i tried to calculate the height using the drawtextexw method however the result is the same as with drawtextw function where it extends the width of the rect to fit the largest line of text

7870826
put	get
to get this to happen when these exceptions occur if you can t do this in your own code you could try aop writing an agent if you are using java 6+ or you could in a pinch grab the source code of sqlexception change it to dump the stack in its constructor recompile and put this class back in the boot class path before everything else

7870827
versioning	upgrade
sorry i still cant get this to work previous versioning still show in the add remove programs section when i upgrade

7870837
pull	push
i push from cloud9ide to github then i pull on my local git and then i push to joyent

7870862
getter	setter
this is expected behavior doing the getter setter will actually change the option modal if it gets launched again not while it s open

7870894
g++	gcc
if it s gcc and it certainly looks like it is based on the absolutely identical error message you may need to make sure that you re calling g++ rather than gcc and or that your extension for the source file not header is a recognised one like .cpp a

7870894
g++	gcc
i m not entirely certain the rules that gcc follows but i ve always found it safer to use source files like blahblah.cpp and explicitly use g++

7870895
cvs	svn
only thing that i have come across in my limited use of cvs is that cvs treats branches and tags as different and also treats them as what they are and not as just folders that svn does

7870895
cvs	svn
many say that svn was build to be a better cvs and in almost all aspects svn is better and is widely used

7870928
ibatis	mybatis
there are popular frameworks out there such as mybatis former ibatis and hibernate to work with relational databases

cvs	rcs
finally cvs stores the history for each file in a single file with the same format used by rcs with a relatively straightforward format

7871646
cvs	svn
i can only guess at the reasons and i don t worry much about the occasional downvote but perhaps some readers think i m advocating cvs as a better system than svn or git

free	malloc	free	realloc	realloc	malloc
when realloc or free result in an invalid pointer error or segfault and you are sure that you are passing a valid pointer obtained from malloc then a good possibility is that you corrupted your memory you wrote to the area where malloc stores the book keeping of the memory blocks

7873135
memcpy	memmove
in your case this is a memcpy or memmove call

7873186

7873670
google-chrome	firefox
wrote a little piece of js which works well on google-chrome but not on firefox

7873678
for-loop	loops
you may not want to count the registries as that would require a query for each state as you are showing the state map you can start every state without link and then on a loops from a resultset using select distinct states or something that would list only states with registry in them then you would activate state by state in a for-loop

7873699

hide	show
my theory is that it doesn t work because the page loading itself show loading indicator and hide it after the page is loaded

7873877
children	parent
after investigation this happens if the collection is at least 1-many edited the code it seems that the more safe way of cascade deleting would be to remove the children objects first brothers then clear the collection of the parent sister and only after that delete it from the context as there is something inside ef itself that tries to connect the entities and removes stuff from something else

7873882
hide	show
in the js.erb file you can mix javascript and ruby and show hide replace divs as you please

7873918
int	boolean
the third option means having to keep track of both the int and the boolean that keeps track of the question whether it is used

7873923

7874021
getter	setter
just a note though your getter setter should reflect that they should look like this which might actually be the case in your code but not in your post

7874033
width	height
you can use simple css or fall back to javascript if you have problems in calculating width height or position

7874597
fflush	gets
try calling fflush on the output after the client is done to make sure the output gets written to the pipe if the child lives on while the parent reads its output

7874599
width	margin
also your page is not centered in ie - i suggest you wrap whole page in a fixed width wrapper with margin 0 auto to center whole page - so you don t keep repeating the width multiple times in your css for each layout element

7875028
width	height
the issue is i need a specific width of jlabel where height is not important because it will scroll the text until the y of jlabel is than -jlabel.height which means jlabel last line of text is at top of jpanel

7875028
width	height
so how can i calculate the height which can hold a sort of text based on a specific value of width

7875028

from filenotfound exception when creating spsite or getting reference to spwebapplication sharepoint 2010

7876427
bids	ssas
you will need to find out what version of ssrs you are running the different versions of business intelligence developer studio bids the ssas and ssrs version of visual studio create reports for specific versions of ssrs

7876427
versioning	upgrade
the reports can be upgrade but not downgraded or deployed to an older versioning of ssrs

7876432
button	checkbox
however when one of the button is clicked which indirectly call the click method on the checkbox the checkbox is not clicked until after the click code has been run

7876453
min	max
i decided to implement it calculation the max and min values of the last 1000 values and then calculate the error using this formula max-min min and compare it to epsilon

7876453
min	max
the first hare-brained idea was to use a list and append new values to it calculating the max and min values for the last 1000 values of it after each appending

7876453
min	max
but it didn t solve the problem of needing to go through all the last 1000 values on each iteration to calculate min and max

7876470
config	ini
i don t think there is security risk involve in saving any config in php.ini file since the location of the ini file is outside the public directory

7876492
width	margin
the reason is it is set to the width of the parent div which by default is 100 since you margin the red column left 200px it slides the display section over so you can see your left column

7876493
getter	setter
because the getter returns a boolean value but the setter expects a string jax-b just ignores this setter

7876531
jar	war
but joining the previews comments maybe you can create a jar with all your handlers and then in each war project define one abstract class with the chain that you want and inherit it in your services

7876540
onclick	onchange
use the onchange event instead of the onclick

7876540
onclick	onchange
you click on you mouse onclick event is fired checkbox gets ticked onchange event is fired

7876607
backgrounding	multitasking
some good backgrounding docs can be found here app states and multitasking

int	double
store preferences using being int double bool dictionary object...

7876634
queue	fifo
keep your 1000 items in an fifo queue

7876654
min	max
when adding or removing entries compare them to the current min and maxvalues - then you only need to rescan the deque for min max if the value you are removing is the current min or max

7876654
min	max
and when adding just compare the new value with the current min and max and update accordingly

7876654
min	max
this will optimize the scanning of your deque for min max values

7876682
width	height
so it stays display inline and elements with that style don t respond to width height changes

7876743
stdout	fflush
use fflush stdout

7876749
unsigned	short
2 i am not properly considering the variable type of packed and unpacked i.e for packed it is unsigned char and for unpacked it is short

7876779
stdout	fflush
use fflush file stream with stdout as the parameter

7876803
stdout	stderr
this way you can run any svn command you want just examine stdout and perhaps stderr to get the command s result

7876804
srp	ocp
have it exactly once. it stands to reason that the long if or the switch will indeed be a violation of srp and ocp

7876817
put	get
when you managed to get the user input put the its pointer in esi esi address to the string

7876870
powerpc	i386
you can also display the symbols for other architectures available in the mach-o format like powerpc or i386 or x86_64 or ppc64 if it was compiled that is

7876912
google-chrome	firefox
both firefox and google-chrome support browser extensions that can take advantage of platform specific apis to register event handlers for onbeforeload or onbeforerequest in the case of firefox and google-chrome respectively

7876912
google-chrome	firefox
the google-chrome apis are currently experimental hence these tools are likely to be better developed under firefox

7876912
google-chrome	firefox
the key point for these 2 firefox apps is that they intercept the web request before the browser gets its hands on it and operate on the other side of the http https encrpytion stage hence can see the decrypted response however as identified in the other post that they don t do the whole thing although the jsdeminifier was very useful i didn t find a firefox plugin to do exactly what i wanted but i can see from those previous plugins that it is possible with both firefox and google-chrome

7876912
ssl	https
basically the way it works is that when your browser makes a request to the remote https server the ssl proxy intercepts the request and from the ip address of the server generates a server certificate on the fly which it signs with its own root ca and sends back to the browser

7876970
getter	setter
it provides an interface to getter setter functions so that the changing of a model value there are many different flavors of change will call render on the corresponding view and the page will correctly reflect the underlying models

7877004
folder	directory
all i would like to do is check if a file with the analysis number in its filename is present in the directory specified then output completed if there is no existance of the analysis number in the folder then output queued

7877036
getter	setter
make a setter getter pair for a string field and an isa that is a calculate field this is the way i ve always done it because it just seems a bit more straightforward

7877064
post	get
i know its an old post but just in case someone else get here

7877076
width	height
otherwise you will need to apply a ratio such as width height

7877076
width	height
say your sprite was width 150 height 100

7877076
width	height
that means width is 1.5 times height

7877095
google-chrome	firefox
everything works like a charm in firefox google-chrome and ie7 but internet explorer 8 and 9 treat the consecutive nowrap spans as 1 big nowrap element it puts all the values on one line

7877112
aggregate-functions	sum
i tried to nest first and sum aggregate-functions but apparently it s not possible to have nested aggregation functions even when they have scopes defined

7877116
mouse	keyboard

thin	unicorn
i ve been using thin but this weekend i switched to unicorn to test it out

7877170
button	checkbox
one thing i do like about ie maybe the only thing is how one can tab between input boxes checkbox and action button

7877170
button	checkbox	firefox	safari
safari and firefox will tab between text input boxes but ignore checkbox and action button altogether

7877209
super	extends
one slight gotcha to be aware of is that the object system in openlayers uses a function called initialize as the constructor so in order to have coffeescript s super keyword work correctly when you extends openlayers classes you ll need to decorate them

7877228
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested it with google-chrome safari and ie8 and it works well just not firefox

7877242
hide	show
maybe the enter-notify-event and leave-notify-event connected to buttons may help you do the thing with for example a popup menu show and hide respectively

7877254
min	max
this one figures out the max and min from each table before combining the set - it may be more performant to do it this way

7877269
jobs	cron
itâ s a very easy and elegant solution for using ci controllers for cron jobs

7877280
hide	show
i have set of few thumbnails each time user click on thumbnail i show big picture on the middle and animate hide thumbnail delete if from the top and insert it on the end of thumbnail set

7877286
post	get
if you would use http get instead of http post you should prevent usage of data from the cache by setting in the http header

7877293
post	get
the example in the post compiles fine but i failed to get it to work with function templates

7877320

ubuntu	linux
however on ubuntu linux 10.4 and newer this does not work as expected

7877409
ironruby	ironpython
however i have to imagine the means syntax by which ironruby would import reference white is very different than how ironpython would do it

7877423
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to the latest versioning of the .net framework is not currently an option

7877434
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the problem exists on the third click on mobile safari many clicks later on safari and google-chrome and has not yet been encountered on an old version of firefox

7877442
post	get
the issue was because the control was not added to the page until the dayrender method - meaning you could not get a reference to it on a post back

7877448
post	get
if you would like to filter what is done via a post or what is done via a get use this

7877459
nullpointerexception	runtimeexception

7877482
folder	directory
i added it to my exclude file that is in the .git directory of the root of the project folder

7877497
stdout	stderr
a file descriptor that you make can take a value 0 1 2 if stdin stdout or stderr are closed

7877510
disk	ram
if you re opening and reading the file from disk manually and then again write it blockwise to the sink end of your web framework then you re very wasteful because the data have to travel through the ram possibly including buffering

7877589
instances	transient
b doesn t exist in test db so i get an error object references an unsaved transient instances

7877618
atomikos	bitronix
otherwise perhaps the easiest way to make your sessionfactories participate in a single transaction is to use jtatransactionmanager with some standalone jta implementation atomikos bitronix jotm

7877620
hide	show
then in your onclicklistener you can show hide whatever it is you want using the setvisibility method

7877642

put	get
administrator of the site must approve every order manually create things propertly with ups and then just get the tracking number and put it in our system

7877830
hide	show
and this will show and hide the element as you intended

7877869
post	get
you can use this access_token as a key to get and post facebook information

7877893
hide	show
i created a simple navigation bar that show and hide buttons using jquery .show and hide

7877893
firefox	safari	hide	show
it works properly when viewing in firefox but when viewing in safari it adds extra spaces into the navigation bar every time you hide show the buttons

7877905
client-side	server-side
moreover you re using the platform default encoding at server-side and client-side to read and write the messages

7877935
versioning	upgrade
fyi unfortunately you can t or at least i couldn t revert to the previous sdk manager and tools versioning so easily it insisted on getting itself upgrade before downloading the sdks i had to use an old copy of the folder i had lying around

there seems to be a repainting bug in webkit the rendering engine used by safari and google-chrome which causes display table-cell elements to be repainted incorrectly

7878086
move	drag
what i would like to do is to create somehow a bigger canvas and paint the line bigger and just show a part of the canvas to the user and the he drag the chart it will move the canvas

7878088
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
turns out that instantiating crossdomainresourceconfig does enable the crossdomain.xml and clientaccesspolicy.xml files

7878088
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
the thing is that they are available at the url myservice crossdomain.xml and myservice clientaccesspolicy.xml

7878099
wxpython	pyglet
you can use the popular pyglet game library along with wxpython the cross platform gui library

7878105

i also had a group of students create 3d fractals as their project using python and chaco for interactivity but using matplotlib instead is pretty straightforward

7878110
keydown	keyup
since it is a readonly input you are not able to type in it therefore change keyup keydown and keypress will not work with regards to this input

7878126
width	height
add width and height if div has no content

7878174
versioning	upgrade
the compatibility level was pretty much created for lazy people like me or rather to reduce the friction on upgrade to help sell more units of newer versioning and reduce the necessary support window on older versioning of sql servers - good goals in their own right

7878204
google-chrome	firefox
if you visit the following url and hover over the main navigation at the top right above the header image in google-chrome firefox and ie8 the sub nav that displays once you hover over a nav element for example hover over meetings appears to line up correctly with the parent li

7878204

7878367
google-chrome	firefox
its works ok in firefox and google-chrome

7878403
floating-point	fractions
some values can be exactly represented as binary fractions and output formatting routines will often display the shortest number that is closer to the actual value than to any other floating-point number which masks some of the rounding errors

7878465
128bit	64bit
language platform supports 128bit-sized numbers - array of 64bit numbers + 128bit variable to handle overflow

adding to what ryan said above the rails asset pipeline guide describes how to setup apache or nginx to serve the static assets for you

7878705
apache	nginx	thin	unicorn
you really should setup nginx or apache to serve static assets as they re much better optimized for this task than mongrel thin unicorn

7878744
onfocus	onblur
just in case you d like to do the same thing when the gets loses the focus by tab for instance use the onfocus and onblur event handlers

7878833
draggable	droppable
although i don t think i implemented it properly since i just added it on to the code which uses the draggable droppable from jquery.ui

7878833
draggable	droppable
here s the draggable droppable code

7878833
draggable	droppable
in the body of the html i am using divs to call out the draggable and droppable

jmock	guice
if i was not able to use a framework like guice i would probably do it something like this here using jmock and hamcrest

7878975
client-side	server-side
that is when a change is made client-side the changes are stored into the viewstate model for the control -- and then during next postback the viewstate is parsed the changes re-run and applied to the control server-side

7879010
google-chrome	firefox
it works just fine in google-chrome but not in firefox

7879054
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome work fine

7879228
folder	directory
i downloaded curl for windows and merged all 3 folder to their existing counterparts in the mingw directory include lib and bin

7879312
addition	multiplication
note that addition and multiplication are very fast in crt representation which could be an advantage if you can deal with the overflow issue

7879340
cassini	iis
remember cassini the toy web server that ships with vs runs under the developer s credentials so permissions to the local file system are very different compared to running your website on iis directly

7879341
width	height
it needs to span the full size which is outside the width not height of the div

7879375
g++	gcc
likewise the same result for g++ instead of gcc

i don t know what the structure of your rss feed is but for any that i ve used the dataprovider requires the following path to the arraycollection of items

7879468
vsto	add-in
iâ ve migrated it to c# it takes the data from a remote java server via wsdl but i found that most functions were being called 50+ times and it ran far far slower than the original add-in itâ s an automation add-in using extensibility.idtextensibility2 â so no vsto tricks available here

7879468
vsto	add-in
this is not an vsto add-in itâ s implemented using extensibility.idtextensibility2

7879468
vsto	add-in
try the edit intercept version as a vsto add-in this should give me the key bindings

7879471

7879633
portrait	landscape
however videos that were shot with the iphone held upside-down in landscape or portrait are inverted on the web server

7879708
children	parent
opacity is inherited from the parent so regardless of what you set for the children they will always take on the opacity of the parent

7879716
memcached	apc
you could cache this using apc memcached or the like if you do not want to query the database for this everytime you render a page

7879736
hash	salt
i think generally speaking storing the username|password hash is pretty safe assuming you re hashing them reasonably using a salt using an iv etc

7879758
qslider	qdial
for example a mix of qdial and qslider ie

7879758
qslider	qdial
if so you will need to subclass either qslider or qabstractslider or qdial and do the painting in your own paintevent

7879758
qslider	qdial
the qt demos and examples or the qslider qdial source code itself may serve as examples on how to overload a paintevent

7879784
gmail	hotmail
hotmail is reading subject but not the body and gmail reads it well

7879813

7879883
google-chrome	firefox
get google-chrome or firefox use the developer tools i personally prefer google-chrome and play around with the css of that element - you d want a margin-top rule similar to this

7879885
post	get
note that i assume that unlike get the post request doesn t prepopulate the before validation has succeeded

7879887
many-to-many	one-to-many
typically you d have an intermediate table between building and roofings and building and exteriors if you want the reference to go both ways or have one-to-many or many-to-many relationships not sure if that applies in your case

i m using a restful style with get put delete post requirement

7880024
boost	stl
languages and avoid things like stl and boost

7880024
boost	stl
the moment you add the baggage of stl and boost you are slower than

7880024
boost	stl
thus if you are not careful with your stl and boost code you will

7880024
boost	stl
edit the quote is about stl and boost thus i added the stl tag

7880027
google-chrome	firefox
well i ve created this and checked it in google-chrome and firefox web developer tool cookies view cookie information and they had fiddle.jshell.net for both cookies

7880066
google-chrome	firefox
there are a number of options for headless html+javascript thanks primarily to google s new toy node.js used in the google-chrome browser depending on the language that you want to use but unfortunately none that i know of are firefox based -- there was crowbar but it appears un-updated since 2008

7880072
packets	multicast
i am unable to send a udp multicast broadcast packets from a laptop wired to a wifi router to an android phone connected to the same router wirelessly

7880109
put	get
instead you need to store the data in a container and make sure it implements the according interface that is the get put and methods as the documentation on property maps explains

7880136
debian	linux
this way i still can have an up-to-date fedora linux for my desktop and develop on a debian with php 5.2 if i need to and i need to

7880208
getter	setter
getter and no setter

7880259
voip	rtp
it turns out the voip stack which is otherwise an excellent stack either has a bug or i do not understand the way it packages and transmits the rtp packets

7880362
chown	chmod
so all of the subsequent calls to exec for chown chmod mv all run with the permissions of the current app process - and hence fail

7880431
vbscript	jscript
first find api you need and find a way to write jscript or vbscript that does what you need

7880539
pop-up	dialog
the correct behavior is just show again the pop-up with messages but the dialog is rendered twice one with the messages and one without the messages

7880555
getter	setter
i m worried that i m reverting to an object-oriented mindset prematurely where i have a bunch of objects with getter and setter

7880571
implements	modifiers	implements	extends

if you can guarantee you only have one couchdb instance or that everyone modifying a particular document connects to the same couchdb instance then you could use the conflict detection system to create a sort of atomicity using methods described above but if you later scale up to a cluster or use a hosted service like cloudant it will break down and you ll have to redo that part of the system

personally i would use the jquery library tag the input element or some div surrounding the markup that you wish to dynamically show and hide with an id tag and use code like

7894895
hide	show
to hide and show your markup

7894896
inherited	subclassing
even though there is a private static final long serialversionuid in arraylist since it s static its not inherited by your anonymous subclassing

converting nsstring like so will force a trailing 0 byte which means nsjsonserialization jsonobjectwithdata and others will fail unless you remove it

7894957
udp	tcp
i don t really wish to use a bloated tcp or even udp just something extremely basic and low latency

7895172
pull	push
so you should be able to pull push them anytime

7895182
touchesbegan	touchesended
this is because uitableview as a subclass of uiscrollview does all sorts of under-the-hood weirdness with the responder chain your code is also kind of odd where you call both touchesbegan and touchesended from the overlying view s touchesbegan method but this isn t why you can t scroll the table

7895199
google-chrome	firefox
this gives 59 in firefox and 186 in google-chrome

7895254
put	get
it will match the proper call based on method type like get put for all empty uritemplates

also unless you were required to write asciitofloat for your homework assignment you should use atof or strtod both declared in stdlib.h from the standard c library

7895440
width	height
the downside is that the whole image is going to be decoded so if you don t actually need the image but only the width and height you might actually want to look in the byte array and decode the file format

7895450
int	chars
the reason this works in this case is because a chars is really an int

7895452

getter	setter
with their getter and setter

7895772
pull	push
i have tried the hg-git plugin and have gotten to the point where i can commit in git and push those changes to a remote mercurial repo however the issue i am running into is that no matter what tutorial i have found i can t seem to pull new changes from mercurial back into git which makes the entire thing useless at this point

7895785
ubuntu	linux
i need to make this cross-platform between linux or at least ubuntu and windows so any common approaches between the two platforms would make my life much easier

7895814
button	checkbox
i ve found that an enterprising user might press backspace on a checkbox or a radio button in a vain attempt to clear it and instead they would navigate backwards and lose all of their data

7895830
int	double
the extract function template also works with double long int float and so on

7895881
google-chrome	firefox
the code i wrote to do it works in google-chrome and ie but fails in firefox on both mac and windows

7895888
hex	binary
it says the type is short so through it i suppose you could represent the number zero in binary as 0000000000000000 or in hex as 0x0000 since as far as i know one hex digit represents four binary digits

7895888
hex	binary
because 8 in hex should correspond to 1000 in binary

7895920
implements	extends
if you want to check if the object is an instance of a certain class but not if it extends or implements it maybe comparing the classes with would be faster

7895931
screens	mdpi
google seems to support this as being true in their section on testing for multiple screens sizes when they list this resolution and mdpi as being large

7895949
hide	show
you could break it into two lines as you have found you could hide the assignment inside a bracketed dereference as mob show or you could simply throw away the first value

7895954
16-bit	64bit
2 - most significant bit is the 15th as the value is signed if you cast it to 32-bit int 16-bit 1000 0000 value would become 1111 1111 1000 0000 in 64bit world the conversion would be 1000 0000 - 1111 1111 1111 1111 - 1111 1111 1000 0000

7895961
udp	tcp
don t reinvent the wheel and choose between udp and tcp until you re completely sure you need something more sophisticated but not simpler

7895961
udp	tcp
to dispatch your data to right application you need transport protocol udp tcp and others

7896012
folder	directory
when i look at the outputs for the primary output of my application it gets the app.config from the project directory instead of the corresponding obj folder like everything else...a big oversight in my opinion by msft

7896041
for-loop	loops
this is because a for-loop can always be rewritten as a while loops

7896047

for-loop	loops
and are different from a for-loop in that for each item it loops through the function that is ran on it is in it s own scope

7896190
put	get
if i put the js callback routine actually on the page then i get full info

7896213
int	double
with it is nub on and comparing big int is slower than comparing double

7896267
int	double
does javascript abstract away the details of int and double in its number type or does javascript only have double precision number types

7896274
daemons	systemd
if i have my daemons detect the current user with the systemd configuration framework and pass it to nstask with setenvironment launchctl bugs out on me

7896292

in my debug aspx page i created a gridview with the sqldatasource set to the same connection string and query

7896316
google-chrome	firefox
use a modern browser firefox google-chrome etc

7896329
post	get
i found the post get the element with the highest occurrence in an array that solves the problem in javascript but i haven t been able to port it

7896340
for-loop	arrays
yet when i go to access the values in the arrays by double for-loop iteration i get the incorrect values

7896341
istream	getline
delimiter must be a single character for istream getline

7896347

7896391
google-chrome	firefox
my site is showing logo in google-chrome but its not visible on firefox

after the pdf viewer has launched adb shell dumpsys activity shows the stack is

7896415
ocx	msflexgrid
i need to maintain an old vbp vb6 project that uses the purchased videosoft vsflexgridpro7 ocx not the free msflexgrid included in vb6pro

7896475
viewmodel	caliburn.micro
there are better ways with a mvvm framework like caliburn.micro or mvvm-lite but this at least gets you started on how to think about these kinds of operations in your viewmodel

7896486
width	height
that is have properties on your view model for top left width and height all of which are updated through behaviors dragbehavior and a sizeobserver behavior

7896515
vim	emacs
the elisp files and .vimrc files ship along with chapel tar.gz file so after extracting the tar.gz file in a folder chapel- version highlight vim or chapel- version highlight emacs there the vimrc or elisp files are present and in the readme instructions are also given how to add to init files .emacs or .vim

in mysql boolean is an alias for tinyint 1

7896534
hash	md5
where request is a primary key and represents an md5 hash of a request uri

7896592
disk	ram
forcing the system to use only ram with no possibility of writing to disk is tricky and ignores the fact that someone with root access can also read data with difficulty directly from the ram of the webserver process before it gets encrypyed

7896619
udp	tcp
it makes more sense to compare tcp vs udp vs other transport layer protocols -- and http vs ftp vs other application layer protocols

7896662
jqxhr	deferred
in the case where the script already exists the jqxhr var will not be a deferred so the then is executed immediately

7896667

so you have an ejb deployed in an app server glassfish jboss etc and you want clients from a desktop j2se and web tomcat app to use this remote of course ejb

7896684
strcpy	malloc
if you want to copy the contents of the string use malloc and strcpy to create a new string

7896689

use the debugger to inspect at what point of execution is your program set breakpoints inspect state of your program perhaps one of loop counters is unsigned integer and overflows etc.

7896710
post	get
could i replace the form s action to a different file which ll redirect the post data to the original form action page but will also receive the get data

7896719
hide	show
in my view a show hide button and a map

7896731
pci	ioremap
in case it is io memory pci memory you should have a closer look at ioremap

7896742
portrait	landscape
i ll also have to do a similar conversion to videos shot in portrait to rotate them from landscape so that they are orientated correctly on the server

7896773
super	abstract
i have looked at some other similar questions and seen things about the usage of final variables when calling the super constructor or problems with the abstract nature of the parent class but i could not find a definitive answer to why this particular situation throws an instantiationexception

7896788
width	height
i had an html body tag with height and width set to 100 and the body was full of various tags in different locations

7896810
src	attr
you can preload images just by using attr src source of image

7896827
google-chrome	firefox
this works in latest google-chrome and firefox and seems cleaner than bind to me

7896841
invokelater	invokeandwait
however if you are in a timer or an action triggered by some other external event your main thread or any other thread you ve created then yes you have to use invokelater or invokeandwait

7896860
disk	ram
use to make the ram disk

7896860
disk	ram
then i wrote these scripts to move directories to and from the ram disk

7896860
disk	ram
backup is made in a tar file before moving into the ram disk

7896862
put	get
i have read up on index and looked at other example but i can t get it to work here it seemed to throw a wobbly when i put the num variable in

7896937
g++	gcc
but when trying to compile that using gcc actually g++ that lead to funny errors

7896947
put	get
if you use a listbox so that the user can select a row and then put your commands in the vm that contains the collection you get a cleaner implementation

7896967
google-chrome	firefox
and it actually works well in google-chrome but for some reason it doesn t work on firefox

7896967
google-chrome	firefox
and again it does work on google-chrome but i don t get anything in firefox

7896969
uiview	subviews
i added a uibutton to uiview as a subviews as shown in my code below

7896983
rss	feed
i am using simplepie rss to aggregate 4 feed and they are being sorted by the date descending and in the code it is set to echo out the pubdate but it is not showing it

7897005
firefox	safari
i m seeing this issue in internet explorer 8 but not in safari or firefox

post	get
sometimes even though i am writing a perfectly normal russian characters in when i view the resulting rendered blog post page i get some symbols substituted with ï ½ï ½ characters

7897040
hide	show
what i really need is the ability to have regions with a show hide ability - click the plus sign or a header to toggle

7897044
vsto	add-in
vsto add-in comaddins and requestcomaddinautomationservice

7897055
move	drag
so either way it neglects to just move it as one might notice the option i change is the helper which is the main factor in all this as well but if the helper is a clone it should just use a clone of itself to be dragged and if it s set to original it should take the module entirely out of the spot it was in and drag the module itself but i don t see why it would be causing these weird problems the current setting on the site is clone but you ll of course have to make an account to be able to test it which if you wish you can delete immediately afterwords and once you re on the site you need to call the javascript function modularmode which if you don t know how can easily be done by entering javascript modularmode

7897078
google-chrome	firefox
but on firefox and google-chrome when i goto the canvas page it redirects away from facebook and to my site

7897089
mouseover	mouseout
i am attempting to attach an event handler to the mouseover mouseout events for each of the subtemplate elements that are generated

7897104
draggable	droppable
jquery makes writing javascript considerably less tedious and jquery ui allows you to add interactions to dom objects such as draggable droppable resizable selectable sortable which will make creating the widgets much easier

7897208
width	height
i am simply growing the width height on hover

7897215
post	get
you cannot 100 prevent this if the user wants to do it however to avoid this happening by accident look into post redirect get

7897216
width	height
you can do the same thing to identify candidate rectangles by translating from the x y space of the image to the solution space of possible rectangles theta d width height rotation

7897230
disk	ram
data written to it is preserved across boots and power downs unless it s a ram disk and even then it depends

7897263
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome seem to be ignoring the after element completely

7897263
google-chrome	safari
it works in safari google-chrome if i have both .readmore and it s after pseudo- set to block but then the .readmore is on its own line obviously and i d really like it to be inline

7897263
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
if i set it to inline or inline-block it stops working in safari google-chrome but firefox doesn t seem to care.

7897267
hide	show
here is a way of doing it...it hide the show more link for the current div collapses all other currently opened divs and brings back there show more links

7897275
crossover	mutation
since you will be using crossover and mutation on a sample of the population you don t have to worry too much about the efficiency of the crossover operator

7897291
datamapper	activerecord
i just went into #datamapper and solnic helped me understand this there is no need to use the mysql2 gem with datamapper because do-mysql the dataobject driver dm-mysql-adapter depends on to access mysql repositories doesn t have problems with character-encodings which is the reason i and most people i would assume use the mysql2 driver in activerecord projects

7897293
int	boolean
primitive types int floats boolean -- and in particular the fact that primitive types aren t part of the object system

7897310
uiview	subviews
uiview currentview _contentview subviews lastobject

7897316
apache	nginx
so if your web server apache nginx iis tries to service those 100 concurrent requests with 100 php threads there would be 100 connections to redis

7897350
getter	setter
i have some common variables that each need to have but i don t want to make getter and setter in each class seems like it goes against dry anyway

7897379
width	height
unless there is code missing from your example in your tiletocache you instantiate and use tilerect without defining a width and height

7897403
implements	extends
it seems weird that you would want to extends piece and implements piecebase.

7897403
getter	setter
if you used an interface all your classes that implement it will still have to define their own getter setter

7897403
getter	setter
that way they all use the same getter setter ..

7897422
getter	setter
i suggest simply defining the abstract class piece with the required common getter and setter and then have your concrete classes extend piece

7897429
clang	llvm
i m using llvm 3.0 and clang on xcode 4.2

7897462
consistency	acid
the c in acid consistency

7897463
cpu	processors
in many cpu s dsp s digital signal processors and machine controllers such as that controlling a washing machine the stack is located on the chip itself

7897471
hash	md5
cryptographic digests like md5 sha-1 and even sha-512 are a lot better because you only ever store and compare the hash passwords but they are still bad because they were designed to hash data very quickly for the purposes of data integrity and signing

7897483
hide	show
i need to add information below the div that toggles show hide on click

7897496
folder	directory
instead set the mvc directory as its own app starting point and then run the mvc from that folder so that it and the existing webforms app are completely ignorant of each other

7897496
post	get
so now instead of blog blog index or blog blog post 1 i get a proper clean url without the duplicate blog in the url - blog post 1

7897508
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
animating font sizes in firefox has a nice smooth effect while in safari and google-chrome but less so it is jumpy

7897524
post	get
here are the post and get raw headers captured by the browser

7897524
post	get
in this get its response the data i need is located but with any combination of parameters cookies or everything i tried i couldn t get it to think that i made a post and now want that data

7897524
post	get
here is the version of my code without jsoup parser but i can t get it to work either although when i check those cookies they are ok same for post and get but without success

7897544
punctuation	words
this matches 0-5 words built using alphanumeric chars or one of . - finetune this followed by the words you re looking for with or without punctuation at the end followed by 0-5 words

7897569

also note that the standard library functions strlen strcpy strncpy strcat printf strdup etc. are slightly incompatible with each other regarding the terminating null

7897716
printf	strncpy
also strncpy does not guarantee null termination while printf does

7897720
onclicklistener	onitemclicklistener
when you set the onitemclicklistener the event onitemclicked will only be called if the child of the listview does not have the onclicklistener set

7897720
onclicklistener	onitemclicklistener
since the textview s onclicklistener is set the onitemclicklistener will not be called

7897737
put	get
i know that when i put getheadphones in google i get get headphones but not sure how they do that and how they know that it is not get head phones

7897744
postgresql	mysql

however when in firefox i need a margin-top of 20px in safari i need like 15px else it s too far down

7898066
firefox	safari
i saw that the discrepancy was because in safari the text element is taller than in firefox and includes a slight amount of whitespace on top that doesn t show up in firefox in firefox the top of the text element is exactly when the text starts

7898572
post	get
whether synchronously via a form action or asynchronously via ajax any type of communication will fall under the category of either a post or get

7898582
post	get
i can t see any way of doing the same as that post without using the ids i was thinking you could route via a vf page and build up the url in the controller but it doesn t seem as though you can get the ids of fields just their type etc

7898589
post	put
once you have set the correct scopes you should be able to do post put requests just fine

7898624
client-side	server-side
behind your question there is apparently confusing between server-side actions and client-side actions

i then defined numfeatures and numsymbols and allocate memory for both symbols and levelnums then fill levelnums inside a for-loop with value of the inner loops index just to verify it is working as expected

7899117
typedef	struct
i can only send in a continuous block of memory explicitly and the typedef struct s are only there for conveying defining the memory struture of the data

7899124

i recommend that you set up a linux vm vmware virtualbox etc with a simple quick to reboot text-based distribution if you want to hack around with the kernel

7899308
mouseleave	mouseenter
your code doesn t specify an event handler when it rebinds the mouseenter and mouseleave events

7899315
int	double
so whatever is where t is a type like int double or even one of your classes becomes and the syntax is exactly the same hereafter.

7899325

7899824
hash	md5
when we upgraded to rails 3.1.1 asset precompilation produced files both with and without the md5 hash in the name

7899824
hash	md5
the precompiled and checked in assets without the md5 hash were being served from public assets as static files which prevented us from seeing any changes we were making in app assets

7899829
pull	push
when i pull or push to private repo i collaborate i have to write login and password

7899889
client-side	server-side
i would think this is a common problem but unfortunately i haven t found any good existing solutions for this and it seems like you ll need to implement all of this yourself both client-side and server-side

7899913
maven	m2e
for eclipse try m2e for idea the maven plugin should do this as well

7899927
profiler	visualvm

if i remove the height attribute the searchdiv gets collapsed within the search box and this is in firefox google-chrome

7900064
int	boolean	int	double	int	chars
it is integer.valueof int similarly for boolean byte chars long float and double

7900065
dbcontext	objectcontext
system.data.entity.dll version 4.2.0.0 june ctp 2011 contains everything from efv4.0 and efv4.1 both objectcontext api and dbcontext api + new features but it is probably the only version for a long time which will combine these two apis in the same assembly

7900073
subtraction	addition
i feel like there should be some way to union two resultsets without a lot of extra work because set addition and subtraction are such a core part of sql

7900100
pop-up	dialog
here s the code that shows up the pop-up dialog to get started

7900129
for-loop	arrays
you can iterate over the arrays with a for-loop over splitted.length querying your list with

7900139
google-chrome	firefox
then will works in google-chrome firefox and ie9 but still not in safari.

7900140
versioning	upgrade
if i remember correctly they merged with another company apex and changed name to componentone so you may be eligible for an upgrade versioning instead of a full new license

7900157
accessor	properties
aaa and bbb are properties each is a pair of accessor methods which are synthesized and use the instance variables _aaa and _bbb respectively

7900173
vpn	lan
my suggestion would be to see if they have vpn access to their lan and get them to set you up an account on the domain

7900178
flac	ogg
and i want those flac files to be converted to ogg in the same directory basically i want to automate

7900180
jquery	jqmodal
or the jquery plugin jqmodal

7900191
opera	google-chrome
will work as intended in latest google-chrome for example - won t work in latest opera

7900205
folder	directory
if you are pointing to a folder outside your root path you could get into trouble when someone decides to move the physical location of your app and use a virtual directory for it

7900230
post	get
i set post type as post but data always get send using get method

7900262
setinterval	settimeout
so i know that there are differences between settimeout and setinterval but consider these two code examples

7900268
int	double
but i do not want to loose the jaxb marshallers for all the others objects int double etc .

7900293
setinterval	settimeout
another difference is that with the settimeout you ll get a new handle every time whereas with setinterval you get one handle

7900293
setinterval	settimeout
another difference with your examples as given is that in the settimeout example you re firing up a javascript parser compiler every time whereas with setinterval you re only firing up the parser compiler once

7900293
setinterval	settimeout
side note it s not best practice to pass strings into either settimeout or setinterval

7900318
children	parent
and children can be removed from the canvas to another parent

7900318
children	parent
so that i apply the transformation delta on all children to place them in the new parent directly without being inside the transformed canvas

7900320
width	height
the issue with just fixing width and height is the listbox keeps the same position even if the user resizes the window

7900320
width	height
this is why i created this tiny behavior which fixes width and height but listens to the parent element s sizechanged event to let the listbox resize itself when the container s size changes

7900320
width	height
when the parent element is resized i restore width and height to double.nan so the control can resize itself and i queue the bit of code which fixes the size properties to actual values in the dispatcher for later execution

7900335
unsigned	short
mapping corresponds to an implicit conversion unsigned short to

7900335
unsigned	short
that the unsigned short

7900395
int	double
i have array of double and array of int

7900465

i have a problem with my html button and checkbox

7900492
button	checkbox
whenever i resize page especially making it very small my button and checkbox goes at the bottom

7900492
button	checkbox
i want the button and checkbox to stay on the same line with the textbox

7900517
nsmutablestring	nsstring
as well that optimization makes physically subclassing concrete immutable types nsstring difficult for mutable variants nsmutablestring in some cases

7900530
hash	salt
hash the password with a salt

7900622
hash	salt
the salt for hashing the password should needs to be unique and can be stored in the database in fact it can be part of the hash itself

7900633
folder	directory
i wanna create a batch file that could do something to all folder in the current directory

7900670
tabs	tabpanel
i have created a formpanel with a tabpanel with several tabs

7900670
background-color	transparency
bodystyle background-color transparency

7900684
viewdidload	viewwillappear
loadview viewdidload and viewwillappear not being called in my uiviewcontroller

7900684
viewdidload	viewwillappear
and obviously since loadview didn t get called viewdidload viewwillappear won t get called either as there was no view that got loaded am not using any nib..creating the view programmatically

7900728
move	drag
the correct solution to this problem is probably to implement a kind of handle on top of the table or something that users could grab drag drop to securely move the whole table at once

7900780
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
the images display fine when viewed in google-chrome firefox safari and opera

7900780
width	height
however when the same page is viewed in internet explorer 7 8 and 9 sometimes well 50 of the time when the page is first loaded the image appears at the correct width but the height is really really small

7900832
put	get
if i try to put in a template for the root node i get an error telling me that i can t have 2 higher level elements or some such

7900846
uninstall	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
a major upgrade will automatically uninstall the old versioning before installing the current one

7900849
mktime	strtotime
always use date functions like strtotime or mktime to increment the date

7900853
free	malloc
there if a big array can t be allocated contiguously even if there s enough free memory you will get either the std bad_alloc exception in c++ or null from malloc -like functions in c c++ or nonthrowing operator new in c++

7900853
disk	ram
the ram is effectively extended by the free disk space at the expense of lower performance because the os has to exchange data between the ram and disk when there s memory pressure

7900860
move	drag
i d like to achieve the exact opposite if the viewpager inside a list row starts reacting to a horizontal drag then it should trap that action and this drag should stop affecting the listview no matter how the user move his her finger vertically

7900868
width	height
document.ready potentially occurs before all of the images have been loaded on a page so the reported height and width can be 0 or as in your case 100

7900886
maven	pom.xml
i got failed to build elasticsearch by maven i wrote pom.xml

7900908
hash	salt
password only the hash of a password should be stored together with a user specific salt

7900908
rainbowtable	salt
the salt can be stored plaintext the reason for the salt is that an attacker cannot use one single rainbowtable for all users building a rainbowtable is expensive

7900937
spweb	splist
since both spweb and splist inherit from spsecurableobject all you have to do is load the splist object for that list you want to alter the permissions

7900951
getter	setter
i tried making a class to represent an answer ischecked note etc with getter and setter

7900955
int	double
the table has unknown dimensions and each column has values of one unknown type string double or int

7900975
int	boolean
however if the int is being used to represent a boolean type which c does not have a builtin type for then this form is ok

7900982
hide	show
i would like if i click red .button then green .show show me over the red button and if i click outside green .show then this hide

7901124
google-chrome	firefox
so the code beneath works perfect in google-chrome but not in firefox and op

7901129
width	height
the consequence of this is that in viewdidappear the width and height of the view are still incorrect width 768 height 1024

7901129
width	height
only viewdidappear will be triggered and the width 768 the height 1024 - as expected

7901158
min	max
other functions from list util like max min sum also may be useful for you

7901237
int	double
if i understand correctly you are trying to do a summation reduction of the double precision array a by the int keys held in b

7901256
int	double
c++ convert vector int to vector double

7901257
firefox	safari
script with the developer tools in safari or firefox but when i download the html page all tags after script

7901282
width	margin
you have the width of the content which corresponds to the width you set then the padding then the border the box then the margin

7901302
viewdidload	viewwillappear
due to the keywords did and will in uiviewcontroller i have am unsure where to put the code before after calling super in viewdidload and viewwillappear in order to make the code run effectively

7901309
int	double
the implementation assigns double from int which basically is not different to your other solution

7901316
rss	feed
google want a feed file to be a customised version of either rss or atom with an additional namespace attached for the tags google product search uses

7901333
onresume	onpause
for stopping the music you can stop it on onpause and restart in onresume

7901409
hide	show
if the user hits emit it should show the toggles and hide the label readouts

7901417
temporary	tablespace
sharding the data with commits between blocks should reduce the amount of temporary table space usage so it would likely be a lot more reliable if temp tablespace is limited

7901418
setinterval	settimeout
this works fine for most common apis except settimeout setinterval

7901418
setinterval	settimeout
i tested it in ie 6-9 settimeout doesn t work at all and setinterval causes memory exhausted in some cases

7901432
ubuntu	debian
if your server is ubuntu 10.04 debian 6 using viruozzo or maybe other virtualization platforms or maybe just multiprocessor systems this may be a bug with the openmp support of imagemagick

7901454
stdout	stderr
by default both stdout and stderr are directed to the terminal

7901454
stdout	stderr
if you redirect stderr to stdout then it also goes to the terminal

7901456
free	malloc
you must call free exactly once per call to malloc

7901456
free	malloc
if you want to be able to call free only once you ll need to make sure to allocate all the required memory in a single call to malloc

7901460
stdout	stderr
stderr and stdout are by default both displayed on the controlling terminal

7901481
hide	show
aside from that you ll probably want to look at the show and hide methods

7901556
hide	show
so basicly run a check on domready what value is selected hide all divs show the right one

7901575
min	max
in the select and order by clause of a sql statement with group by you can only use the columns expression used in the group by or aggregate functions min max avg .. of other columns

7901578
listadapter	simplecursoradapter
i would expect listadapter listadapter new simplecursoradapter ... to hold the values that are binded to a listview until we activity is destroyed.

7901579
inherited	subclassing
but this raises many questions to me specially regarding to activemodel product shouldnt have its own table but i would want some fields in its subclassing hotel restaurant etc to inherited those fields from it

7901580
width	height
you can extend a layout which will be your top layout which will be set to fill_parent width and height and override the onsizechange int width int height int oldwidth int oldheight

7901580
width	height
the width and height is the real width and height of your display

7901585
submit	submission
assuming it is the former case what you can do is this submit the chunks to the executor in some order and each submission will give you a handle called a to the task processed output

7901596
mkmapview	mkannotationview
you can subclass mkannotationview add uiimageviews and whatever else then implement the mkmapview delegate method

7901607
aggregate-functions	sum
group by in oracle implies that you are trying to run an aggregate-functions sum count etc. on one of the columns

7901622
google-chrome	firefox
this javascript does not work on ie 8 in google-chrome and firefox it does

7901672
ssl	https
the problem is if a ssl https url exists i tried all suggestions in the above threads and while they work fine on normal http urls none of them work on a https file

7901707
membase	couchbase
for adding persistence to this later couchbase formerly membase is worth a look and used in production for very large game platforms

7901716
portrait	landscape
this does work when the device currently the 7in galaxy tab running 2.2 is in portrait mode but when rotated to landscape the layout does not adjust size and the keyboard hides half the screen

7901748
apache	nginx
depending on the webserver the error_log nginx apache apache2 directive and where it is logging errors to will help you understand where the problem is happening

7901834
portrait	landscape
my uialertview has a message and 3 buttons my problem is the alert view display normally in portrait but it hides message in landscape mode as below screenshots

7901839
apache	nginx
if you re using passenger then one reason for the slowdown is that all assets are now served by the asset pipeline instead of the webserver apache nginx

7901920
for-loop	arrays
a simple for-loop without copying the arrays but only altering the original

7901926

7902038
free	malloc
you have two malloc s so you need two free s

7902054
folder	directory
and put that in a .htaccess file in your folder directory assuming you can alter apache s settings meaning you have the option allowoverride all in that virtual host

7902082
free	malloc
heap allocated memory allocated by malloc is not reclaimed until explicitly free by calling free

7902103

in this and almost any situation where i find myself tempted to have a subclassing extend multiple superclass i try to find a way to model the situation with delegation rather than inherited

7902232
fastcgi	scgi
you could also make your file server application a fastcgi or scgi client of your web server the one running django

7902246

7902327
mouse	keyboard
indeed both when i change the selection by keyboard and when i change the selection by mouse the handler is executed

7902327
mouse	keyboard
the problem is when i change the selection with keyboard and then i move on to the next field either by mouse or keyboard in the form

7902368
post	get
if you can post some code we can get to the bottom on the problem

7902377

i m currently developing an app on my ubuntu linux machine

7902389
salt	md5
i am trying to append a randomly generated salt along with my md5 generated password

7902394
mouse	keyboard
see how to simulate mouse and keyboard events in code for examples of using sendkeys to send keystrokes to a different application

7902396
versioning	upgrade
otherwise better upgrade tomcat and align everything based on the tomcat versioning

7902408
mouse	keyboard
another option would be to use inputsimulator which is a very flexible and reliable wrapper that is capable of simulating keyboard and mouse events

7902425
capistrano	bundler
after i added the require bundler capistrano at the top of the deploy.rb file and after i run the cap deploy migrations command i get the following error

7902432
hash	salt
you could do this in a salt field or in the hash itself see phpass for a good implementation example

7902457
hash	salt
the point of a salt is to avoid rainbow table attacks or precomputed password hash

7902457
hash	salt
in order to check the old password you ll need to use the same salt you hash it with so you do need to store it in the db

7902457
hash	md5
md5 isn t a strong crypto hash and you are probably best using bcrypt

7902489
hash	salt
you could as well just store the date and time of the last login and use it as the salt - this way you don t explicitly store the salt and it changes with each new login naturally this also means the password hash is always different

7902489
salt	md5
you could actually have several salt - perhaps one or more coming from the database md5 last_login sha1 username ... and another one hardcoded in your php application

7902538
jstl	taglib
for this particular simple purpose i d just use the jstl functions taglib

7902541
put	get
not exactly sure how you managed to get an _id field in the indexes collection but both shell and morphia originated ensureindex calls for compound indexes do not put an _id field in the index object

then i tried changing layoutparams.width turns out width and height are the only public properties in java history and objectanimator needs getter and setter

7902978
min	max
i know how to remove duplicates or how to replace them by max or min but couldn t find a way how to calculate a mean

7903033
hide	show
method 1 - show hide specific columns

7903033
hide	show
so the most direct way and this will work if there are only a handful of things you want to show hide is just to create a boolean column for every thing you need to show hide

7903033
hide	show
method 2 - show hide whole sections

7903033
hide	show
the next level that you might need is rather than showing hiding particular columns have your show hide boolean columns something like show_contact_info show_photos etc

7903033
hide	show
for each logical section that a user would show or hide

7903033
hide	show
method 3 - show hide sections based on who is viewing it

7903083
int	double
unfortunately c++ does implicit casts from double to int so suddenly my first code snippet will compile

7903087
opera	google-chrome
google-chrome and opera both look at the file s contents detect that it s a png and display it as an image

7903162
firefox	safari
hybi-00 hixie-76 firefox 5.0 safari 5.1.1 use this old protocol with sec-websocket-key1 key2..

7903162
google-chrome	firefox
hybi-06 firefox 7.0 google-chrome 14 are using the last protocol with sec-websocket-key

7903186
versioning	upgrade
you can consider this something to think about when you upgrade to a new versioning of python which actually removes this module

7903197
public	protected
does object has to do any thing with public private or protected apart from the fact that if some thing is defined as public then objects too will be able to access irespective of the scope

7903219
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in ie firefox google-chrome and safari my checkboxes looks like this

7903237

i am developing an html and javascript catalogue pageslider for ipad which shows one page in portrait and two pages in landscape

7903299
width	height
it seems that this function doesn t pass the actual width and height of the device screen

7903332
uiview	subviews
property accessoryview is just a usual uiview so you can add any subviews to it

7903336
put	get
but when i put notpersistent don t get fields from view and fields stay empty

7903337
width	height
you can use .actualheight and .actualwidth to get the rendered height width of a control

7903340
ant	maven
when using a decent tool for creating a web app like an ide ant with ivy or maven or a combination of these then handling and bundling dependencies should be no problem

7903384
width	height	actualheight	actualwidth
the thing is the width and height properties let you express the desired size whereas what you want is the rendered size - which can be accessed but not set using the actualwidth and actualheight properties

7903384
actualheight	actualwidth
because actualheight actualwidth is a calculated value you should be aware that

7903400
qapplication	qobject
qapplication is already a qobject so you should simply write

7903419
post	get
finally the case you re describing relates more to updating a specific post so post can get different image set for example

7903433
folder	directory
i believe windows phone does not have a current directory so the application probably looks in the root folder

7903456
width	height
i get unspecified dimension exceptions unless i specify the width and height of the drawer in dip which isn t ideal for supporting large small screen devices

7903471
switching	screens
but to switching the screens from screens 1 to screens 2 the scrolling effects has to be show to the user the scrolling effect can be from moving first to second from left to right or from right to left

7903484
accelerometer	gyroscope
the devicemotion property is only available on devices having both an accelerometer and a gyroscope

7903484
accelerometer	gyroscope
cmmotionmanager supports gyroscope and accelerometer

7903484
accelerometer	gyroscope
furtheron there is a simple but quite efficient sensor fusion algorithm called devicemotion if the device has an accelerometer and a gyroscope on board - compass is not needed and thus not used

7903508
qapplication	qobject
there is one base qobject for the qapplication and another for the actual myapp class

7903508
inherited	base-class
you should keep your inherited diagram linear rather than have a split inherited scheme and that means having a derived class that only contains one instance of the base-class

7903514
google-chrome	firefox
first in the browse console firefox and google-chrome check if this code returns the parent that you want

7903546
switching	screens
this may seem totally unreasonable to ask but i have been designing a multi-panel real device simulator that has many different screens and my current approach is to add all the screens objects from the code only and dispose them when i switching to another screens

7903556
post	get
i am using delete button since a link calls for a get instead of a post

7903556

7903612
pascal	delphi
most pascal compilers including delphi also have the same linking feature and it is known as smart linking but the resulting statically linked executables are much smaller the those produced by the visual c++ compiler

7903647
width	height
if i understand you correctly set your html body width to 100 height 100

7903751
hide	show
you can then show hide the element within the event handler based on the value selected

7903755
spine.js	backbone.js
i was taking at look at mvc solutions like backbone.js spine.js dojo toolkit and pub sub pattern but i don t know if these solutions is the way to go in my app however may be solutions with large amounts of resources that i do not need

lxml	elementtree
i have an xml file that i m using elementtree from lxml to work with but when i add tags to it pretty printing doesn t seem to work

7903760
google-chrome	safari
so apparently my problem is with google-chrome but the same setting works with safari

7903793
apache	lighttpd
actually now that i think about it a reverse proxy using apache or lighttpd might be the easiest of the solutions

7903800
getter	setter
consider following entities some getter and setter are omitted for brevity

7903800
children	parent
the child entity is wrongly being inserted twice into the list of children of the parent entity

7903840
width	height
in paper layout go to headersection and double click change width height

7903872
margin	height
otherwise your height margin combo will push the bottom blue line off the screen

7903949
post	put
however jon skeet put together unconstrained melody which adds the functionality with some il post processing

7903952
setinterval	settimeout
the same can probably happen if you overload event loop by constantly scheduling your own events with nexttick setinterval settimeout

7903992
button	checkbox
you ll need to disable the save button at paypal checkbox then when you generate your code you can unprotect the button to expose the individual fields including the item price

7904004
jar	war
this just requires a little advanced use of maven jar war plugin

7904004
jar	war
to make it work you have to set up jar plugin in the third artifact war type artifact regarding the classifier and the fact that you need 2 packages from one artifacts war jar

7904020
post	put
also i read some post from rom developer that they put some app in system app system app folder and that it did not behaved as you want uploaded app on market with greater version did not updated their system app and behaved like a different app in respect to installing it

i m guessing that i need to set bind the datasource of repeater2 somewhere in the aspx to be the children property of parent

7904301
width	height
i added a width and height properties to fish class and in my data template i bound the textblock width height to these using mode onwaytosource

7904301
width	height
problem the width height are always nan when setting my fish.width height properties

7904301
actualheight	actualwidth
i cant bind to actualwidth actualheight because they are read only why can t i bind onwaytosource on a readonly property

7904351
google-chrome	safari
yaws 1.91 works with safari version 5.1.1 6534.51.22 but does not with google-chrome 15.0.874.102 and probably not with 14.x

7904355
int	double
i m guessing php int types scale to some double type or something like that

7904364
superclass	subclassing
you should call the superclass implementation of the nscoding methods in your subclassing

7904375
width	height
what i want to do is i declare the width and height by using the points which also are using in the cvrectangle which is the point r

7904393
int	chars
but when an int goes in it gets interpreted as a chars which is why 123 got displayed as ascii chars 123

7904441
width	height
keep in mind that you re looping over absolute coordinates and width and height are relative terms

7904516
websphere	ibm
according to the websphere infocenter the formloginweb sample from the techsamp package in your websphere installation samples src techsamp formloginweb is supposed to demonstrate such ibm specific extension but.

7904532
int	double
then it will be unserialized as a double giving you more bits per int than a standard 4-byte per int 32 bits

7904554
jsr311	jax-rs
for example jax-rs jsr311 spec provides a class javax.ws.rs.core.mediatype

7904624
children	parent
in the model each parent contains a list of a children

7904654
libs	buildpath
i think you should add libs libgoogleanalytics.jar to build path in libs right click on libgoogleanalytics.jar - buildpath - add to build path

7904662
x86	64bit
but my problem is if my program is installed on a 64bit operating system that file path is not right as it is program files x86 so is there a way to detect and run different code or anything

switching	screens
all the code for animating left and right works fine from on screens buttons and the correct backstatus flag is passed when switching flippers

7905087
cgpoint	cgsize	cgpoint	cgrect	cgsize	cgrect
you shouldn t be putting non-object types in an nsarray for instance if you wish to store an array of cgrect then you wrap them up in nsvalue objects and store those this is the same for cgpoint cgsize etc

7905108
put	get
once i understand how to get this solution working i should be able to put it into my online form.

7905123
min	max
you could go for a fully ordered structure such as a balanced bst and cache the min max whenever the tree is modified

7905123
min	max
the min is the leftest element the max is the rightest element

7905151
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox

now i can easily set its delegate to self to make it point to my parentviewcontroller however from the child view i will push the next and the next view onto the navigationcontroller

7905297
shadowing	named
so the case statement generates a new symbol of the same named x as your initial value shadowing that original value

7905297
shadowing	named
by shadowing intellij means that it hides any other values of the same named and thus makes them inaccessible

7905300
awt	swing
it should preferably integrate with swing awt

7905318
accessor	properties
create a non-serializable accessor properties converting basic type to what you need

7905342
getter	setter
we already have a bunch of classes that represent the domain objects but most of them know too much and have both logic getter setter and data access in the form of untyped datasets strewn throughout them

7905447
ready	each
for each thread that isn t ready to run windows keeps a list of all the waitable objects events etc. that the thread is waiting on

7905448
implements	extends
now we can implements concrete types of animals - since we want one animaltype to accompany every system-type that extends the animal class we will define and store the animaltype instance in a static field inside each type - and our implementation of the animaltype-property will return that static instance

7905453
integer	unsigned
as returns an unsigned integer this value will wrap round to max int - 2

7905494
integer	unsigned
to be more precise returns an unsigned integer so subtracting two from zero remember calling any method on nil gives you zero doesn t give you -2 it gives you a very very large number

7905519
capistrano	bundler
as wrote in the bundler official documentation in the automatic deployment with capistrano section i added the require bundler capistrano to the top of my deploy.rb file

7905531
floating-point	integer
it s because cpus today tend to have separate integer and floating-point units

7905540
width	height
interestingly i had to subtract the min of the status bar s height and width

7905540
portrait	landscape
i ve looked at this in the past and it similarly reports the same dimensions in both portrait and landscape except it reports having a rotate transform

7905540
width	height
not sure how your app works but if you aren t using a navigation controller of some kind you could have a uiview under your main view with the max height width of parent and grows shrinks with parent

7905540
uiapplication	uiwindow	uialertview	uiapplication	uialertview	uiwindow
start messing with uiwindows and you ll find out weird stuff like showing a uialertview will change uiapplication s keywindow to point at a new uiwindow that the uialertview created

7905630
plot	heatmap
i first read the data into a dataframe remove any duplicate rows factorise timestamp field melt the dataframe according to timestamp scale all variable between 0 and 1 then plot the heatmap

7905648
int	boolean
it s a bit hackish but the status 1 when status really is 1 will evaluate to a boolean true which mysql will politely cast to an int 1 which then gets summed up

7905654
nunit	moq
i m getting this error from moq via nunit and it doesn t make much in the way of sense to me

7905699
hide	show
but i want to modify the way it is displaying currently in portrait mode.so i want in portrait mode whenever application open it should display both master as well as detail view controller.so on pressing the navigation bar button it will again hide and show the left root view controller

7905699
portrait	landscape	hide	show
now both portrait and landscape mode is showing both root and detail view controller as i wants but the problem is navigation bar button is not working to hide show left root view controller

7905743
hide	scrolltop	hide	show
you ll need to find out the height of the header and its position on the page then just show or hide the div depending on the scrolltop value using jquery

all enum types for example inherit from system.enum which in turn inherits from system.valuetype which inherits from system.object all reference types. however i think the fact that fundamentally all delegation in fact inherit not just from delegation but from multicastdelegate is the critical realization here

i m not sure if you have thought about doing this but one of the things you can do is check for the width of the screens resolution with javascript and then if the resolution is less than some number i use 480 because at that point that site looks bad then switching the css templates from the default to the mobile themed template

case 2 the code could potentially return an error since f could subtract 1 from x and assign it back to the x in the parent environment where any x element equal to 1 could then be set to zero and the third line would return a division by zero error

7906903

if you know the height width or can calculate it somehow then you can use

if you instead make them popup controls you can show or hide them at any time on first navigation

7907157
put	get
if it does then you should then be able to do click on the appropriate link most likely selecting by the text in the link. you will also likely have to put a sleep of a second or so after the mouseover to give the client side code time to render the menu and get the objects inside it into a state where they can be seen and clicked

7907383
width	height
before set the width to 300px but no height and add the class ui-widget

7907383

after the dialog is created set the new width for the dialog wrapper and start an animate if the current height is lower then the calculated

7907501

in this case you might be safe to declare the controlslist as ienumerable rather than ilist assuming .net 4.0 because ienumerable is declared as covariant ienumerable

7907544
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i tried this in safari google-chrome firefox all return the same thing

7907847
public	protected
i think the helpfulness of the public protected and private keywords is just to make the code more clear

7907847
public	protected
so you would use public for the api of a class private to make it clear how to do not extend a class and protected in every other case

7907847
public	protected
a common pragmatic approach is never use private and to use just public or protected

children	parent
i m finding however that disabling the parent always disables the children no matter what the children are set as and i ve not had any luck finding a way around this

7908805
children	parent
i have a sneaking suspicion that because the children are visual children of the parent within the layout they will always enable disable along with the parent no matter what i do

unless you re doing microcontroller arduino avr etc or firmware development python s high-level-ness won t be an issue at all

7909728

i assume from the docs for each rectangle then create a buffer to that rectangles height and width

7910651
width	height
the first rectangle always has a header and within that header the requested width and height

7910651
width	height
i m guessing i haven t received all of the first rectangles data even though i have set the sockets buffer size to width height bytes

7910661
hide	show
the logic will be show both images start the timer and when the timer ticks after 2 or 3 seconds or whatever you set the delay to be hide the images inside of the timer s actionlistener

presumably all of these elements are hidden to begin with such that the overall effect is to show and then hide one element at a time changing once per second

7910874

i made a list of candidate algorithms - dsa ecdsa rsa for which there are crypto providers in java

7911156
rsa	dsa
comparing dsa vs rsa

7911156
rsa	dsa
dsa has signature that is independent of key strength and is much smaller than rsa signature for equivalent security rsa 1024 1568 vs dsa 192

7911156
rsa	dsa
however dsa verification expect verification calls to be 100x issue is about 10x slower than rsa verification

7911156
rsa	dsa
a review of dsa vs rsa also brought out other esoteric issues - secrecy of private key in dsa is very reliant on how random the k parameter is dsa does not support firewalled hashes which is not an issue for us

7911176
calloc	malloc
with regard to __nano_init being called twice you ve declared the function as a constructor so it s called when the library is loaded and it s called a second time explicitly when your malloc and calloc implementations are first called

7911188

so right now they get a simple email telling them how many post they have i have searched for a way to run a second query inside the main query which counts the post from the post table generates the email based on their account info in another table what we want is to have the email show each post as well i am already joining tables in my first query and i can t seem to find a way to run a second inside the while statement

once you meet the minimum requirements for kvc compliance then kvc will recognize the properties and use its accessor including any array accessor you implement

7911709

i trying to use contact form using j query php ajax but here in the below code the form information is gathered and send it to the server using for-loop and arrays of inouts of ofrm is created

7911726
accessor	properties
alternatively if you re not using kvc to access this properties then you need to make sure you re using the array accessor to access it

7911726
accessor	properties
you implemented undo support in your accessor at least the two whose implementations you showed and if anything is observing the properties via kvo that is another side effect

7913123
getter	setter
2 properties implement getter and setter you don t have to write javastyle getter and setter methods and pretend they belong together

7913130

7914134
hide	show
show is js is unavailable hide if js is available

multiplying	subtract	multiplying	modulo
i need to optimize some code where i multiplying a vector of ints 32 bit by a scalar modulo p where p is the prime number 2 32 -5 and then subtract that vector from another vector modulo p

7914637

7914758
division	modulo
i know of two ways to do this without using division or modulo

7914758
division	multiplication
the basic idea here is to pre-compute and approximation of the reciprocal of the p which allows you do an integer division using just a couple of integer multiplication

7914758
multiplying	modulo
then you can multiplying back and obtain your modulo

7914758
floating-point	integer
both approaches here involve no divisions aside from a pre-computation of the reciprocal either in integer or floating-point

7914759

7914854
idictionary	icollection
both icollection and idictionary are unordered meaning that although you can retrieve the elements in some order with the copyto method or a foreach loop that order has no special meaning and it might change for no apparent reason

if you have the option to make all the children inherit a single mappedsuperclass annotated class where the parent field is declared and mapped you could do a single query that would return all the children

7915510
implements	extends
maybe the simplest solution is to extends the wiser class which implements a simple smtp server specifically for testing by overriding its accept method returning false after the x

7915514
folder	directory
you might however simply add a drive map to the share on your windows server assign it a fixed letter like z or even simply access hostname folder escape the backslashes and use the php built in directory commands to read and write the files from that drive

using hover is just a little bit shorter than binding to mouseover and mouseout separately but the end result is the same

7915545
integer	unsigned
a typical serialization field would be something like unsigned 32-bit integer little-endian

7915597
hash	md5
you now have to calculate the md5 hash first

7915605
junit	easymock	junit	mockito	mockito	easymock
an alternative i can suggest is through writing a junit test with easymock mockito and simulating the exception that you see on production

7915607

7916236
multiplying	add
but only one step of the above procedure is enough just split multiplying to 5 and add

7916272

alternatively you can also stick to using inputstream outputstream only as that would stream the content as pure bytes and thus wouldn t affect the charset the bytes represent

7916752
viewmodel	caliburn
i ve tried using caliburn so it can map the view event to the viewmodel method

7916752
viewmodel	caliburn
it means that when the search event fires caliburn will look for the method searchtext in the viewmodel

7916893
width	height
i inverted the width and height should be 480 300

7916914

7917555
keydown	keyup
we would suggest that you can try to do in the textbox s keyup event instead of the keydown event

7917561
keydown	keyup
bind an event to the keydown keyup function which stores the event.keycode or event.which in a variable

7917564

c99 requires that all static initializations be constant expressions int constants floating constants enumeration constants chars

7917796

to solve this problem i would first get the min and the max datetime values from the dataset

7917801

there is the htc legend with 320 x 480 width x height and the samsung galaxy with 480 x 800 both chose to be displayed with the normal definition since i don t have large

7922582
width	height
actually the width is not the problem - the same definitions work for small normal large - but the height really makes trouble

7922608
getter	setter
employee.java setter and getter omitted for brevity

your formula generates numbers between min and min + max

7922990
std	ostream
if you want to receive a generic output stream you should accept a reference to std ostream for char -based streams or to std wostream for wchar_t -based streams

min	max
to show that the first one is incorrect let s say min is 10 and max is 20

7923004
min	max
your formula generates numbers between min and min + max

7923004
min	max
the one google found generates numbers between min and max

7923006

google-chrome	firefox
some browsers such as firefox and google-chrome come with packages that will allow the browser to talk to sqlite dbs but they are not written in javascript and can do things that javascript cannot which is why they are included as browser-specific packages instead of as js scripts

7923979
post	put
i guess you can access post also if you put global post

7924017
int	chars
you could add a calculated column with year-month data using a chars 6 like 201104 for april 2011 that column can be updated using insert and update triggers or an int like 24136 24136 2011 12 + 4

i was wondering if there was a relatively straightforward way to simulate this behavior in other programs such as notepad++ or gedit where users can set up scripts to compile programs

7924074
int	boolean
the same thing is happening in your example the int â boolean that you ve passed to takewhile isn t going to get fed any elements beyond the head of the stream until something like your foreach makes that necessary

7924143

7924397
hide	show
have a text field show up exactly on top of the password field hide is on focus and focus on the password field.

7924430
disk	ram
then run your program in the ram disk

7924445
profiler	yourkit
i haven t looked at yourkit in a very long time but i would be surprised if its profiler wasn t able to exclude packages or restrict profiled packages

i can t get a handle on how to put the pieces together

7924590
int	chars
indeed i agree that it would be nice from a convenience standpoint if java allowed arrays to be indexed by chars or even an enum rather than just int

7924645
int	chars
you can not mix different datatypes in an array like int and chars or jpanel and jframe or int and jbutton

7924645
int	boolean	int	chars
only if you abstract over the difference and use an jcomponent for jpanel and jframe as common parent but this will not work for the build-in types int chars boolean and so on because they aren t objects

7924645
int	chars
if your base-types arrays of int byte chars string jpanel ... are of equal length then you have something like a hidden object a database-row

7924653

int	chars
a chars data type is just an int which has size of 1 byte

7924847
portrait	landscape
for example the rest of the app stays in portrait mode but one view can be in either landscape or portrait mode

spaces	delimiter
the pattern delimiter at either end mean the regex engine should know where the pattern ends so the engine shouldn t be confused by a spaces

7924891
int	chars
yes you can store chars in int data types

7924891
int	chars
a chars is just a int data type like int but with a narrower guaranteed range

7924891
int	chars
in fact it is sometimes the right thing to do to use int rather than chars to store a chars - for example if you are reading chars from a file you can use

7924891
int	chars
in this case you must use int rather than chars for the type of c in order to be able to distinguish eof from a valid chars

7924893
ant	maven
any java ide or command-line build tool ant maven gradle whatever understands this and behaves accordingly

typically you should be fine with using a mocking framework like easymock or mockito in which case the number of additional classes required solely for testing purposes should be pretty less

7926763
ord	chr
carry on using ord and chr exactly as before

7926763
ord	chr
although the documentation for chr and ord implies that these function use byte as the integral type don t believe the documentation

7926765
for-loop	loops
also i found that this is not nearly as fast as the for-loop on my computer 0.35s for deal versus 0.05s for loops presumably because of the call to mat2cell

7928216
hide	show
you won t be able to override the default browser behaviour of how it displays tooltips containing the title attribute text but you could follow the steps on this other question to show and hide a div containing the relevant text the approach uses jquery and deals with hover but adding a click handler isn t much of a stretch

7928216

jquery hide show with slide on hover.

hash	salt
the salt sole reason to exist is to be unique for each hash password

7928642
hash	salt
the kind of optimization that an attacker may apply when a salt is reused shared includes but is not limited to tables of precomputed hash such as rainbow tables

7928642
hash	md5
as a professional cryptographer myself i would raise a suspicious eyebrow at the use of simple concatenation in md5 or even sha-256 these are merkleâ damgã rd hash functions which is fine for collision resistance but does not provide a random oracle there is the so-called length extension attack

7928642
pbkdf2	hash	hash	hmac	hmac	pbkdf2
in pbkdf2 the hash function is not used directly but through hmac

7928778

udp	rtp
loopingcall for example was designed to invoke udp sends for rtp media streaming at the appropriate interval for transmitting a sound sample

7929166

7931655
pylons	pyramid
i believe that pyramid like pylons ships with the webhelpers module so you can import the literal function

7931684
put	get
if i put the id of the uicomponent of the page to render i get a nullpointerexception saying that a property is not defined for namingcontainer in ccdisplay

7931684
put	get
when i put the f ajax with the render pointing to the clientid passed in param i get an error while loading the page

7931685
children	parent
you can still safely keep a parent pointer but make sure you cleanup the children before you allow a parent to go out of scope deleted or otherwise

7931692
serializable	deserialization
my thought is to have a property that flattens the array and serializable that collection and unflatten it during deserialization but i m not sure if that s efficient

7931694
int	chars
chars is not guaranteed to be aligned in the same way as an int should be

7931707
width	height
you just need to cancel the rotation of the child s and adjust for their width height and offset from the container

7931797
portrait	landscape
note that the orientations are relative to the default orientation of the device which is portrait for phones and landscape for tablets usually

7931799
xslt	xquery
i am new in xquery but right now i m in a project using xquery using php and xslt

7931816
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox though bottom image but not in ie 8 and google-chrome top image

7931836
rss	feed
i have a mobile app that gets a rss feed

7931836
rss	feed
the date on the rss feed displays fri 28 oct 2011 17 30 00 gmt and i would like that to render as a short date in cst time standard dd mm yyyy and time

7931838
post	get
i wanted a way to be able to create template files for the different emails which accept _post variables to fill in relevant information and to simply make a post request to these templates and get back the response to place as the body of the email

7931845
jquery	anythingslider
i m using anythingslider jquery plugin for my gallery

7931854
children	parent
and some example code to add children to the parent

7931862
int	chars
however i am surprised how chars here is understood as 3 int because substring take two int

7931893
int	chars
this goes all the way back to c where chars is in essence a narrow int type and gets implicitly converted to int whenever necessary

7931898
sorting	grouping
the dataset is returning both the detail and summary rows - detail first then summary for each grouping - grouping and sorting being done in the stored procedure no grouping in the report

7931902
int	chars
now when you pass chars it is automatically promoted to int endindex and hence treated as int

7931943
filtering	grouping
it s basically and outer join between the agencies table and the rentals grouping by agency following your search filtering

7931945
int	double
the same occurs if you assign an int value to a double

7931945
int	double
1 is an int but it is implicitly cast to double 1.0

7931957
division	modulo
this kind of conversion is done using integer division and the modulo

7931957
division	modulo
with integer division you find out how many of the large unit you have and with modulo you find out how many of the small unit are left over

7931961
dependencyobject	freezable
didnt work for some reason i ended with exception the provided dependencyobject is not a context for this freezable but oddly only in some cases

7932000
versioning	upgrade
this could be due to a badly installed versioning of wmi wmi repository upgrade failure insufficient disk space or insufficient memory.

7932040
gridview	repeater
i have a repeater nested inside of a gridview

7932040
gridview	repeater	gridview	rowdatabound
on the rowdatabound event for the gridview i set the datasource based on one of the row s columns and then bind the repeater

7932045
post	get
you should use post instead get since get is meant to retrieve information more info

7932077
put	get
the response from the get is sacramento | ca | united states i can easily put the responses into input boxes but i can t figure out how to select an option based on the response

7932086
post	get
i have also read this blog post that says that it s not possible anymore but i know there are sites that still custom css - i just cannot get mine to work

7932088
int	chars
use int to store chars code points instead

7932092
put	get
my org has some silly requirements that you must put admin at the end of every svn commit message in order to get around some decision made by the svn gatekeepers that every commit should have an associated bug number

7932095
superclass	subclassing
i m trying to set up a parent class that extends a subclassing but whenever i attempt to reference this.element in the subclassing when called from the superclass it s undefined

7932116
keydown	keyup
i m not familiar with sendkeys enough to be sure about this but i d imagine what it is doing is saying shift keydown followed immediately by shift keyup so that you aren t getting time to click before the keyup event

7932121
int	chars
now you re storing the chars 3 an ascii value of 51 and if you tried using it as in int you would get 51

7932141
inherited	properties
actually what i found that was very helpful to me was going to properties manager - select the properties pages that all my projects inherited - double click to open the properties pages editor - click user macros - add a macro and define it s name and value

7932147
folder	directory
create a widgets folder under example module directory and create your widget there

7932184
puts	gets
i can see what is going on sort of i can get an js alert on ajax success for the form as a remote form that puts to the server and the update on the controller works -- the basic text gets changed but i need to refresh the page to see the changes

7932211
post	get
i ve tried various joins and subselects and i have managed to get a list of categories their post count and their first post i need the last

7932211
post	get
i have also managed to get a list of categories and their last post but not the post count

7932232
post	get
if you have no such field but you have for example post_date that is not unique you may get two rows for some categories in rare cases where two post have exactly the same timestamp

7932232
post	get
to also get categories without post use a left join

7932248
gridview	repeater
edit i suspect it might have something to do where you might need to rebind your gridview and not just the repeater

7932273
caliburn.micro	mef
i am currently getting into wpf and caliburn.micro for now without something like mef or autofac

7932287
x86	64bit
i am using linux with x86 64bit to be precise

7932290
ant	maven
running of the ant or maven before tests start is not supported

7932329
onmousedown	onkeydown
my preference is to not compromise the user experience just for analytics and i do this for a living. so my solution is to use onmousedown and onkeydown as substitutes together i refer to them as preclick

7932348
children	parent
then child.parent works fine and if you want to remove children you d tell the parent which ones to remove

7932362
put	get
if you put the device a on the desk in stationary position then b on a perfectly horizontal turntable rotating slowly you will get the same qualitative sensor readings

7932369
google-chrome	firefox
the closing function works on ie and firefox but not on google-chrome

7932396
folder	directory
i would first try accessing that directory location or it s parent and make sure that your account has the proper permissions to create folder in that location

7932421
dynamicmethod	reflection.emit
wp7 does not support reflection.emit and therefore cannot use il generation and dynamicmethod

7932425
width	height
the canvas height and width are set to 800 x 600 and the image content scales appropriately and then is displayed

7932425
width	height
right now if i set the canvas width and height it just crops the image at those dimension not resizing as i would like

7932466
rss	feed
i m writing an android app that is parsing rss feed from different sources

7932466
rss	feed
what i m doing is on a remote server i m consolidating all of the rss feed into one big xml file then parsing that on the device using a sax parser instead of going to each site individually

7932466
rss	feed
so i m basically caching the rss feed for performance and it works pretty well

7932489
getter	setter
the suggested solution was to duplicate the date object in both getter and setter like

7932518
oncreate	setcontentview
the activity uses a standard oncreate call which set s up the content view from an xml resource via setcontentview r.layout.main

7932575
width	height
where dx dy dw dh are the destination x y width and height

7932576
width	height
ie8 has multiple issues with float and specific width height values on tags

7932595
width	height
the width and height of the presented view are smaller than those of the screen and the view is centered on the screen

7932657
width	height
uiimage size w x h portrait width x portrait height depends on your camera resolution

7932657
portrait	landscape
cgimage size depends on device orientation portrait or landscape

7932662
width	height
the height width of the outer box this is static at 200px

7932701
unsigned	short
i need to read a byte array of 16 bits as unsigned short number and java doesn t support unsigned short type

7932710
put	get
simply put it does not need to reload the whole page to get new information

7932711
width	height
the height width of the outer box this is static at 200px

7932723
cos	sin
newx cos angle oldx - sin angle oldy

7932723
cos	sin
newy sin angle oldx + cos angle oldy

7932729
put	get
the path method wizard_path is ambiguous it can either refer to the delete clause in which case it needs an id argument wizard_path 22 or it can refer to the get and put clauses in which case it doesn t take an id argument

7932746
unsigned	short
i don t know if you have to use an unsigned short but in case you don t you can always use a char to hold an unsigned short

7932755
width	height
you should replace 200 by width height constant

7932774
unsigned	short
you cannot represent all values of an unsigned short in a short but in an int you can

7932815
folder	directory
you can publish to a folder that you ve already set up as a virtual directory

7932817
min	max
min max values are

7932820
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox and google-chrome but it doesn t in ie

7932834
width	height
with xcode 4.2 and the llvm compiler when compiling for armv6 there are some very weird bugs in the generated application such as width property of cgsize returning the height instead

7932892
profiling	debugging
incorrect provisioning - verify that you have specified the correct provisioning profiling in debugging in the build settings for both the project and the target

7932921
google-chrome	firefox
it works perfectly in google-chrome but in firefox and internet explorer the css file does not render

7932930
int	boolean
you can leave off the astype int call if you re happy with an array of boolean rather than an array of int

7932937
hash	salt
ok so i understand the value of the salt in my hash passwords.

7932952
portrait	landscape
droid and flash often break after changing back and forth between landscape and portrait while in fullscreen. by break i mean freeze where you can hear the video and use the controls but everything is just a still frozen image the redrawing fails

7932975
superclass	subclassing
you can call the superclass s method from within the subclassing

7932986
wmi	managementeventwatcher
i m using a managementeventwatcher in c# to monitor wmi pnpentity events

7933004
hash	salt
salt are concatednated to a password and then unidirectionally hash to avoid the ability of compromised passwords to be determined from rainbow tables or lists of pre-hashed passwords

7933007
ant	maven
note that the defaults depends on the build engine you use so if you use something else than eclipse ant or maven and you live supports-screens undefined in you manifest the defaults can be different then this

7933011
g++	gcc
or if there is a way for gcc or g++ to be able see these files in a location i specify when compiling

7933060
typedef	struct
i have typedef struct in my c++ code

7933080
openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	linux	freebsd	linux
i m trying to find a way to create a gre tunnel on osx lion i m able to create such tunnels in almost every os including openbsd freebsd linux and cisco ios

7933083
portrait	landscape
heights seem tricky since the value is so different in portrait and landscape modes on a single device much less across devices

7933093
hash	salt
but thats nothing hash passwords with or without a salt can avoid

7933122
subtraction	add
but when i add a subtraction as follows

7933140
google-chrome	firefox
datachannel is planned for version 25 of google-chrome behind a flag meanwhile it can be tested in firefox nightly aurora 12th december 2012

7933173
avr-gcc	winavr
i tried to choose manually c|c++ compiler files avr-gcc and avr-g++ from winavr directory but the error still take place

7933180
perl	tcl
python perl jruby lua beanshell javascript tcl and shell are currently supported and we re planning to add more

7933183
gridview	sqldatasource
and in default.aspx page add new gridview control and bind it using sqldatasource control

7933220
ubuntu	linux
vnc server vnc4server on a ubuntu linux host

7933229
int	chars
technically this is because chars is a subtype of int

7933229
int	chars
to determine whether substring int int is applicable to argument int chars we first try 15.12.2.2 phase 1 identify matching arity methods applicable by subtyping we need to test whether chars is a subtype of int

7933229
int	chars
then to assign the chars argument to the int parameter per 15.12.4.5 create frame synchronize transfer control we apply 5.3 method invocation conversion which converts chars to int per 5.1.2 widening primitive conversion

7933292
gridview	repeater
as for your problem i would suggest either rebinding the gridview when new items are added to the repeater or find the repeater in the event that saves the new record and rebind it there

7933381
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox when i log in and persist cookie then close the browser and then bring up the same page i am already logged in

7933421
getter	setter
these classes has some additional internal logic inside overriden property setter and getter

7933437
google-chrome	safari
while this would appear to work it doesn t since the temp file is cleared from memory before safari google-chrome can actually read the data system returns once the command open returns which does not take into account the amount of time needed for safari google-chrome etc

7933437
google-chrome	safari
if not is there a way to wait for safari google-chrome etc

7933522
box-shadow	box-sizing
whenever i use css3 style commands like box-shadow box-sizing background gradient etc in my visual studio 2010 projects and compiles it vs shows one or more errors regarding css3 styles

7933554
cocos2d-x	corona
i m not aware of any virtual joypad library that isn t built for cocos2d-x unity corona or some other engine

7933626
viewdidload	dealloc
i expected a single viewdidload with no viewdiddisappear or dealloc

7933641
children	parent
but the children property for each parent entity is null

7933657
post	get
the problem is passing the function this way sends it as undefined via post and if i enclose it in quotes then when i try to call it i get the error that it is not a function

7933701
public	protected
the rule of thumb is public is too weak and private is too strong you need some form of selected access either protected or friend

7933782
button	checkbox
user controls can be button checkbox input text boxes mice keyboards etc

7933783
button	checkbox
user controls can be button checkbox input text boxes mice keyboards etc

7933791
children	parent
you must either make both parent and children virtual to support lazy loading it can trigger really lot of queries to database or you must explicitly tell ef to load children by using eager loading

7933813
xsl-fo	xslt
you definitely do not need to write custom fo s for every file write an xslt just once and use it on-the-fly to convert your xml to xsl-fo and then use a rendering engine to process xsl-fo to pdf

7933852
viewdidload	viewwillappear
move your code that depends upon the view being the right size to viewwillappear instead of viewdidload or an init method

7933887
inherited	properties
the own properties are those that are not inherited from the prototype so by using that function on x you are explicitly excluding all the properties of object.prototype

7933938
ienumerable	iqueryable
the query can be executed in two ways either by implementing the getenumerator method defined in the ienumerable interface in the query class which inherits from iqueryable

7933951
xslt	xquery
you should pass a properties object as suggested by the documentation for getitemasstring which contains an indent key set to no as documented in the xslt 2.0 and xquery 1.0 serialization reference

7933962
children	parent
if this isn t how you intended you will have to switch the relationship so that parent can have multiple children by setting up a many to many relationship or by switching the direction of the many to one

7933965
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
works for me in google-chrome firefox and opera

7933967
prepare	execute
for instance you could prepare execute your query like so

7933991
background-color	transparency
set border 0 and background-color transparency for your input

7934038
cil	ildasm
ildasm cil disassembler

7934039
portrait	landscape
now if i choose a table row from popover view and push a new screen for the master and detail view the navigation bar button disappears and wont appear until i rotate the device to landscape and then back to portrait

7934075
int	boolean
next sort by b.member not being null - mysql will coerce this boolean result into an int 1 or 0 which can be sorted so sort descending to make all the 1 s not null b.members sort first

7934088
width	height
element s metadata say x coordinate y coordinate height width

7934103
hide	show
one more option is hide webview and show it after webview loading is complete in webview delegate method

7934107
hide	show
i probably should add that i use .show and hide whenever i use cancel button to hide the form and show other stuff

7934129
spaces	linefeed
that said here is what is happeneing when you cave out memory in a buffer overflow you have a limited amount of spaces available for your exploit before you hit the stored stack frame instruction pointer the mpeg2 browser bug which you are trying to exploit allocates 1024 bytes on the stack which is thusly the limit of your payload as well it is terminated by the standard series x00 x09 x0a x0d thats null char stop carriage return and linefeed respectively which further limits you to any shellcode which is not written with this in mind

7934130
sms	tropo
tropo does not have an email gateway for receiving sms

7934130
sms	tropo
applications that send sms by email won t be able to send to tropo

7934130
sms	tropo
one thing you could do is built a small catcher application that receives the rest call from backpack and then makes a rest call to tropo to send the sms

7934144
pascal	delphi
first there is the classic turbo pascal string also called openstring in delphi iirc which is essentially string 255

7934186
outputstream	inputstream
also i can t use the method mentioned here as i want to pass the socket instance so that the request handler can get outputstream and inputstream on the socket

7934258
sms	tropo
tropo is a cloud api for sending and receiving phone calls sms and instant messaging

7934259
sms	tropo
tropo is a cloud communications service which provides web applications the opportunity to send and receive phone calls sms text messages and instant messages

7934288
crypt	md5
after hearing that md5 isn t safe for password storage mysql i decided to use php s crypt with blowfish tell me if you know any better algorithms

7934303
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in google-chrome firefox safari and ie9+

7934310
solaris	aix
therefore if we could just have a find binary for each solaris and aix platforms we have we would have an easy fix

7934338
put	get
as far as the api s they are mostly just get put operations for the files and the files are xml based

7934388
crypt	hash
check out example #3 using crypt with different hash types

7934400
swt	swing
your underpinnings options are pretty much swing or swt

7934400
swt	swing
swing is a pretty good gui framework architecturally although some prefer swt

7934418
entities	entitymanager
the entitymanager holds a references to all managed entities since the em is required to return the same instance on subsequent query and find calls to maintain identity

7934418
entities	entitymanager
if this is not done already will want to clear the entitymanager or obtain a new one at certain points to release the memory and managed entities

7934425
put	get
put in id get info

7934493
g++	gcc
you might perhaps extend gcc actually g++ assuming it is at least 4.6 with a plugin or a gcc melt extension melt is a high level domain specific language to extend gcc which does what you want for instance providing an additional builtin which encode the type of its arguments in some constant string etc... but that does require some work and is specific to gcc

7934504
jar	war
provided two maven projects j jar w war

7934507
postgresql	mysql
i would like to use massive with mysql and i see there are sql default postgresql oracle and sqllite providers for massive

7934513
timeago	datejs
it provides a lot of the things that datejs provides formatting parsing manipulation timeago i18n etc but it s smaller faster and doesn t ruin the native date prototype

7934576
rss	feed
i m trying to use java rome-fetcher to acquire rss feed for processing

7934577
jsonb	hstore
hstore json or jsonb fields in postgresql

7934577
jsonb	hstore
json jsonb fields support any json-encodable data type not just key value pairs but also tend to be faster and for jsonb more compact than hstore

7934577
int	boolean
it also supports types other than strings such as int boolean and nested dictionaries

7934675
post	put
this post claims that someone must simply put a message via rabbitmq and then the task shall be executed

7934723
folder	directory
the target directory contain the lib with dependencies but it is located in folder with the artifact name

7934736
width	height
it s set width and height on itself

7934744
width	height
if i hard-code the pixel dimensions of the player in the call it works but i want it to adjust based on the dimensions of the webview which uses android width fill_parent and android height wrap_content and change depending on screen orientation

7934744
oncreate	onstart
from what i ve read i ve tried waiting for oncreate to finish and calling getheight and getwidth in the onstart and onresume methods but they both still return 0

7934744
width	height	oncreate	onstart
for some reason i always get 0 as the height and width whether i call the method in oncreate onstart or onresume

7934748
post	get
what do i call to get the post content xml file into a variable to mess with it

7934767
vim	emacs
many popular editors vim emacs will then read the tags file and let you quickly jump to definitions by name

7934767
ubuntu	debian
i m using exhuberant ctags which is what you get if you install ctags on a rhel-ish system but it s certainly available under debian ubuntu os x and so forth

7934777
int	double
the cost is not so high just a conversion to from int from to double and a multiplication modern processors will do it in a very little amount of time and since the accessed memory is less if the list contains a lot of values your code will be more friendly with processor cache

7934846
width	height
flexible width and height

7934846
width	height
fixed width and height

7934846
width	height
fixed width and height

7934846
portrait	landscape
position the views correctly in portrait mode in ib and everything should resize correctly for landscape mode and preserve the layout

7934853
uilabel	uitextview
i have a fixed-size uilabel and or uitextview and i need to fit variable multiline text in these views

7934854
for-loop	loops
if condition is set to false loops ends without having to break out of the for-loop

7934854
for-loop	loops
an extension of the above reasons methods with access to condition can end loops without going over all other items in the said list or implementing a special check in the for-loop

7934868
firefox	safari
but on the password field you needed to change the input type from text to password which works in browsers like safari or firefox but not ie ie doesn t support the setattribute function very well

7934868
width	height
one that is the correct width height etc

7934868
firefox	safari
works great should work in all browsers although only tested in safari on mac and ie firefox on windows

7934890
profiling	debugging
and i am looking for a simple solution even that would be acceptable if the profiling data was written out to the debugging window

7934902
istream	getline
this istream getline call reads up to the first newline which is the newline that follows jaws

7934907
int	chars
i have the following code in c++ and i would like to convert a int to a const chars in order to write on a file

7934917
uifont	uitextview	uilabel	uifont	uilabel	uitextview
you could use a for-loop that increases the size of the uifont until the size exceeds the uilabel or uitextview

7934925
client-side	server-side
change your server-side method to match the type of data you re passing in from the client-side

7934937
equals	gethashcode
i overwrote equals gethashcode and for the type to be compared

7934964
width	height
the webview is a heavy component and its possible that it has not been fully rendered on the screen before you tried to get its width and height

7934964
width	height
the dimensions of the webview would always equal those of the framelayout as long as it is the only child and both its width and height are set to match_parent

7935025
propertychangelistener	listeners
swing listeners are based on the propertychangelistener interface and that utility class so if you are using it in ui code you ll find it more appropriate

7935028
hash	md5
so if you really need an md5 hash of the original html page and need it to be accurate you will have to request it again from the server it will probably end up coming from the browser cache and calculate your own md5 hash of what you download from that - you can t use innerhtml of the current document

7935064
vsts	tfs
so one of the most important reasons to use tfs as version control system is because it play this central role in vsts allows this traceability and simply does the job

7935079
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this works fine on firefox google-chrome opera but any ie version

7935107
portrait	landscape
if you are not adding your uiactionsheet to a view controller that is handling the orientation for landscape then the uiactionsheet will come up in portrait

7935257
pipe	file-descriptor
you re always suppose to read from file-descriptor 0 and write to file-descriptor 1 with pipe .

7935264
integer	unsigned
boost posix_time ptime and system.datetime are both very lightweight structs which just wrap an unsigned integer so they are good function return values

7935269
qstring	qtablewidgetitem
no matter what the qstring returned from qtablewidgetitem text is an empty string

7935283
rss	feed
what you could do though is secure it with basic authentication and let the users that are suppose to be able to access the rss feed include the username and password in the url

7935292

7935298
implements	extends
i have two classes customerpreferences which extends preferenceactivity implements onsharedpreferencechangelistener and customeractivity which extends activity

7935310
folder	dir
would list the files in the workspace dir in your home folder for you to open

7935324
bottle	flask
if you re looking for small implementations you might get better results with bottle or flask

7935358
try-catch	exception-handling
if it s a common exception-handling there may be even several hundreds of such try-catch blocks in a larger codebase

7935358
pop-up	dialog
now let s assume that we need to introduce pop-up dialog based exception handling instead of console logging or start to additionally send an e-mail to the development team

7935420
debian	linux
i m writing an ipsec implementation for a microcontroller and i want to test it using a standard linux box running debian lenny

7935442

i haven t defined an explicit post function but i am using the get function instead

7935442
post	get
this part handles the post get requests

7935456
button	checkbox
i would normally use a checkbox or radio button for multiple options but i want to use an image to do this

7935457
cells	tablecell
if the tablecell is being reused by the tableview via reuse then it will remain available to be reused when a cells of the same type is needed

7935505
fastcgi	scgi
go for fastcgi or even scgi which is a much simpler protocol to implement than fastcgi if you don t want to use a library or if you have specific needs for such an implementation

7935554
google-chrome	firefox
i have html form for basic user login it works google-chrome firefox even ie8

7935558

inherited	properties
so how does charlie inherited the properties of cat if they are not defined in its prototype

7935618
system.data.oracleclient	odp.net
agreed that using odp.net is better than deprecated system.data.oracleclient

7935692
put	get
the prototype will never get the properties that you put in the object

7935724
division	multiplication
first of all multiplication is faster than division

7935724
division	multiplication
your compiler is usually smart enough to replace division with multiplication on constants if the results is the same but it will not do that with variables of course

7935724
division	multiplication
the first uses two multiplication and one division the second uses one division and one multiplication

7935728
versioning	upgrade
i would suggest to upgrade to maven 3.0.3 and the latest versioning of the assembly plugin first to see if that fixes it

7935739
mp3	wav
if you supply it wav and mp3 then the player will use wav or mp3 via html5 if it can or mp3 via flash as a last resort

7935744
width	height
for the same reason you want to make certain arrays have the size of pitch height where pitch is the width rounded up to the nearest multiple of whatever storage unit you are using

7935744
width	height
check that width and height are compatible with your gpu specifications for thread block size

7935745
primefaces	richfaces
the big mistake richfaces doesn t make that primefaces does make is that

7935776
min	max
the max and min aggregates come to mind

7935797
folder	directory
also if you install to the c program files or c program files x86 directory you will need to adjust the permissions on the tidy folder to allow non-administrator access

7935803
folder	directory
also if you install to the c program files or c program files x86 directory you will need to adjust the permissions on the tidy folder to allow non-administrator access

7935812
width	height
your dev_histogram will have an actual width equal to pitch and height equal to your specified height

7935812
width	height
width and height are the dimensions of your 2d array

7935844
stdout	stderr
will capture stdout and stderr in

7935849
cos	sin
i had to get the x and y coords of the arm based of angle then i got the sin cos of a number that was based of the same angle as the arm and subtraced from that

7935882
button	checkbox
to get around this i used checkbox with the definite argument true or false wrapped up in a button that changes the state

7935908
fpdf	fpdi
just a quick n dirty example using fpdf and the fpdi classes

7935924
disk	ram
to supplement the disk throw lots of ram at it so that the database is stored mostly in memory

7935958
cifs	smb
however i looked at some cifs smb traces i have saved from a few years back

7935972
folder	directory
my goal is to have python write the file under file_name to a file in the address folder in the feed folder in the current directory ie where the python script is saved

7936008
for-loop	loops
whereas indexof is essentially a loops which runs on per character basis which probably means you have 3 loops within your main for-loop ofcourse indexof won t be as slow as a regular loops but still when the input size grows the time increases

7936022
int	chars
checks for non int for the first 3 chars and then only accept int

7936062
folder	directory
commands like os.mkdir don t actually require that you make the folder in your current directory

7936067
getter	setter
by supplying my own getter and setter i can see that both the getter and the setter are used in the process in that order like it was actually

7936133
jax-ws	jax-rs
solution is to use tomee plus which supports jax-ws in addition to some other technologies like jax-rs and jms

7936136
ready	each
i could call recv in each one in this case some calls shall fail or poll the list and later call recv on ready sockets

7936140
getter	setter
so you can either create a custom type that un marshals using an xmladapter or you can be mischievous with your getter setter logic

7936160
xamarin.ios	xamarin.mac
the xamarin.ios xamarin.mac and xamarin.android sdk are going open source

7936197
treeview	expander
i first thought you could modify both treeview and treeviewitem styles by removing all the left margin and make the header the same left margin as the expander button

7936198
hide	show
i have a spinner in my app the dropdown list of spinner have many items and have scroller so when pop the spinner the notification is show and then hide when i choice one item as pic i have read

7936211
tunnel	vpn
as we don t have office-side vpn hardware the simplest and free solution proved to be an ssh tunnel

7936231
getter	setter
as was already mentioned it seems rather odd to have two getter setter pairs for the same private variable

7936261
folder	directory
using the bucket sort via system directory it would be optimized to keep a separate folder for items that have yet to be sorted and sort the whole lot in batches

7936331
int	chars
the used with sscanf basically means to ignore a string any chars up until a whitespace and then after that you re telling it to read in an int d

7936367
codeigniter	cakephp
i am a newbie to drupal and have used cakephp and codeigniter frameworks earlier

7936370
avr	microcontroller
i m using an avr microcontroller to write to a programmable frequency divider chip via the i2c bus

7936372
post	get
this previous post gave an interesting example using union s to get around the 1000 record limit but it only works if each query returns less than 1000 records which at a large company would probably require lots of unions.

7936376
ceil	floor
these work because if x 0.5 floor x + 0.5 floor 1 1 and ceil x - 0.5 ceil 0 0

7936392
implements	extends
and either an abstract class or interface all operands extends implements

7936395
rss	feed
to get it done please see the following article that walks you through the whole process how to create a custom rss feed in wordpress in 12 lines of code

7936405
temp	tmp
- teamcity sets the temp and tmp environment vars to its own temp directory

7936407
pull	push
don t forget to push your update and pull other s back from github

7936415
int	chars
as auscbloke has said you need to read the all of the unwanted chars before the int into a std string

7936462
nscalendar	nsformatter	nsdateformatter	nsformatter	nsdateformatter	nscalendar
however the thread safety summary lists both nscalendar and nsformatter nsdateformatter s superclass as â œthread-unsafeâ saying

7936479
width	height
it s simply an iframe with 100 width and height but my main problem is that the full page ad is shown in a website that has a vertical scrollbar so if the iframe ad also has a scrollbar then two scrollbars are visible and it looks bad

7936498
uicontrol	uibutton
a good example of this is uicontrol s addtarget action forcontrolevents method you usually use when creating uibutton or some other control objects programmatically

7936507
spaces	delimiter
tags being spaces delimiter

7936534
g++	gcc
both g++ and gcc programs are from the same free software project gcc

7936534
g++	gcc
however on ubuntu you have several different packages for them so install the g++-4.6 or the g++ package with gcc-4.6 or gcc one

7936536
width	height
two of which take up full width but not much height

7936671
width	height
if you want to avoid this you should give the boxes with a black border dimensions on the sides not having a border equal to the width of the border so add border none first then add dimensions like if normal height is 20 and border is 5 and you want a border on the right you would set height 30

7936684
webkit	gecko
to be clear i m aiming to use a rendering engine like gecko or webkit with .net

7936702
fgets	feof
i would also loop based on since feof will return a true value after fgets errors and hits eof so your last buffer-full will be printed twice

7936702
fgets	fread
also as others have stated while i took too long to answer fread may be a better alternative since fgets won t necessarily read 10 chars

7936707
post	get
these allow you to define custom paths accept and return types ie text xml multipart etc methods get post etc and be just about has finely grained as you would like

7936777
haskell	scheme
on the other hand higher-level languages like c# or java ruby python perl haskell scheme etc have a more or less substantial underlying runtime support system

7936777
haskell	scheme
it s just a lot lighter weight than the one for ruby or haskell or scheme

7936799
uicontrol	uibutton
however if your accessory view inherits from uicontrol uibutton etc you may set a target and action through the addtarget action forcontrolevents method

7936818
int	double
don t use double to hold int

7936846
width	height
the other part should allow the iframe to use the full width height of the browser

7936860
google-chrome	firefox
this works in internet explorer and firefox however in google-chrome it appears that the max-width is being ignored when width is present

7936860
google-chrome	firefox
which again works in ie and firefox but the max-width is ignored in google-chrome

7936876
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
the longer answer is to derive this view controller from uitabbarcontroller rather than from uiviewcontroller as i suggest in this answer

7936877
pull	push
usually one makes the developers merge in their changes and then push the the release manager pull from the developer s already merged repo

7936879
profiling	instrumentation
you can use the performance counter hardware on your cpu to get profiling data without adding instrumentation to the code itself

7936891
scheme	racket
by the way this code is in racket plt scheme a subset of scheme

7936924
getter	setter
some may only look at public variables in your classes or just call on public methods that look like getter setter

7936945
onresume	onpause
have a static boolean variable in your activity called isrunning that you set false when ever onpause is called and true whenever onresume is called

7936946
post	get
i m trying to get all post messages using restfb my code is as follows

7936953
aggregate-functions	sum
by storing everything as varchar you make it harder to use aggregate-functions sum avg etc. and functions that work with specific data types like sql server s date time functions dateadd datediff etc.

7936986
folder	directory
the final folder structure of the app will be like this bin directory contains the compiled assemblies and in the same level as bin folder have the app_data folder and have the database inside this app_data folder

7936989
google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari
in opera google-chrome ie and safari the first checkbox makes the top row visible or invisible and the second checkbox makes the second row compressed invisible or extended visible

7937002
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
you can apparently install imagemagick graphicsmagick on a machine and dotcloud also has im available

7937011
width	height
fourth - if you want the buttons to have a specific size you could do so by replacing the values wrap_content by xxdp for the width and height

7937014
serializable	deserialization
i m facing an annoying situation where my serializable deserialization isn t as expected

7937014
serializable	deserialization
i m using the in-framework serializable deserialization helpers

7937073
screens	tablet
filtering out tablet by specifying compatible screens sizes makes no sense

7937205
post	get
this also means the user does not need to get and post an entire google maps link

7937208
hide	show
if you know the controls that you d like to appear on the page dynamically then i d approach the problem by including those controls in the xaml and using the visibility property on the controls to show and hide them

7937208
hide	show
you can show hide groups of controls by changing the visibility of their parent control such as stackpanel or custom control

7937215
multiplying	subtract
multiplying this my the denominator and subtract it from the numerator

7937239
post	get
either add a timestamp to your get request or use post instead

7937269
division	multiplication
to be able to easily do multiplication needed also for the division algorithm a reasonable choice for the base with 32-bit integers is 9999 because 9999 9999 is still less than 2 32 and so can be computed directly without overflows

7937298
prepare	execute
but when i execute the package it failed to run showing fail status for steps like prepare for execute pre-execute execute

7937311
inherited	properties
yes you have to re-apply the attribute because the reliabilitycontract has its inherited properties set to false and that means methods in derived classes won t have the attribute applied

7937361
post	get
this is not looking the javascript problem because after submitting the page get refreshed and you are validating on server side so you can use post global vars to return the value or you can ask me with more information

7937377
wav	aiff	mp3	wav	mp3	aiff
aiff mp3 au wav ulaw

drills through the whole directory structure of the folder you want to

7937417
gridview	repeater
i have a repeater and three gridview s inside the repeater

7937417
gridview	repeater
each gridview has different columns than the others since i have a stored procedure and each gridview has different columns based on the value of a hiddenfield inside the repeater

7937418
width	height
if you want to keep the aspect ratio of the image while resizing it you can keep only one of the width or height as constant while other one you need to calculate based on the aspect ratio

7937458
google-chrome	firefox
robbrit s answer is very useful but i find the solution to just be ok for google-chrome and a failure under ie8 and firefox

7937466
ssms	sqlcmd
if sqlcmd mode is an option for your within ssms for example you can do this

7937512
shibboleth	simplesamlphp
if you want to stick with saml you can also look at shibboleth or even simplesamlphp simplesamlphp is a php server that acts as a saml identity provider among other things but you still need a service provider within your applications

7937516
google-chrome	firefox
in ie there is no problem but with google-chrome and firefox the upload fails

7937525
sysml	uml
it is therefore a standard language designed by the same group ho designed mof uml sysml and mda in general

7937542
equals	gethashcode
you need to override gethashcode and equals methods in your customer class

7937557
for-loop	loops
the while loops is equivalent to the for-loop

7937598
g++	gcc
on linux you should compile with both -g to get debugging information produced by the compiler and -wall to get all warnings passed to gcc or g++

7937610
udp	tcp
how should i manually open ports tcp 1554 and udp 2000-2006 for ip 192.168.0.1

7937610
udp	tcp
you have to manually open ports tcp 1554 and udp 2000-2006 for ip 192.168.0.1

7937637
submit	submission
lets say i proceed the submission like this first submit aa

7937638
g++	gcc
order of arguments to the compiler gcc or g++ are really important

7937638
ubuntu	linux
the advices above are not specific to ubuntu 11.10 they could apply to other linux distributions and other ubuntu versions

7937651
stdout	stderr
after some trial and error i ve been able to successfully send a pty-req followed by a shell request i can get the login preamble send commands and receive stdout but i m not exactly sure how to tell the ssh service i want to recieve stderr and status messages

7937656
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome i get no results

7937656
google-chrome	firefox
however if i change the datatype to html i get correct results in firefox and google-chrome and then get no results in ie .

7937664
int	double
rather than using double or bigdecimal i would use int values because this is the type you need at the end of the day and unless your screen has more than 2 billion pixels across or down you don t need long double or bigdecimal

7937679
portrait	landscape
i am trying to create a layout where when in portrait mode the layout_gravity should be center_vertical and when i am in landscape mode it should be top

7937684
portrait	landscape
if the user clicks the button in portrait mode and changes to landscape mode the activity restarts or refreshes again

7937687
ocaml	sml	xlib	xcb	lisp	sml
some implementations of some languages sml common lisp ocaml made that choice of implementing the x11 protocol without using the xlib or xcb c libraries

7937688
onmouseover	mouseout
some of those block elements have onmouseover mouseout events attached to them

7937699
g++	gcc
on the first steps of programming you should not use ide because you will better understand what happens backside gcc or g++ and stdlib will be sufficient

7937699
cvs	svn
you also should read about makefiles svn cvs git autotools or cmake to manage your projects

7937702
g++	gcc
if you are familiar with the command line you can use an editor like vim and gcc g++ to compile your code learning make svn git is also recommend

7937755
for-loop	loops
i would like my while loops to block at most 5 seconds for all threads it creates in the for-loop

7937771
onkeyup	onblur
note it may better to check them on onblur rather than onkeyup

7937786
postgresql	mysql
dummy mysql oracle postgresql postgresql_psycopg2 sqlite3 error was no module named django_mongodb_engine.base

7937809
portrait	landscape
when the activity goes from portrait to landscape the oncreate method is executed again thus creating the button again

7937836
onmouseover	onclick
on the subject of javascript jquery â you shouldn t really use inline event handlers such as onclick onmouseover

7937845
post	get
i will also post some code parts later when i get access to a computer

7937854
rss	feed
this is on the rss feed of my self hostet wordpress-blog within the section

7937859
verilog	vhdl
the xilinx documentation gives example vhdl and verilog that xst can use to infer the more efficient components

7937872
ienumerable	icollection
easiest way if you use c# 4 is to use ienumerable instead of icollection because ienumerable supports contravariance

7937921
rss	feed
for example there could be a module that handles rss feed

7937921
rss	feed
the module could return the content of a rss feed for urls such as example.com channel 1 and the partial content of a rss feed with urls similar to example.com subchannel 2 1

7937970
button	checkbox
name is used for grouping radio button and checkbox when it s the same name their are in a group so checking one will will uncheck the other

7937998
backgrounding	multitasking	hide	show
the reason for this is the double clicking exit button use case that actually does not hide your view or put you in the backgrounding state it just scrolls up a bit to show the multitasking menu at the bottom

7938069
typedef	struct
giving a name to the struct that is being typedef allows the programmer to use either person or struct person

7938069
typedef	struct
so a bit of flexibility not to mention you don t have to change already written code after typedef ing the struct

7938093
try-catch	exception-handling
but the problem is if this is the case the try-catch clause does not catch the exception-handling

7938128
flac	ogg
i want to convert all flac files to ogg in the working directory

7938134
width	height
i want to create a picturescrollfield using some images in blackberry.by default it is displayed on the top of the screen with the given width and height

7938147
serializable	deserialization
i think the problem is due to the serializable and deserialization of the amf body

7938152
instances	transient
transient that will create new instances each time you call resolve

7938206
uiview	subviews
to do this i have created a subviews called searchview which is represented by a uiviewcontroller and use a simple uiview for presentation

7938264
serializable	deserialization
if you do all the processing in a stored procedure and only send the small result this is faster but mainly because all processing stays inside the sql engine so there s no serializable deserialization nor sending back and forth of data

7938283
rubygems	rvm
i run on vagrant with rvm and ruby 1.8.7 rubygems 1.3.7

7938295

7938308
margin	height	width	height	width	margin
this div need to occupy the total height and width of the screen window size with 5 px margin

7938356
width	height
first of all you probably need to set the css elements html and body to a height and width of 100

7938356
width	margin
if you fit a div element with a size equal to the screen and then gives it a 5px margin the width in total will be 100 + 5px

7938373
put	get
i don t get how to put the things together

7938433
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
priorityqueue is not sortedlist or sorteddictionary

7938437
hide	show
by using below function we can show and hide two different inputs

7938438
capitalize	uppercase
just stupid examples but i need to separate words that are full uppercase from words that are only capitalize

7938438
capitalize	uppercase
i could have uppercase words and capitalize words

7938471
width	height
you may add some calculations to the width height for a real scale of your avatar when copying into

7938495
postgresql	mysql
in the latter case you need to send login data through http or any other tcp based protocol and once data is on you application server you can insert it on any database it supports mysql postgresql oracle sqlserver sybase you name it

7938591
hash	md5
i had been trying it out with httpclient with its examples but was not able to find a suitable example that sends both csv file and its md5 hash via http post

7938607
hash	md5
you can send md5 hash using a custom header

7938616
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i would have bet your navigationcontroller is nil because this typically happens when you are using a plain uiviewcontroller not embedded in a uinavigationcontroller but it you actually present your modal view onto the navigationcontroller it may not be nil

post	put	post	get	put	get
we use get post put and occasionally some other requests express handles them really nicely

7941271

in other words leave the function as it is add na.omit and combine it with lapply or whatever form of the apply family sapply tapply lapply suits you best

7941322
typedef	struct
here typedef is used just to create a synonym alias for pointer to struct node

7941322
typedef	struct
using node makes it just shorter anyway i wouldn t advise such typedef as you re hiding that it s a pointer not a struct or other type as mentioned in matteo italia s answer

7941322
typedef	struct
the format you re referring typedef struct type_name format is something else

7941344
serializable	deserialization
ok so i was able to resolve this .net serializable weirdness by tinkering around with both the class markup as well as the actual serializable deserialization code

google-chrome	firefox
you can use crossrider to develop full-on browser extensions that work for ie as well as google-chrome and firefox

7941718
google-chrome	firefox
nss the ssl implementation of firefox and google-chrome apparently correctly follows the x.509 specification and ignores the last certificate in the chain sent by the server and uses its own trusted version of digicert high assurance ev root ca to verify the chain

7941763
viewdidload	viewwillappear
i tried to set the user tracking mode in the viewdidload method and in viewwillappear

integer	unsigned
uint32 is a 32-bit 4-byte unsigned integer

7941907
integer	unsigned
i suppose they are some typedef respectively for a floating point type and an unsigned integer type guaranteed to be 32 bit wide

7941907
unsigned	short
on most platforms they will simply decay to float at least on any machine that uses the ieee 754 standard and on 32 bit machines to unsigned int on some 64 bit platforms it may decay to unsigned short

7941914
button	checkbox
a checkbox that must be ticked before pressing the update button

7941938
inherited	properties
with prototype you can define what properties instances inherited

7942002
uiview	subviews
one option could be to ditch the button and just use the uiview touches to detect when to add the subviews you want to let the user drag.

7942031
post	put
you have to put post into div but you cannot put div into tr or table

7942036
uiview	uipangesturerecognizer
as daniel suggested ditch the button and just use a uiview but i believe you may need to have a uipangesturerecognizer in place to get your dragging

7942039
box-sizing	border-box	width	border-box
input with type button or submit have box-sizing set to border-box setting it to content-box can sometimes fix some width issues

7942042
width	height
that makes the width 100 and height 100 work

7942043

alternatively if you do want to create your own then what you have to do is declare an interface have all your database connections inherited from this interface and store the connection instances in a properties of the interface type

7942085
hex	binary
i think the issue is to do with either padding or the key format binary vs hex etc yet searching though the documentation isn t helping me find an answer

7942146
post	get
do you mean when you check the post you get something like

7942192

i ve seen several post here on the subject and i ve read the w3c spec on border style conflict-resolution and admit i don t fully get it and i m not sure how to achieve what i want

7942222
free	malloc
you have to keep track of every chunk of memory you malloc and free it when you re done using it

7942231
free	malloc
if you don t need the malloc ed space at the end of one iteration anymore you should free it right away

7942237
children	parent
this is roughly what i have been doing.since every children has only one parent then the path from root to one arbitrary node is unique as well.so i wanna set all the other paths as null in case that i could take advantage during recursion

7942260
post	get
i think you ll find what you re looking for here link to b4a forum post you need to get the html to a string first then load it to the web view with webview1.loadhtml s if you still want to

qframe	qwidget
the qwidget is on a qframe

7942268
qframe	qwidget
i d like to put a white border inside the qframe and around the edge of the qwidget

7942268
qframe	qwidget
the closest i ve come is to put short vertical and horizontal spacers around the qwidget but that displays the underlying grey qframe

7942269
width	font-size
the second problem with this solution is that i might want to change the font-size of bla1 bla2 which will automatically change the width of bla1 and distort the position of bla2

7942373
put	get
i have been learning ajax for the best part of 2 hours trying to get my head around how to get this to work it seems it is calling the function as if i put an alert in it all works fine

mpmath	sympy
i don t know anything about nsolve s call syntax but i can tell you why neither sympy nor mpmath can find a real root of the function there aren t any

7942538
stdout	stderr
complete guess work at this point but i believe that similar to logging into a ssh service via a terminal like xterm or putty that stderr and stdout are sent together unless explicitly redirected via something like 2 somefile which is beyond the scope of a ssh service provider

7942582
implements	extends
create a interface at the bottom of your file witch extends all the interfaces you want to implements then create an anonymous class of which implements this

it outputs b in google-chrome firefox opera and even ie

7942654
ireport	subreports
if you can simply get the result from database or javabean and you just want to have a simple show in ireport i recommend you just use the textfild or subreports

7942681
irix	linux
if you need access to the raw link layer raw sockets on most oses don t support that linux and irix being obvious exceptions as per the previous paragraph but libpcap does

7942684
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
this is because mfmailcomposeviewcontroller isn t a subclass of uiviewcontroller but of uinavigationcontroller

7942703
777	tmp
that directory exists. when i run the same code on my local box mac osx 10.5 running zend server community ed i get false which is wrong because tmp exists and has permissions set to 777

7942709

7942954
pull	push
the important difference is that svn is centralized which means that push and commit are effectively done in one step as are pull and checkout

7942973
int	boolean
attributes with boolean and int formats work fine but when i try to specify a reference to an array resource the application crashes at launch

7942982
iboutlet	ibaction
basically i ve built a set of buttons and nstextfields and a custom view into the main xib just dropping them straight off the library into the default window and then of course linking them up with iboutlet and ibaction

7943035
int	boolean
it is bad practise though to assume that the compiler jit will resolve these variables to a known value such as 0 for int or false for boolean so you should always use your first example

7943044
google-chrome	firefox
you can dynamically insert a tag into your document here is a script that will work in firefox google-chrome you may need a bit of tweaking in ie

7943054
fgets	strstr
it s because fgets stores the newline character so when strstr does a comparison it fails

7943066
google-chrome	safari
in all other browsers ie google-chrome safari the parts of the animation are missing basically i used movement and opacity attributes

7943084
stdout	stderr
the objects stdin stdout and stderr are also objects that are setup at program start

7943109
int	boolean
if you re trying to do all that work up front before guessing then you don t really need a map of boolean you need a map of int one per lower-case letter initialized to zero and incremented each time its corresponding letter is guessed

7943125
int	boolean
in this case you re going to require an int as opposed to a boolean

7943137
glut	assimp
i m trying to modify the sample code for loading 3d model included in assimp s sample code by using glut instead of wgl

7943143

udp	tcp
one of the things i d like to do is implement the server in both tcp and udp and allow the client to choose which protocol to use at runtime

7946885
profiling	debugging
anyone know what the problem might be or how to determine debugging what it is without using sql profiling which i do not have atm

7946944
udp	tcp
if you want to know how it is possible in the socket level you should be able to bind your tcp serversocket and udp serversocket in to the same port

7946974
websphere	ibm
10 different xml messages will be enqueued to an ibm websphere mq server

7946988
maven	pom.xml
i added the following dependency to my maven pom.xml file and it seems to have made the class available for use

7946999
rss	feed
the user can enter a simple rss feed into a text field by pressing enter psfeed gets the new feed url

7947026
websphere	ibm
as to scaling i can t speak for websphere mq or other ibm products but 40-50k messages per hour isn t particularly hard for msmq on windows server to handle so i d assume ibm can do that as well

7947042
mouse	keyboard
for now no way to find why auto-submit of the form after selection by mouse or by keyboard and the line don t deliver the value in array

7947082
qhash	qmap
i was wondering for how long the reference to a value inside a qt container especially a qhash or a qmap is valid

7947083
subtraction	addition
you might try simple xor encryption with some addition subtraction of values

7947094
filtering	grouping
actually you technically can with a filtering index sql 08 only but it s still wrong-headed because the isleader bit does not actually designate a relationship and if you accidentally update the groupid but forget about isleader then you ve suddenly just made this person the leader of an entirely different grouping and probably violated the at-most-one constraint

7947094
put	get
that is a better design conceptually but since you ll likely have a cascade from group to person you won t be able to put a two-way cascade on leader as well you ll get the multiple cascade paths error if you try

7947164
superclass	subclassing
for that matter superclass shouldn t call methods defined by subclassing in its ctor because the object hasn t been initialized yet

7947191
udp	tcp
for socket creation use datagramsocket for udp and serversocket for tcp

7947197
superclass	subclassing
the important thing to realize is the way that java loads classes first the superclass is loaded and then the subclassing

7947197
superclass	subclassing
one strategy for example would to embed some of the contract which your subclassing is fulfilling in the superclass using interfaces or inheritance..

7947242
explode	substr
an additional solution than using explode and substr as have been mentioned you can solve it using regex

7947284
scheme	racket
i tried mzscheme from plt scheme 4.2 and racket from both racket 5.1.1 and the development tree all compiled in 64-bit mode.

7947331
x86	64bit
i am running 32bit ubuntu on 64bit x86 processor intel

7947337
pull	push
just add a new commit to the branch used in the pull request and push the branch to github

7947407
post	get
i would assume this post s the data to login but all i can see happening is the details being attached to the url as if it s doing a get request to the page i m on rather than a post to my login page

7947421
mouse	keyboard
a touch based application doesn t really have the concept of focus the way a mouse keyboard based application does

7947447
subtract	add
i want to be able to subtract every field in each record from the current one then add them together and store the results

7947453
hash	salt
above that ensure that you never compare passwords directly rather you compare the hash of the passwords with the inclusion of a salt

7947470
post	get
the file you are post ing too is not called index.php or index.html so the browser finds nothing and again defaults to get

7947485
bazaar	git
you can use bazaar git or mercurial to do so or any other dvcs it s just the major ones

7947496
folder	directory
among the java dictionary info.plist keys expands into the path to the root directory of the application bundle. alternatively consider creating copies of your folder data in or preferences

7947498
int	boolean
basically i m looking for something similar to php oop and with type hinting for all data types in php you can t type-hint int strings floats nor boolean and they are not classes

7947510
google-chrome	firefox
per the following screenshot top is google-chrome firefox as expected and the bottom is ie9

7947520
mp3	ogg
i would really prefer not having to upload one mp3 file for each ogg vorbis file on the server

7947520
mp3	ogg
update i ended up uploading one mp3 for each ogg vorbis on the server because the above clearly does not work

7947548
for-loop	loops
use a background thread such as one provided by a swingworker to run a for-loop going from 1 to 10 with a thread.sleep inside of loops

7947575
versioning	upgrade
i ve often considered just using a cracked versioning as it provides a much simpler upgrade path which basically just involves installing the software

7947585
getter	setter
instead of using synthesize or such you use dynamic and apple takes care of the rest for you - hooking up those properties to getter setter which mimic what you would normally do with a bare nsmanagedobject

7947585
sorting	filtering
all of those things mentioned above could be tacked on to an nsmanagedobject subclass which was created for us by xcode we didn t create by hand - and they all revolve around dealing with the data directly formats conversions etc and or around pulling the data out of core data filtering sorting

7947604
post	get
post to get is often caused by you using a wrong url

7947604
post	get
according to specs this means that get must be issued instead of post

7947619
post	get
that way will take care of converting your data to the proper post or get or ... format and you don t have to worry about the details

7947630
postorder	inorder	preorder	postorder	preorder	inorder
problem k return of methods preorder inorder and postorder

7947681
xslt	xquery
probably xsom makes more sense if you want to do the subsequent processing in java saxon scm makes more sense if you want to do it in xslt or xquery

7947682
qhash	qmap
there is nothing wrong with using references at qmap qhash elements unless you delete the node you are referencing to

7947745
width	height
set width and height values for your control more then 0

7947750
ssl	https
you need the http https wrapper plus php built with ssl support

7947791
maven	pom.xml
using intellij 9 tomcat 6 maven project pom.xml based

7947819
post	get
simulate get and post requests on a url and observe the response -- everything from low-level http result headers and status codes to page content

7947870
asp.net-mvc	openrasta
in asp.net asp.net-mvc the configuration code is written against the routetable class while in openrasta it is done against a resourcespace class

7947871
hash	md5
i tried to use an md5 hash but it seems it s only a one way encryption

7947990
children	parent
now everytime you delete a parent folder all of it s children will be deleted

7947999
opera	google-chrome
this works in opera and google-chrome haven t tested in ie yet .

7948055
width	height
the first 4 numbers are the x y location of the top-left point and the height width of the bounding box

7948073
bmp	png
you need to provide a valid header for the supported formats bmp jpg or png

7948115
multiplying	add
i m looking to add up the columns am midday evening to see which ones contains the value yes and then take that total and multiplying it by the rate for each row for a client

7948115
multiplying	add
when i introduce the rate variable my query starts telling me i need the group_by clause and i don t think i m ready for that since i still need to add the am_total and the midday_total together first and then multiplying that by the rate

7948182
sorcery	clearance
when i try rails g clearance install or rails g sorcery install it fails and responds with

7948183
casting	autoboxing
sure you are casting what you pass into them as an int but java has a habit of autoboxing data

7948196
hide	show
not only use a focus event to show or hide the prompt but also look at the content of the textinput

7948216
folder	directory
i am trying to upload a file into a folder called directory

7948222
post	get
example at the following url you will see that the jsessionid is not a parameter like other post get parameters are

7948222
post	get
i can highly recommend using the firefox firebug together to examine your post request and headers so you get an idea for exactly what is being passed

7948253
getter	setter
also using breakpoints in the getter or setter does not tell you anything the binding engine does not use them they are just for your own convenience

7948261
int	chars	for-loop	loops
edit i know you ve already marked the question as answered but just wanted to suggest you have a function like printrepeatedly chars c int count to reduce the amount of loops that you re repeating it ll just be a for-loop and a print statement

7948276
fancybox	thickbox
off the top of my head i think the problem might be that you are initiating an alert dialogue box rather than a jquery fancybox thickbox type of overlay lightbox which accommodates the speed at which the it animates to open or close

7948276
fancybox	thickbox
so rather than to try and resolve that chunk of codes you have picked out from different sources and since the content that you wish to display is an inline one you might as well consider using thickbox or fancybox instead

7948288
pop-up	dialog
now when you click the edit link a jquery ui dialog pop-up and the edit form for that object is displayed

7948329
post	get
note i m planning to write a ui that uses ajax post or get methods to retrieve the terminal output from backend server

7948373
rss	feed
i would recommend using builder or some other xml generator for rss feed

7948383
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	calloc	malloc
so if you just test if the return is 0 but don t test the arguments to malloc calloc or realloc you might encounter a segfault much later

7948383
memset	malloc
an easy thing to check for return of malloc is to wrap it up with something like memset malloc n 0 1

7948443
width	height
edit i could also render each character and maintain a mapping of character font weight size - width height on the server since i m not dabbling in kerning or other inter-character relationships

7948492
hide	show
there is a checkbox that show hide all liked posts and another that does the same for disliked posts when selected

7948492
google-chrome	firefox
again it all works fine in google-chrome but not in ie and firefox

7948492
post	get
for example if my db already has values for post 1-3 all future decisions by the user to like dislike those post are sent and saved no problem but if i add a new post post4 and the user likes or dislikes it no values get sent.

7948533
freebsd	linux
gnu getopt is installed by default on linux but on mac os x and freebsd it needs to be installed separately

7948534
getter	setter
however this requires that i specify a custom getter setter which calls a custom method for every property

7948534
getter	setter
to avoid the extra typing i have been trying to find a way to override handle the property getter setter in an object and call the custom method instead of the generated getter setter

7948554
spaces	delimiter
scanner.next with the default delimiter is only parsing as far as the first spaces - so str is only the first word of the sentence

7948575
getter	setter
dynamic proxies should intercept calls to methods in form of get_propa and set_propa which are effectively getter and setter where you can add your additional logic

7948616
octal	hex
of course an alternative solution is to replace the single quotes in your regexp with the octal or hex codes 047 or x27 instead

7948631
single-quotes	backslash
you could wrap your string in single-quotes instead escaping the existing single-quotes in the text with a backslash

7948667
keydown	keyup
i have traced the keyup keydown textinput textinputstart and textinputupdate events but they do not seem to be involved in the update of the text in the textbox object

7948715
width	height
the demo also shows a list of properties top left right bottom height and width

7948718
listboxitem	textbox
to get the datavalue of the selected listboxitem into your second textbox you use this code

7948755
post	get
i ve been able to get the post into wordpress with featured images categories tags and comments intact but i m hung up on custom fields

7948789
folder	directory
so i open a terminal and i think i am at what you called the home directory for when i do ls i see folder of desktop application movies music pictures documents and library

7948789
folder	directory
and when i ls a directory of data and nested in it a db folder do exist

7948795
width	height
i have a two column text layout of fixed width and height implemented with stuff text freely flows from one column to another

7948795
google-chrome	firefox
should work at least in latest google-chrome and latest firefox

7948870
ivar	subclassing
subclassing uitableviewcell and add a uislider to it s content view and keep a reference to it with an ivar

7948889
post	get
the issue i have is that when i save it is doing a post redirect get so the action i m saving in isn t the action i am returning a view from

7948889
post	get
i have attempted to use viewdata in the post action but due to the redirect it is across requests so by the time it s at the get the viewdata dictionary is cleared

7948905
trojan	virus
you are likely to have the same or similar code trojan virus duplicated elsewhere on your server even outside of your user account

7948923
super	self
despite super building self .save args kwargs first the building s id was not set

7948940
yacc	bison
i m building a compiler with flex lex and bison yacc and c

7948942
uiview	subviews
uiview for the whole frame with two subviews

7948942
hide	show
hide show the uiimageview as needed

7948961
folder	directory
i am sure that it had something to do with how i did my folder configuration not properly set by me in the res directory

7948961
screens	tablet
thing is that in my case i am dealing with phones and tablet high and low resolutions and in some of them that setting presented an awful screens

7948964
folder	directory
your command will have created the directory structure in the current folder not the root directory of your computer which is what the missing is

7948964
folder	directory
the first command was right but because you are trying to create a folder in which is a protected directory you need to prefix it with sudo which is short for superuser do

7948983
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox the option is not properly selected a css selector won t find it so i can tell that it s not selected

7948983
google-chrome	firefox
here s a fiddle which verifies that i can tell the difference between the two cases in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie

7949002
post	put	post	get	put	get
it is the thing that is currently doing your restful stuff get post put delete via the function as well

7949002
post	put	post	get	put	get
about 30 or so lines of code to map create update delete read to post put delete get in

7949014
getter	setter
all subsequent get set of array items should be done through the getter setter functions for safety

7949014
free	malloc
secondly a hidden nasty makeridmatrix has used malloc to allocate the memory - but it s going to be job of the calling function or its successors explciitly to free the allocated pointer when it s finished with

7949072
clang	llvm
i heartily recommend llvm for statical analysis see also clang static analyzer

7949080
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox 5 and google-chrome 14 the default state of the select is with selecteindex 0 and the first option s selected property true

7949099
post	get
and it s working pretty well except that whenever i hit gem to post a jquery call it just hangs at the loading icon i don t get any feedback in the console as to why the call is not going through and being processed as it should

7949128
portrait	landscape
i have a tabbar application that i would like to keep in portrait mode but when streaming video via uiwebview i would like to add support to rotate to landscape in order to go full screen

7949128
portrait	landscape
the layout of my app does not look too appealing in landscape hence the reason for wanting to stay in portrait mode

7949146
onmouseover	onclick
i have some onclick javascript functions onmouseover javascript functions

7949196
express	node.js
i m using ssh root to a vps ubuntu 10.04 server from linode that has node.js express mongodb etc

7949225
gif	png	tiff	png
also i ve using a middle man format - gif tiff png jpg - with similar results

7949237
versioning	upgrade
either downgrade or upgrade your gcc versioning or modify the package to build with just the gcc command

7949279
client-side	server-side
server-side or client-side controls makes no difference as far as javascript is concerned

7949286
cos	sin
the problem begins at the first step at certain angles the value of the cos or the sin is very close to zero

7949390
dictionary	map
a dummy variable of some sort like you would use in a dictionary or map iteration

7949404
post	get
you can only send ajax with post or get

7949471
cng	kdf
what i need to know is how exactly cng s kdf uses hashes in my case the secret agreement value

7949471
cng	kdf
i m using the sha-256 algorithm as kdf and trying to hash x and y of the secret agreement but result doesn t match to the one cng computes

7949493
clang	llvm
have a look at section 4 of automatic reference counting in the llvm clang documentation

7949501
integer	unsigned
this pretty much always means the maximum value of the unsigned integer type on the platform in question divided by the size of the type of elements to be stored in the container

7949503
margin	height
i don t think that your jquery solution will work because height doesn t take into account margin and padding

7949521
for-loop	loops
note my interpretation of the question is that it is not comparing a standard for-loop with the for..in variant it is just compared the different variable declaration methods with each other for a standard for-loop then doing the same again for a for..in loops

7949526
udp	tcp
i was told that for a high frequency trading hft system that requires low-latency tcp is used over udp

7949526
udp	tcp
i was told that with tcp you can make point to point connections whereas you cannot with udp however from my understanding you can send udp packets to specific ip port

7949526
udp	tcp
there are several arguments used in this article as to why udp tcp for gaming but i can see relevance for hft

7949529
atomic	interlocked
use interlocked lock etc for atomic

7949571
udp	tcp
there is no special difference between a tcp port and a udp port beyond the type of connection being used send the packet and forget it udp style or negotiate a connection and sustain it tcp style and the service listening on the server side

7949571
udp	tcp
tcp 25 would usually reveal a smtp server whereas udp 25 would not

7949573
udp	tcp
there s no reasons to expect a stream of data over an already-established tcp connection would be slower than the same data over udp plus you get checksumming retries and all the other tcp goodness

7949573
udp	tcp
udp mainly wins in cases where you can afford to discard the reliability or where the overhead of many tcp handshakes would be too expensive such as with common dns queries

7949574
disk	ram
also you could edit etc my.ini settings to give mysql more ram to play with since it appears to be writing to disk when building the indexes

7949580
udp	tcp
udp is superior to tcp if you don t need some of the features tcp provides

7949585
udp	tcp
basically modern tcp implementations are going to be just as fast as udp if you re keeping the connection alive

7949585
udp	tcp
if tcp is having to resend a packet you d need to resend it in udp too

7949585
udp	tcp
plus for udp you re going to end up implementing the same reliability code retransmission of dropped packets that tcp has already implemented

7949597
ienumerable	ilist
in your case if you have an ilist and you want to force chunk partitioning you can just make it look like a simple ienumerable instead of writing this

7949658
integer	unsigned
this means in effect that types cannot be demoted to a type with lesser precision by the integer promotions it is possible for uint64_t to be promoted to int or unsigned int but only if the range of the type is at least that of uint64_t

7949684
google-chrome	firefox
i was having the same output as you google-chrome says it was cancelled while firefox does it okay

7949684
google-chrome	firefox
apparently firefox and many others browsers are able to handle this situation correctly but google-chrome designers decided to do it as specified

7949690
post	get
you will probably get some automatic speedups by iterating pre and post directly and avoid doing so in a nested fashion

7949706
lxml	beautifulsoup
the book foundations of python network programming has a detailed comparison of what it looks like to scrape the same web page with beautifulsoup and with the lxml library

7949706
lxml	elementtree
but in general you will find that lxml is faster more effective and has an api which adheres closely to a python standard the elementtree which comes with the python standard library

7949706
lxml	beautifulsoup
see this blog post by the inimitable ian bicking for an idea of why you should be looking at lxml instead of the old-fashioned beautifulsoup library for parsing html

7949721
google-chrome	firefox
for example google-chrome uses webkittransition firefox uses moztransition and msie use mstransition

7949744
inherited	properties
you can handle the button control s click event in fact you can use all events with the following code because metro s hyperlink button only inherited the buttonbase class without any special properties or events such as navigateuri

7949756
qstring	qbytearray
it might be easier and clearer to use qbytearray instead of malloc arrays or qstring qstring are for user displayed strings which is not the case here

7949853
jobs	cron
launch via cron every 60 seconds and poll for new jobs spooled in some readable area

7949853
daemons	launchd	daemons	systemd
launchd as a daemons at systemd startup

7949855
ubuntu	linux
when you launch a new linux instance the public key is placed into the root .ssh authorized_keys file or home ubuntu .ssh authorized_keys for canonical ubuntu amis allowing your private key access to the instance

7949867
profiling	debugging
runing my web application worked well when clicking the profiling project however when i want to debugging again the project the jprofile is still being run when i just want to debugging clicking the debugging button instead of profiling

7949973
width	height
lastly set the expected width and height of the div

7949990
post	get
by attaching the post save signal to the through table itself we were basically able to catch all cases we needed to do post_saving for and being as the ids to the two connected tables for the manytomany relationship existed in the through table this was sufficient to get the job done

7950007
post	get
i thought i would post the code i needed to get this example to work here as the existing question and answer never really settle the issue

7950032
integer	unsigned
iã think the integer promotion should not happen because the type of both of a and b are unsigned int

7950055
integer	unsigned
there should be a compiler warning that you probably ignored or turned off but it s still possible to store -1 in an unsigned integer

7950067
passenger	unicorn
unicorn or passenger

7950117
hide	show
i thunk you can make a uitabbarcontroller then hide the tabbar then when you will switch the view controller then just remove the hidden property..then such problem will not be show i think so...

7950143
associativity	operator-precedence
see the c# language specification operator-precedence and associativity

7950153
prepare	execute
now you just loop through all the rows in csv and prepare query dynamically and execute it for example assuming that column 0 has ids and column 1 has hasweb

7950242
hide	show
i give opportunity to switch between my events and all events through segment control first it show all events location and when user switch to my events it ll delete or hide all events location pins and show my events location pins on same map view

7950281
g++	gcc
another thing to try is to pass the full path and filename for the library as an input file to g++ with no options - gcc will figure out that it s a library file and a lib directory search will not be done for it

7950298
width	text-align
please create individual div for image give a style that text-align center and width 100

7950339
min	max	range	min	range	max
pcolor simply read range of number then apply scale between min and max then apply color scale from blue to red or whatever you choose if you do

7950361
boost	stl
for those that only need 32bit stl s mingw distro has boost included with all the libs already built for it

7950371
width	height	portrait	landscape
by making the width 100 and removing any height attribute the image will scale perfectly to take up the full width whether you re in landscape or portrait orientation

7950385
fast-forward	merge
my workflow idea is for the synchronization to take place automatically since it s basically a fast-forward of sorts and the integration to be half-manual since it requires merge and fixes

7950470
folder	directory
i m having problems with file permissions that is my script is unable to create files and directory in the folder it resides within

7950480
codeigniter	cakephp
for the back-end you can try cakephp codeigniter etc. or just code the back-end from scratch

7950494
put	get
the jquery library uses a approach event listeners for the document ready function are put in a callback list and the functions get called when the ready event is fired

7950495
google-chrome	firefox
you ll get false in older safaris but true in the latest firefox and google-chrome

7950517
sin	sqrt
d 2 asin sqrt sin lat1-lat2 2 2 +

7950517
cos	sin
cos lat1 cos lat2 sin lon1-lon2 2 2

7950579
fadein	fadeout
use instead the completion callback of fadeout and fadein to trigger the effects

7950587
width	height
i am sure you want to have that 5 buttons of equal width height

7950599
getter	setter
where my to class is a simple class with 3 properties acol bcol and ccol and getter and setter

7950614
int	chars
this is only sound if f is guaranteed to be injective otherwise we might legitimately have say f int f chars and then we would be able to conclude int chars which would be bad

7950662
profiling	debugging
debugging should not append the vm parameter for profiling -agentpath to the java command even if the jprofiler integration is installed so this sounds kind of strange

7950664
width	height
i m unable to change width and height of a button

7950674
width	height
instead of it give 100dp to layout_width and 20dp to layout_height and remove the width and height attributes

7950690
getter	setter
all of these pojos have public final fields with no getter or setter

7950710
rss	feed
i am trying to parse rss feed using feedzirra

7950760
int	chars
i.e if we use int and chars then union will allocate space for chars which has the bigger size and the int too ll be stored in the same space overriding the last one

7950771
put	get
when i put username and password in process.startinfo i still get the access denied error

mergesort	timsort	quicksort	mergesort	quicksort	timsort
the java 6 se implementation uses a combination of mergesort and insertionsort which are both deterministic with non-transitive comparators but in java 7 the timsort algorithm gets used and other implementations might use quicksort or something else so you can t be sure that it will work with all implementations

hide	show
do not change set targetsdkversion to a higher version if you are not able to test your app on this android version because i have misunderstood the existing answers regarding this admob topic i have also set the android targetsdkversion attribute of the element to api level 13 in my app which caused a fatal side effect as android 3 thought my app would natively support honeycomb it did no longer show the menu button in the soft button bar at the bottom border and as my app hide the native title bar to show it s own implementation the user did not have any possibility to access the menu any more on honeycomb

accessor	properties
some of the advantages of using accessor specifically synthesized properties in objc are kvo kvc compliance

7952299
equals	gethashcode
i have overriden the equals and gethashcode method becuase in another article it said that when in a collection you need to override the equals to match on the key otherwise when you use selecteditem although all the values would be the same between the item in the collection and the selecteditem they would be two different instances and thus not match with the default implementation of equals

7952343

the script is doing the show hide part correctly for the description but isn t swapping the main image

7952401
pop-up	dialog
however you can make browser to pop-up a dialog window allowing the user to pick the save location

slider	supersized
i just want to add html text to the famous image slider supersized

7953033
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this will work in ie google-chrome safari and firefox

7953063
width	height
just use display as block because you are floating left that way you would have to assign the width so they don t move out of position once the text is added the height will grow automatically min-height does not work on older browsers and will be treated as height which is terrible you have a beautiful css solution to your float left problem it s used on containers to keep the div natural â

7953102
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
so for example sites like google will always show up in english instead of portuguese as it appears in ie firefox google-chrome or opera

7953126

edit it works correctly on firefox but not on google-chrome nor safari on my mac.

7953176

this will work also if the user submits the form using the keyboard the click event is only for the mouse

7953224

extjs	ext.net
i m using ext.net 1.2 extjs 3.4.0

7953282
width	height
taking this and the fact that the layout has fixed width and height into consideration i think the best solution is just making two divs acting as columns as in this fiddle

7953306

i have modified the upgrade code for another versioning so that previous versioning does not gets uninstalled when the newer one is installed

7953467
profiling	debugging
you can check if you have the profiling installed by checking if you have start windows phone performance analysis not start performance analysis in your debugging menu

7953490
children	parent
my typical experience is that for reporting purposes any node in a tree should only have one parent but may have many children

7953490
children	parent
having many parent and many children makes a web rather than a tree

7953747
hex	binary
or you may want to convert the string to actual binary using hex2bin then echo the index of the string possibly converting back to hex for output

7953803

as suggested earlier to make complete link clickable use display block and define width height or padding

7953973
textmate	bbedit
i ve been using bbedit for years but i ve just started using textmate because i find it has better support for ruby on rails than bbedit please don t start a flame-war over this

7954070
uilabel	uibutton
i have a custom uiview with nested views of type uiimageview uilabel and uibutton

7954071
ocean	petrel
this zone behavior in petrel is a concern and subject to change - another reason why ocean does not expose an api

7954079
hide	show
or you could call show hide

7954134
put	get
what you could do is get your tag to put the queryset into a variable in the context and use that variable in the for-loop

7954155
put	get
but the cost is that it s generally harder to get put data into from the database

7954183
serializable	deserialization
i can deal with object serializable deserialization to from a file but don t know where it should be placed or if there s some registry where i can just save a couple of user s settings

7954201

7954207
portrait	landscape
but while i am running am running my camera application the camera preview is shown as landscape instead of the portrait

7954219
profiling	debugging
note about your screenshots the only issue i noticed is the code signing identity in debugging should use debugging provisioning profiling and not distribution one

7954246
folder	directory
the images folder shouldn t be in the classpath - the parent of the images folder should be so that then when the classloader looks for an images directory it will find it under its root

7954326
addslashes	htmlspecialchars
assume you have something like - then you need it htmlspecialchars -escaped and not addslashes etc. -escaped

7954389
post	get
there are other post regarding this but those solutions are not working for me as my form submits to a thickbox popup which requires a get method and certain variables to be passed

7954411
width	height
also the example is designed for images with size 150x113 so if different sizes are being utilized you should change the properties width height itemwidth itemheight accordingly

7954420
firefox	safari
the way i am doing it is to call firefox internet explorer or safari like this

7954520
mouse	keyboard	mouse	trackpad
the problem is that the client is not interested in seeing a mouse cursor on the screen this particular keyboard will have all except a few buttons covered up and will function as a remote control the trackpad is inaccessible so the pointer sits in the middle of the screen uselessly

7954552
implements	extends
instead of inheriting from gwttestcase extends the gwt-test-utils gwttest class and implements your click test with the browser class like shown in the getting starting guide

multiplying	subtract
i have to write a parser for the compiler and i ve already done adding subtract multiplying dividing and the assignment statement

7954599

it s all to do with the order in which subclassing inherited the hello method from superclass and myinterface

7954603
coalesce	isnull
you can then forget all about isnull coalesce three-valued logic etc

7954607
put	get
this will get the file or even a part of it and put it into an element for you to work with

7954632
post	get
to further the answer based on your edited post you can use gettickcount onrequeststart.cfm and onrequestend.cfm to get the run time of the page

7954670
mongoid	activemodel
mongoid uses activemodel so works very similar to activerecord

7954687
pop-up	dialog
if you want the pop-up to be styled as the rest of your website then you could render your error message into a div element and use a jquery dialog to display it as a modal dialog within your page

7954692
cos	sin
however based on your edit you can precompute the sin and cos for a collection of angles you re interested in and store them in a lookup table

7954692
cos	sin
this will be faster than computing the sin and cos for general angles though will require some additional space and there will be an accuracy penalty as well

7954696
post	get
what i am trying to do is to get a list of users sorted by the number of post they have

7954713
versioning	upgrade
of course your free versioning can have fewer features but they don t like it when there are buttons that do nothing but prompt you to upgrade

7954825
memcpy	memmove
memcpy and memmove don t seem to be working as expected

7954825
unsigned	short
so first i needed to add brackets around the statement and second as the non-blocking method didn t work for some reason i am now checking whether the last two bytes that were transmitted translate to a 0 when read a unsigned short

7954856
textview	imageview
additionally in each row of the optionsmenu there have to be three entrys one imageview at the left and two textview on the right

7954856
simpleadapter	listactivity
i ve been searching the whole day and found many things that in combination would solve this thing like dialog i would start a new activity with the layout of a dialog listview listactivity simpleadapter viewbinder and so on

7954861
int	boolean	int	chars
â 6.3.1.1 boolean chars and int

7954883
post	get
you can use get and post at the same time but you shouldn t

7954924
sigkill	sigaction
so my solution is to use sigaction and not use sigkill for my own custom communication

7954927
width	height
as a texture with height 1 and width of my list then refresh the data using glcopytexsubimage2d

7954934
integer	unsigned
if you throw away the top-end bits of a number by the explicit cast to a 16 bit unsigned integer then you re going to have a result that is smaller within the range of 0 and 2 16-1 than before

7954955
serializable	deserialization
i can deal with object serializable deserialization to from a file but don t know where it should be placed

7954966

is there any way that we can put these extension methods in centralized location or some assembly cache where we can easily add using statement and get access to all static methods

7954978
onclick	onmousedown
as far as i can tell the whiteboard doesn t mimic the onmousedown capability and instead all touches are interpreted as onclick s

7954978
onmousedown	onmouseup
i can t think of a way to implement drag-and-drop without using onmouseup and onmousedown nor do i know of any way to make the whiteboard interpret the input differently

7955033
jcomponent	jdialog
create only one jframe as parent and for another top-level containers create only once jdialog put there jpanel as base and re-use that for another action then you only to remove all jcomponent from base jpanel and add there another jpanel

7955039
children	parent
i have a similar question to uncheck parent node if all children unchecked in jquery with this solution and have tried to modify it so that the children will also all uncheck if the parent is unchecked which the above below fails to do

7955039
children	parent
if the parent is checked unchecked its children should be checked unchecked as well as its parent

7955039
children	parent
if the children are checked then its parent and grandparent should be checked if no children are checked then parent shouldn t be checked

7955050
versioning	upgrade
your solution is either to upgrade the mockito versioning

7955069
post	get
of course you can not use get and post methods simultaneously

7955073
int	chars
i can t make it work i already tried itoa atoi strcat summing event.key.keysym.unicode to a int then converting to chars i m new to c thanks

vb.net	vb6
i m porting an application from vb6 to vb.net and have come across something that vb.net doesn t like

7955142
inherited	properties
the problem is white-space properties gets inherited in the spans

7955194
int	boolean
i would certainly take this opportunity to rewrite parts of it so it makes more sense - like having the isfirstcomponent variable converted to a boolean instead of an int and remove all html from your c# code not that you have much in there but the next person working on this code would probably like to know that the html is not being created by some assembly hidden somewhere on your server

7955207
int	boolean
others simply define that boolean values are just int 0 and 1

7955222
free	malloc
dlclose doesn t free memory allocated with malloc

7955243
cos	sin
after reviewing your math make sure you have specified the model-view and projection matrices and note if you are using the standard cos sin functions they take radians not degrees

7955272

this is bad because i need a dialog box to pop-up afterwards that portion of which i have completed but with no way to tell i increments inside of the method for the dialog box i can post it if you guys ned it

7955331
opera	firefox
i struggled with this for a while and i was able to verify that ogg theora work just fine in firefox 7 nightly 10 and opera next

7955331
opera	firefox
opera and firefox are yet to support it

7955339
width	height
also you ll need to handle the situation where the user drags the selection right to left and or bottom to top because that will introduce negative sizes for the width and height of the rectangle

7955352
for-loop	arrays
all i did was look at your code and the first thing i noticed is that it doesn t look like you need that arrays arrays at all or that third for-loop

7955357
getter	setter
side effects in getter and setter is generally not a great idea as it is usually not expected and can lead to tricky bugs

7955365
int	chars
is_signed unsigned chars 1 is true on any normal implementation because the type of is int not unsigned chars

7955401
width	height
if the screen coordinate is either 0 or matches either your width or height then it is touching a screen border

7955494
g++	gcc

7955511
button	checkbox
each class is split into a few dozen different 30 sec to 4 min video lectures and at the end of most of them the screen is paused and there is a user input overlay of the video with checkbox radio button or text fields along with a done button

7955662
min	max
histogramming will be good for dense number sets where you have most of the numbers between min and max and sorting will be good if you have sparse number sets very few of the numbers between min and max are actually used

7955669

7955883
for-loop	loops
there is 1 for-loop and 1 while loops in the method israndom and 1 for-loop in the method diff

7955887
memcpy	realloc
you could strive towards optimising realloc for performance avoid moving the block and the memcpy or you could optimise against memory fragmentation

7955973
pop-up	dialog
a common feature of the application is to show a pop-up dialog window for basic user input

7955990
width	height
you might get better results if you float the a tag and not the image also i would set the a tag to be a block with the same width and height as the image

7956575
sorting	grouping
sorting by brightness is second but still important for smooth transitions between color grouping

7956578
int	chars
although i see the functor actually returns a chars not an int so if the type deduction worked for you here you d be getting back a which cannot be converted to a when you assign the result to transformed

7956603
accessor	properties
you can declare the set and get accessor in the traditional way as objective c methods although it is definitely best practice to use properties declarations for things that are logically properties

7956603
getter	setter
there s no reason why your getter and setter can t calculate values

7956603
accessor	ivar
given the above the major difference between and obj.ivar is that the former modifies the ivar directly and latter invokes an accessor this means that the latter can do any memory management stuff needed retains releases copies etc and can also invoke key value observing

7956614
textblock	itemscontrol
so all your lines would be drawn on the bottom itemscontrol while all the textblock would be drawn on the top itemscontrol

for-loop	loops
create the rects based upon ivar integer values and put it in a for-loop which increments the xpos ivar each time round loops

7956891
integer	unsigned
4 uintptr_t is an unsigned integer at least as big as an to safely allow integer math on pointers

7956919
bmp	png
you have to understand the headers of both bmp and png files

7956919
bmp	png
after you successfully create the header you can copy data but data is not stored in the same form in bmp and png so it is quite time consuming task

getter	setter
though java does not to my knowledge have such a feature defined several java coding environments such as eclipse produce automatic getter and setter under certain circumstances

7957030
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
the code is simply a for-loop that loops over your uiimage arrays allocated a uiimageview for each image and sets the x-origin based on the index position of the uiimage in the arrays

7957063
width	height
if the height is the smallest attribut of the image i want that to be 140 pixels or vice versa on the width

7957067
entities	entitymanager
doctrine stores a reference of the retrieved entities in the entitymanager so it can return an entity by it s id without performing another query

7957079
bmp	png
i would assume since it lets you perform various transformations on images that those images are kept in memory so you should be able to just load it as bmp and eventually save it as png

the first thing that i looked into was having a view with a select for each distinct database all union together

7957201
serializable	deserialization
while it s possible to override the modelform used by your modeladmin docs in this case i would consider using a custom field type and building in the encryption decryption into the database serializable deserialization

7957213
httpconnection	downloading
this could be a troyan downloading it definitly opens a httpconnection downloading files and executes them

7957214

so for example a job shop scheduling problem might be represented as list of permutation which represent the execution order of the jobs on the different machines so called job sequence matrix

7957543
crossover	mutation
for all those still simple types crossover and mutation operators exist

7957543
crossover	mutation
in that light you also want to avoid having to repair a large part of your chromosomes after crossover since that is also introducing unwanted mutation

7957569
min	max
django annotations is great for average min max etc

7957575

7957668
children	parent
all of your related tables should have declarative ri which means that you can t delete a parent while it still has children

7957668
children	parent
when they accidentally try to delete the wrong parent and it not only deletes that parent but 20 children in 5 other tables that s bad

7957668
children	parent
if a developer is coding a delete for the parent then they should know that they have to use the delete stored procedure to take care of children

7957672
unsigned	short
you should not use any sort of bulk copy routine for this nor should you use typecasting to get a pointer to unsigned short because none of those options take byte order into account

7957672
integer	unsigned
the correct way to extract a two-byte unsigned integer from a buffer is with one of these functions

7957686

getter	setter
no if you re certain of your scope and don t need anything that expects normal java properties getter setter then it s likely not a big deal

7959180
getter	setter
yes if some of that behavior may change like you need to abstract a calculation affecting x or y without affecting calling code or you re using something that expects getter and or setter

7959185
prepare	execute
if you first prepare a query that contains a placeholder for id and repeatedly execute it for various values of id performance should be adequate

7959190
getter	setter
on the other hand for fields that you don t need or want to expose to the user because they might only be relevant in an internal context then you should mark the fields private and only provide getter and or setter if you really need want to

your site is probably in a virtual directory so the refers to the actual web root as iis or whatever web server sees it - maybe the folder above your root folder

7960245

here s an example tested on safari google-chrome

7961458
width	height
if you re generating html at the end you will have difficulty using x y coordinates for image positioning unless you also use x y width height positioning for all text areas in the final document

7961458

if you do go with the coordinates system you could build a jquery ui to allow users to drag drop resize layers divs and enter text in them then upload it to the server as a list of layers x y width height content

7961471
post	get
the redirecttoaction is important so i leave the user on a get page rather than a post page to avoid that annoying repost dialogue that comes up

7961613
int	double
first your qlist is of int and the documentation points out that the type in the sequence should match the first parameter of the map function where you have a double

7961613
int	double
so the qlist needs to change to double -or- your map function needs to take an int

7961626
children	parent
the problem is that this jtree drawing operation takes very long time to complete adding 1000+ children defaultmutabletreenodes for the selected parent node

7961663

7962213
free	malloc
you call malloc with an argument stating the amount of memory you want instead of sending alloc to the class which knows how much memory is needed and use free instead of release to relinquish the memory

7962231
free	malloc
since you called malloc you must eventually relinquish the memory occupied by the array by calling free in your -dealloc method

7962260
post	put
i put the tweetbox from anywhere application to every of my post

7962268
free	malloc
objects created on the heap with malloc will persist until it s free

don t forget to free the malloc ed memory when done

7962287
jena	dotnetrdf
several of the popular semweb apis jena sesame and dotnetrdf all provide fully streaming apis for rdf files so you can write a custom data handler that will only take the uris produced and throw away the rest of the stuff you aren t interested in

7962410
mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave
it would be much better to use the mouseenter mouseleave methods rather than the mouseover mouseout methods which tend to cause a rapid blinking effect during the time your mouse is hovering

7962410
mouseleave	mouseenter
then you can simply combine the mouseenter and mouseleave handlers into one by using the jquery .hover method

7962410
mouseleave	mouseenter
to prevent the animation queue from stacking up and creating a new issue where it comes on off because of the mouseleave delay use a jquery .stop true false on the mouseenter function like this.

7962410
mouseleave	mouseenter
upon mouseenter it stops any mouseleave animation immediately

7962920
portrait	landscape
then the zoom in out works in both portrait and landscape mode

7962959
hide	show
so a workaround may be to use css to hide the original tab before initialization using display none and then add animation to show the generated tab using the tabs create event

7962965
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the following javascript works in google-chrome firefox and safari but for whatever reason it is not working in ie 7+

inherited	properties
in the above example more_food inherited from food in other words food is the prototype of more_food this prototypical reference is stored in an internal properties called

7962976

the correct way to access a private variable from another class is with getter and setter methods

7963234
client-side	server-side
your data is fetched out from the server-side to client-side as in a jtable successfully.for saving the fetched data you have to read the cell data of table and save that data into a text file format in a particular directory

i know there is a way to specify the width and height for the popup but i would rather have the option to be on the top z-index 2000 or something like that

7963359
margin	height	width	height	width	margin
if you don t want it to occupy entire space you can set margin on it or use grid control with as row column width height a gridrow with height 0.5 will occupy only half of avaliable space

for example if your application provides bitmap drawables only for the baseline medium screens density mdpi then the system scales them up when on a high-density screens and scales them down when on a low-density screens

7963606

7968481
min	max
on both runs the same series of inputs for min max x y and type were provided in the same order

7968503
web.py	cherrypy
as i mentioned here we use cherrypy the web server built into web.py behind nginx to serve most of the html at oyster.com -- nginx splits the traffic across 2 or 3 web servers each running 4 python processes and we can easily handle 100s of requests per second

7968535
ant	maven
i agree with previous answers but i would also recommend to use proper java build tool - like ant perceived easier to use but not necessary or maven perceived more difficult to use but really worth learning

7968598
children	parent
both the product parent and the ingredients children are saved and linked to each other

7968611
multiplying	add	multiplying	addition
two absolutely unnecessary multiplying add operations in addition to the already steep performance penalty by its nature

hide	show
you can wrap all the input elements except the radiobuttons in two different divs so you can catch the change event for the radio buttons and show and hide two divs accordingly

7968615
children	parent
delete children inline on the parent s form

7968615
children	parent
add children inline on the parent s form

i don t think you need to show or hide the elements necessarily as the form elements seem to be the same on both forms consider

7968726
udp	tcp
udp packets are not guaranteed to reach their destination whereas tcp is

7968733

you can either add a class to represent which elements are uk address elements and which are eu or as ã lodie petit answered wrap them in a div and then either show or hide them depending on which radion button was selected

7968777
width	height
then on some browsers it will have a width and height of 0px and be unclickable

7968874
vbscript	jscript
i learnt jscript only for writing these macros and now that it cant access web pages i am thinking of giving vbscript a try

7968892
google-chrome	firefox
things work great in firefox google-chrome safari...but alas not in ie8

7968926
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox but the same statement give s error in google-chrome with something like type error non_object_property_load

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
httpfox says it s a 500 error which would indicate an internal error but this exact call works from both google-chrome and safari in their extensions so i m suspecting the error to be related to firefox specifically

7969295
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this renders correctly in ie safari google-chrome but not in firefox

7969319
pop-up	dialog

7969866

hash	salt
this approach really isn t useful unless you are encrypting your passwords with a symmetric key instead of a 1 way hash which will have it s own issues that way the salt value doesn t need to be stored and can be generated on the fly otherwise it is equally susceptible to replay attacks just harder to read

unsigned	short
i have a system which deals with keys that have been turned into unsigned long integers by packing short sequences into byte strings

7973784
children	parent
the obvious one is to first fetch a list of all parent and then run a separate query for the children of each parent in a loop

7973784
children	parent
the order by clause is there to ensure that the children of each parent are sorted together

7973784
children	parent
if you don t actually want to show all the parent and children in the table but just say those belonging to a single family then you should still try to do the filtering in sql to avoid fetching too many records

7973798

7974121
decoder	encoder
you can find a url encoder decoder here

7974157
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller

7974157
iboutlet	ibaction
the xib s file owner proxy should be set to your uiviewcontroller subclass which allows you to bridge the gap between the interface elements on the xib and the code inside your uiviewcontroller subclass through the use of iboutlet and ibaction properties of your subclass

jtextfield	jlabel
you would want to assign this value to some gui component such as a jtextfield or jlabel by using the settext string text method on said component

7974282
mouse	keyboard
the browser certainly uses at least one native os thread process to handle the actual interface to the os to retrieve system events mouse keyboard timers network events etc...

7974305
children	parent
finally the all-mysql solution would be to prepare a stored procedure that purposefully constructs the data structure you re looking for 1 row per family having the parent s full name as the first column and children s full names as subsequent columns empty fields if the person does not have children like emmit herring

7974358
post	put

7974735
apache	nginx
i have nginx installed with apache as a reversed proxy to handle php

7974735
apache	nginx
apache s design is thread per client while nginx uses the reactor pattern meaning - nginx can handle much more traffic than apache as a web server about 50 times the number of requests

7974735
apache	nginx
the drawback is that nginx doesn t handle the php requests and for that the apache is installed too - nginx will send all the php calls to the apache so it will handle them and return the response back to nginx and back to the client

7974735
apache	nginx
if in that setup which is quite common you will put css js files under javascript you will lose the advantage of the nginx which instead of handling the static js css files on its own it will send them to the apache as it ll address them as php pages

7974758
sorting	grouping
grouping and sorting optional

7974762

7975072
post	get
i will post an example tailored just to show one i get the same error for all of them

7975136
folder	directory
the nsdocumentdirectory will not be cleared on app updates but be careful using this folder since ios 5 now uses this folder for backing up in icloud and your app will likely be rejected if you use this directory to store anything other then user generated content

7975143
translation	transliteration
the issue here is that an automatic translation from sql to linq will often have to perform more transliteration than translation - generating examples of how not to write linq queries

int	double
i think you ve got it since the data types are double rather than int or int the resulting x and y may not be precisely equal

7975241
setcontentview	findviewbyid
method 1 should give a force close error as you are using findviewbyid before setcontentview

7975241
setcontentview	findviewbyid
findviewbyid tries to find the view inside the layout you specified in setcontentview

7975246
width	height
you may want to calculate it based on the middle of the player rather than their top-left corner in which case just add half the player s width to their x position and half their height to their y position

7975270
client-side	server-side
could somebody explain the difference between server-side scripting and client-side scripting to me

7975306
inherited	base-class
first create a base-class to force views to inherited from that like below and override some methods

7975328
client-side	server-side
this could actually mean a couple of different things but the explanation that is probably most relevant to you based on your mention of triggers is that server-side scripting is sql that is precompiled and stored in the database in the form of triggers functions stored procedures views etc while client-side sql also known as dynamic sql is sql that is contained within the application

7975332

hide	show
the javascript here is relatively simple but it s harder to manage your data and you re limited to the granularity of one full kml file - you can t show hide individual placemarks

7975753

you can then use the references to these objects to support your show hide controls

7975838
width	height
i needed to assign the width height variables after creating the popover but before initialising it

7975890
keydown	keyup
there are three keyboard events you can trap keyup keydown and keypress

7975890
keydown	keyup
as explained in the jquery doco admittedly it is kind of buried the keyup and keydown events give a keycode that corresponds to the actual physical key on the keyboard so uppercase a and lowercase a will have the same code as will 2 and - but note that the 2 key above the w has a different code to the 2 key on the numeric keypad

7975899

by the by this problem only started occuring after i switched to pygobject 3.0 from pygtk 2.24

this works for me in google-chrome safari firefox and opera

7976492
post	get
http post behaves different than get

7976492
post	get
the reason for using post instead of get is that get parameters have a size limit in some browsers whereas you can have parameters of almost any length when submitted via a post

7976492
post	get
depending on what backend server technology is being used the server may treat get parameters and post parameters the same and therefore your backend service will handle either one fine

7976492
post	get
however in a lot of cases you have to specifically code your backend service to accept parameters via get post

7976495

7981743
int	chars
i remember when java changed from throwing an exception to replacing the chars with the replacement chars int 65533

7981760
post	put
you can only send files via put and in this case they re send more efficiently then with post because you no longer have all the multi-part overhead but in order for you put listening server side component to actually receive a file via put you have to make sure that you actually send a put command to it via javascript for instance

google-chrome	firefox
the code below makes the video tag work in ie9 google-chrome and firefox

7982278
submit	submission
one way would be to use an asynchronous messaging pattern so instead of submission a request and waiting on a response you would submit a request and continue on and have either a callback contract or an external-facing service contract that your service can connect back to a callback contract is the best option when you re dealing with a typical client-server scenario

7982278

bionic	libc
i replaced it by the bionic libc which is a light weight subset version of linux libc for android

7982398
for-loop	arrays
first of all for-loop checks if the value of current argument is within boundaries of argv argc is the length of arrays so last position in arrays argv is argc-1

7982401
mouseup	mousedown
you would check if the mousedown event originated from an htmlbuttonelement or from any of its child elements and if it did you set up a mouseup listener on the button so it does not have to bubble too much that will check the target property of the mouseup event

7982486
jerkson	jackson
aside from trying to make jerkson which is a great library to use from what i have heard you could also try jackson s scala module -- modules are the official way jackson is extended to deal with 3rd party datatypes as well as native datatypes and constructs of other jvm languages

7982486
jerkson	jackson
this is not to say this is more official than jerkson just that there are many useful jackson extension modules that many developers are not familiar with

7982503
google-chrome	firefox
it was indeed security related which works if the external css is in the same directory for firefox but does not work for google-chrome

inherited	properties
i created an extended datagrid class inherited from datagrid with additional properties autoscroll to control if i want the grid to scroll automatically or not

7982550
implements	extends
you might be able to work around this problem by implements one of the extensibility points of wcf which are explained in greater detail in the msdn article extends wcf with custom behaviors probably either idispatchmessageinspector or idispatchoperationselector but the request may not even make it that far since the message really isn t a valid soap request to begin with

maven	pom.xml
i have a httpservlet in my project and my problem is the following if i use maven to deal with the javax.servlet package dependency compilation is fine but when i launch tomcat via the tomcat eclipse plugin a jar is loaded with tomcat even though its scope is set to provided in my pom.xml

7982553

post	get
case is sensitive while dealing with get post variables

7982729
range	minimum
these are the dates that correspond to the minimum and maximum values for a 32-bit signed integer. additionally not all platforms support negative timestamps therefore your date range may be limited to no earlier than the unix epoch

7982743
post	get
the html specifications technically define the difference between get and post so that former means that form data is to be encoded by a browser into a url while the latter means that the form data is to appear within a message body.

7982756
min	max
i have tried right clicking on the bubble in design view clicking series properties and going through all these but cannot see the min max options

google-chrome	firefox
the chrome.manifest file tells firefox where to look for an extension s google-chrome files

google-chrome	firefox
the jar scheme is how you tell firefox that your google-chrome files are packed where the jar is located and then where to find the files in the jar

7982886
google-chrome	firefox
this tells firefox that greasemonkey has a content directory in a jar located at google-chrome greasemonkey.jar path relative to the location of the manifest in a top-level directory named content

7983087
entities	entitymanager
working with entities and the entitymanager is simple

7983096
uitapgesturerecognizer	uigesturerecognizer
nothing s changed with touchesbegan etc as far as i m aware but a smart way forward might be to check whether uitapgesturerecognizer is available it is as of ios 3.2 and if so attach one of those to your eaglview and use its locationinview inherited from uigesturerecognizer when an event fires

7983112
uipangesturerecognizer	uipinchgesturerecognizer
if you need the annotation to move more smoothly you can add a uipangesturerecognizer and uipinchgesturerecognizer to the map view and also update the annotation in the gesture handler

7983151
post	put	post	get	put	get
the body.read method works properly only if the request body was processed which happens only when request.process_request_body is true it is by default and when the request method is in request.method_with_bodies which is only put and post by default but not get which you probably used when requesting the page with a browser

7983167
mdpi	hdpi
one ldpi one mdpi and one hdpi

7983167

cassini	iis
if you website is running on iis express or cassini then you don t have a choice

pull	push
when you re ready to make changes public push everything up to your private fork on github and then use pull requests to selectively copy branches to the public repo

your best bet is to show hide them with pure css js

7983491
src	attr
xml .find img attr src

7983507

if i put in the specified format above i get a blank page

7983509

7983532
jboss	glassfish
the reason i ask the second question is that it doesn t make sense for application server e.g glassfish tomcat jboss machine on which the oci client is installed settings to override the database server settings

7983548
versioning	upgrade
historically the main issue with upgrading has been 3rd party library dependencies besides rails - they often break when rails is updated and then you have to either fix them rewrite them yourself switch to another one that works on the new rails versioning or just wait to upgrade until they are compatible all which may be undesirable

7983579
curlpp	libcurl
then compile the following code with g++-mp-4.4 installed by macport linking to libcurl and curlpp

width	margin
- returns the width of the element along with left and right padding border and optionally margin in pixels

7983591
width	margin
.outerwidth true - returns the width of the element along with left and right padding border and margin in pixels

7983591
subtract	add
assuming your element is also 580 pixels .outerwidth true will add or subtract margins add border and add padding to the element itself so you are not going to get 580 unless margins padding and border are all zero

7983595
post	get
the best solution i could find is to first do a fql query on the stream table to get the post ids

7983595
post	get
and then simply get all the post at once

7983602
rsa	aes
but aes and rsa are two very different algorithms which are not normally used for the same kind of problem

7983602
rsa	aes
you would typically use rsa in a handshake to negociate a secret aes key and use aes to encrypt the rest of the conversation

7984131
junit	testng
it can be used within junit and testng

7984149
put	get
if you can execute the script by passing an inputstream or a string to the interpreter put in the src folder so it ends up on the classpath and use getclass .getclassloader .getresourceasstream script-name to get an inputstream

7984155
haskell	agda
yes smart constructors or agda are the way to go here but if you really wanted to go crazy with the dependent approach in haskell

7984198
google-chrome	firefox
they look fine in google-chrome and firefox but ie9 seems to have them taking up extra space and they flow over onto the next row

7984215
gridview	sqldatasource
for your scenario you could possibly use a sqldatasource to feed the data to a gridview and just enable support for paging sorting

7984221
charindex	substr
you can combine charindex and substr functions

7984244
nsstring	nsdata
the answer to this is i can t just read the nsdata token into the nsstring with utf8 encoding and expect it to display the token

7984383

7984442
google-chrome	firefox
oddly caused the first letter to transform at google-chrome 14 and firefox 3.6.23

7984457
min	max
windowstyle.toolwindow is the only one that includes the close button and not the min max buttons but because it changes the appearance of the close button you may prefer windowstyle.none and just define your own window chrome and buttons

7984485
quicksort	heapsort
if you have only three numbers - 1 2 3 it is far better to sort them with counting sort than a quicksort heapsort or whatever which are o nlogn

7984567
hive	hdfs
now the first thing you will do is you will store on hdfs and then you create a hive table on top of it

7984609
atomikos	bitronix
we are evaluating a jta transaction manager for a legacy oracle jdbc project and have looked at bitronix and atomikos so far

7984609

the java.sql.datasource implementations of both the bitronix and atomikos connection pools are making heavy use of dynamic proxy objects for the jdbc interface instances they return

7984630
cpu	affinity
for example in the absence of any explicit cpu affinity you may restart execution on a different core or cache lines may have been refreshed

7984681
folder	directory
however it does not offer any class hiding selective exporting or versioning of third party libraries the ones that sit in the lib directory of your webapp folder so the treatment for these is the same as for a standard java app

7984690
ceil	sqrt
the a and b values are integer values so actual code is more like ceil sqrt float a b

7984706
jobs	cron
cron jobs are defined within etc spool crond crontab root or something similar to that cant remember the exact path right now but using tabstop will do the job for you

7984743
mouse	keyboard
you can hook a mouse or keyboard with jna here s an example

7984766
int	double
since ceil always produces an int value albeit represented as a double we will always have some value x for which the first produces x.0 and the second x.1

7984766
ceil	sqrt
therefore before ceil n +0.1 could overflow the a b being used as an input in sqrt a b would have to have overflowed already

7984788
oncreate	ondestroy
now on your main form not any other forms you need to put an event handler for both oncreate and ondestroy

7984835
svnkit	subclipse
so i installed subclipse again 1.6 using svnkit 1.3.5 and it seems to recognize all my repository settings

7984835
svnkit	subclipse
i also tried subclipse 1.8 but it seems to only use the hl version of subversion and i m on a mac and would prefer the pure java svnkit option

7984859
submit	submission
the issue with the form submission is that if they tap whitespace we get the name of the submit button posted along with the desired url - we use the acceptparameterattribute to allow us to route form submit to the right action

7984935
jline	readline
either of these are useful in general and you ll be happy to learn to use them but specifically they use readline or jline automatically where available

7984940
put	get
how can i get the data and put it into a 2d array

7984991
integer	unsigned
your variable i is an integer while the size member function of vector which returns an allocator size_type is most likely returning a size_t which is almost always implemented as an unsigned int of some size

7985008
integer	unsigned
the warning is obviously because you are comparing signed integer with unsigned integer

7985031
hide	show
i need a way to read the blob field to see if its a blank and then show hide my label based on its contents

7985045
pull	push

7986096
for-loop	arrays
so to print out the contents of the arrays you will almost always will need to iterate through it using a for-loop or use the arrays class static tostring method like you did in your first snippet which pretty much does the same thing for you

7986235
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome tend to automatically close any missing close tags on html elements but ie will not

your only lock contention there will be on the per-database maps for the duration of a put and a get and according to your report there won t be much of that

7986262
multiplying	multiplication
karatsuba multiplication is only going to beat long multiplication for numbers that are huge relative to the machine register size and you really want each primitive multiplying to be doing as much work as possible

7986308
int	double
but apparently when you initially declare your x and y s you can declare them as double or float and when it comes to actually drawing the image you have to cast them to int

7986346
int	double
note that you should draw using int but do all your calculation using double

then you can plot a heatmap of mortgage burdens for the u.s. and evolve this heatmap over different time scales

7986651
inherited	properties
but you can create a class entryclass that inherited qobject and add id and name as qt properties internally entryclass can use the data of the corresponding entry struct instances by using a pointer to it

7986655
width	height
first you pretty much need the fill_parent width even if you don t do height

7986778
addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	division	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction
you would typically store the numbers as arrays of digits and as a first step implement addition subtraction multiplication and division using the on-paper algorithms you learnt in school

7986794
actionscript	mxml
note that this technique adds some overhead because your viewnavigator skin is now mxml instead of pure actionscript

7986810
width	margin
because the width of the content area is 100 then you have to add margin border padding.

7987275
sse	avx
the exception is with the sse avx registers

7987291
int	chars
change your struct to use chars instead of int especially since you are using a pointer to assign the value

7987310
google-chrome	firefox
it works great with firefox and google-chrome and also with ie 9 when also browser mode changes it seems compatible with ie7 through ie9

7987347
textmate	sublimetext
if you want applications like textmate or sublimetext to use a different version of ruby you can update their individual configuration settings to set the path to the ruby binary you wish to use

7987382
jruby	mri
and it sounds strange but jruby scales very well and it s faster than mri with java 7

7987429
width	height
edit or you could use wx.getdisplaysize to get the width and height of the window subtract 200 from the height and use that to set the size of the listbox

7987430
folder	directory
when i look at the target directory i have folder named like aotbuildoutput5264907783565294361.tmp with files in them

i tested in firefox 7 and google-chrome 15 and saw that the code block in the if statement is only fired once when enter is pressed

7987527
mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave
the problem i have a live handler for mouseenter mouseleave which works as expected if i don t have any other handlers but breaks down when i add another live handler for mouseout on another element

7987527
mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave
however adding the mouseout event causes the original live handler that is supposed to fire only on mouseenter mouseleave to instead fire on mouseenter mouseout

7987529
rspec	capybara
i m still on rails 2.3.x and using rspec capybara and steak to do some acceptance testing

7987550
hide	show
i would like to supply controls for the user to be able to show hide the various layers interactively

7987555
int	double
because it creates a temporary int where the double is converted and mutable references cannot bind to temporaries whereas const ones can. that doesn t make sense to me

7987578
mvp	presenter
while some may argue that mvp model view presenter may be based on this approach i don t like the fact that the controller cannot exist without a gui object being instantiated

7987580
addition	multiplication
assuming your bignum class already has multiplication and addition it s fairly simple

7987580
division	modulo
converting the other way is the same concept but requires division and modulo

i m trying to get page data using curl and sending variables via post

7987587
move	drag
when i drag an item and move it across to another box it throws me error

cobertura	jenkins
if you are using hudson jenkins remove all checks from the pom.xml and install the cobertura plugin to hudson and configure the checks in the hudson jenkins plugin

7987670
multiplying	add
the simplest not the most efficient way to do this is to write two functions one to multiplying a large number by an int and one to add an int to a large number

7987672
for-loop	arrays
after the for-loop i initiate an arrays and assign it to the pointer

7987689
capistrano	bundler
if i understand your question capistrano is a bundler aware way to do deployment

7987704
width	height
you can replace the hard-coded width and height by binding them to parent s width and height

7987704
width	height
i feel that you will need your own value-converters for assigning special width ad height actualwidth - shadowdepth kind of stuff shadowdepth being 5 pixels here

7987705
mp3	wav
convert from wav to mp3

7987732
swt	swing

7987734
mouse	keyboard	qtableview	qtablewidget	qtableview	qabstractitemview	qtablewidget	qabstractitemview
there doesn t appear to be anything as concise as the qtablewidget s currentcellchanged but qtableview does inherit a few things from qabstractitemview that you may be able to use together specifically the clicked entered pressed signals for mouse input and the keypressevent for keyboard input

7987766
children	parent
when you ask for parent you don t load children when lazy loading is on

7987766
children	parent
when it is off whenever you load parent you load all of it s children

7987766
children	parent
then when you serialize parent you will not try to serialize children that have reference to parent creating circular reference

7987792
mouse	keyboard

note you should pass a cgsize parameter in to the constrainedtosize part that is a larger height than what you intend it to be but the correct maximum width of the label

7987980
children	parent
i want parent be on a specific div children on an another div and list them

7988001
post	get
as long as you keep certain security principles in mind you can use both get and post even together

for both get and post it s always important to never trust the input and escape and filter and attempt to prevent csrf and other attacks

7988014
hide	show
i am using jquery ui tabs and working pretty well and now i want to hide and show tabs with a click of button as show below

7988014
hide	show
on each tab i have a button and when i click it it should hide the present tab and the rest tabs and should show me the next tab. ie..if i am on tab-1 and if i click button it should show me the tab-2 and should hide 1 3 and 4 tabs and similarly for 2 3 4 tabs

7988024
ubuntu	linux
i am on ubuntu linux

7988025
openexr	tga	bmp	tga	bmp	png	png	tga
the ideal way would be to use a image file format with alpha channel support png tga openexr â and not using bmps actually the bmp file format would allow for a 4th channel and in fact i once wrote my own bmp loader with alpha channel support and a photoshop export plugin many years ago

7988074

i had to implements getcolumnclass in my class that extends defaulttablemodel

7988090

client-side	server-side
i did this to determine if the problem was server-side or client-side and so far it s pointing more towards the client-side

7988204
superclass	subclassing
i had a solution in a php 5.2 codebase that used reflection to get at the constants of a subclassing from a superclass but i d advise against doing that unless it s absolutely necessary because reflection is q relatively expensive tool in php in terms of performance

7988244
folder	directory
it s faster to the operating system reach the file when you have 100 folder with 100 files inside i see a lot of improvement when i split one directory that had more than 20.000 files inside

you could use tax_query parameters to get the post by post_format

7988275
google-chrome	safari
i heard solutions like comet as described in this article are not used anymore and instead websocket is the future for this kind of features but it s only supported in google-chrome and safari

7988291
fadein	hide
when one clicks on a certain link i want to hide the all divs within the section element and fadein only the div#one

7988291
slideup	slidedown
once the div#one is visible when someone clicks on a span element it should take the div#one and slideup and grab div#two and slidedown

7988291
slideup	slidedown
if it is visible the the same span element should now take div#two and slideup and grab div#three and slidedown

7988292
for-loop	arrays
to overcome this problem just add one more element to the arrays say 100 so the for-loop to terminate after processing the decades

7988321
superclass	subclassing
perhaps a point i need to make is that it is fine to cast an object as its superclass if you are not going to call any subclassing specific methods on it

7988362
google-chrome	firefox
edit .xpi package for firefox .crx package for google-chrome

7988364

the getter and setter of the jobfilenames property are referencing themselves causing an infinite loop

7988462
google-chrome	firefox
everything runs pretty fast thought not as fast as google-chrome in firefox

the problem is that slidedown and slideup animate the height not the position

7989008

folder	directory
essentially they give you a single virtual directory which contains a single active bin folder for your dlls

7989394
folder	directory
one way that we got around the issue is to reconstruct the exact same folder structure starting from the root of the virtual directory on the production server within your visual studio project

7989441
maven	m2e	maven-antrun-plugin	m2e
this should provide you with the most flexible base of writing the code and will also work with m2e though you need to run the maven generate-sources yourself as maven-antrun-plugin won t run automatically as there is no connector for it yet

it is impossible to get a full list of post from the feed home graph api but you can use fql to query the stream table to get almost every post made by friends here is a quick example of how you would do that with the javascript sdk

7989450
post	get
this will get you the post ids which you can then use with graph api to fetch the rest of the post info

skip-lists	tree
for this reason i thought about using a skip-lists compared to a tree the iterator should be faster

7989658
arraylist	treeset
after some micro-benchmarking running iteration multiple times on different-sized treeset linkedlist concurrentskiplist and arraylist shows that there s quite an overhead

7989659

it s also completely acceptable to do as you are suggesting and require the user to send the token as part of the get post put delete request as you would with a standard page

7989680
jobs	cron
i am looking into cron jobs and windows scheduled tasks as well

7989680
min	max
we are talking about changing adding removing from 1 min to 160 lines max in the tables at a time

7989690
skip-lists	tree
in a single thread world is different you can use a sorted set a binary tree or your custom data structure that would perform better than concurrent skip-lists

7989690
skip-lists	tree
the complexity in iterating a tree list or a skip-lists will be always o n but if you instead use a linked list or an array list you have the problem with insertion to insert an item in the right position sorted linked list the complexity of insertion will be o n instead of o log n for a binary tree or for a skip-lists

7989690
treemap	treeset
there is also the treeset class that probably is what you need but since it is just a wrapper to treemap the direct use of treemap would be faster

i believe there is a way to post to a php file some information so if i could get an array of all the checked people and pass that to the php file where it will then do they mysql queries that would be great

7989999
post	get
the method get post head etc you re trying to use on that url is not supported by the app

7990013
stdout	stderr
also note this is only one problem with your code there are potentially and most likely a lot more problems however you should be able to narrow them down with gdb using the backtrace bt command and printing to stderr as opposed to stdout so that your output is not buffered

7990022
innodb	myisam
a very basic run-down of my decision-making is table-lock myisam row-lock innodb

7990048
xlwt	xlutils
if what you mean is after you ve already saved the workbook you want to read it again to get the max widths and then save it again with new column widths this will be much slower and will involve using both xlwt and xlrd and possibly xlutils as well

7990053

youtube	vimeo
alternatively youtube and vimeo have provided access to a html5 friendly embed using an iframe

7990173
setinterval	settimeout
you probably want settimeout rather than setinterval because setinterval will run your opacityto function every 100ms forever while settimeout will run opacityto exactly once after the 100ms delay

7990173
setinterval	settimeout
when you call setinterval or settimeout it does not pause execution of the current block of code

7990204

iframe	prettyphoto
you can tweak the prettyphoto js code but that will effect all your popups so as you found the workaround of the close function inside the iframe then that s it you didn t have to duplicate themes and hide the close button on the its stylesheet you could have simply let jquery do so from withing the iframe just include this code into your iframe

7999830
post	put
if you read this blog post it sounds like it was pulled out of 1.6.3 and perhaps will be put back in 1.7 and the main reason it was pulled is because it broke some things people were incorrectly using the animation queue for though perhaps that is a matter of opinion

8000104
moq	moles
again i d usually do this with moq and used mystub.verify for this purpose so it s possible that there s a slicker way to do this with moles that i m not aware of

8000104
moq	moles
personally i think moles is much better suited for mocking the unmockable and i prefer a combination of moq for my own interfaces and classes and moq for framework and externalities like file i o gui db connections etc

postgresql	mysql
i am used to mysql so you may need to adjust the syntax slightly for postgresql

8001698
postgresql	mysql
probably this would work in postgresql as well as in mysql

8001716
hash	md5
however a very simple method is to use a md5 hash with a private key

8001716
hash	md5
if you know the users name on the website login you can provide that key in an md5 hash set to a javascript variable

8001763
int	double
note the problem goes both ways when i keep the denominators and numerators separate for most of the calculation i struggle with int overflow when i do most calculations on the fly using double arithmetic i m met with the various problems limits that really small double values have as defined by ieee 754

8001785
bufferedreader	fileinputstream
new bufferedreader new inputstreamreader new bufferedinputstream fileinputstream 2048

8001887
button	checkbox
this script adds a checkbox to the final screen of the installer and allows an exe script to be run when the finish button is clicked

8001898
profiling	instrumentation
so i took instrumentation s time profiling and dug into the depth of my app only to find out that every time the app hung it actually was in the process of opening png files for uiimageviews just like you found out as well

8001899
vim	emacs
for java development eclipse has lots of features which you ll miss from emacs or vim

8001906
width	height
when you resize a uiview the width height increases to the right bottom direction

8001910
spaces	delimiter
so you should be able to simply supply the classes in a string delimiter by spaces

8001913
uiview	calayer
to animate properties of the calayer you must use core animation classes and methods not uiview s

8001946
codeigniter	cakephp
i am new to cakephp as a framework however am very familiar with codeigniter zend etc

8001984
implements	extends
so to make a type of library class that implements ihero extends a display object like sprite or movieclip and then use the implements keyword to indicate the class implements ihero

8002041
width	height
i have tried setting div height and using width 100 but nothing seems to work

8002059
children	parent
when i want to display all of the children for the parent model i can do

8002067
put	get
get out the words that are the most comonly used let s say drop your rate up to xx trial and error here put this words in your database and give them a weight of 0

8002111
migrate	upgrade
this application was actually upgrade from a biztalk 2006 r2 project and the parties were migrate over using the party migration tool included with biztalk 2010

8002188
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
this occurs in firefox 7.0.1 safari 5.1.1 google-chrome 11.0.696.68 and opera 10.53 on a mac snow leopard

8002202
decoder	encoder
unfortunately none of the java encoder decoder classes seemed to solve my problem

8002204
getter	setter
a better approach i think will be just to gather all data you will ever need either in your bean as an instance variable with a setter getter method or passed as a parameter when you fill your report

8002235
division	multiplication
division by a constant can usually be optimized into a wide multiplication followed by a shift

8002237
opera	google-chrome
in opera and google-chrome it works as i expected and prints

8002308
post	get
for example i want to get post from this category tag

8002354
macbook	isight
i am trying to create an opencv application on my macbook with built-in isight camera

8002393
getter	setter
the attr_reader and attr_writer class macro methods define getter and setter methods for instance variables

8002415
post	get
doing it this way the browser will show the show_result.php page a get request instead of the page requested with post

8002440
many-to-many	one-to-many
if you had a separate joining table used for many-to-many you would need to resort to trickery to enforce the one-to-many relationship

8002442
udp	tcp
the idea is that requests come in via the network though i ve not decided if tcp or udp would be best yet and are passed immediately to a high-speed load balancer

8002442
cpu	affinity
each queue corresponds to a thread whose affinity is set to one cpu core on the server

8002442
udp	tcp
it d be very useful to have the proof of delivery that tcp offers but the lightweight nature of udp is appealing too

8002473
put	get
i put the onclick code in the oncreate of the main.layout but i get a nullpointer at line 101 which is chkbox.setonclicklistener new view.onclicklistener

8002515
post	get
according to http standard you ought to make browser to do a get request after sending post one

8002553
dbcontext	objectcontext
the datacontext objectcontext or dbcontext in ef is nothing else than an implementation of the unit of work uow repository pattern

8002566
width	height
say you want to increase it s width and height by 10 in the opposite direction

8002603
int	double
i presume that the reason for this is something to do with casting the left hand side to a double in the same way that it happens for int double comparisons and calculations but here the left and right sides do not interact in this way

8002615
realloc	malloc
i m using malloc rather than new because i want to use realloc in the function that resizes the array

8002663
equals	compareto
if you look at the documentation for compareto you ll notice that it s intended to return -1 b goes before a 0 a and b are equals or 1 b goes after a

8002684
int	chars
if one of the operands is of type t where t is byte short or chars and the other operand is a constant expression of type int whose value is representable in type t then - the type of the conditional expression is t

8002684
int	chars
chars and the other operand is a constant expression of type int whose value is representable in type chars then the type of the conditional expression is chars

8002684
int	double
that s exactly what happens here - the parameter types are converted to int and double respectively the second operand the third in the original expression is then of type double so the overall result type is double

8002741
pop-up	dialog
currently if you do not correctly enter the form questions a dialog box pop-up with a message indicating you didn t fill in the field correctly

8002749
put	get
i put the onclick code in the oncreate of the main.layout but i get a nullpointer at line 101 which is chkbox.setonclicklistener new view.onclicklistener

8002781
nsstring	nsdata
you can do this by creating an nsdata from the nsstring using whatever encoding its was originally created with you need to know this much at least or it won t work and then you can create a new nsstring from the same data using utf-8

8002793
udp	tcp
basically i want the phone to communicate with a server sending it tcp udp packets and i want the server to reply to the phone an answer depending on the packet received

8002811
width	height
perhaps setting the width and height to zero might have the same effect.

8002816
post	get
if you do then whatever that element s value was would have been posted and retrievable using assuming the request method was post and not get

8002817
put	get
a put your for in loop in a child process and get the result in your main app once it s over

8002852
range	max
multiplying it by your num or max range gets you a value with a max of that number 1 num

8002904
richtextbox	textblock
chrisf offers the richtextbox as a solution but its less well known that simple font variation is acheivable with the simple textblock -

8002930
uilabel	uibutton
sounds like you really don t need the complexity and weight of cocos 2d and could very well do with just nstimers uilabel uiimageviews and uibutton and if you need finer control you can use coregraphics it has simple methods for text and images and system timing apis as nstimer accuracy can be an issue

8002940
getter	setter
it is better to keep the field private and only expose the getter and setter

8002940
getter	setter
one advantage is that you can choose different access levels for the getter and setter whereas a field has only a single access level

8002940
getter	setter
even better is to avoid getter and setter where possible

8002940
getter	setter
this is because objects shouldn t be tampering with other objects internal state either via directly accessing fields or indirectly via getter and setter

8002960
width	height
i have 2 html elements that sit in the exact same position same x y values same width height

8002963
vb6	vba
perhaps one of the important traits of cryptosys is that it supports several development languages platforms not just vb6 and vba

8002985
put	get
however in ios 5.0 you will need to put up with the fact that it may get purged in low disk space situations

8002992
getter	setter
private properties with getter and possibly setter are considered proper style since declaring them public and using them directly harms the principle of encapsulation

8002992
getter	setter
besides getter setter allow you to add logic to the process of accessing and mutating

8002992
getter	setter
then again in many cases like most javabeans usage the getter setter do nothing more than what you d do with direct access

8002997
children	parent
but leave the other children under that parent untouched

8003019
children	parent
this way all p children in your parent won t show but the specific #item3 will

8003055
getter	setter
i typically end up writing my own helper method so that my properties can have single-line getter and setter

8003055
caliburn.micro	prism	viewmodel	caliburn.micro
the implementation of my setproperty method will vary depending on whether i m using a framework like prism or caliburn.micro whether any of my viewmodel need to do extra custom work when a property changes etc

8003061
hide	show
if you hide parent item then child items can not be show

8003061
hide	show
why dont you hide unwanted child items and show just those which to want show

8003077
width	text-align
the style seems useless because it only contains another div with a width of 100 that itself has got text-align center too to center the logo

8003094
viewmodel	caliburn
i know to use basic caliburn micro i m still fairly new to it so i haven t covered all of the less-frequent areas so i basically would benefit just from the snippets on each area viewmodel view and model that would pertain to the image control

8003131
put	get
a labor intensive but pretty foolproof way to figure this out is to put a shit-load of nslog statements so you can trace what get s called when

8003137
mouseover	mouseout
i didn t write the mouseout function yet as the mouseover doesn t function correctly

8003187
packets	multicast
it is designed to receive udp packets for multiple ips multicast groups at a specific port

8003188
google-chrome	firefox
the site works flawlessly in google-chrome firefox however in ie some ui does not function

8003222
width	height
however on debugging it appears to me that the preview might be failing because it seemed like the width and height dimensions were round the wrong way but its not just a case of switching them around as i think the orientation also plays a part

8003227
nsmutablestring	nsstring
it could be that some system routine that returns an nsstring used to return an nsmutablestring but no longer does

8003227
nsmutablestring	nsstring
at some point it might have been casted from an nsstring to an nsmutablestring

8003232
versioning	upgrade
language incentives aside if your codebase is too dated it will be very difficult to upgrade to the latest versioning

8003235
int	boolean	int	chars
classes override it notably boolean chars int long float

8003283
writetofile	nsdata	nsstring	nsdata
as per the documentation writetofile only works if your array s contents are limited to a handful of types nsstring nsdata nsarray or nsdictionary objects

8003308
nunit	mstest
the problem with traditional nunit or mstest is that the test will be held up for hours waiting for the result

8003325
base	fractions
if a significant fractions of your user base real or expected mdash

8003340
codeigniter	pyrocms
so ion_auth is a very good replacement because it s now maintened as part of codeigniter based pyrocms

8003350
innodb	myisam
you would also want to go with innodb as opposed to myisam to avoid table level locks during writes

8003354
int	double
i am trying to create an array of int double or strings depending on what the user inputs

8003361
mouseover	mouseout
first i bind the same mouseover and mouseout event on both #right and #left

8003377
google-chrome	firefox
if you want to add more than one event handler per element view the breakdown of functions for both internet explorer and more standards-compliant browsers such as firefox and google-chrome at wikipedia

8003421
versioning	upgrade
i ve been trying for months to upgrade devise to the latest versioning but the major stumbling block seems to be a change introduced in 1.2.0 so i m focusing on upgrading to 1.2.0 right now

8003429
inherited	properties
if yearlyschedule and the other stuff are derived entities from the base entity schedulinginformation and you have separate tables for base and derived properties you are forced to use table-per-type inherited mapping which is known to be slow

8003528
g++	gcc
to build it on linux using gcc use the command g++ -pthread filename.c++ -o filename

8003530
screens	tablet
i have a winforms application that is being used on tablet pc s with touch screens

8003569
hide	show
i want to show hide the new link action of the admin generator list depending of some db condition

8003661
google-chrome	firefox
tested in ie and firefox as well as google-chrome

8003674
hide	show
you should just use findviewbyid r.id.progressbar1 .setvisibility view.gone to hide or view.visible to show

8003682
imperative	declarative
ryan s example is a change from imperative steps to declarative

8003683
superclass	subclassing
this is possible because php let protected members be accessed in both directions from base to subclassing but from subclassing to superclass as well

8003690
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
the way that qgraphicsscene and qgraphicsview interact is that you can have a single scene with at least one or more views

8003690
qgraphicsview	qrect
when you are jumping between coordinate systems of your scene and view with your qrect s or qpoint s use the helper functions maptoscene and mapfromscene from qgraphicsview

8003765
width	height
ajaxupload then creates an iframe using document.createelement and gives it zero width and height so it ll be invisible before adding it to the document

8003771
invokerequired	begininvoke
the norm is to using invokerequired and begininvoke the following pattern

8003780
nginx	lighttpd	apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd
the same code was working fine on lighttpd and apache recently i switched to nginx and the app started crashing when i run it locally

8003782
post	get
when visiting the site paypal visits with get or post values which your page should then report back to the site and verify

8003801
width	margin
i know that the div is being targeted correctly in the css because the other properties such as width and margin are working correctly

8003833
ant	maven
even many ant build scripts follow maven in this

8003836
postgresql	mysql
i ve decided to switch from mysql to postgresql recently mostly just to learn a new db

8003850
google-chrome	firefox
i was wondering if this is just browser javascript engine slowness happens in both google-chrome and firefox and on my xampp localhost as well as at pjax.heroku.com where too frequent click events and ajax calls confuse the browser resulting in it ignoring already loaded javascript jquery

8003888
post	get
before you live prices.html page will be good to store transfer post get input price in hidden textfield in new page and than read hidden textfield with jquery

8003894
pascal	delphi
note that loading up and calling c++ code from delphi apps is not hard and that c++ builder and delphi are basically two flavors of the same thing since c++ builder is really just a way to write your app in c++ while using a delphi pascal ui framework the vcl underneath

8003975
post	put
the problem is that when a put post or delete method is done instead of sending only fields from the model in the json payload fields from ext.data.nodeinterface are also sent

8003990
width	height
i m trying to get a site that is simply 100 of the possible width height of a device after scrolling down far enough to get rid of the address bar

8003990
width	height
simply 320x400 320 width 400 might height - title bar - footer

8004039
rss	feed
in one of my own apps where i download a bunch of data from an rss feed and present it to the user i store the data in the user defaults because it is part of the app s persistent state the next time it appears

8004097
width	height
and then you dont need the exact width height of the viewport the div will already use the maximum possible space

8004153
google-chrome	safari
also please note that the above code will only work for webkit based browsers google-chrome safari

8004182
uilabel	uitextview
i have a uitextview in which it has a place holder text in it however when i tried to type in something to the uitextview it moved my uilabel text to the right a bit

operands	scalar
if either operands of scalar

8004302
put	get
if i don t put value for these values then i get security exception

8004306
int	chars
chars is sort of like a 16-bit int

8004374
vmware	virtualbox
this is an .iso file so you d need something like vmware or virtualbox to run it

8004374
bluetooth	usb
plug in your usb bluetooth dongle

8004383
outputstream	inputstream
i hate writing the inputstream outputstream copy code and i see it all over the place

8004406
qgraphicsview	qwidget
a qgraphicsview has a bit more going on than most qwidget subclasses and i m not familiar enough with it to say what is going on for sure but i might venture a guess that your problem is related to the fact that the scene is actually rendered onto the view port widget

8004415
min	max
i implemented the jqueryui slider and want to display the min max slider values in 2 different divs

8004443
draggable	droppable
i want to limit a droppable to only take 1 draggable at a time

8004443
draggable	droppable
example i have 3 draggable boxes and 2 droppable target boxes

8004530
draggable	droppable
since the draggable element is not physically moved to the droppable area after drop it s quite hard to determinate it s existence in the droppable area

8004550
post	get
edit i am getting this page as a result of post operation from another page .there is not get action with same name in the controller

8004607
postgresql	mysql
sorry i m new to postgresql switched from mysql due to its horrible performance so i have a question regarding psql replication

8004619
capistrano	rvm
i believe capistrano doesn t use a login shell so the line in .bash_profile that loads rvm is never executed

8004659
vpn	lan
your internal lan has the same network numbers as your vpn s lan 192.1.168.xxx for both networks and the stack can t route correctly while the vpn is on

8004668
plot	heatmap
however there is a very efficient way to visually scan all of your variables simply plot their distributions as an image heatmap

8004679
google-chrome	firefox
the following function works perfectly for me with google-chrome and firefox while it fails with internet explorer

8004707
portrait	landscape
it scales correctly when loaded in portrait mode and also when rotated to landscape

8004734
int	double
a double uses 8 bytes and an int uses 4 bytes on the parcel

8004736
jobs	cron
you can check the cron jobs in cpanel

8004746
google-chrome	firefox
the best for you will be to use google-chrome dev tools or firebug on firefox and see in the console the results

8004778
filtering	grouping
any grouping or filtering that can be done while the services are grouping one way can also be done with the services grouping the other way

8004784

8004971
innodb	myisam
put another way let s say i start with a new innodb table and insert 20 gb of data assuming that 20 gb incorporates all the excess innodb stuff i realize data stored in innodb is larger than myisam then i delete all data then i insert 10 gb of data

8004981
width	height
so that when the window size gets larger or smaller the child items should stretch according to a certain width height ratio

8004981
width	height
when the child items get added or removed from the itemscontrol s itemssource the wrappanel should place linebreaks among items appropriately to keep child item s width height ratio

8004989
hide	show
my problem is i want to hide only one item value from my db that show on this dropdown

8005063
int	chars
i m not quite sure if this is what you want but you can assign int values directly to chars types like so

8005066
int	boolean
if you want a 0 or a 1 then an int or boolean might be a better variable type to assign to

8005084
rss	feed
i m reading a rss feed and i get an image url and now i want to store this image in my folder

8005110
put	get
so you will get the expected results if you put execute your writeline statement in the operator.operate method

8005110
ienumerable	ilist
i think the implicit cast from ilist myobject to ienumerable idated creates a temporary variable that is only in scope for the duration of the method call

8005136
express	node.js
fyi i m using node.js express so i will probably end up using

8005195
fadein	fadeout
all they look like they are doing is on click they simply use fadeout 250 and then fadein 250 of a div

8005195
fadein	fadeout
there are plugins for this sure but for the fading it s just fadein and fadeout

8005198
fink	homebrew	fink	macports	macports	homebrew
i would install from macports fink or homebrew or compile from source myself to a different location like usr local

8005268
public	protected
finally there are also other keywords that might be used with fields like transient volatile and the access levels public protected private

8005296
google-chrome	firefox
above code which works only in firefox google-chrome not in ie browser

8005296
google-chrome	firefox
this above code works only in firefox not in google-chrome and ie

8005330
hash	salt
secure hash and salt for php passwords top answer

8005331
put	get
that is fine .however if i put a value in of say 285292746 i get an output of 2.85292746e8 when i marshal

8005354
hash	salt
and i think this so article is more than enough secure hash and salt for php passwords

8005414
listview	gridview
when gridview have great rows count listview overlaps bottom stackpanel

8005443
fadein	fadeout
jquery stop fadein during fadeout

8005443

8005447
google-chrome	safari
i have found the code for safari and google-chrome but it is not compatible in other browsers

8005457
postgresql	mysql
if you have a aoutvalue id in any sql server postgresql mysql ms sql ... and do a delete from it only removes the table content not the counter

8005497
nofollow	noindex
the sure fire way of having the page not show up in the serp is to remove the disallow admin command and allow googlebot to crawl the page and see the noindex nofollow meta tag

8005497
nofollow	noindex
the noindex command will remove the page from the serps and the nofollow will help inform googlebot not to give priority to the links that it finds on your login page this will help maintain your crawl efficiency but does not guarantee google won t crawl the links it finds on the page

8005540
hash	salt
the length of the salt does you no good as it s a known constant in the hash input

8005601
post	get
if you look at github they have a very slick ajax experience but as you navigate through the folders of a repo it makes post requests to get the additional xhr information

8005610
folder	directory
here is an example of the directory permissions in the shared folder

8005619
portrait	landscape
but i want to show two pages when device is in landscape mode currently app shows only one page in both portrait and landscape modes

8005742
put	get
and if you put a break point in the code and go to disassembly you ll see that although the second line looks complicated it is not complicated at all you can t get any faster

8005798
ant	maven
you could replicate this into an ant or maven script but you then lose any backwards compatibility you have to future upgrades

8005798
cvs	svn
i would suggest either ensuring the relevant play framework files are included so that the build can be done or doing the war build on a central build server and distributing or load from cvs svn git the war file to target machine s

8005827
thin	unicorn
you could try to run it with lightweight app server like thin or unicorn

8005925
rspec	capybara
using capybara instead of rspec is a better solution for request intergration tests

8005925
rspec	capybara
i use rspec for unit testing and capybara for integration testing

8006008
profiling	instrumentation
it would be a good idea to instrumentation or profiling your code to find out where most of the time is going

8006009
google-chrome	safari
if i do the same thing in google-chrome or safari i will see

8006018
children	parent
the same issue applies for your mdi parent and children

8006068
getter	setter
when you find yourself writing a class that is no more than a collection of attributes no invariant whatsoever then instead of getting all oo on us and writing a getter setter pair for each of them consider making them public instead

8006118
post	get
when click a image form the gallery of image i need load to another page along with setting the _session issueid something like this i know by send it through url get method but i don t want the user to know this issueid not even by post method

8006162
post	get
in addition to this table i would cache the running total of likes in the post record so you don t have to join to the child table and sum all the likes every time you display something that can get costly quick

8006216

move	drag
i ve seen the examples where you can pick click a single shape and drag it but i haven t been able to find an easy way to select and move multiple shapes

int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

8014077
button	checkbox
while this may be tempting for form features in which a custom text value is secondary to a radio button or checkbox the click-focus functionality of the label element will immediately throw focus to the element whose id is explicitly defined in its for attribute making it nearly impossible for the user to click into the contained text field to enter a value

8014129
width	margin
if you want to center it you need to give the div a width and then you can apply the margin auto

8014152
icriteria	fluent
it can be done in sql but then that does fit in with the fluent code the isqlquery doesn t return an icriteria object

using jquery would i set a height with an aspect ration of 16 9 so if the width is 560 the height should be 315px

8014482
opensuse	linux
the machine has the opensuse v11.3 version of linux installed

8014510

hash	salt
i m no expert on where to get good random salt on windows but you can always concatenate or xor things like system time memory usage etc and hash that with sha-2

from weblogo image you can see that i need to change the height of character without changing its width

8017573
margin	height
one more thing since you are using padding on div.links and you wanted a height 100 at the same time i think you have to do some margin offset to get your desire result

8017605
teamcity	nant
if you are not using tfs look for continuous integration tools like nant or teamcity

8017608
int	double
you promise a double via f but provide an int the type of the literal 7 so it s undefined behaviour

8017609
int	double
you re telling printf that you re passing it a double because of the f format specifier but you re actually passing it an int

8017611
int	double
you re passing a float which turns into a double so printf is expecting 8 bytes on the stack but you pass an int which is 4 bytes

8017726

division	modulo
is modulo it gives the remainder to the integer division this remainder is only 0 where the division is exact

8017780
equals	gethashcode
as you have stated though were you to override equals it is best practice to override gethashcode for hashtables

8017782
division	modulo
use the modulo to check the remainder after division

8017784
equals	tostring
unless you implement equals to simply test if the tostring of two objects are equals which would most likely be a mistake

8017806
serializable	deserialization

disk	ram
and one consequence that we with 20-20 hindsight can say is not so nice is that the translation scheme allows virtual memory to simulate ram by using disk space

8018509

well it s because if there isn t a typedef that s the only way to refer to the struct

8020349
typedef	struct
make a typedef like typedef struct thing thing_t

8020360
typedef	struct
typedef was added to the language to allow the creation of shorter names which didn t included the struct however the full struct syntax is used - and specifically is used in historical context where the original definition of a system structure is defined as struct without a corresponding typedef short form

8020360
typedef	struct
as comparison c++ which is a much later language allows a class struct to be referred to by just the class struct name regardless of whether it was defined with a typedef

sip and rtp traffic is going through the proxy machine currently but i changed the proxy implementation such that instead of routing the media or rtp traffic through asterisk proxy automatically forwards it to the other client

8020399
typedef	struct
many modern c libraries are systematically typedef -ing their struct and use some naming convention

8020419

as you push uiviewcontroller on to a uinavigationcontroller the view of the uiviewcontroller which have been pushed onto may be unloaded to save memory as they are invisible

8020654
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
you should have iboutlets to uiviewcontroller not uinavigationcontroller so that they can be released on viewdidunload

prepare	pdostatement	prepare	execute
if the query contains parameters then prefer using pdo prepare and pdostatement execute instead of pdo query

8020932
min	max	range	min	range	max
you could use inputquery from qdialogs unit which has an overloaded version with min and max parameters for limiting the range of integer input

8020935
google-chrome	firefox
when inspecting the output in the browser google-chrome 15 firefox 7 with firebug the ul element seems to have height 0 and the li elements are displayed outside of it

8021206
innodb	myisam
innodb is much much stricter than myisam

8021212
implements	extends
you have to extends defaulttablecellrenderer instead of implements tablecellrenderer

8021213
innodb	myisam
generally innodb is much better for preserving your data integrity so stick with it and do not go back to myisam there is also a matter of what each engine is best fore but unless you give us more details there is no point in dwelling on that

8021220
google-chrome	firefox
this actually crashes my browsers latest stable firefox and google-chrome upon hitting enter

width	height
you have the a and b from the width and height of the cgpoint minus the width and height of the center

8021395
getter	setter
you do not need to avoid internal getter and setter unless they are causing specific performance problems

8021395
getter	setter
you can usually determine this by using traceview and seeing lots of time spent in the getter and setter

8021395
getter	setter
so for example in a tight loop over a large data set trying to avoid getter and setter is probably worthwhile

8021395
getter	setter
outside of scenarios like that using getter and setter is unlikely to cause any material pain to you or the user

8021396
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
causes jquery to use getelementbyid which obviously return a single element whereas will do something like getelementsbytagname and then using loop find only those which has id as names

8021410
config	ini
according to netbeans manual you have to add the xdebug config file to the apache php ini directory and not the local php ini directory to make it work with anykind of wamp

8021452
stdout	fflush
you should usually end not start the outputted string with newline because on stdout a newline may fflush buffers

8021452
stdout	fflush
or you should call fflush stdout

8021477
nunit	mstest
i ve selected mstest as the test runner because i can t be bothered with invoking nunit i d like to use nunit in the long term but at the moment i just want to get some bdd code working

8021477
nunit	mstest
the generated code files however continue to reference nunit - which is obviously wrong since i ve just told specflow to run using mstest

8021477
nunit	mstest
i m not surprised at this one since it s still trying to run nunit tests even though i ve explicitly asked for mstest though obviously it shouldn t nullref and present that to the user

next	except
for example if the permalink is myurl.com music september-guitar-post i want to exclude all categories except music from the previous and next post links

8022082
int	chars
here s a function i wrote to multiply two int in the format of chars arrays with each cell representing a single decimal number eg

8022105
arp	snmp
you can also use snmp to examine the routing tables on routers on your network to fetch arp ip maps quite often

8022110
width	height
if you re using weight weightsum parameters in your linearlayout you might want to set your height if linearlayout is vertical or width if linearlayout is horizontal to 0dip instead of fill_parent

8022120
decoder	encoder
the issue is not quite a netty limitation or encoder decoder limitation

8022120
post	put
in this way the example from netty will work for you but as was mention in a previous post you have to put more logic in the business logic handler

8022147
google-chrome	firefox
and in serialize1.php in google-chrome firefox and ie i get

8022158
children	parent
so the parent need to be ordered a - z and the children need to be ordered a-z

google-chrome	firefox
i tried it in firefox instead of google-chrome and it worked

8022322
submit	submission
i have the submit page and a form action to a page that queries the submission info into my database

8022339
post	get
sending that data using a get works just fine but when any of my forms send the data using post i get the following error message in chrome no data received

8022343
g++	gcc
i believe that recent gcc ie g++ 4.6 made a lot of efforts on language standard conformance

8022369
packets	multicast
some routers filter out multicast packets and unfortunately if you don t control the network there s not an awful lot you can do about it

8022399
int	boolean
i am used to the word primitive being used for basic data types boolean int float etc

8022401
ubuntu	linux
i use ubuntu linux

listview	gridview
i also changed a gridview to a listview i changed their id s too

8022554
thin	unicorn
i m running unicorn which is about 40 faster than thin on celadon cedar

8022569
lxml	elementtree	lxml	libxml2
if you re concerned about speed there s also lxml which builds an elementtree-compatible dom using libxml2 and should be quite fast â they have a benchmark suite comparing themselves to elementtree s python and c implementations available

8022570
jobs	cron
of course this code can be modified into a bash script if you prefer not to have a java class running in your cron jobs - but i ll leave that to someone more experienced with bash

8022592
division	multiplication
multiplication and division of large numbers is extremely quick so thats not a problem

8022631
unsigned	short
unsigned short

8022633
int	chars
it does pointer comparisons because string literals decay to pointers and chars are promoted to int

8022656
pull	push
its not that i had found the quirks of scala xml to be bad but the approach itself didn t sit with me well and prompted the question what if you separated the content from the tree and unified push and pull

8022683
int	chars
but when you re extracting formatted data into a type like int the parser attempts to pull as many chars out of the stream as it can to form the number

8022694
postgresql	mysql
regarding performance the apache guys say derby is perfectlly good for production matching and sometimes even surpassing mysql and postgresql in certain scenarios as you can see in this apache document

8022698
int	chars
in the int case multiple chars can be read while parsing an int because an int may be represent by multiple digits

8022714
passenger	unicorn
i m trying to decide between unicorn and phusion passenger standalone formerly phusion passenger lite

8022714
passenger	unicorn
i have read a lot about unicorn and it fits my model well but i see passenger standalone can essentially do the same thing

8022734
post	get
if you can post you code and possible callers that could help get to the bottom of the problem

8022743
multiplication	modulo
you should calculate the modulo after each squaring multiplication so the intermediate results should never be more than twice the digits as in your value for m

8022749
ready	each
i have more images ready to multilayer and stuff but i can t seem to get the darn thing to override the background for each li entry since the main thing is coded on the ol itself

8022752
viewdidload	viewwillappear
i know because it is a tabbar so neither viewdidload nor viewwillappear is called on click of that tab

8022764
fadein	fadeout
i have done an accordion style jquery function which works lovely but would like to add to it fadeout and fadein here is the part of the code

8022764
slideup	slidedown
im wanting to it fadeout then slideup and then again fadeout on slidedown

8022776
persistent	transient
like matt said in his comment to your question since those fields are marked as transient they are not persistent to the database and thus there s no way for you to query them

8022816
stdout	stderr
in either case the error message goes to stderr rather than stdout

8022850
ubuntu	linux
i have recently installed ruby 1.9.2 on linux ubuntu 10.04 running 0.7.65 when i run gem server the server starts but is not viewable on the 8808 port of the domain

8022966
width	height
i want an image with height and width 48px so if the image is different from that size i just resize the image to that size

8022977
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
however this code is clearly not doing anything because if anyone not just the user with account_id 3 goes to www.mysite.com uploads 3 2 my_video.m4v they can still access this video it is downloaded by firefox safari and played by natively by google-chrome

8023011
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i m using the uitabbarcontroller to control the views and just want the uinavigationcontroller so i can show the title in it as well as show a save button

8023034
spaces	delimiter
if that s not feasible although it s probably the better option replacing all single quotes with single quote escape sequences then placing single quotes around each of the arguments split the string with a spaces as the delimiter could provide a similar effect

8023036
min	max
the second is fast fourier transform - this is useful for lines which are like waves in that they stay between a min and a max bound and have some regular cycle or a number of regular cycles which is what the equation will divine

8023041
width	height
what happens is the iframe width and height is not fixed values so they can be any other numbers

8023049
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
the natural thing to do would be to have a uitabbarcontroller load first and have each uiviewcontroller it loads upon tab selection be an instance of uinavigationcontroller

8023052
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
basically you add uinavigationcontroller to the uitabbarcontroller

8023052
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
each uinavigationcontroller is initialized with the desired uiviewcontroller as its rootviewcontroller

8023071
post	get
gather information like url parameters and request type post get from that ajax request

8023144
ssl	https
according to this page all i really need to do to enable my service for connections via ssl is to update the axis2.xml file and include a new transportreceiver node for https

8023226
pull	push
once that is setup i start the process of pull ing and push ing to it - you talk about your ide here and there are a lot of git ide options but i just use the command line - i just find it faster

8023258
multiplying	addition
if you re testing a multiplying in one implementation and an addition in another method your matrix could look like this

8023279
google-chrome	firefox
if you run the code in firefox or google-chrome press f12 and watch the height of the body tag and of the first div after the body you will see that none have dynamically changed their height to include the inner content

8023301
concave	convex
however since my need is now to effectively compute a concave contour i m lost wikipedia does list a lot of resources for convex calculation but none for -concave-

8023339
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
observablecollection however implements inotifycollectionchanged and inotifypropertychanged interfaces

8023350
wmv	asf
i have a filter graph that takes raw audio and video input and then uses the asf writer to encode them to a wmv file

8023358
onfocus	onblur
you could set the defaults to off in the onfocus event of the credit field then turn them in the onblur

8023390
ubuntu	linux
i installed the eclipse platform using the software installer included with linux ubuntu lucid lynx

8023414
integer	unsigned
i m trying to convert a 128-bit unsigned integer stored as an array of 4 unsigned ints to the decimal string representation in c

8023414
hex	binary	octal	hex	octal	binary
if i was going to hex binary or octal this would be a simple matter of masks and bit shifts to peel of the least significant characters

8023451
int	chars
the method should take a chars array and and int pointer which is the size of the array

8023459
hide	show
i have a small uiview that i hide show in to show a message to the user

8023463
int	chars
the second code prints the int value of every chars read from the reader

8023470
comparator	comparable
the language you are using will determine how to define this ordering in c++ operator is used in standard containers in java the interface comparable and function comparator are typically used

8023473
addition	multiplication
you need to implement multiplication by a power of two and addition

8023473
multiplying	add
multiplying them by 2 32 3 2 32 2 2 32 1 and 2 32 0 respectively then add them together

8023477
uitableview	nsindexpath
- uitableviewcell tableview uitableview tableview cellforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

8023488
int	chars
you might use the string.split method to split the line at every space chars and the integer.parseint method to transform the third token into an int

8023505
width	height
you should be able to call the constructor of that with the same width height and textureoptions parameters - or any of the other variants of your liking

8023508
rsa	dsa
the openssl library also supports other key types besides rsa such as dsa see openssl pkey module .

8023534
onresume	onpause
the activity that holds the cameraview releases and reopens the camera in onpause and onresume methods

8023534
pop-up	dialog
the interesting part starts if there are multiple activities that can handle this intent and the intent chooser dialog pop-up

8023550
emacs	aquamacs
i really want to run gdb from within emacs but x-forwarding emacs has too much latency so i run aquamacs locally on my mac

8023552
onresume	onpause
from the standpoint of that activity any time after onpause until possibly a corresponding onresume the process may be terminated and the activity be lost

8023589
put	get
your best bet is to save things in whatever manner makes sense if you really need them between places where someone might logically put the device to sleep or rotate it or get a phone call or anything else that interrupts its top ness

8023589
serializable	deserialization
there s a little more work up-front and of course slightly more overhead in the serializable deserialization but since it s only happening on the rare instance that my variables are destroyed it s really not anything to worry about unless you have some massive amounts of data in which case you should be using a database anyway

8023606
equals	gethashcode
2 you don t override gethashcode to be consistent with equals or it s just not shown in your code excerpt

8023625
uilabel	uitextview
try changing it to a uilabel and see if the problem is specific to the uitextview

8023625
uilabel	uitextview
if you absolutely need a uitextview let me know in a comment but i have a suspicion that a uilabel is what you re after

8023671
division	modulo
use the remainder operator also known as the modulo which returns the remainder of the division and check if it is zero

8023672

you re trying to mutate the arrays with replaceobjectatindex while enumerating it the for-loop at the beginning of your code

8023699
int	chars
how would i format an int between 0 and 99 to a string which is 2 chars

8023703
width	height
and the generated result is the next where the generated has a width and height of 300px but is far away from using all the space

8023714
int	chars
you could convert your int to a string or a chars array and simply insert a comma every three digits working from strin.lenght -1 backwards then set the text atribute of the view using this string

8023740
getter	setter
if you really don t want to use any xml files then you should probably adapt the touchlistview class and add the necessary getter and setter

8023783
textview	imageview
i m not sure if it s the best approach but i would try to return a layout which is an indirect subclass of view that encapsulates both the imageview containing the image and a textview with the overlaying text

8023783
textview	imageview
build something like a relativelayout add both the imageview and the textview to it and return the layout

8023829
rss	feed
it is using the elementparser library to make a dictionary of values from an rss feed there are other values besides title which i have omitted

8023852
fitnesse	dbfit
i have had a great deal of success using the dbfit library in conjunction with fit fitnesse to develop stored procedures in a test-first manner

8023868
children	parent
what i want now is to call render on all of the object s children after the render on the parent has finished

8023891
post	get
and also the url i m sending the post to is localhost 8000 wr_view1 wr_webcube update and i previously successfully did a get to localhost 8000 wr_view1 wr_webcube webcube.xml and despite the .xml extension in the case of get it was still being handled by django and without errors in flex

8024004
put	get
second run get the modulo 100 and divide by 10 and then put them in buckets from 0 to 9

8024009
for-loop	loops
programmers often refer to it as the for-loop because of the way in which it repeatedly loops until a particular condition is satisfied

8024012
for-loop	loops
the only difference is that with your for-loop the variable i exists only within the scope of loops

8024012
for-loop	loops
every for-loop can be transformed into a while loops using this same pattern

8024013
hide	show
you can then hide the images by default with css and a simple click event to show the image

8024031
put	get
in my gem file i put down guard and rspec now when i try and run rspec by itself or with guard i get errors thrown at me and i m not sure why

8024103

i want to write a powershell script that will recursively search a directory but exclude specified files for example and myfile.txt and also exclude specified directory and their contents for example mydir and all files and folder below mydir

8024122
one-definition-rule	inlining
moreover linking requires that all necessary function definitions including member functions exist in some translation unit with inlining providing the usual exemption to the one-definition-rule

8024124
hide	show
this doesn t show the widget on the screen since you don t relinquish control back to the queue until the hide happens

8024125
codeigniter	kohana
using a mvc framework like codeigniter or kohana will make the swapping of views your content files very easy

8024131
implements	extends
this could be implements by extends the jdialog class this way

8024149
inherited	properties
2 a for...in loop which returns all the enumerable properties of an object regardless of whether they are own properties or inherited from the prototype chain

8024149
inherited	properties
we also have such methods as hasownproperty prop lets us check if a properties is inherited or actually belongs to that object and propertyisenumerable prop which as the name suggests lets us check if a properties is enumerable

8024149
inherited	properties
in other words can i somehow get a list of the inherited non-enumerable properties

8024152
implements	extends
note that it s and not in a class extends implements containeraware

8024236
put	get
you would then call asmap to get a map where you would be able to put your keys and values and have it backed by the cache

8024240
quicksort	mergesort
finally stack all the piles together this is where top-down approaches like msd radix or quicksort have a big advantage over bottom-up approaches like lsd radix or mergesort

8024270
inherited	properties
to get all inherited properties or methods for some instance you could use something like this

8024292
equals	tostring
gerhashcode equals tostring ...

8024295
hide	show
from the user perspective it should work similarly to google search and intellisense it should come up with a number of ranked choices and also come up with an intelligent way to cut that list off at the right point if nothing really matches the query then suggest nothing rather than show the best of the worst fits and also if the first few results have a strong rank but subsequent ones have a much weaker one relatively to the top results then perhaps hide the weak ones

8024334
superclass	subclassing
nsnumber is the abstract public superclass of several concrete subclassing

8024336
rss	feed
i would like to share my websites rss feed from a code snippet that users can cut and paste into their own websites

8024349
put	get
you can then put instances of your class directly into the listbox and cast an item from the listbox back to the class to get the property

8024365
rss	feed
you can write server-side code that renders your rss feed as formatted html then put that url in an

8024367
multiplying	add
update the simulation would be in a series of time steps at time t 0 the node a would have the value of 10 and b would either multiplying by 3 or add 3 depending on how someone would want to specify the impact

8024407
gif	png
for example i want to give him the option to select only jpg gif and png files for upload

8024410
hide	show
i dont know how you would show hide the desktop icons using c# however i have read a few articles about how to do it using the resistry keys

8024424
width	height
when it s called at application start if isfullscreen true there is very noticeable screen flicker for a second or 2 even if the width and height are the same as the desktop resolution

8024428
rspec	capybara
and of course require capybara rspec and set in your spec_helper

8024431
versioning	upgrade
osgi helps mitigate downtime in upgrade scenarios by allowing different versioning of a service to run concurrently allowing connections to use the newer service and then upon the last active connection s drop the old servlet will be shut off

8024444
folder	directory
i ve built a winforms app c# that will take a list of file paths and copy those files from a different vs solution to a new location in a folder the user specifies in the same directory structure they currently exist on local file system

8024449
viewdidload	viewdidappear
on the change of one view to another i want to load uitableview data after the viewdidappear of the new view occurs because if i load them in viewdidload it takes too much time to update the interface and the reason is the data loading

8024479
super	extends
the touch extension isn t working yet so i need to create something super basic for myself by extends the widget

8024480
integer	unsigned
i would like an algorithm or pair of algorithms that works for both signed and unsigned integers and does not rely on casting the values to a larger integer size

8024480
integer	unsigned
computing abs a - b as a signed value and then casting to an unsigned value doesn t work because signed integer overflow is typically an undefined operation at least in c.

8024492
children	parent
of course there is no limit of depth and a parent can have many children

8024504
imagemagick	minimagick
minimagick uses standard imagemagick geometry strings for sizing and from the fine manual a wxh geometry

8024504
width	height
maximum values of height and width given aspect ratio preserved

8024513
post	get
i django recommends against accessing post get data in middleware i m not really sure why so.

8024518
spannable	charsequence
if it s just basic text styling you could probably build a spannable and set the completion hint with the result since it accepts a charsequence

8024519
stdout	stderr
if these don t reveal where the problem is you may need to save the output of error stderr and output stdout

8024534
lxml	html5lib
more sophisticated alternatives include html5lib and lxml

8024536
subtraction	modulo
further the unsigned-integer subtraction operation is congruent to actual subtraction modulo uint_max so combining these facts we know that unsigned a - unsigned b is congruent to the actual value of a - b modulo uint_max

8024579
stdout	stderr
this is really problematic for non-interactive command-line programs that are merely trying to run a program and capture the exit code and stdout stderr output

8024592
post	get
everything works fine if i use a get request but it doesn t work with post

8024592
post	get
for some odd reason the php script is actually receiving a get request instead of post

8024649
int	chars
however if i change the declaration of the int array count 26 0 to count 25 0 and only change this the program will not properly store the number of z chars which is stored in the 25th element of the array

8024675
vsto	add-in
i assume you are working with an excel vsto add-in with the ribbon visual designer

8024699
getter	setter
create your own extension of application have it implement getter setter for your variables

8024710
prepare	execute
you can only prepare and execute sql that s a string literal or a user variable that contains the text of the statement

8024729
queue	fifo
this provides you with a fifo queue of the last 5 attempts and their timestamps

8024753
cgpoint	cgrect
i m wondering if there is a little bit of code that would do something like highlight a cgpoint making a dot of some sort on the the cgpoint s location or if you were using cgrect to see exactly where the rectangle is on the simulator not just the numbers in the code

8024767
post	get
i believe those would change the request type from a post to a get

8024767
post	get
it needed get requests but the default for httpservice was post

8024767
post	get
i was able to get around this by specifying a http header to get instead of post

8024783
listview	gridview
you would then bind the itemssource property of a listview to your property and declare your gridview inside the listview.view property

8024798
std	ostream
.. symboltable symboltable.h in function â std ostream operator std ostream const compaler symboltable â

8024803
superclass	subclassing
the first case is essentially defining an entirely new class though it may be a subclassing of a relatively generic class while the second is defining a new subclassing of some superclass which largely describes its external behavior

8024803
getter	setter
c++ has ordinary structures as well as classes though technically the difference is only whether the members default to public vs private and some things eg parameter lists or simple internal structures are probably better left as simple structs without making all data members private and requiring setter and getter etc

8024840
free	malloc
3 it s the type of raw memory pointers the result type of std malloc and operator new the argument type of std free and operator delete and of placement-new

8024863
udp	tcp
tcp is faster for when using a few connections the important difference is that modern nics perform significant amounts of acceleration on tcp and not really that much for udp

8024884
maven	pom.xml
for inspiration i wrote a dependency installer that installs jars into local maven repository and generates pom.xml definition with all those dependencies so that you can use itself as a dependency which put all its dependencies on classpath - transitive dependencies .

8024889
strtol	atoi
i would like to see how are those functions are implemented such as atoi strtol etc

8024914
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
try that in firefox google-chrome safari to see how it should look and check in ie8 9 youll understand the issue

8024943
std	ostream
however an alternative i often prefer is to make a public print function which prints the object to an std ostream and then let operator call that function

8024974
cgpoint	cgrect
a general cgpoint or cgrect has no concept of how it is being used

8024974
uiview	subviews
on the flip side there s nothing inherent in a uiview that would do anything to spit out anything visual unless it draws or adds subviews which of course is implemented by you

8025045
for-loop	arrays
in all other cases add a for-loop from 0 to 30 and inside add the current number to the location index and call the method again giving your arrays and index+1

8025095
put	get
the code above works just fine to get values from slider and to put it to input elements

8025102
min	max
setting the pangesturerecognizer for both the pagingscrollview and the imagescrollview to only accept a min max of 2 touches seems like a good place to start however it doesn t work

8025134
width	height
this page has an iframe that loads the actual content into it which i then run a height and width jquery function on to fill the remainder of the window

8025134
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
in google-chrome opera and safari it works however in firefox it calls the page into the content frame then doesn t run my function on the iframe

8025134
width	height
when i load the page into a frame its height and width are just whatever stock iframe height width the browser uses

8025249
children	parent
for instance the module model would be the parent class and would have two fields title and description that will be common amongst all types of children

8025261
hide	show
you can add a generic class to every toggle-able element and hide them all when an option is selected and then just show the desired one

8025263
width	height
keep the aspect ratio while re-sizing height to width ratio

8025297
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i am unable to get this feature to work in the latest versions of safari firefox or google-chrome

8025311
.htaccess	httpd.conf
check all apache configuration files httpd.conf and .htaccess to check for url rewrites

8025324
serializable	deserialization
i could simply attempting a serializable and deserialization but this seems messy at best

8025371
folder	directory
while creating one folder in src directory in one project in eclipse it makes that folder a package

8025371
folder	directory
i add main folder in src directory

8025404
folder	directory
any folder in src directory becomes a package

8025416
std	ostream
here i am using a std ostream pointer to redirect output to either console or to a file

8025419
folder	directory
eclipse forces you distinguish between source directory and ordinary folder

8025460
stateless	stateful
an ejb may a stateful a stateless or a singleton

8025462
put	get
if you not doing assets for exception at least put a try catch block and log the exception you will get the same exception on test case also

8025492
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
what you need is getelementsbytagname not getelementbyid

8025498
put	get
put the filemtime call inside that loop to get each file s mtime and do the comparisons in there

8025498
int	boolean
your code is not working as you ve not assigned a value to at the point you do the initial filemtime call so that returns a boolean false for failure which gets converted to an int 0 for the date formatting

8025504
width	height
this is even with height width defined in the css

8025512
folder	directory
when you run a java project in eclipse the current working directory is the root folder of the project

8025512
folder	directory
there is no need of putting resource directory inside your source or binary folder

8025523
implements	extends
general note implements runnable instead of extends from thread

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
website renders fine in ie but in firefox safari google-chrome the tables are shifted off-screen to the right

8025601
hash	md5
too high security is not needed at the moment but instead of using md5 hash with seed i plan to use sha1+seed to store my passwords

8025605
unix	sunos
that s surprising since should be available on all unix-like posix systems not just linux -- and comments in the source indicate that it s been used on sunos 4.1.1 and several other unix systems

8025633
width	height
edit also it d be a better idea to check if the x and y were greater than or equal to the width height and less than or equal to 0 for 2 reasons

8025643
getter	setter
so i ve been around android for about two years now and around 6 with java something that i liked from the very start that i discover them where the java convetion this guide that help me wrote more understandable code you know the typical calmelcase upper for class lower for method or the getter and setter of javabean etc

8025643
getter	setter
does not declared private attribute and follow the getter and setter pattern

8025678
strncmp	strcmp
in c you can t use to compare strings you have to use strcmp or strncmp

8025729
uinavigationbar	uiappearance
you should look into the new uiappearance changes or as daniel says use multiple subclasses of uinavigationbar

8025745
submit	submission
as long as all of the radio buttons and submit button are part of the same form you don t need to worry about submission multiple forms because there won t be any

8025771
uiview	subviews
i have one uiview with slider and segment control as a subviews

8025796
post	get
basically i can get the model-binding to work if i simulate a post in fiddler with the following data serializing it also of course

8025845
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
to add it to a navigationbar you need to then push the navigationitem onto it similar to how you add a new uiviewcontroller to a uinavigationcontroller

8025847
for-loop	loops
instead of a while loops i used a for-loop with xrange

8025899
ubuntu	debian
the good news is that ubuntu by way of debian has specific tools for this for example

8025958
multiplication	modulo	division	modulo	division	multiplication
supposing you have a fast 32-bit multiplication and division the result can be computed 4 digits at a time by implementing a bigint division modulo 10000 and then using s printf for output of digit groups

8025959
verilog	vhdl
there are hardware description languages out there verilog or vhdl where a couple of simulators exist vcs from synopsys or verilator if you want a free one

8025975
uiview	subviews
you could counter-rotate your subviews when you handle the gesture for rotating the uiview

8025998
width	height
something in your code is wrong try giving to pivot width and height and it wont work in any browser

8026007
backtracking	greedy
for an exact solution you can use backtracking check all possibilities and choose the best but it will take a lot of time or you can sattle for a heuristic solution such as greedy but it will not be optimized

8026042
installation	upgrade
so i recommend you to upgrade your installation if this is possible

8026056
int	boolean
since i don t know which database you re using you may need to consult the documentation to see how to cast from a boolean value to an int

8026086
width	height
i am trying to create a simple popup box that appears when my c++ program starts that will allow the user to enter the width height and length of a cube that will then be displayed in a separate window

8026144
mouse	keyboard
there are many libraries available that interface with various input methods for keyboard and mouse and provide graphical output

8026144

glut	glfw
opinionated note i prefer glfw over glut

8026175
padrino	ruby-on-rails
i built it for all my restful api needs in sinatra padrino and ruby-on-rails

8026190
int	chars
finally in computelettergrade you are doing a lot of redundant tests and your control flow is messed up by this variable assignment plus you should use a chars rather than an int

8026216
folder	directory
i m trying to sync a maildir directory which some folder within this maildir directory contains directory starting with dot

8026229
hide	show
for example hide button or show text got from request

8026257
javassist	cglib	javassist	bcel	bcel	cglib
check the following bcel cglib asm javassist

width	height	min	max
in swt there are several constructors to create chartcomposite most of the use defaults which specify min max width and height

8026323
sunos	bsd
many fs based on ffs sunos svr4 and hp-ux ufs bsd ufs1 ufs2 lfs implements fragments in order to save space when a lot of small files are created

8026323
filesystems	btrfs
modern filesystems like btrfs and zfs also support block sub allocation

8026335
qapplication	qcoreapplication
qapplication is derived from qcoreapplication and thereby inherits quit which is a public slot of qcoreapplication so there is no difference between qapplication quit and qcoreapplication quit

8026354
inherited	properties
it gives you control over how the image is drawn and is actually a uiview properties so uiimageview inherited it

8026374
rss	feed
i have a yahoo pipe which gets lots of feed inputs atom and rss

8026446
clang	llvm
llvm clang is a possibility or extending gcc thru plugins or even better with extensions coded in melt

8026506
jobs	cron
i have python-scripts set as cron jobs and they do the job almost fine

8026524
ssl	https
my specific problem appears to be that lwp protocol https is loading io socket ssl rather than crypt ssleay

8026524
ssl	https
it loads the module but it continues to load io socket ssl and use it for the https requests

8026530
gif	png
i am trying to recognize if this is an image url or not ending with jpeg jpg gif png etc.

8026540
maven	pom.xml
yes maven reads the parent pom.xml from your local repository or proxies like nexus and creates an effective pom.xml by merging the information from parent and module pom.xml

8026564
strlen	substr	strlen	strstr	strstr	substr
all byte functions eg strlen strstr strpos and substr work like the corresponding character functions eg mb_strlen mb_strstr mb_strpos and mb_substr

8026570
children	parent
the toplaintextstring method includes the text content of the tag s children so all the parent tags of the tag containing are going to contain too

8026580
super	abstract	super	implements
is being implements by the abstract class super there should be necessary for the abstract class super to implements that method showsum

8026585

8026635
google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari
it works fine with mozilla and opera but fails with webkit browsers like google-chrome and safari

8026635
google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari
as a workaround i tried to use a snapshot instead of an iterator with the dom level 3 xpath api that approach works fine for me with all four major desktop browser supporting document.evaluate mozilla opera safari google-chrome

8026662
for-loop	arrays
instead of using a for-loop to copy an arrays you can simply copy a vector using the assignment operator

8026686
google-chrome	safari
previously the only way to do this was to use a safari google-chrome extension written by simon whitaker

8026694
integer	unsigned
6.2.5c9 says a computation involving unsigned operands can never overflow because a result that cannot be represented by the resulting unsigned integer type is reduced modulo the number that is one greater than the largest value that can be represented by the resulting type

8026700
rank	max
since there may be several entries with max rank i don t think you can get the entry_date from an aggregation query like this

8026701
equals	tostring
instead of equals etlandsize.gettext .tostring since using to avoid comparisson with null is not usefull here - tostring cannot return null

8026712
width	height
in a wpf application i get the image size width and height before really loading it as i am loading it with reduced size... and i am using this c# code to get it

8026717
memcached	apc
but you could use memcached apc and more advanced caching techniques if you are up to it

this is how we have it set up on several projects on win7x64 dev machines with ncrunch r# dotcover all behaving fine

8026805

8026980
put	get
for anything where i just need a char equivalent holding data read from a database where locales encodings are not applicable i use std strings as they re a lot easier to use with non-qt libraries and your data doesn t get put through any encoding conversions

by removing the headers generate by the layers below the application layer tcp udp ip ... you will have access to the rtsp stream

8028010

8029180
put	get
this means that if you try joining that process you may get a deadlock unless you are sure that all items which have been put on the queue have been consumed

right now what this code is producing is the right image doesn t look like a square the width is larger than the height

8029559
submit	submission
instead of using a submit -type input use a button -type input for form submission

8029607
children	parent
so it makes easier to change the type of panel mantaining logics as zoom pan drag children implemented in parent contentcontrol

8029624
memset	malloc	memset	calloc	calloc	malloc
mentions in the comments this zeroing is why you should always use calloc instead of malloc + memset

8029624
memset	calloc
calloc can take advantage of this fact to avoid a separate memset

8029628
free	malloc
to see shich is the case write a different value to the memory free it and call malloc again

8029651
free	malloc
if you call free the glibc allocator will return the region to its free lists and when malloc is called again you might get that same region but dirty with the previous data

8029653
mouseover	mouseout
the only other thing that comes to mind is that mouseover and mouseout bubble to parent elements which can be confusing if you re not careful

8029653

prng	random
obviously there are issues around the repeatability of random tests so use a prng and log the seed

8029768
vb.net	vb6
if you have never learned old win32 with vb aka vb6 i would advise you to skip it altogether and learn vb.net unless your end goal is to maintain legacy applications

8029785
vb.net	vb6
vb6 is unsupported products for it are unsupported and there isn t much you can gain by learning it instead of learning something else like vb.net

8029859
cvs	svn
is it possible to download that svn repository using my existing version control like cvs

8029875

you are passing a relative path to fopen so it may be opening a file in another folder you are not expecting as the calling process s working directory can change dynamically

8029894
cvs	svn
there are no connectors between svn and cvs that i know about

8029912

8029923
google-chrome	firefox
but in firefox and google-chrome it is showing in the tab data in the same window

8029929
yacc	bison
think that many parser generators like antlr or yacc or bison are build on a similar idea

8029941
actualheight	actualwidth
you will need to refer to actualwidth and actualheight in you code behind to get the rendered size of the container

8029946

now i want to call a method which is in the stateless bean from the stateful bean

8029980
width	height
i have a bitmap in as3 i want its height to be 800 i want the width to be adjusted with the correct ratio so the image doesn t look squashed

8030006
superclass	subclassing
java also adds bridge methods to classes when a subclassing overrides a method in a superclass or interface but refines the return type

8030015
nowjs	node.js
node.js and socket.io or nowjs on the backend

8030041
int	double
in the code you are comparing a double to an int

8030041

therefore you have to use fromintegral or frominteger to convert an int to a double

8030043
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
an uitabbarcontroller or an uinavigationcontroller will call the viewdidload by default lazy right before the user sees it

8030055
width	height
the right image doesn t look like a square the width is larger than the height

8030062
width	height	portrait	landscape
of course if you are dealing with both portrait and landscape images it would be slightly more complicated but the general idea is you set either height or width then use the bitmap s scale properties to adjust the other dimension

8030066
post	get
if you want to compare the two different variants given in your post it probably won t matter that much nowhere near the same gains you get in c or co if you order your arrays correctly

8030075
switching	screens
it works but when the switching occurs between the default.png and the uiimageview default.png on the view the uiimageview show up slightly down in comparison with the default.png which is the splash screens image

8030085

the uploads work fine in firefox and google-chrome

8030281
post	get
the url you are using is afaik from the google safebrowsing api v 1 which used to support get requests and is now deprecated and will be taken offline by december 1st - i strongly recommend switching to v2 of the api which from what i gather only supports requests via post

8030282
put	get
i am able to put just the username into the spinner with the commented out code above but then get no return values

8030297

i read so link and incorporated swt with swing into my code

8030383
postgresql	mysql
so unless you want some models that aren t searchable using sphinx on sqlite and the rest in mysql or postgresql - and that is more of a headache than it s worth - then you should just use either mysql or postgresql for your rails application and not use sqlite at all

8030386

8039464
maven	pom.xml
and as a final note in a setup such as the one aboce ideally you d create a parent maven project packaged as pom.xml which has as child projects b and a in that order

8039464

this way if you ve modified stuff in both projects and you want everything to be build with the latest modifs you can just do a maven install on the parent pom.xml and maven will take care of everything

8039529
portrait	landscape
when rotating the device from portrait to landscape or vice versa the page s content becomes bigger than the webview s bounds and black areas appear

8039574
int	boolean
basically you would need to implement a listcellrenderer and specially the getlistcellrenderercomponent list list object value int index boolean isselected there you would have to add the corresponding logic to detect where the list element is going to be painted and play with the styles to set shadows gradients or whatever you want

8039597
openssl	m2crypto
my specific problem was that openssl and the m2crypto instances of key pairs were not in the same underlying format

the dropdownview defines the look of the dropdownview and the layout defined in the simplecursoradapter constructor defines the layout of the items of the closed spinner object itself not its drop down view

8040230
simplecursoradapter	spinner	textview	simplecursoradapter
so its nice to have a different layout for the dropdownview which is exacly like the one defined in the simplecursoradapter so the values pushed to it can be set to the right corresponding fields except with the difference that i use for the textview of the dropdownview layout and android layout_height wrap_content for the textview of the spinner layout

when the app is put into the background i get an onpause but then still get my messages coming through as one would expect

8040290
put	get
you say that there s no clear way to put the parameter somewhere where the splices can see it since they only have access to the application monad. in my mind having access to the application monad is exactly what you need to get this stuff inside splices

google-chrome	firefox
in ff6 and google-chrome 9 support for media queries from js was added which can greatly simplify the media query approach necessary for determining zoom in firefox

8040723
keystore	jks
the reason i don t want to bundle a keystore aside from having to use bouncycastle instead of jks is that i don t want to package the intermediate ca cert with the app as this will create a certificate management problem sooner

8040755

uitableview	uisearchbar
i have a uitableview with a uisearchbar as its tableheaderview

8040830
uitableview	uisearchbar	hide	show
the best i ve been able to do is set the uisearchbar as a separate item in the view and simply resize the uitableview dynamically to show or hide it when the user taps a search button

it s better to not use mouseout or mouseover event and use jquery .hover if you are using the plug in .hoverintent for more clean and readable code

8042980
viewdidload	viewdidappear
it appears that a side-effect of this problem is that none of the view management methods on cameracontroller are ever called like viewdidload viewdidappear etc

i assume i cant pass chars into an array that is called as so is there a way to have both int and chars in an array

8043369
equals	gethashcode
i m a little confused about the default behaviour of equals and gethashcode in c#

8043399
prepare	execute
prepare statements are slightly faster when execute repeatedly because the mysql server has to parse the sql and run the query planner optimizer only once

8043401
equals	gethashcode
you don t need to explicitly override equals and gethashcode unless you want to change their behavior

8043407
int	chars
in c++ int s and chars s are almost the same thing

8043408
folder	directory
here s a basic python script that will combine all css files in a directory and replace references to your images folder

when the user inserts a chars at a specified index you want to update an array of chars instead of inserting the value in your int array

8043442
google-chrome	safari
it works for google-chrome v16 and safari v5 except

8043446
button	checkbox
the title of your question says radio button but your question asks about checkbox

8043447
int	chars
as others have mentioned chars will be promoted to int when you assign elements of the array with chars values

8043447
int	chars
since you would need to keep track of which elements hold int and which hold chars -- this is not an attractive solution

8043467
post	get
when i use the graph api to fetch the likes for the post eg post_id likes i get a data field with 5 entries in it and no count field

8043474

for google-chrome and firefox this script works perfect when it comes to the horrible ie

8043601
google-chrome	firefox
i m tried some debugging and found out that the parent of google-chrome and firefox is which is correct but the parent of ie is

8043630
children	parent
it should be specified on the parent in order to affect the children in your case searchlistviewmodel

8043681
post	get
if we get the post data in the controller then we need to pass the data as arguments to the model function but the model function can be used in other forms

8043681
post	get
if we get the post data directly in the model then we can eliminate the argument passing step but it s limited to some specific forms

8043701
put	get
but as it seems every time i put this into one of my groovy classes i get the following error

8043744
children	parent
sure just iterate through the children of your parent view self.view and remove any that are zeldaview elements

8043760
typedef	struct
my advice drop the typedef and just use a struct tag as you already do for struct internalstruct and don t try to create a special name for the array type

8043779
accelerometer	gyroscope
currently i am trying to combine accelerometer and gyroscope on android phone to calculate the orientation how much angle each axis rotates of the phone

8043787
viewdidload	dealloc
create the mutable array in viewdidload and release it in viewdidunload and dealloc

8043792

running a quick benchmark on my netbook inserting 1 000 000 bindings into a dictionary shows that the mutable sorteddictionary takes 5.2s and immutable map takes 11.8s so there is a significant but not huge difference

8043896
udp	tcp
for tcp and udp protocol there is no such thing as wchar_t

8043929
for-loop	arrays
using the variable i as an index which you already have set up in the for-loop you can access the arrays s values one by one and compare with number1

a workaround is to convert it to wav or aiff

8043990
rss	feed
i ve searched online to see if elmah can send daily emails and from the reading i ve done the developers say to use the rss feed instead of emails

8043993
width	height
you can set height and width to fill_parent and then use setscaletype

8044000
postgresql	mysql
but type tables for instances where users need to be able to add modify delete various values or if i know that i m going to have a data warehouse of some sort type tables are better quicker due to foreign keys with your run of the mill storage systems mysql postgresql etc

8044052
width	height
i d like to get the aspect ratio based on the width and height of the image being specified in a form i m letting users enter these values in

8044069
post	get
for the difference between get vs post please see this article

8044070

if you can get one of height width then you can calculate the missing width height

8044070
width	height
original width new height original height new width

8044070
width	height
original height new width original width new height

8044070
width	height
original width original height ratio

stdout	stderr
it will print a lot of debugging to stdout or stderr and you will be able to

8044207
firefox	safari
safari did not mind but firefox did not like it because linefeeds and carriage returns are not valid json so that could well be your problem

8044210
post	get
i actually like that having got the gold flag weight badge i m able to flag the problem post that are less obvious - the ones that 9 times out of 10 get marked as helpful but occasionally get disputed

8044222
min	max
i d like to find its local min and max points

8044222
min	max
check my sample chart and the blue points on it it is not just a simple getting min max values from an array

8044253
width	height
ideally i would like to scale the dialog by entering width and height parameter programmatically

8044263

8044320
move	drag
i have a screen that the user can drag move different things around on

8044338
google-chrome	firefox
here s a simple example of this showing that google-chrome does the former while firefox does the latter

8044338
google-chrome	safari
edit here s the webkit bug describing google-chrome safari s incorrect handling of this test case

8044347
sequence	permutation
the c++ algorithm next_permutation performs an in-place rearrangement of a sequence into its next permutation or returns false when no further permutation exist

8044370
maven	pom.xml
i am relatively new to this and still bit puzzled how the maven dependencies in pom.xml and the grails dependencies in buildconfig.groovy hang together

8044370
springsource	grails
in sts springsource tool suite it seems to list the different the grails dependencies

8044379
uiview	calayer
it seems to me that the first time i run an animation animating the frame of a uiview or the position of a calayer etc it is quite choppy and subsequent animations are smooth

8044391
webclient	httpwebrequest
you have two options httpwebrequest and webclient

8044419
width	height
to get the aspect ratio just simplify the width and height like a fraction for example

8044420
integer	unsigned
could an unsigned 32-bit integer be used as an index would allow 4 294 967 296 indexes which could be used to identify how to sort the original array

8044444
oncreate	ondestroy
when this happens it appears that ondestroy oncreate and onstartcommand are not being called

8044481
width	height
if you want to be concise calculate the greatest common divisor of the width and height and divide both of them by that

8044482
setinterval	settimeout
this is a technique to replace settimeout and setinterval functions globally in a cross-browser fashion

8044498
qicon	qfilesystemmodel
if it does then i am right and only thing you can do is to subclass qfilesystemmodel and change qicon returned from data method - but this is quite crude and non-flexible solution

8044518
width	height
now this form will not allow the user to set its width or height below 400

8044536
width	height
i tried using negative margin-top instead of top but that as i suspected defaults to using the width of the element to determine the height offset which does not achieve your effect

8044536
width	height
by giving .bkg a width and height of 100 that set s its size which apparent is enough to correctly then calculate the correct 50 offsets to reposition it down and to the left which is the same relationship you wanted for your original look

8044563
google-chrome	firefox
this works in google-chrome and firefox current versions but apparently not ie7 or ie9

8044568
cufft	fftw
i am trying to write fortran 2003 bindings to cufft library using iso_c_bindings module but i have problems with cufftplanmany subroutine similar to sfftw_plan_many_dft in fftw library

8044596
prng	random
it then likely uses its last result as an input to the next value so by seeding the prng with a known value you will always produce a known sequence of random numbers

8044623
jboss	glassfish
may be the java part can be implement and work on java server glassfish jboss

8044636
put	get
proof put a breakpoint in the enenmies class destructor and seee when that gets hit therefore when you try to de-reference them you ll get garbage

8044656
mouseleave	mouseenter
try using mouseenter and mouseleave instead

8044656
mouseover	mouseenter
here s the relevant piece of documentation about mouseenter vs mouseover

8044656
mouseover	mouseenter
the mouseenter event differs from mouseover in the way it handles

8044683
margin	height
the height of this grey margin i wasn t expecting looks to be about the height of the top signal strength bar

8044719
width	height
drop a line down from the top right of 1 0 you end up with another right angled triangle and a triangle composed of three right angled triangles height is your original triangle height width is 1.5 triangle length hypotenuse i leave for an exercise for the class

8044719
width	height
another option is to work out the parallelogram calc it s centre move that to the origin rotatee 30 degrees clockwise move back precalc the transform you have a diamond with a width of the above hypotenuse which side of the middle is which triangle height of the diamond is triangle length you ll still need to work or the parallegram as 1.0 and 2 0 will overlap

8044756
unsigned	short
try unsigned short for 16 bits grayscale image

8044773
dsl	dynamic-languages
but you may want to look at perhaps using groovy to write your dsl as there is a great deal of opportunities in a dynamic-languages and it would have a shorter learning curve than scala does

8044854
puts	gets
i m trying to write a program that in a function gets 2 numbers from the user puts them in an array and returns them to the main function

8044859

found lots of ways to achieve this using slideup and slidedown

8044863
post	get
this way you will handle both post and get requests

8044866
do-while	break
in your c++ textbook look up the keywords continue and break as they apply to your do-while loop

8044871
width	height
it does seem to work correctly if you use self.resize width height instead of redefining boundingrect

8044874
google-chrome	firefox
demo works in google-chrome and firefox but not ie

8044905
textarea	textbox
the user could add 50 form elements from textbox to radio to textarea

8044960
equals	tostring
also note equals tostring etc are public virtual

8044973
memcpy	memset	memcpy	memmove	memmove	memset
theses indices can then be used along with memcpy memset and memmove from string.h to perform string replacement

8044995
elementname	datagrid
elementname binding is not working within datagrid

8045010
hash	md5
my recommendation will be to simply hash the client id using md5

8045015
equals	tostring
there s only one way to do it so there s no reason to let you customize the behavior with some specialized logic like equals tostring etc

8045016
ienumerable	iqueryable
iqueryable contains provider info and ienumerable listgrpholder does not

8045048
division	modulo
if you want to do it in reverse as in finding the x y position by the array index you can use the modulo and division

8045070
carrierwave	fog
i am trying to crop an image with carrierwave and put it on the cloud fog cloud_files

8045134
inherited	properties
i need the derived class to be able to show the inherited class s name properties

8045138
post	get
the issue now is that when i do the get depending on its value i need to do a post

8045153
post	get
this way you don t need to determine whether it was by post or by get that the data was submitted

8045167
uiview	subviews
if i put the shadow on self.layer it appears but it encompasses all the subviews of my parent uiview

8045185

i use a for-loop 100 loops to create houses and treasuries across an area

8045199
google-chrome	firefox
there are no problems in firefox and google-chrome

8045219
ontouch	ondraw
in ontouch you can modify a member variable which is accessible in ondraw

8045231
i2c	spi
step one is getting your program compiled and running step two is some simple i o then a lot of learning about various interfaces spi i2c etc and peripherals timers lcd controllers pwm etc

8045232
getter	setter
and if you need to access the members of the struct then you can do so with self.ms.member or by writing getter and setter

8045240
implements	extends
if it is not possible at all i will dynamically generate a new class that extends the abstract class implements its constructors and the abstract method of all its ancestors a bit more complicated so i would be very happy if i succeed just making the original class non-abstrat instead

8045280
punctuation	words
a single-character words followed by certain punctuation like that a back there

8045288
openssl	m2crypto
you could name your swig-generated module _foobar and write a pure python module foobar that defines the necessary pythonic interface m2crypto an openssl wrapper follows that approach

8045327
int	chars
whenever i ve had values that can only be a single int a value 0-9 i ve always just used int 1 to say it s an int and it will only be one chars which i assume means that it could only be a value 0 through 9 please explain this to me if i m wrong

8045368
superclass	subclassing
your action s superclass implements modeldriven hence so does your subclassing

8045374
setinterval	clearinterval
the setinterval function on the other hand runs a function at a specified interval until clearinterval is called

8045374
setinterval	clearinterval
if you were using setinterval then you would need to clearinterval when you no longer wanted the function to be called

8045394
ffmpeg	libavformat
by the way in my ffmpeg version there are still many bugs in libavformat module for proccessing mms protocol

8045409

min	max
the declarations of min max total_border_height and total_border_width all come after at least one statement in the block

8045487
passenger	thin	passenger	unicorn	thin	unicorn
passenger unicorn or thin could all address your needs in this respect

8045488
stdout	stderr
if catastrophic errors are logged or just printed to stdout stderr before the logging service starts in glassfish you will never see the output

8045523
floating-point	integer
i have some code that executes quite a few floating-point operations but runs unacceptably slowly on the phone and i d like to see how the performance of integer computation compares

8045529
post	get
it should count the impressions for each post and count the amount of users that like or dislike so if you have 30 people dislike for each post it should get them i cannot see your table structure but i hope it will help or point you somewhere

8045610
int	chars
the easiest way is to just cast that chars to an int

8045645
min	max	queue	fifo
one way to solve this problem is maintain priority queue with min max values and fifo discipline too

8045645
min	max
what you will find simpler i think is to not track min max while allocating but instead just have a loop to find min max right before each printout

8045672
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
the basic theory is that you create a uitabbarcontroller and then put a uinavigationcontroller inside that and then put a uiviewcontroller as the root view controller of the navigation controller

8045674
addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	division	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction
i have tried looking online with no success and i need functions for addition subtraction multiplication and division if possible and limited to a specified number of decimal places.

8045707
automake	autotools
in the book autotools a practioner s guide to gnu autoconf automake and libtool chapter 6 building libraries with libtool an example of linking library is given

8045735
stdout	stderr
while it is true that set_combine_stderr diverts stderr to the stdout stream it does so in chaotic order so you do not get the result you probably want namely the lines combined in the order written as if you were running the command in a local terminal window

8045735
stdout	stderr
if instead you comment out the chan.get_pty call and uncomment the chan.set_combine_stderr true call you will get clumps of stdout and stderr lines interspersed randomly from run to run

8045773
keydown	keyup
it updates the input val with the focused val the user is on with keydown keyup

8045777
mongodb	bson

jar	war
and like you said define the scope as provided since it s already in the tomcat and you dont want the servlet-api jar from pom to be included when building the war

8045871
copying	overwrite
if it involves only copying files then imo the best option is to give the bunch of files in needed directory structure and ask to overwrite existing copies

8045871
folder	directory
a slightly more user-friendly measure would be to zip up the directory structure along with a batch file and ask to unzip it in the app directory under some designated folder and then run the batch file to overwrite files

8045886
getter	setter
it is only data no functions although i might now add getter setter

8045932
spaces	delimiter
in powershell arguments to functions are delimiter with spaces and not comma and are not enclosed in parentheses method arguments are though

8045941

8045976
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
run it in viewdidappear instead of viewwillappear

8046032
filesystems	btrfs
reiserfs and i believe btrfs dynamically allocate new inodes as needed and so the total inodes field of the filesystems doesn t really reflect any sort of useful value

8046052
hide	show
you could even make your list of available selections and then hide them with css and only show those items when their corresponding form values have been selected

8046104
nsurl	nsstring
remember that cfstringref and cfurlref are toll free bridged which means that the objective c equivalents are nsstring and nsurl

restrict	shared
unfortunately i am restrict to doing this purely with a .htaccess file since i m on shared hosting and don t have access to apache config files and such

8046224
comparator	comparable
instead just use the comparator method that you know your comparable objects have

8046271
for-loop	loops
in this case a bit of glob magic needs to be thrown in due to the way the for-loop assigns to its loops variable

8046276
onclick	onfocus
ok ignoring the fact that inline event handlers are generally frowned upon these days try something like the following in which the onclick and onfocus in your html pass this through to the associated functions such that those functions have a reference to the element that the event was triggered on so that they can figure out what the related field or label is

8046311
children	parent
for the parent of those leaves build another hash table using the values at each parent and the identifiers of those children

8046311
children	parent
assign each parent an identifier that is the same if the value at the node is the same and the identifiers of its children are the same

8046314
avassetwriter	avassetreader
use avassetwriter and avassetwriterinput in order to encode the raw samples into a file - the following sample mac os x project shows how to use these classes the sample should work for ios too however they use an avassetreader for input it reencodes a movie file instead of the camera and microphone.

8046363
width	height
define height and width of form and also use jquery ui 1.8.16

8046372

in my activity i have a listpreference which pop-up a dialog and allow to select a value for a preference

8046416
setcontentview	findviewbyid
of course exclude the setcontentview and findviewbyid s

8046439
client-side	server-side
alternatively if you are using a server-side programming language such as php you should do the redirect through that instead of client-side code

8046442
children	parent
however i can t help feeling that there has to be a better way and i haven t tested this with an existing parent that s had children modified and maybe added and removed so i know it s not actually correct yet

8046449
int	chars
for example if you want to extract an int from a stringstream and then see if there were any left over chars ie

webservers like apache nginx are perfect for this

8046477
class-method	eigenclass
that s because all class-method are instance methods of eigenclass for this class es object

8046507
public	protected
the difference between the two is that if a is not in the same package as b package access is a different case - left as exercise for the reader - then in case of delegation or composition you will have access only to public data members and methods of class a whereas in case of inheritance the inheriting class b will have access to public and protected members and methods of class a

8046509
union	distinct
you could replace the group by a b c clause with a distinct in front of a in the select-list of the first part of the union

public	protected
inheritance gives you all the public and protected methods and variables of the super-class

8046547

it follows that the subclassing should have a logical implementation of each of those inherited traits

8046555
public	protected
class b will be an extension of class a and contain all of class a s public members as well as have access to the protected ones also which you won t in the second example

8046577
vb.net	vb6

8048440
google-chrome	safari
look at this in google-chrome and in safari when you click the link the div rotates and should expand the page horizontally to ensure the whole page is visible

8049561
width	height
i can force it to use multiple lines by removing the before the call to setpreferredsize in the above code but this requires me to set both a width and a height and i don t know what height to use

8050764
sorting	grouping
i have implemented a web - application which features a gridpanel which can be grouping or ungrouped and where the rows should be sorted alphanumerically like the standard grid sorting function does but with the exception that some rows which represent summary rows should not be sorted at all and should stay at the same row position

8050816

8050964
int	boolean
i need to find the protected method view.overscrollby int int int int int int int int boolean

8050973
setinterval	settimeout
don t pass a string to setinterval or settimeout it gets evaled which is slow and hard to debug and it breaks scope

8050996
width	height
it appears you have to put either width or height to div css for gradient to work in ie 7+

8050999
sproutcore	cappuccino
i have seen things like sproutcore and cappuccino but they seem very different to the way in which the chrome web store has been built

8051026
udp	tcp
no issue for me so far - mainly work with udp tcp servers clients

8051070
instances	transient
object references an unsaved transient instances - save the transient

8051095
pbkdf2	salt	scrypt	pbkdf2	scrypt	salt
in most cases such as storing passwords used for login to your site you should use a proper password hashing functions such as pbkdf2 bcrypt or scrypt with an appropriate salt

8051104
icu	gettext
my question is whether icu resource bundles including the access functionality and the storage format are meant for - or it is part of their purpose - to be used for message translation - for example like gettext and .po files are

8051112
rtp	rtsp
rtsp stream does not carry video audio itself it provides a method to control independent rtp video and audio streams they are in turn independent one from another

8051112
rtp	rtsp
one of the options though is when rtp streams are tunnelled through rtsp connection in which case all communication might be taking place through single tcp connection

8051120
twitter	myspace
remember facebook is written in php though they compile a lot of that php to c++ now for speed myspace was written in c# coldfusion i believe twitter uses ruby on rails though they plan to abandon it apparently google uses java go i think and linkedin uses asp.net or something i think

8051141
uitableview	uisearchbar
i have a uitableview with a uisearchbar which contain japanese words and i want to test if it works to search japanese words with japanese keyboard

8051172
oncreate	findviewbyid
you could use findviewbyid r.id.give_the_custom_view_an_id in the main activity s oncreate method and get a reference to your custom view and the access then variable

8051192
django	turbogears
python also can do it using web frameworks like django or turbogears

8051196
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
if you have previous experience with bash often the default on gnu linux installations this makes the os x command-line experience familiar otherwise consider switching your shell either to tcsh or to zsh as some find these more user-friendly

8051196
versioning	upgrade
if you upgrade from or use os x versioning 10.2.x 10.1.x or 10.0.x the default user shell is tcsh an enhanced versioning of csh c-shell

8051196
ubuntu	linux
on a final note i am on linux ubuntu 11 and mac osx so i use bash and the thing i like the most is customizing the .bashrc source d from .bash_profile on osx file with aliases some examples below

8051336
invalidoperationexception	argumentnullexception	invalidoperationexception	argumentexception	argumentnullexception	argumentexception
there are also several base types you can use for example argumentexception argumentnullexception invalidoperationexception applicationexception

8051351
google-chrome	safari
this works fine across all browsers on mac but looking at it on pc on google-chrome and safari it appears jagged

8051358
fitnesse	jbehave
unfortunately i don t know python tools but in java i would use jbehave or fitnesse

8051398
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

8051418
ant	maven
i m converting an ant project that uses cxf into a maven one

8051435
google-chrome	firefox
open the following link in firefox or google-chrome and you will see all working fine you need to hover over the personal and then the mobile or internet sub-menu items to test

8051456
maven	pom.xml
alternatively you could create two simple maven projects one per each vendor each project will use an sql plugin in order to run your queries paste them in the same order into the pom.xml

8051473
versioning	upgrade
i have a problem whit online update because i don t know how can add code for check for update program and after check if find newer versioning upgrade itself

8051507
dbvisualizer	toad
in any other database tool sql developer toad dbvisualizer i can see the schema along its tables and views and can query against them and create new views etc

8051578
google-chrome	firefox
view the site in google-chrome firefox to see how it should look

8051591
put	get
as one artist can have many albums and each one have a single record label i would put this query in the album model part of a get method like

8051593
vmware	virtualbox
for windows they suggest using a virtualbox or vmware based implementation

8051625
portrait	landscape
but the true orientation isn t know at this point because apps are always started in portrait and then are sent rotation notifications if it s really in landscape

8051656
put	get
what you do here is get one editor put in the preference and leave it alone

8051705
folder	dir
the source folder is structured like the packages and not just all classes in one dir

8051793
excel	listobject
now what i would like to do is to be able to make a custom mapping to bind this dataset to a excel listobject

8051793
excel	listobject
by default listobject will display every column in the excel worksheet but i only want to show some properties and in a particular order

8051804
uigesturerecognizer	subviews
here s what you could do is to iterate through all the subviews of your self view and find the one that has the same uigesturerecognizer it s not the prettiest solution and the more subviews s you have the longer the loop will take

8051816
struts	wicket	lift	wicket
in this interview with david pollak he explains his reasons to start this project and in short lift s benefits compared to rails wicket the smalltalk web framework seaside and struts

8051880
int	chars
this means look up two chars from input from offset t input.substring t 2 then convert these to a hex int again

8051934
mktime	strftime
then you can use mktime localtime to convert it to struct tm which is displayable with strftime and could be parsable with strptime

8051947
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
seems like the ie version 7+8 put the menu a lot further down then what safari google-chrome firefox do

8051951
folder	directory
perform a directory comparison between your branch folder your trunk folder

8051977
opera	firefox
everything is fine but in opera ie popupwindow opens in the center and in firefox - on the right side like smbody puts float right

8052002
matplotlib	scipy
i want to install scipy numpy and matplotlib globally so that the libraries can be accessed from network computers

8052036
width	height
and then i need to be able to add an item according to starting position like in two dimensional array width and height while width and height are the number of cells

8052036
width	height
so after receiving a command additem item axe position 1 width 2 height 2

8052109
portrait	landscape
this results in splitviewcontroller willhideviewcontroller withbarbuttonitem forpopovercontroller being called on the delegate simulating a landscape - portrait rotation even though the device is already in landscape mode

8052109
portrait	landscape
since the device is in landscape mode as the split view controller is revealed this causes splitviewcontroller willshowviewcontroller invalidatingbarbuttonitem to be called on the delegate simulating a portrait - landscape rotation thereby invalidating the bar button item removing it from the right-side of the split view and leaving us where we want to be

8052109
portrait	landscape
it s only after you rotate again to landscape and then back to portrait has the system got back into the right state and will actually install the popover bar button item in portrait mode

8052135
getter	setter
the function getter and setter called and values also set but i have the output log as

8052141
google-chrome	firefox
current firefox google-chrome and ie9 don t

8052151
post	get
i get the error stack i post only the end if you need more tell me please

8052174
put	get
you need to put the bean in the request scope or to get rid of the component binding altogether

8052192
spaces	delimiter
you need to use cin.getline cin s will only read the first word delimiter by spaces

8052193
postgresql	mysql
postgresql is far more powerful and scalable and doesn t have mysql s silly limitations and gotchas

8052200
centos	linux
the maven command line we use under centos linux is

8052215
division	modulo
i tried using modulo and division to solve it and came up with nothing of course my formula was wrong

8052217
width	height
i had this same problem recently i had set the height and width to 100 and firefox would not display ie9 would squish the swf to the top of the page height 100px or something

8052221
setinterval	settimeout
i have looked setinterval settimeout and similar functions but what i really need is this

8052252
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
okay here is how you can draw your rect in touchesmoved use nekto touchesbegan to store the starting point of your rect

8052252
width	height
and be careful i can t tell how it will behave if you drag your finger to the top or to the left negative values for height and width

8052315
opera	firefox
in firefox opera even ie it displays as it should black links normally and red on hover

8052315
google-chrome	safari
in webkit-based browsers though google-chrome and safari it displays as normal blue links with underline

8052335
tcpdf	fpdi
i am using tcpdf and since i am needing to modify an existing pdf i am also having to use the fpdi class

8052335
fpdf	fpdi
it appears to me that fpdi normally is integrated with fpdf so i ve been using the fpdf methods to build out my pdf

8052340
google-chrome	safari
i don t see this behavior in google-chrome safari or internet explorer

8052376
maven	pom.xml
using these maven plugins in conjunction with each other in your pom.xml configuration will give you what you need

8052381
min	max
you can also set the min and max value and just use value++ on it to make it work

8052397
hide	show
i m trying to create a window control where you can toggle the state from hidden to show that hide show some stuff when not hidden

8052413
folder	directory
when i create a website which uses sql server compact ce 4.0 in private deployment mode then i result in having 2 additional folder inside bin directory amd64 and x86 -- which contain the platform specific non-anycpu assemblies

8052434
post	get
so if you please someone show us how to properly get a post request right in this wp7

8052462
client-side	server-side
there s a hard separation between the server-side processing and the client-side processing

8052462
client-side	server-side
it would have to match the same conventions for separating client-side code from server-side code

8052469
equals	gethashcode
as others have pointed out for equality comparison implement iequatable or just override the equals and gethashcode methods

8052516
folder	directory
i m trying to write to an xml file in the uploads folder in my wordpress directory

8052529
hide	show
isset is false then it hide that sub-form and show the next sub-form the individuals form has only been designed

8052536
client-side	server-side
i want to be able to change the value client-side with javascript and read the value server-side during postbacks

8052544
int	boolean	int	double	int	chars
i m pretty certain that every method will take 0 1 or 2 parameters which have a mixture of boolean int double and chars

8052544
int	double
where the int is the payment method type in this case would be cheque and double is the total

8052634
int	double
my idea was to write an immutable â realnumberâ class that handles primitive numbers int long float and double without a bunch of instanceof controls

8052634
int	double
but brings another 2 issues this pattern allows to add double to int which results in realnumber of int and results in a stackoverflowerror if one passes a biginteger byte or some other number

8052641
backbone.js	javascriptmvc
in back-end i use php while in front-end a javascriptmvc framework backbone.js

8052678
width	height
as i mentioned in my question i could already work out the width and height after the drawing has taken place

8052748
int	double
if you don t want to add int to double then i guess you will need to do something like

8052752
screens	tablet
i just got a samsung 10.1 tablet and apart from the fact that the screens layout is different and i clearly need to start specifying layout-large etc

8052782
portrait	landscape
you can even have a different layout for portrait and landscape for example you can have

8052782
portrait	landscape
layout for portrait and layout-land for landscape

8052815
width	height
a common problem it s an issue of not having a width or height properly set

8052876
serializable	deserialization
we re going to be started a project requiring extensive use of json and i m looking at options for handling the serializable deserialization of objects and collections

8052911
getter	setter
ive tried with getter and setter without nothing seems to work

8052962
google-chrome	firefox
turns our firefox 7 is fine with those numeric values and google-chrome gives me invalid value and only accepts integers

8052981
vbscript	jscript
you can connect to wmi by executing script jscript or vbscript using cscript utility directly from java program or using number of interoporability tools like jawin jintegra or jinterop

8053005
width	height
this is false you need to implement this yourself that is you need to store your window state left right width height into a settings file and then load those settings during startup

8053044
dictionary	map
you can exploit map which offers you an efficient dictionary based structure

8053045
openni	kinect
there is a project in development that hooks openni into the kinect sdk

8053045
openni	kinect
the windows kinect sdk driver and the driver generally used with openni sensorkinect cannot coexist

8053072
tablet	mdpi
that tablet is mdpi so the sdk icon is an exact match because it s in drawable facebook_icon and your icon is in drawable-hdpi facebook_icon and the drawable directory without a qualifier is mdpi.

8053076
screens	tablet
i offer a mute option in my application again in the settings screens but although this mutes my sound effects any clickable items that are pressed on the tablet still get the default click sound

8053081
post	get
according to this post - you need to use the wcf web api to get low-level access to the request or use a request parameter that supports streaming mtom

8053089
maven	pom.xml
defined as maven dependency on the three pom.xml

8053135
mouse	keyboard
this way it will be shown automagically both for mouse and keyboard triggers the latter depends on laf

8053147
versioning	upgrade
you might also build in some file upgrading logic...for instance every versioning n of your program keeps around old copies of the definitions of structures for n-1 n-2... so that you re able to write routines that can be used in offering the ability to upgrade old files it encounters

8053150
opera	google-chrome
the code below works on f f but not on google-chrome or opera

8053150
opera	google-chrome
these vars are visible to f f but not to google-chrome or opera variable xxx is undefined

8053150
opera	google-chrome
i can get this to work the svg displays in opera or break in f f by re-arranging code but not in google-chrome

8053150
google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari
it turns out that they re never executed - at least in ie9 ff8 google-chrome opera and safari

8053192
post	get
assuming it was submitted with a form and i use to denote that it can be either a post get value

8053201
post	get
this is because allot of developers have to work with templates and as a php programmer your task would be to take post get input and database rows and make them available to templates as easy to access variables and arrays

8053207
width	height
or diamond has equal width and height and it s only necessary to rotate the square

8053222

i am using multiple stylesheets for different viewport sizes to target the ipad in portrait landscape view

8053247
apache	nginx
there is plenty of information on this issue with apache and a few modules but nothing on nginx

8053249
nscoder	nsobject
i ve been doing ios now for about two years and mostly by consequence of simple data layers no real need for id s joins complex queries etc i ve always managed persistence manually by extending nsobject conforming to nscoder and saving my data in flat files

8053249
getter	setter
for example things like dynamic getter setter are not to clear to me etc

8053257
punctuation	words
i am using the isalpha function to separate the words but isalpha does not differentiate between same strings having different punctuation

8053265
put	get
but if i forget to put in the end i get not found error.

8053275
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i have tried on safari 5.1.1 google-chrome 15 and firefox 7.0.1

8053349
superclass	subclassing
for example if the more-specialized class method is exactly the same as the superclass except for a chunk of code in the middle the superclass would define an extension point method and keep it empty in itself and the subclassing would override

8053360
lattice	hmisc
i am drawing box-percentile plots in r using the box-percentile panel function from hmisc panel.bpplot with bwplot from lattice

8053368
cpu	processors
usually do not cost more than a single cpu cycle on modern processors

8053384
punctuation	words
but if you want to separate words and punctuation is significant then use isspace as a separator

8053386
google-chrome	firefox
i ve code which works fine in firefox and google-chrome but ie 8 doesn t match the regex somehow

8053389
firefox	safari
unfortunatly on mac i have to had a css hack for safari which works but i didn t find anything similiar in firefox

8053420
calendar	gcal
the calendar s url that i provided gcal did not end in a filename i use a php framework with url rewriting

i m stuck authenticating to the europe rackspace cloud with paperclip and fog

8053487

what i need is to get those coordinates probably put it in a variable and use it as coordinates for another svg

8053636
min	max
min max are not supported in indexed views

8053639
integer	unsigned
at unsigned integer arithmetic only carry flags

8053663
onresume	onpause
this would stop the active activity don t forget to unregister the receiver in onpause and reregister it in onresume

8053677
setinterval	settimeout
also use setinterval instead of settimeout to make it work multiple times and then when all are clicked clear the interval

8053692
ireport	subreports
there is a known discomfort or a bug if you want to call it that way with jasper report not being able to set or use relative paths to your project resources subreports images etc especially if you are compiling the reports with the ireport designer tool

8053735
inherited	properties
sounds like you could just inherited from the textbox control and override the text properties

8053746
post	get
you ll need to post more code to get a definitive answer but somewhere one of your variables is nullable and to assign it to a non-nullable type you need to do .value

8053761
folder	directory
php could be used to get and output the list of files and folder see php s directory documenation

8053777
uiview	uiwindow
the view controller s uiview property is embedded inside uiwindow but alongside an additional view controller

8053777
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiwindow	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uiwindow	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiwindow
you would typically add one primary view controller such as a uinavigationcontroller uitabbarcontroller or a generic uiviewcontroller to your uiwindow

8053777
uiview	uiwindow
if you add an additional view controller s uiview property to uiwindow at the same level as your primary view controller via the following

8053785
tiff	png
the file can either be pdf png or tiff and i don t know which on beforehand

8053786
dictionary	map
why not create a mutable map with all the integers in the dictionary as keys 1000000 ints in memory is roughly 3.8m from my measurements and pass through the document list only once where for each document you extract the integers and increment the respective count values in the map for which the integer is key

8053786
dictionary	map
the result is a map with its keys being a number in the dictionary and the value the number of times it appears in the document list

8053786
dictionary	map
i dont verify if the number exists in the dictionary although you only need to init the map with the values and then increment the value in the final map if it has that key

8053799
rhel	suse
i did not find dependency on gcc tried 3.2 3.4 4.1.2 nor linux distro rhel 4 5 suse 10

8053803
int	chars
the problem is that 67 and 70 are not chars -- they are int

8053812
innodb	myisam
you could always convert to myisam ignore-add the index and then convert back to innodb

8053832
portrait	landscape
the problem is my app shall only support landscape but during the rootviewcontroller transition the new view controller appears in portrait mode than quickly rotate to landscape mode

8053846
hash	md5
also to note md5 is not an encryption method it s a hashing algorithm meaning that once the data is hash it can t be recovered

8053887
folder	directory
in a sense that the directory path-to-config is actually being populated with folder like p2 plugins etc.

8053908
width	height
i haver tried removing width 100 to inner div and width problem is solved but not height

8053945
width	height
your inner div picks up 100 of the height width of the parent so it becomes 500x300 but then adds 2px all around for the border so it s really 502x302 and leaks over the parent s border on the right bottom edges

8053948
debian	linux
existing server debian gnu linux 4.0 php version 5.2.0-2 apache 2.2.3

8053948
debian	linux
new server debian gnu linux 6.0 php version 5.3.3-7+squeeze3 apache 2.2.16

8053951
box-sizing	border-box
to prevent the inner div being displayed outside the bounds of the parent add box-sizing border-box to both the parent and the child

8053956
width	margin
for the width just remove the width 100 because a division block-level element will already expand to fill the width of the container automatically better than a 100 width can do because it will consider padding border and margin

8053963
post	put
when i use the classic gnu make i put in post build actions like flash the device if it is a embedded device and other similiar actions

8054120
udp	rtp
in the most simple system you could just use voice packets over rtp over udp

8054138
expander	grid	expander	togglebutton	treeview	expander
to get the expansion part which is why you initially selected a treeview simply use a grid with two rows defined and an expander in the second row bound to the ischecked property of a togglebutton

8054142
express	node.js
so i m doing a web page with node.js and express framework

8054150

but both google-chrome and safari require that you add in your columns to make this example work

8054321
gridview	sqldatasource
i have the following sqldatasource on a gridview

8054358
getter	setter
i ve made a test class with a private setter and a public getter

8054379
getter	setter
both the getter and the setter have to have the same visibility unfortunately

8054397
button	checkbox
in your grid_rowdatabound event handler you can attach a client side onclick event on the button to check the checkbox

8054397
button	checkbox
in that method you have access to the button in the grid as well as the chkselect checkbox s clientid

int	chars
the firs one is more common and works on all systems where the size of an int is greater than the size of a chars

that s why if you put myarg.somenonexistentfunction you won t get any kind of error message until runtime

8058159
ati	nvidia
it doesn t support opencl which is a standard gpgpu library which is supported by ati nvidia

8058232
width	height
here is a very basic code that only work in x axis to show it s possible with injection of an img element with background-image url value as it s src and detecting the background image height and width to calculate if click happened on background image or not

8058232
background-position	background-size
also background-position and background-size are not involved

8058268
folder	directory
documentation etc in the roslyn directory under your my documents folder

8058334
folder	dir
just put them in some folder in your webapp dir and reference them as yourappcontext path-to-your-css in your pages

8058341
background-color	transparency
since you are using a transparency image for your bottom image you need to make sure you don t set a background-color to the container div instead set it to the content div

8058362
hide	show
i need to learn how to show or hide content in my app

8058404
width	height
you can give an element a width or height and it will be the of the width or whatnot of its first non-static parent

8058404
width	height
50 of the parents width from the left edge of that parent and 50 of its height from the top

8058404
width	height
to center the element fully you need to offset it by half its width and height

8058427
wordpress	joomla
i am just starting with wordpress defecting from joomla - having a bit of difficulty getting started

8058435
post	get
from what i get from your post you want to check in equals whether the numeric value represented by your object equals the numeric value of the argument object

8058442
for-loop	arrays
it reads all the pixels into an arrays at the beginning thus requiring only one for-loop

8058469
filesystems	ntfs
ntfs on an ntfs filesystems the modified date of a folder does change if the contents of the folder change

8058469
filesystems	fat
fat on a fat filesystems the modified date of a folder does not change if the contents of the folder change

8058488
folder	directory
this keeps sprockets auto-loading any files in the same directory but not in any folder further

8058526
children	parent
so if the parent s dimensions don t really change it won t be cascaded down to its children

8058605
addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition
i am to create methods of addition subtraction multiplication and devision for each of the classes that has two parameters and a return type of the class

8058610
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i ve tried this on firefox google-chrome and opera on my desktop and none of them do anything - clicking the button does exactly nothing

8058699
move	drag
however while the parts of my code which have drag drop functionality work on an iphone i cannot scroll or move the page in anyway

8058771
ready	each
alternatively put the src in a different attribute on the image like data_orig_src and run the script to set src to data_orig_src on each image upon document ready

8058777
rss	feed
the rss feed url is available a site s meta data if one available

8058781
hash	md5
i could generate a md5 sha1 hash and use only the first 64bits

8058813
int	double
consider a class that represents a numeric value be it a double a float or an int

8058847
x86	64bit
on 64bit x86 cpus your instruction pointer is 64bit long

8058887
mouse	keyboard
i have a simple opengl program that allows you to spawn triangles and quads then move them around using your mouse and some keyboard controls to make complex objects kind of like a 3d model editor

8058892
int	boolean
additionally you re mistreating an int as a boolean which is almost always a bad idea from a maintenance standpoint

8058898
min	max
when new data is available moc observation i add data to plot s data array scatter plot determine the new y-range required min max value in data array and reload the whole plot

8058913
addclass	removeclass
so when i want to do a simple addclass and removeclass for one element this works

8058919
perl	tcl
i don t think you can usefully call those from tcl but you can from perl or python

8058929
ftp	telnet
applications such as telnet ftp passwd fsck rlogin tip ssh and

8058938
memset	malloc
you re malloc ing 512 bytes and you re writing with memset 513 bytes so you ve corrupted the heap

8058958
width	height
creating a popup window from main page with window.open the child popup page uses the onload event which should display it s width height

8058958
width	height
checking both the window s and document s width height with or without jquery will only return 0

8058958
width	height
oddly enough loading the child page in a tab by itself will always report the width height correctly

8058958
width	height
but it seems to just be a guessing game about how long to wait before you check the width height

8059029
post	get
this is a common problem and the cleanest method i know to work around this when using post-redirect-get is to set a cookie in the response to the post and then immediately delete it in the response to the get

8059054
shadowing	named
shadowing means add a new method with the same named without using polymorfism

8059054
shadowing	named
speaking from the point of view of the virtual table or virtual method table if you prefer another named with shadowing the base function and the derived function occupy two different entries in the virtual table also if they have the same named

8059063
ready	each
i m going to assume that generating each chunk is independent therefore you can probably move the work to another thread - then show the chunk when it is ready

8059065
range	minimum
so that works fine except that my value1 or v1 data will generally range from a minimum of 10 to a maximum of 90

8059112
children	parent
the default is cascadetype.none so as a result the update that the parent id has changed doesn t get propagated to the children so hibernate will delete the orphans

8059122
getter	setter
i suppose some people would even extend that philosophy to getter and setter

8059130
chunked	transfer-encoding
that is if your response has transfer-encoding chunked header the original http dissector tries to reassemble the data and if you hook it over with such http_wrapper then reassembling fails

8059133
folder	directory
if you want the user to select a directory on the web server machine then you will need to gather the list of folder that they can select from and present them to them in a tree or other user interface construct that makes sense for the task you wish to perform

8059135
lisp	scheme
it s my understanding that scheme and lisp are related

8059135
lisp	scheme
even if you re not ok with scheme you could surely fork the module to edit it to use your favorite lisp engine without too much trouble

8059166
prng	random
you get the same sequence of random numbers in each process because you seed the prng before the call to fork

8059167
cvs	svn
it s a modern way of thinking about a commits subversion svn and cvs repositories could barely support this style of repository check-ins

8059175
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
you can only do it if you create a browser extension in google-chrome firefox or safari

8059180
ubuntu	linux
if i have a dozen users on my linux machine ubuntu 11.10 what are the security concerns of giving each of them sudo access of apt-get install

8059205
free	malloc
by overriding this you actually destroy the information that free call needs to succeed and really free the malloc d memory

8059208
superclass	subclassing
i have an activity superclass with some utility functionality in it but in order formit to be of general use i d need to also subclassing all those as well

8059214
ant	maven
like an ant script or maven script

8059235
getter	setter
all this does is create getter and setter methods

8059235
getter	setter
the synthesize directive automatically generates the setter and getter for us so all we have to implement for this class is the dealloc method

8059291
explode	implode
according to other answers i need to use the explode implode function but i m not quite sure when and where to implement it

8059311
min	max
except i have no idea how i can include this min max size into the type

8059334
mouse	keyboard
use jquery dojo zepto or any other library for your ajax calls and mouse keyboard events

8059360
realloc	malloc
some variety of realloc trick might then work but i don t think realloc in particular because that s intended to be used on objects that are allocated with malloc and the details of what c function is used to allocate objects in not exposed in objective c so you shouldn t assume it s malloc

8059377
min	max
the only way to do this sort of thing would be to add an interface constraint to size which requires size to have max and min methods or something like that

8059410
ubuntu	linux
i have an ubuntu natty linux server and have several virtualenvs on it

8059421
division	modulo
it does not matter whether you do that by arithmetic manipulation division and modulo by 10 or by converting the numbers into strings but fundamentally your question is precisely about the individual digits of the numbers

8059428
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i thought ie7 and above followed the same box model as google-chrome firefox opera but when i run the following code in ie8 and then in google-chrome firefox opera i get different results

8059428
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
in order to see my problem you need to use ie and then either google-chrome firefox or opera

8059536
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i realize that firefox opera google-chrome have thousands of extensions that extend and alter the ui and for everything else there are bookmarklets

8059536
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome firefox whatever i load up a regular html page with some javascript code

8059553
hide	show
10 of the time this works beautifully the other 90 the tool tip div flashes that is it hide and show infinitely even if the mouse remains still

8059553
mouseover	mouseout
it seems like the mouseover and mouseout events are endlessly firing

8059578
mouseleave	mouseenter
try using mouseenter and mouseleave instead

8059591
min	max
i held the min max of each bucket 24 bits for each bucket entry and made one big struct array for the key-pairs

8059627
jsf	seam
i have a jsf 1.2 seam 2.2.2 application

8059691
ubuntu	linux
i m running a proc now on ubuntu linux that has a definite memory leak and node 0.6.0 is pushing 8gb

8059696
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to the latest eclipse versioning

8059718
post	get
as far as i know all modern browsers ignore the message body of a 302 in response to a get or post and will directly go to the url as specified in location header

8059722
put	get
the fatal error i get is in the locker.comp section of cmd printout however i get a warning just before it which i will also put down briefly

8059726
sorting	grouping
the crux of the issue here is that i was doing ajax binding but wanted to do grouping and sorting

8059726
sorting	grouping
what that required was a manual sorting process that sorted by the grouping column first then the other sorted columns

8059745
google-chrome	safari
all this works in safari and google-chrome

8059766
min	max
any item in the select portion must be in the group by portion if an aggregrate wasn t defined min max sum count etc.

8059790
udp	tcp
udp doesn t require to acknowledge every packet like tcp does ack flag

8059790
udp	tcp
you would be slower because you would have to implement a packet control like in tcp in udp too

8059790
udp	tcp
udp does not acknowledge the receival of packets and it also does not knock on the door to see if anybody is home tcp syn

8059790
udp	tcp
udp packets are easier structured than tcp packets but sacrifice security for their size

8059790
udp	tcp
with a cable that can hold c packets s and tcp at a rate of c packets s and udp at a rate of 8 c packets s udp would be much faster

8059879
client-side	server-side
i ve been working in the j2ee field for several years and tired of writing all those ajax functions which downloading some data from server-side and render on the client-side

8059879
client-side	server-side
is it possible to only write javascript codes that run on both server-side and client-side

8059879
client-side	server-side
rhino is a javascript engine running on j2ee projects but it doesn t provide any means to access both client-side data and server-side data

8059900
gridview	entitydatasource
i d like to use a gridview and entitydatasource in order to save writing crud

8059908
primes	modulus
if you are using rsa properly your modulus should be composed of two primes each one at least 1024bits long

8059988
salt	md5
we have a php application that stores passwords just using the md5 function with no salt

8059988
crypt	hash
any language that uses the crypt 3 library will see that string and know to use sha256 with the given hash and expect the given result

8060069
pop-up	dialog
when the eclipse instance is started while running the test it pop-up a dialog window named usage data upload which blocks the test run until i manually close it

8060073
ubuntu	linux
your code compiled properly on my linux machine ubuntu 10.04 boost-filesystem 1.40 with the following command

8060078
hide	show
using jquery i show hide the span depending on whether there is a value entered into the field

8060087
client-side	server-side
is it possible to only write javascript codes that run on both server-side and client-side

8060101
g++	gcc
note also that while gcc often works for c++ programs you should use g++ instead

8060103
post	get	rss	feed
i m using curl and utf8_encode to get the xml from from an rss feed of blog post from another web site

8060103
post	get
but when someone puts an ellipsis in their post i get a weird characterter which when i view the source code is e2 80 a6

8060103
rss	feed
note the rss feed has charset utf-8 and so does the page where i m trying to present the feed on my site

8060137
put	get
like this the ad will destroy less space on the screen and i can put the ad at a better place to get clicks

8060180
rhel	suse
this code runs fine on linux rhel suse but on windows the memory usage increases as the number of files to create increases near a million files

8060195
int	chars
since chars is an int 8-bit signed int in your case your chars are being promoted to int via sign-extension

8060226
cells	tablecell
my question is when i tap the cells i want to get the label value i know how to get a cells value when tapping the cells but i need to get the label value my code for getting the tablecell value is

8060247
int	chars
then when printing it is converted to int and to keep the semantical equivalence the compiler pads the extra bytes with 0xff so the negative int will have the same numerical value of your negative chars

8060263
int	boolean
won t compile in java because length is an int but the condition part of a while must be a boolean

8060264
ubuntu	linux
ruby 1.9.2 in linux ubuntu

8060410
accessor	properties
i ve seen this happen when i ve accidentally used an accessor to clear a properties on a calayer while within that layer s -dealloc method

8060418
ssl	https
this results in a number of superfluous bugs like the 500 or so related to ssl access because they try to dynamically alter all http schemes to https on the fly

8060430
jlist	jtextpane
on the left side i will be using jlist and on the right side a jtextpane containing long text files

8060461
folder	directory
the code below will create a folder called images under document directory and copy all files from a folder called folderinbundle in your bundle to images

8060545
width	height
just select 2 pictures and write 100 for speed 900 for width and height

8060555
opera	google-chrome
the same seems to happen in all other browsers i have on hand too ie8 google-chrome opera

8060583
width	height
select 2 pictures and write 100 for speed 900 for width and height

8060613
hide	show
in viewwilllayoutsubviews manually show or hide the button depending on the interface orientation

8060623
umask	chmod
with a final chmod to make the newly installed files readable in case umask is set to something restrictive

8060641
ostream	istream
i understand no copy or assign for io objects so that we have to have reference sign for istream ostream objects

8060665
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the date output is displayed in firefox and google-chrome but the date output doesn t display in safari

8060674
google-chrome	firefox
i am using firefox 7.0.1 and google-chrome 15.0.874.106

8060697
width	height
but this code draws some strange type of arc i am sure with the x y width and height params

8060701
int	chars
you need tn convert the int to string chars exactly using

8060709
mouseover	mouseout
use .hover instead of mouseover mouseout

8060723
nullpointerexception	runtimeexception
open up your breakpoints view and you should see a breakpoint listed as a nullpointerexception runtimeexception or exception

8060732
listview	gridview
nikhil just keep in mind that defining a custom adapter is one time practice once you define and understand it properly then you can customize any views like listview gridview gallery spinner

8060759
width	height
and add a tableview of width same as textfield and height whatever you want and place it exactly below the textfield and keep it hidden

8060787
filtering	grouping
in my dataset i got some rows that i don t want to show in the report and i m using for grouping i m using a filtering for that

8060809
express	nowjs
i use express nowjs running on port 8003

8060841
mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave
it should also be noted that mouseenter and mouseleave work somewhat differently and usually much better than mouseover and mouseout

8060878
wxpython	textctrl
here in this extract i am reading output so that i can redirect it to display in a wxpython textctrl in a separate thread

8060885
hide	show
if you want it to slide down and over at the same time then you can use show and hide instead and it will automagically do that for you

8060905
accelerometer	gyroscope
i m running an app that samples accelerometer and gyroscope data overnight

8060908
post	get
i did manage to get the code in beta s post to work on a small test project

8060937
accessor	properties	accessor	ivar
the in the synthesize statement above is entirely optional but it helps to force the distinction between accessing the ivar directly in your code and attempting to use the properties accessor because to use the ivar directly you have to type it out with the underscore

8060943
debian	linux
with gcc it is the -wall option and on linux debian sid gcc 4.6 i m getting with your example file david.c using the gcc -wall -g -o david david.c command

8060976
gif	png
but i have problem with attaching the the png gif wheel image in the original image

8060977
min	max
where i need to configure the min val and max value for sequence in postgresql

8060994
content-disposition	content-type
another solution would be to make a temporary copy of the file in s3 using the put object copy call so you don t need to transfer it to your server and then set the content-type and content-disposition headers on this object to force the download

8061026
button	checkbox
i am trying to parse through a checkbox radio button

8061054
std	ostream
and c++ output is usually better done to std cout using the std ostream standard c++ class

8061086
stdout	fflush
or at least fflush stdout

8061086
stdout	fflush
you need to output newlines or to call fflush because at least on linux the stdout file buffer is line-buffered

8061103
stdout	stderr
it doesn t always print out the output to stdout because by design stdout is buffered output and stderr is unbuffered

8061103
fflush	gets
so data can continue buffering for a long while before it gets fflush

8061104
stdout	stderr
the reason being is that stdout is buffered in order to be more efficient whereas stderr doesn t buffer it s output and is more appropriate for error messages and things that need to be printed immediately

8061104
stdout	fflush
stdout will usually be fflush when

8061197
profiling	benchmarking
as always if in doubt the only thing to do is try both ways and benchmarking profiling them

8061280
post	get
i do not know much about the difference between a http get and a http post so i am hoping to get some information from those more knowledgeable then me

8061280
post	get
however when i change method from post to get it returns the following pass password form_id user_login and when i click this link it does not log me in

8061294
google-chrome	firefox
i need the compatabity for ie firefox google-chrome

8061303
portrait	landscape
this will set image for both mode landscape and portrait

8061319
width	height
concepts.w and concepts.h are simply the width and height of the screen in pixels - or perhaps differently said for a full screen app the screen s resolution

8061399
google-chrome	firefox
so i m using watir webdriver with both firefox and google-chrome

8061399
google-chrome	firefox
however there is one other eccentricity i ve noticed in google-chrome that i haven t noticed in firefox

8061399
google-chrome	firefox
i haven t seen this in firefox - at least not yet - but perhaps google-chrome is giving me an error where firefox hides it

8061407
x86	64bit
to keep this short i was able to break past the 1k thread limit by switching my build config from x86 to 64bit

8061407
x86	64bit
here s the simple program i created that illustrates this artifact be sure to run it as x86 and watch it die somewhere between 1k and 1.5k threads - then switch to 64bit and it should run to completion without failing

8061409
tablet	galaxy
when i run the same app in one of my emulator of samsung galaxy tablet of android 2.2 i am getting the oncreate options menu can anyone help me in this

8061455
png	ico
the png compression is embedded in the ico file for the 256x256 images

8061466
width	height
the following function is similar to your apply_surface function but instead of copying the whole source image to the the given coordinates of the destination it copies a region of a given width and height from the given coordinates of the source image to the same coordinates of the destination

8061472
post	get
after sending a post request you get a cookie that authenticates you for future get requests

8061473
for-loop	arrays
you ve named the arrays as word during the split but you are using the arrays words in the for-loop

8061490
int	double
the method i have used here is arc2d.double double double double double double double int

8061513
maven	m2e
there are exceptions to that rule the m2e plugin for maven integration into eclipse but it has to be implemented by the plugins

8061555
boost	stl
but keep in mind that while using the power of boost you will miss the simple and elegant integration of stl and opencv

8061597
onresume	onpause
i need to restart a timer on onresume because on onpause i call timer.cancel

8061653
for-loop	loops
the problem is that when the sub for-loop breaks the top-level loops also does it

8061739
portrait	landscape
i am already use guideline of issue 178 for convert it into portrait but its not works fine camera open in landscape mode not change its view landscape to portrait

8061758
integer	unsigned
come to think of it i think we did encounter a machine where a right shift of an unsigned integer did not necessarily insert zero bits

8061767
put	get
why don t create another class in which you will put response and in there you will have get and set method

8061776
getter	setter
here is basebasket i cut out the getter and setter

8061820
addeventlistener	onload
from what i understand the code is executed in the order it is printed so i solved this by making sure the addeventlistener is placed before the in the code - and also stop doing this onload

8061841
post	get
here are a few links to get you started with creating multipart post request on android

8061863
tolower	toupper
if you don t want to use tolower there s always toupper which works just as well

8061869
inherited	base-class
this would mean you would have two models ad and housead who both inherited from a base-class

8061880
outputstream	inputstream
use a writer and a reader or an outputstream and an inputstream

8061892
rss	feed
i am trying to build a rss feed that i would like to have custom tags and not the regular tags like title description etc

8061909
int	chars
if sizeof chars sizeof int or pointers in your system have distinct alignment from int 11046 is not the actual pointer value it can be a part of it or something else from the memory near it

8061931
post	put
when i receive this request i want to list all of the post data received with this put request but no post data is received

8061932
inherited	properties
i m using monodevelop 2.4.2 for os x the version that comes with unity 3.4.1 and was wondering if there was some way to inherited comments from the base class or properties

8061932
inherited	properties
it seems like the only solution would be to duplicate the properties comments in the inherited class

8061940
hide	show
you can show hide and replace individual fragments

8061944
inherited	properties
the difference is simply that cmd.exe allows child processes to inherited its own environment while explorer.exe will only apply administrator privileges if it has been told to do so either by right-click and run as administrator or by editing the properties of a shortcut

8061974
globalization	localization
my code uses an explicit date format to work independently of that setting which is not ideal since it might make it problematic in situations where localization globalization is needed

8061989
subtraction	addition
in this answer to a related question there s sample code in c that shows how to do subtraction via addition

8061989
subtraction	addition
let s say we want to calculate a - b where a and b are 4-bit unsigned integers and we want to perform subtraction via addition and get a 4-bit difference and an underflow overflow indication when a b

8061999
google-chrome	firefox
just so we dont get side-tracked ie google-chrome and firefox all report errors

8062035
setinterval	settimeout
settimeout and setinterval break scope so it can t find testmessage when it goes looking for it because that function is scoped inside the anonymous function you pass to ready

8062047
postgresql	mysql
im using postgresql trying to switch to mysql didnt help

8062118
for-loop	loops
in the above case the inner for-loop is actually empty but indentation makes it look as though it contains the following block which is actually an immediate child of the outer loops

8062138
google-chrome	firefox
the code return false can stop dropdown list display in firefox actually the dropdown list display first and hide after a short while but not work in google-chrome

i m thinking along the lines of one thread running an algorithm to find the combinations and another persisting the results to disk and releasing the ram

8064765
maven	pom.xml
if you have to use maven just strip out the plugins from the pom.xml file and only add the dependencies and repos and use an ide to launch the aplication or create a jar

for example when the user rotates the ios device to portrait or landscape mode

8065548
restrict	shared
but you can load extensions at runtime using the dl function but note that it is usually disabled by default on php sapis since at least v5.3 - and if you re working in a restrict environment such as a shared host managed host it will likely be disabled there too regardless if it s sapi cgi fcgi for security reasons

as an aside it might even be useful necessary for the target website to think this script is firefox or google-chrome or a real browser

8066082
width	height
it s argb 32bit for one pixel width height times

8066134

i was able to accomplish this for firefox with the following but it won t work in ie 8 or google-chrome because they don t support explicitoriginaltarget

8067831
free	malloc
if you are writing c code maybe it would be better to use malloc and free

8067902
spaces	delimiter
copy characters one-by-one into the destination buffer but look for spaces and delimiter and remember the last location you copied a non-space character into

8067902
spaces	delimiter
if you see a spaces and the last non-space you copied was the delimiter then skip the spaces

8067902
spaces	delimiter

8068077
google-chrome	firefox
the following function works in google-chrome but not in firefox

8068115

8068178
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
in general you cannot use ignorecase to make certain rules case-insensitive and other rules case-sensitive because there is no straightforward way to set ignorecase just for the pattern of a particular rule.17 to do this use either bracket expressions or tolower

8068211
post	get
i ve got it working to a point login theme changing etc but every time i try to change any settings controls or post a blog post i get a 500 - internal server error

8068246
value-initialization	rvalue
the expression t where t is a simple-type-specifier 7.1.5.2 for a non-array complete object type or the possibly cv-qualified void type creates an rvalue of the specified type which is value-initialization 8.5

8068246
value-initialization	rvalue
that means that int will create an rvalue of type int and value-initialization it

8068246
typedef	typename
the creation of the typedef either directly or through the template creates a typename third type that can be used as a simple-type-specifier first type

8068247
spaces	delimiter
you want to find the delimiter preceded or followed by any number of spaces and replace it all with a single copy of the delimiter

8068247
spaces	delimiter
mick previously posted an answer demonstrating this but he deleted it because he got the regular expression wrong deleting all spaces instead of just the ones abutting the delimiter

8068248
division	multiplication
the somewhat unexpected reason for your results is that python seems to fold constant expressions involving floating-point multiplication and exponentiation but not division

8068248
division	multiplication
if you eliminate the effect of constant folding there s little to separate multiplication and division

8068256
rss	feed

8068349
post	put
if the postman need to deliver a package for example he will put a notice in the mailbox to go to the post office to pick it up

8068349
post	get
you could even get to the post office to find out there is nothing but another pointer to another location

8068355
width	margin
the line setting margin is not working and the console log is outputting 1 0 so the item exists but has no width

8068378
post	put
but if i put this line code db.getcollection post .ensureindex name

max and min overloads with nullable types

8068501

8068734
google-chrome	firefox
i am using firefox 7.01 but in google-chrome the same problems

8068790
inherited	properties
actually you can set up a .vsprops file to specify that include directory and then have all of your projects .vcproj inherited from that properties sheet file.

8068812
margin	height
give your header and footer absolute position and give your body top and bottom margin equal to the height of your header and footer respectively

8068814
do-while	goto
since the body will always get executed and java does not have goto i don t know how a variable declaration in the outermost do-while body scope could be skipped

8068817
int	chars
_stdcall winmain hinstance i hinstance j chars k int l

8068867
ubuntu	linux
i build my android apps with jenkins on a linux ubuntu server and uses bazaar as scm

8069061
octal	decimal
in javascript 022 means 22 in octal 18 in decimal

8069062
hide	show
if you click it it calls a js function to hide it and show a diff element in its place

8069106
octal	decimal
oddly javascript will interpret the number as decimal base 10 even if it has an octal prefix if the number is impossible to reach in octal

8069119
vbscript	jscript
although jscript wasn t mentioned by name jscript is available from windows 95 throughout all windows os s and uses the same wsh as vbscript

8069131
post	put
put post this works when i create a new record with the create action however when it redirects to the show action clicking the back button doesn t do anything and you must refresh the browser in order for the index page to appear

8069131
post	put
put post id same as above except through the update action

8069139
hide	show
your best bet is to change the to an since looking at your page it s apparent that you want to make it a navigation item and while you re at it add a href some text and use additional css to hide it to let your image show through

8069152
vbscript	jscript
since you re working with ie you may be able to use either vbscript or jscript but i doubt you ll be able to disable the reload button

8069180
hide	show
but since we needed to support a feature to allow user to show hide certain blocks interactively we plan to use silverlight for rendering the graphic

8069188
prepare	execute
you ll probably prepare this dictionary only once at some early stage like in a constructor or a static initializer so that it is ready when your later code execute

8069275

this happens in firefox google-chrome safari

google-chrome	firefox
i am trying to insert a color div before a checkbox using .before method of jquery 1.5.1 which runs alright on firefox google-chrome ie8+

8069574
punctuation	words
sequence of words ended by a punctuation can be matched with something like

8069637
innodb	myisam
guess localdb is myisam production db is innodb which does not support full-text searches required by match against

8069667
n-gram	words
if you want the n-gram probabilities you want the product of all the probabilities in the path from the root to the last words

8069697
opera	safari
for instance opera and safari do not prevent javascript from writing to the cookie

8069715

8069776
width	height
i have a textview with both width and height set to wrap_content and max_lines set to 2

8069925
getter	setter
instead either use an auto-property recommended if you don t need direct access to the backing field and are not doing any other operation in your getter setter

8069931
postgresql	mysql
in our django project we have models pulling data from postgresql mysql oracle and ms sql server there are various issues depending on the database but it all generally works

8069992
gif	png
i also added a specific ignore route for the occasional apple touch icon request using a wildcard for the different dimensions and allowed for the different file extensions for the favicon google toolbar and some other browsers look for png and gif favicons

8070111
teamcity	psake
the way i have got teamcity working with teamcity version 6.5.4 i must add is to use the teamcity module that is provided in the psake download

8070113
width	height
i want to get the height and width of my jframe so that a graphic should be at the same relative position even if the window is resized

8070113
width	height
to do this i am trying to get the height and width in my constructor but it always returns 0

8070155
width	height
the resulting code can be a bit confusing to work with as the width becomes the height and visa versa but it might still be a better solution than moving the div around with javascript

8070175
tolower	toupper
you can use tolower or toupper for example

8070187
ubuntu	linux
i am using ubuntu linux distro

8070192
int	chars
if you need to read int that are not 2 4 8 or 16 bytes long you ll have to read into a chars array and extract the numbers manually with algebraic operations for a 3-byte int

8070210
qicon	qtablewidget
i have tried numerous ways to display a qicon in a qtablewidget cell and i am not sure why it is not working

8070211
django-tinymce	django-filebrowser
if you are already using django-tinymce you can integrate django-filebrowser with it

8070238
put	get
i think loadpcmfrombytearray is what you are looking for provided you know what values to put in the pcm bytearray to get the sound you want

8070271
put	get
i ve posted this quick question to try and get some quick responses but if you need any more info just ask me i ll put it straight up

8070332

however the update create and delete part i didnt meaning put post and delete

8070363
mouse	keyboard

8070377
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
tested in all major browsers google-chrome opera firefox internet explorer

8070381
repo	egit
i don t think egit will connect to your git repo easily in this mode but your eclipse specific project files will be in a different location than your source tree

8070381
repo	egit
then using will allow you to connect egit to the already existing git repo

8070388
gmail	hotmail
but with gmail i am able to send messages hotmail etc

8070399

again the video works fine in ie9 safari and google-chrome but no goin ie6-7 or firefox and opera

8070413
mongodump	mongoimport
the counterpart to mongodump is mongorestore and the counterpart to mongoimport is mongoexport -- the major difference is in the format of the files created and understood by the tools dump and restore read and write bson files

8070413
csv	tsv
export and import deal with text file formats json csv tsv

8070423
sqldatasource	entitydatasource	sqldatasource	linqdatasource	linqdatasource	entitydatasource
entitydatasource sqldatasource linqdatasource name it you provide low-level access details in your declarative code

in the example the width must come first than the height

8070489
post	put
the firefox add-ons sdk only allows put and post requests via its api

8070501
helpers	actioncontroller
i have tried including actioncontroller urlwriter modules and actionview helpers urlhelper with no luck

8070506
mouse	keyboard
i don t know of a way in firemonkey to capture mouse and keyboard events at the application level in a platform agnostic way

8070506
keydown	mousedown
however by default firemonkey forms get all of the mousedown and keydown events before the controls do

8070506
keydown	mousedown
if you simply override the mousedown and keydown events on your form you ll accomplish the same thing

8070506
mouseup	mouseleave	mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mouseleave	keyup	mouseup	mouseleave	keyup
if you want you can keep going with mousemove mouseup mousewheel mouseleave keyup dragenter dragover dragdrop and dragleave

8070520
disk	ram
vsuite ram disk

8070520
disk	ram
the vsuite ram disk on the other hands works very well

8070527
post	put
it will let you use your ff browser to test post put delete methods

8070532
kde	gnome
although i am still new at linux and the destop environemnts i want to know if i can develop kde based applications from a system using gnome as its desktop environment

8070537
std	ostream
i cannot understand why assigning cout to test std ostream is ok to compile but the compiler produces error messages for the rest like stdout1_ cout

8070542
rss	feed
i m trying to add a rss feed to the site so i edited the header.php file that s where it s going

8070553
memset	malloc
i think that memset initializes the buf variable with size of bufsiz but malloc also allocates a block of size bufsize of memory and returning a pointer to the beginning of the block to the variable buf.

8070557
int	chars
i thought a for-loop that goes through every chars in the original string and builds two separate strings inside would work but i could only think to base the separation on int and alphabetic chars which would make something like pr405j turn into prj and 405

8070569
getter	setter
bottom line as i ve always heard it you should always use the synthesized getter and setter

8070569
getter	setter
however there are times when you need to access the variable directly especially when you may override the synthesized getter or setter to return set some processed data but need to also access the raw data from inside the class

8070569
getter	setter
say in this example you wanted to use the default setter but you wanted to override the getter to always return a normalized version of the first name sorry i know its weird but i can think of a better example off the top of my head

8070582
memset	calloc
note that you can also use calloc to allocate memory initialized with 0 so you can avoid the memset call

8070587
folder	directory
another possibility is to create virtual directory for each of your sites which all point to the same library folder

8070624
post	put
once you have started one of these clients you should be able to send requests using put post delete or even one of the other less common http methods

8070633
updatepanel	scriptmanager
ps there is a scriptmanager and a updatepanel on the page just in case..

8070660
std	ostream	ostream	noncopyable
you need to use a pointer because references do not allow rebind and std ostream is noncopyable

8070661
put	get
in order to update a record i d first have to get that record by calling findbyid which would put the record into the session cache

8070678
postgresql	mysql
but the most general solution has to avoid automatic series generators like postgresql s generate_series and common table expressions because mysql doesn t support them

8070699
hide	show
i have two buttons hide show liked and hide show disliked that when clicked toggle all liked posts or toggle all disliked posts

8070703
listview	gridview	gridview	datalist
i would use a listview or datalist instead of a gridview

8070743
width	height
given the width height ratio of your input you may choose some different small resolution

8070751
button	checkbox
use docmd.runsql insert into ... as many times you need as given by the radio button and the selected checkbox

8070855
tinyint	nvarchar
conversion failed when converting the nvarchar value xxxxxxxxx to data type tinyint

8070880
width	height
and then i make some operations like tracking objects but it s have very bad performance i mean every about 200 ms i get new frame when removing the lines 5 6 that set the width height i get very good performance.

8070899
maven	cobertura	cobertura	emma
if you re going to stick with maven and want a plugin for maven that will do the code-coverage job i think cobertura is a better choice as emma stable last build is from 2005

8070899
maven	cobertura
according to the cobertura site it supports code coverage in maven 1 and maven 2 environments

8070899
maven	pom.xml
a problem exists between pom.xml configurations of maven 2 and maven 3

8070899
cobertura	emma
sonar has cobertura embedded also options to embedd emma and some people state that they had successfully reported code coverage despite they had problems using the stand-alone cobertura plugin

8070915
portrait	landscape
jquery mobile form validation even with landscape portrait distinction

8070916
getter	setter
and added getter and setter method for it

8070918
button	checkbox
such as unchecking any checkbox checks the radio button even if other checkbox are checked or entering and clearing the text box when no other checkbox are checked etc

8070941
for-loop	loops
the for-loop does not create a separate closure for each iteration through loops

8070965
std	ostream
i cannot understand why assigning cout to test std ostream is ok to compile

8071006
google-chrome	firefox
i am able to access the session variables in google-chrome 15 and firefox 7

8071020
portrait	landscape
if so you have to support both landscape as well as portrait orientation otherwise apple will reject it

8071029
int	chars
it depends on what you mean by convert an int to chars

8071029
int	chars
if you mean transforming the int 1 into the chars 1 you can do it like this

8071054
google-chrome	firefox
i can always use firefox to look at it but i use google-chrome as my main browser and i would really like this too work

8071143
int	chars
you should look in java s api at and use the string classes substring int beginindex method after you find the index of your specified chars so

8071166
nsscanner	nsregularexpression
you may also consider using nsscanner or nsregularexpression

8071167
disk	ram
for msmq 1.0 and msmq 2.0 the combined size of messages capable of being stored on one machine is not limited to the amount of ram in the machine or the size of the hard disk but to the amount of virtual address space provided to the msmq service by the operating system this limitation has been lifted in msmq 3.0

octal	hex
if you re using 17 backslash escape it will be interpreted as as 0017 where 17 would be an octal digit equals to f hex

8071256
implements	extends
if you are coming from java it can sound strange at first it was the same for me but actually now i find it s more regular syntax then java s where i need to explicitly say whether i want to implements or extends other class interface

8071256
implements	extends
it does not actually matter whether you are saying extends or implements

8071256
implements	extends
just try to replace extends implements with with is a and it becomes more clear

8071256
implements	extends
with this you are saying that bar does not extends implements foo directly but all other classes that want to extends bar should also extends foo

8071334
implements	extends
first note that the extends implements difference tells nothing to the compiler than it would not know

8071334
implements	extends
in c# you write class a b c d instead of both class a extends b implements c d and class a implements b c d

8071340
post	get
how do i get my facebook application to automatically ask for the required permissions post installation

8071363
int	double
i use math.pow a b now but it returns a double and that is usually a lot of work and looks less clean when you just want to use int a power will then also always result in an int

8071379
children	parent
in category model belongsto parent and hasmany children both have the class category and foreign key parent_id

i am noticing an unexplained behaviour when comparing scipy s 0.9.0 and matplotlib s 1.0.1 delaunay triangulation routines

8071382
matplotlib	scipy
scipy s edges are missing some of my points while matplotlib s are all there

8071423
mouse	keyboard
also i included code to make sure the text gets selected if you click on the textbox with the mouse and not just keyboard focus it

8071424
google-chrome	safari
i can reproduce the error in safari google-chrome

8071452
int	double
you first need to cast to decimal or double to avoid int division

8071495
put	get
i d also study up a bit on the mvc model view controller design pattern so you get more comfortable knowing where to put app logic

8071502
rss	feed
i wrote my own thing to handle rss feed

8071502
rss	feed
you now have an object containing a list of each entry from the rss feed

8071502
rss	feed
you should be able to use this with no changes for standard rss feed

8071539
post	get
the first security-constraint does not have any auth-constraint so the get and post methods are available to anyone without login

8071565
width	height
same logic is applied to column definitions only regarding width instead of height

8071565
expander	grid
the parent grid is also stopped since the template for expander uses dockpanel that is also a stopping panel

8071565
expander	grid
the expander is not stopped the child grid is not stopped since the grid assumes it has infinite height available thus the list box is not stopped the scrollviewer in the template of list box is not stopped so it s viewportheight is infinite for the virtualizingstackpanel that arranges the items and is a child of the scroll viewer this means all items are in the view render all elements

8071632
postgresql	mysql
is there a tool to create python code from an existing database mysql postgresql

8071694
fgets	splfileobject
if you want to read every 5th line you could use an splfileobject to make life a little easier than the fopen fgets fclose family of functions

8071701
keydown	keyup
you can just toss the whole event object that a keyup keydown keypress whatever was directly into an array

8071744
google-chrome	firefox
server socket receives 2 http requests when i send from google-chrome and receives one when i send from firefox

8071771
submit	submission
i m curious because i just asked a question regarding webkit not submission my form if the submit button is hidden display none

8071847
width	height
size.x y is the width height of the window

8071855
hide	show
this is ugly and i was wondering if there was a function which controls the hide show of this window

8071866
integer	unsigned
a perhaps more common cause other than actually running out of memory of course is an unsigned integer wrap around case where a uin32_t or uint64_t is used to allocate memory but was 0 and had 1 subtracted from it leading to a very large request allocation in 64-bits that would be many thousands of petabytes

8071885
folder	directory
it pulls the code from a github repository creates a new folder in var www releases timestamp and symlinks the document root var www current to that directory

8071903
ldd	glibc
just do ldd on your app and see which are used ok not that much but certainly glibc

8071903
profiler	gprof
use gprof and the visual studio built-in profiler and compare time spent in different functions

8071909
submit	submission
the standard does not say anything about a submit button being necessary in the submission process

8071917
wmv	asf
everytime i try to convert asf file to wmv

8071959
hide	show
show and hide work but i have to do this

8072001
userprincipal	directoryentry	principalcontext	userprincipal	principalcontext	directoryentry
i don t understand why you re using the new principalcontext userprincipal stuff in your first example but fall back to the hard to use directoryentry stuff in your second example..

8072119
dictionary	map
you can simplify your code by using a dictionary to map weekday names to numbers

8072152
google-chrome	firefox
i ve found this trickling down to be there in google-chrome but not in firefox

8072160
width	height
however the methods that take in a height width or a rectangle are different

8072160
width	height
those methods either ignore the height and width or with the rectangle only use the top and left

8072180
skip-lists	tree
as measured using open jdk 6 on typical production hardware my company uses you can expect all add and query operations on a skip-lists map to take roughly double the time as the same operation on a tree map

8072203
rtp	rtsp
to be more open for interoperability you might prefer to implement some well known protocol for data streaming over network such as rtsp rtp

8072208
width	height
height and width are both correctly set to the resolution of the camera

8072231
min	max	minimum	max
can anyone tell me how to select the minimum and the maximum from a table using the min and max and union keywords

8072234
rss	feed
you can either tell simplexml to skip them default or to read them see read cdata from a rss feed

8072252
imageview	viewswitcher
rather than loading all the images at once perhaps try something like a viewswitcher with two child imageview

8072304
ffmpeg	libavformat
libavcodec libavformat and other ffmpeg projects - a wide range of codecs to use

8072322
width	height
in ie8 block elements with a set width height will display properly but mouse events and linking only work for text inside of that element

8072364
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
in firefox google-chrome and opera that is working pretty well but when i try to append child no matter if i m using jquery or not ie gives me a unspecified error

8072374
for-loop	loops
in the case of a for-loop the increment operator is called entirely independent of when it is evaluated so think of it as a line at the end of loops by itself either being

8072384
subclass	accessor
first always keep in mind the implications of accessor mutators being virtual as all objective-c methods are. in general it s been said that one should avoid calling virtual methods in init and dealloc because you don t know what a subclass will do that could mess you up

8072395
portrait	landscape
you pass a cgpoint where 0 0 represents the top left of the picture area and 1 1 represents the bottom right in landscape mode with the home button on the rightâ this applies even if the device is in portrait mode

8072396
min	max
note that this can return more than 2 rows if there is more than one row with the same min or max value

8072396
min	max
it could also return just one row if both min and max happen to come from the same row you could use union all to avoid that

8072396
min	max
btw your query means get min sal and then get the ename from a random row and the same for max

8072396
min	max
in both min and max cases the mysql decided to return the same random row

8072427
opera	google-chrome
at this moment i have that problem on my two computers and i cant login using google-chrome ie and opera

8072445
versioning	upgrade
so you can also just upgrade to at least that versioning

8072459
int	chars
builder.length and word.length are int - the number of chars in each word

8072470
hash	salt
well what i do with my apps is usually create a special id by taking the hash from the machine name found in environment concat it with a hash value of my app s name and then apply a salt probably not even necessary but it helps to be paranoid to produce a fingerprint for an app machine combo

8072500
super	self
the point of this is that the super implementation could return a different but still valid object than the current value of self

8072500
super	self
however since it returned a different object the super implementation should have released the old self which is what you are returning

8072500
super	self
this code reassigns self to be the value returned by the super initializer instead of just assuming the value returned is the same

8072511
actualheight	actualwidth
actualwidth actualheight rendersize are set by

8072519
mouseleave	mouseenter
i highly recommend using jquery s mouseenter and mouseleave events

8072521
children	parent
this works because the lifespan of the children is bounded by the lifespan of the parent

8072521
children	parent
hibernate knows that it should remove the children when it removes the parent and therefore avoids violating the constraint

8072521
children	parent
it deletes the children and then the parent

8072559
versioning	upgrade
yes when an rpm upgrade occurs rpm first installs the new versioning of the package and then uninstalls the old versioning of the package

8072559
uninstall	upgrade
but your scripts pre post preun postun need to know whether they are handling an upgrade or just a plain install or uninstall

8072569
vmware	virtualbox
just make sure you are getting the physical nic s mac address and not a virtual mac created by vmware or virtualbox

8072603
centos	linux
i want open pop3 port on my centos linux box with etc services

8072605
hide	show
sure all you need to do is attach an onmouseleave event listener to the container div so that when the mouse moves away it will check if that div .content_inner has been show and if so hide it

8072646
gridview	formview
i have an xml file called answers.xml and i need to connect gridview formview etc.

8072652
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox and google-chrome and it works with ie getting the page from the old server

8072664
matplotlib	scipy
which somehow installs numpy 2.0 scipy 0.11 matplotlib 1.2 ipython 0.12 pandas 0.5.1 as well as pymc 2.2 alpha

8072665
debian	linux
debian like most other linux distributions comes with python installed as standard as many of the system tools depend on it

8072684
gridview	sqldatasource
but when i execute this procedure and using sqldatasource and show results in gridview rows aren t in the same order as it should be

8072732
portrait	landscape
the problem is that i want the player to be able to play both in landscape mode and portrait

8072732
portrait	landscape
in the manifest.xml file - you can tell the game to play on just portrait or just landscape mode

8072734
portrait	landscape
i use this code to set my app to portrait as opposed to landscape

8072738
versioning	upgrade
i did like to first upgrade the solution from 2005 to 2010 first and then actually change the framework versioning but you may get better mileage with a different method

8072780
entities	entitymanager
which for instance looks to the modules defined check if there is a entities directory and add s this to the doctrine entitymanager

8072789
versioning	upgrade
upgrade it to a more recent versioning of rails 3.0.x

8072852
punctuation	words
but technically hello there all first are all words that are spelt correctly...just that there s punctuation between them making them wrong

8072852
punctuation	words
at the same time i don t want to just strip away all the punctuation in a words because for words like don t won t can t it requires the apostrophes to be marked as correctly spelt

8072858
postgresql	mysql	ingres	postgresql	ingres	oracle	ingres	firebird	ingres	mysql
firstly i noticed that these are the most common names when it comes to relational database management systems - - db2 ibm oracle microsoft sql ingres mysql postgresql and firebird

8072858
postgresql	mysql
while mysql exclude enterprise version postgresql and firebird are open source and free

8072865
fitnesse	jbehave
look into jbehave or fitnesse

8072889
portrait	landscape
my app supports both portrait and landscape orientation so the tableview sometimes needs to be scrolled when the device rotates

8072890
hide	show
however you have several element that you want to hide show i m not sure when you want to do so so it may be easier to use a different method of selecting the elements such as getelementsbytagname or getelementsbyclassname but it depends on your html and what you re actually trying to do

8072907
hide	show
so if you wanted to hide all and show one you could do that with this function

8072925
mdpi	hdpi
what you should do in this case is make a 50px x 40px button for mdpi and make a 75px x 60px these are x 1.5 for hdpi etc

8072935
matplotlib	chaco	matplotlib	scipy
either will install numpy scipy matplotlib ipython traits and chaco on window osx or linux

8072965
postgresql	mysql
note also that some platforms scale better when adding more servers mysql and others do better when increasing your server resources postgresql

8072968
skype	hangout
is there any way i can outsource this to existing services such as the hangout feature in google+ the new video chat in facebook or the skype api

8072973

8072983
filtering	grouping
input a set of maps a database table output a report grouping on one of the columns filtering on a predicate with aggregate functions applied to the columns

8072990
put	get
however if i put a messagebox.show in the catch - the io exception catches one time - get the message box displayed and then hitting the ok button has the effect of unbusying the file to allow the file.move operation to proceed

8073004
jax-ws	jax-rs
other than that a simple servlet or a real webservice api like jax-rs jax-ws is really the best way

8073005
lapack	fftw
matlab adds a layer to anything it calls fftw lapack mkl

8073009
background-repeat	background-size	background-repeat	background-image	background-repeat	background-position	background-position	background-size	background-image	background-color	background-image	background-size	background-image	background-position
this property defined background-color background-image and background-repeat explicitly however background-position background-clip background-size etc

8073019
post	get
is the array idea the best idea if so how do i get the contents of the array from the ajax or is there a better way and how do i do the ajax call if i am not doing a post of anything

8073070
unsigned	short
this will fix the cannot convert parameter 1 from _bstr_t to unsigned short error

8073078
touchesbegan	touchesended
i ve tried variations of overriding touchesbegan touchesended touchesshouldcancel etc.

8073131

you are converting the text to double and then saving the value in an int

8073220
portrait	landscape
i added orientation to my app for landscape and portrait without many problems and it works

8073233
width	height
as for problem #1 i would look at the width height ratio of your button and pick actual pixel dimensions based on that but larger than the model 50 x 40 px

8073258
width	height
both the custom sliding drawer and parent both specify layout width and height attributes

8073281
google-chrome	firefox	put	get
i have the code blow for tabbing through 2 fields and it has no effect in ie and google-chrome it seems it runs nothing for example i get nothing when i put alert and in firefox it runs with some bug it jumps twice there where do you think the problem is i m developing in by asp.net and jquery version 1.3.2

8073319
keydown	keyup
you ll need to use keyup or keydown

8073320
nsurl	nsstring
i m sure it s not possible to retrieve the original nsurl from the nsstring

8073331
public	protected
a method or variable which is not declared to be public private or protected is thereby package protected and can therefore be accessed by any class in that package

8073336
kde	gnome
i ve no idea if either gnome 3 or kde support displaying libappindicator notifications anywhere.

8073338
superclass	subclassing
now on the other hand if you want a function of a subclassing to call a method of a superclass that can be done

8073368
inherited	properties
all objects inherited a constructor properties from their prototype

8073407
mouseleave	mouseenter
i also agree with the other answer about using .hover in place of mouseenter and mouseleave but that alone will probably not solve your problem with ie

8073433
switching	screens
when ever i try to switching back to the original view i just get a blank screens for reasons i cant understand

8073452
accessor	superclass	accessor	properties	superclass	subclassing
i have an abstract superclass with constructor and accessor for the shared properties and a subclassing

8073452
superclass	subclassing
i assume therefore that there is an issue with my superclass and subclassing

8073452
superclass	subclassing
trying to create objects from the superclass customer and subclassing stcustomer

8073481
int	boolean	int	chars
iterate through the string chars by chars and have a boolean keeping track of when you find a chars that can be interpreted as an int hint is_int

8073481
int	chars
if you are in an int keep track of the chars you are traversing and concat them onto a string

8073481
int	chars
as soon as you find a chars that is not an int stop concatting onto the string

8073492
post	get
currently the system is getting the post first and then going to the server again to get the latest comments to display thought of getting them in one shot since we are displaying only one comment initially .

8073570
accelerometer	gyroscope
the app uses cmmotionmanager to sample accelerometer gyroscope data at a rate of 20 times per second

8073612
single-quotes	double-quotes
also in many cases unmatched quotes single-quotes double-quotes or backquotes are not an error

8073619
int	chars
sizeof int in c++ will be 4 bytes chars

8073630
post	get
i want to replace that by updating after i get a post in a controller

8073648
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
update tested in firefox opera and safari it seems to be only a google-chrome issue

8073648
google-chrome	safari
it s not even a webkit issue unless google-chrome s got a newer version than safari

8073676
superclass	subclassing
you have to explicitly call the desired superclass constructor else the compiler will add super as the first statement in you subclassing constructor

8073689
children	parent
2 use the ancestry gem to model parent children - it has very convenient methods to get to the parent ancestors or descendants

8073724
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
use a uiviewcontroller instead of a uinavigationcontroller

8073748
super	self
because you called super goblin self .__init__ self power maxhp magic maxmp speed name without difficulty

8073754
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox are fine of course

8073767
getter	setter
don t forget to generate getter setter

pull	push
so we ran into a problem where if you rebase your branch on top of master and them push the other guys who was working on your branch does a pull and gets all kind of merge conflicts b c the rebase has rewritten history and the commits are not the same as they were on the branch

8073921
subtract	add
knowing these items will enable you to calculate the time at the target location subtract local offset add target offset

8073930

the type option allows you to specify get or post

8073935
put	get
i have a wcf service and i am able to get from it but i canâ t work out how to put to it

8073966
ethernet	wireless
now if you use a router you will know that the router is connected to the modem and is distributed through the router either through a wireless connection or ethernet connection the cord the way the router organizes things is each computer is assigned a private ip address something like 192.168.1.2 .

8073978
mouse	keyboard
it can be a mouse or keyboard event

8073985
base	fractions	floating-point	fractions
remember that floating-point values are represented using a sections of the 64-bits for the whole part and a section for the fractions part and a section to represent an exponent in base 2 -- it s all very esoteric stuff differs from machine to machine and i think the only formal definition is found in the accursed necronomicon

8074006
int	double
i ve been searching online for hours and hours and can t find anything that doesn t use double string int or object as the binding for the vector class

8074026
nsstring	nsdata
response to comment both nsdata and nsstring feature length

8074038
for-loop	arrays
to reach them you can iterate cursor using for-loop double the number of times than result of getcount and use the cursor to fill record_id numbers into an arrays

8074060
super	self
remove the second self from the call to super goblin self .__init__ self ...

8074060
super	self
symptom self is automatically passed to super class self .some_method ... so putting it in there yourself is like calling enemy.__init__ self self difficulty power ...

8074060
super	self
added difficulty to the call to super goblin self .__init__ ...

8074120
viewdidload	viewwillappear
in the viewwillappear the viewdidload and nothing seems to work

8074161
hide	show
the question is how to hide completely all the inlines when the mainmodel instance is being created the modeladmin s add_view and to show the inlines for relatedmodel1 when the type field of the mainmodel instance is true and show the inlines for relatedmodel2 when false

8074202
integer	unsigned
look at unsigned integer parsers for info on how to tune that behaviour

8074218
google-chrome	firefox
i am particularly interested in firefox and google-chrome implementations of localstorage

8074257
getter	setter
you should use getter and setter methods for your private variables

8074257
getter	setter
you should then always use your setter and getter methods to access your variable instead of accessing it direct

8074274
post	put
it could be that you are using http post when your attribute says put

8074316
keylistener	jmenuitem
if i click the jmenuitem to restart it restarts fine clears everything and the keylistener still functions

8074354
mongodb	bson
mongodb uses bson not json so you need to re-encode anyways

8074359
post	get
the php manual offers a few examples to make get and post calls with curl

8074396
photoshop	fireworks
i use photoshop or fireworks

8074402
vim	sublimetext
i have found the vim mode in sublimetext 2 to be fantastic along with the great extensions and awesome performance makes it one of the best 59 i ve spent all year

8074410
post	put
i would have put it as a note under your post like you and verofairy have done but i don t know how to do that yet

8074415
matplotlib	scipy
it is an excellent and very thorough step-by-step guide to installing 64-bit numpy scipy and matplotlib on mac os x 10.6 though it seemed to be equally helpful for 10.7

8074415
matplotlib	scipy	libjpeg	libpng
this resource is useful because it discussed in detail what always seems to be the problem for me--numpy and scipy are ok but matplotlib fails and it fails because of libpng libjpeg et al

8074415
matplotlib	scipy
some empirically likely causes of a failed install of numpy scipy matplotlib all unfortunately based on personal experience

8074415
zlib	libpng	freetype	libpng
libpng freetype zlib all matplotlib dependencies

8074421
dictionary	map
since the map function transforms a list or a dictionary

8074429
width	height
this would select iframe tags with width 160 and height 600

8074437
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works in google-chrome and safari but of course not firefox which in my opinion is fast becoming the new internet explorer

8074437
google-chrome	safari
to see it work correctly in google-chrome and safari go to

8074443
rss	feed
i use google reader to browse through various rss feed

8074443
rss	feed
i mean when i go view the source of any given rss feed it shows a finite list of say 20 items

8074487
octal	hex
you can use the --non-decimal-data option of gawk to cause it to handle octal and hex numbers in the input

8074492
rss	feed
in short yes google probably stores rss histories to provide you with a history beyond what the current feed shows

8074500
pop-up	dialog
display must be one of pop-up + dialog iframe touch async hidden or none

8074511
for-loop	loops
to slow the animation down you will have to restructure your code such that you execute each iteration of the for-loop in a settimeout and when that timeout finishes and executes you then schedule the next settimeout with the next iteration of loops

8074513
width	height
i am always rotating by 90 degress or -90 width becomes height and vice versa so i should stay the same quality

8074530
debian	linux
now i need to autobuild this project under the latest debian gnu linux

8074583

ubuntu	linux
but a library that will work on linux im using ubuntu

8074635
dlsym	dlopen
something like dlopen and dlsym

8074690
redhat	fedora
if you want a portable python distro that runs on fedora or any other distro have a look at currently you have to build it on an ubuntu system but the resulting tarball includes all shared library dependencies and runs on redhat rpm style distros and suse rpm style distros

8074692
public	protected
either directly by making its visibility public package or better by keeping it private protected and allowing access through a public getter method

8074720
put	get
using the above scheme i m able to get put resources under the user s directory but also the directories resources belonging to other users

8074790
width	height
the overhead of downloading the image drastically outweighs the actual time spent finding its width and height

8074791
onchange	onfocus
i ve tried attaching onfocus onevent and onchange handlers to the anchor on page two but it s not working

8074808
google-chrome	firefox

i have defined 2 macros min a b and max a b as

8074832
post	get
from url to php get method from php to js json with jsonencode ajax and finally a post or get in ajax to a php page

8074836
button	checkbox
an alternative way of implementing would be to use a custom listadapter that switches over the item type being rendered and selects the appropriate component to use checkbox button image whatever

8074857
post	get

8080914
put	get
but the problem still seems to be there and here is the best part when i try to debug if i put a breakpoint within the loop that this method is being called so that it pauses a bit before it calls the generator method then i get new unique obstacles but if i let the loop run and generate them all i inspect the array and find out that they are all the same objects

8080957
hash	salt
your salt isn t following that so the hash function is probably failing completely though i m not certain

it must works with firefox google-chrome and ie

also as you pointed out earlier gethashcode gets called you should get a compiler warning that you ve overridden equals but not gethashcode

minus of js svg vml is that there aren t such powerfull developing tools as in flash case but if we use some library like application won t require flash plug-in

uiview	subviews
my suggestion create a uiview below the table view then put the table view as a subviews of that view and then you can manage its size as being not full screen

8081719
sorting	grouping
if you don t want the inefficiency of sorting the items within each grouping consider using an o n maxby method such as the one from morelinq

8081723
explode	substr
otherwise you are going to store every substr location and that will explode your memory

8081753
explode	substr
you re doing things in the wrong order first explode on the quotes so you ll isolate quoted substr easily then explode based on the spaces

8081820
for-loop	arrays
you are creating your tabpanel inside the for-loop which is creating one tabpanel per arrays item with each tabpanel having a list bound to a store with a single record

8081828
post	get
i would make sure you are actually invoking a get and not a post as the method

8081828
post	get
if you are submitting a form it defaults to post which would mean you don t have a matching route the route you listed above only works for get requests

8081923
getter	setter
this means that i can easily call getter and setter but i immediately get a segmentation fault when trying to call a function that overwrites a virtual base class functions

8081937
maven	pom.xml
with the transitive dependencies declared even if they are used explicitly the maven pom.xml becomes more verbose

8081947
min	max
if you just replace the min function with a max function the algorithm will lead to a-b-c but the longest path is a-d-c

8081947

then you can use max instead of min to find the longest path

8082111

8082264
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome ie firefox and create an extension which would forward my wcf messages to a browser

8082314
pthreads	fork

8082407
hash	salt
include a salt to prevent the attacker from relying on generic hash tables

8082430
width	margin
unless you have a specific reason for formatting the page in that manor which is entirely possible given this looks like an extracted test case i would make the inner div width relevant to the outer div plus some margin and then expand the outer div instead

8082430
width	margin
instead of using a width i d try margin on the left and right to get the effect your going for so dynamic resizing is easier

8082516
addclass	removeclass
if li.slidenum first has a class of active addclass disabled to li.prev else removeclass active from li.prev

8082531

i ll skip getter and setter for primitves

8082703

but in the 2nd case where the user picks an image form the photo library i get an nsurl which i want to convert to an nsstring to be able to save it in

8082759

8082773
for-loop	loops
try a for-loop where it only loops twice

8082802

8082868
postgresql	mysql
i am almost close to settling with mysql over postgresql over the reasons i wrote on my blog here

8082868
postgresql	mysql
it s often said that mysql is the most used rdbms among those that are available for free alongside postgresql firebird etc

8082874
min	max
for min max scenarios i d want that as an option but obviously something like a sum would make it hard for the component to know what the source row it d tie to

8082907
post	get
in the same way i can get the user post

8082910
cgpoint	cgrect
there are four uiview methods which can help you converting cgpoint and cgrect from one uiview coordinate reference to another

8082941
int	double
then just remove the pointer reference out of the type and you just have a function type void int double

8082944
mouseup	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown
use a combination of mousedown mousemove and or mouseup to tell whether the div is being has been resized

8082944
mouseup	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown
if you don t need that you can simply not use mousemove at all and just measure the div in mousedown and mouseup and figure out if it was resized in the latter

8082956
debian	linux
and you could take a debian linux distribution and find all the compression utilities there

8083025
opencart	oscommerce	opencart	magento	magento	oscommerce
i tried to use open source ecommerce packages like opencart magento oscommerce etc

8083034
int	chars
i also read this in the documentation if the string does not contain any of the chars . e or e and the numeric value fits into int type limits as defined by php_int_max the string will be evaluated as an integer. so i m guessing it should not be below or the same as the value of php_int_max which is by far less than the strings i m evaluating above - assuming that s what they mean by fits into

8083041
width	height
you probably want to adjust the font height width and overflow

8083047
glulookat	glrotate
the glulookat function comes in handy when you want to position a classical camera but its functionality can also be achieved by calls to gltranslate and glrotate without problems and sometimes depending on your requirements this is even easier than artificially mapping your view parameters to glulookat parameters

8083047
glulookat	glrotate
after this gltranslate comes whatever other camera or scene transformations you already have be it glulookat or just some gltranslate glrotate glscale calls

8083053
switching	screens
my cursor does not blink by default i find that annoying but what i would like is this when the cursor jumps to the next match it should change color or blink briefly to draw attention to its placement on the screens then switching back to the default cursor behavior

8083083
int	chars
c naively defined all of its chars test functions for an int

8083083

8083308
public	protected
also i noticed that the load method is protected and it looks like you re calling a public load method on t

8083308
public	protected
this could cause some confusion as to what methods are actually being called since you can t override a protected method with a public one compiler error inconsistent accessibility base class baseclass.protectedmethod is less accessible than class derivedclass.protectedmethod

8083312
ssl	https
possible ways http tunneling - may be used to connect to the mysql server it is a method of connecting to the server through http https protocol or using secure connection ssh ssl network protocol

i have a controlresolver class that returns idynamiccontrol - for my purposes i have wrapper classes for asp.net textboxes checkbox and dropdownlistfor which implement idynamiccontrol dropdown implements idynamiclist

8083390
width	height
if the image s width in emus is greater than the max page width s i scale the image s width and height so that the width of image is equal to that of the page when i say page i m referring to the usable page that is minus the margins

8083390
width	height
i then use the width as the value of cx and height as the value of cy both in the dw.extent and in the a.extents of the a.transform2d of the pic.shapeproperties

8083498
maven	cobertura
the answer to running integration tests with cobertura maven plugin did not work for me and also i would not want to call verify with every cobertura run but only for nightly coverage

8083540
post	get
then configure a custom flowurlhandler which appends the _token parameter to generated urls so if you have been using flowexecutionurl to reference your flows the token will appended whenever you post get back to your flow automatically

8083540
post	get
webflow and many other web frameworks don t distinguish between get and post - by default you generally can use a get to do whatever you do with a post unless you verify the request method yourself which would be a good idea anyway

8083540
post	get
so an attacker wanting to bypass your csrf filter would just do a get instead of a post

8083561
matplotlib	scipy
you can also try to package your numpy scipy matplotlib .

8083609
profiler	google-perftools
also there is a good heap profiler in google-perftools

8083609
gcov	gprof
needs no recompilation of application like it was needed with gprof gcov

8083609

folder	directory
if necessary you may set the output build folder for each source directory and clear eclipse s default bin output directory

8083653
qstring	qchar
i haven t been testing internationalization capabilities of qt library so much but from what i know qstring is fully unicode-aware and is using qchar s which are unicode-chars

8083659
int	chars
fgetc for example already returns either eof or a chars read as an unsigned chars and then converted to int so there s no sign-extension issue for values from that

8083659
serializable	deserialization
you can think of this as deserialization on input and serializable on output

8083677
toggleclass	slidetoggle
this toggleclass active .children div slidetoggle slow

8083687
dbcontext	objectcontext
you need to cast your dbcontext to iobjectcontextadapter so you can access the underlying objectcontext which gives you access to some more advanced features hidden by dbcontext

8083701
inherited	properties
background is a tricky one...because although it is not an inherited css properties changing an ancestor s background can alter a descendant s appearance if they have transparent backgrounds

8083731
for-loop	loops
not to mention that since you have in the condition part of your for-loop it s gotta loops through the entire enumerable every single time to get that count

8083786
mouse	keyboard
it doesn t respond to keyboard input but will still change the cursor once the mouse moves into the window

8083833
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
you can use the viewwillappear viewdidappear viewwilldisappear and viewdiddisappear in your view controllers

8083837
mouse	keyboard
unless that midi controller has some kind of a web-based interface that you can point a url at or the controller can insert its data into a normal keyboard mouse input stream then no you cannot use js to talk to it at all

8083838
hide	show
the problem is not deciding which row to show hide it s the actual code to hide show a row

8083928
daemons	systemd
i want to use the pear systemd daemons library to spurn a daemons and then spurn off processes within that daemons

8083929
hide	show
the easiest thing would be to wrap everything you want to show in a div then hide and show that div instead of hiding and showing the individual divs

8083929
hide	show
then you can just hide or show the #container box which would also hide show box 1 and box 2

8083929
hide	show
and finally the most exact solution would be to explicitly hide show those divs based on ids like so

8083951
post	put
i find this to be quite annoying as it doesn t really follow the rest architecture id like the option to be able to return response objects for post delete and put requests in some cases

8083972
uiview	uiwindow
say i want to do something which grabs the origin of a uiview with respect to the uiwindow instead

8083973
spaces	delimiter
i have a large txt file spaces delimiter which i split into 18 smaller files each with their own number of columns

8084088
min	max
if so you will need to query and use the max and min functions for the dates

8084101
int	double
so i have 2d point structures of int and double which i need to manipulate

8084146
linefeed	delimiter
if you are able to edit the .csv file a workaround is that you can use a text editor such as ultra edit that supports wildcards or regular expressions in its find replace feature and replace each carriage return linefeed with a cr linefeed followed by ix quotes optional depending on if you want to specify a text delimiter on insert

8084147
post	get
i have tried to get post and echo the variable in the update.php script into the edit.php script redirect but with no luck

8084161
int	double
xna s point structures are all single-precision float where wpf s are double precision and gdi+ are mixed sometimes int values

8084178
multiplying	add
if i have that total of items i can multiplying the 456 by 1 000 and add it to the 329 to get the total number of items

8084178
division	modulo
there are faster methods but the compiler usually turns the above division and remainder modulo operations into more efficient bitwise logic operations so you don t need to worry about it generally

8084191
hide	show
if you are trying to show hide from code behind server side you can make the row a server control and set its visible property

8084352
google-chrome	firefox
anyway i am not able with google-chrome nor with firefox and firebug to see the up to date dom source code of course the rendering in the browser is fine

8084356
hide	show
as long as the provider you are using for mysql covers all of the same methods you can do a quick google search and find tons of sites showing how to show hide bits based on roles

8084383
post	put	post	get	put	get
all that readings lead me to use the webappdebug template make some actions and respond to get post put delete with some json objects

8084402

hlsl	glsl
i have been told by experienced shader developers that while cg is great for simple shaders it is advised to do glsl hlsl directly for advanced shaders due to bugs in resultant shader code

8084533
onmousemove	onmouseup
i think you might get a better user experience by making the sliders change canvas onmouseup instead of onmousemove

8084540
realloc	malloc
and my limited understanding of the standards makes me think that an implementation which always return a null pointer for malloc and does nothing for realloc is still respecting the letter but not the spirit of the standards

8084547
realloc	malloc
you never know when realloc is going to allocate another memory block and copy data because there is no api that allows you to look at malloc internals and see if allocated region can be extended or shrunk

8084562
x86	64bit
will it put the .exe into the c program files x86 directory structure automatically or do i have to make allowances for 64bit versions of windows

8084613
google-chrome	firefox
but ie google-chrome do not support xml space preserve firefox does

8084623
voip	sip
to create this it s necesary - sip voip android.software.sip

8084635
firefox	safari
this ll probably require using javascript listeners eg window.onclose although apparently that doesn t work for safari or firefox 2 and within that an ajax xmlhttprequest to send the data to your server

8084770
gnutls	opensc	openssl	gnutls	openssl	opensc
both openssl and gnutls provide full x.509 ssl tls cryptographic functionality while also supporting smart cards via the opensc library

public	protected
this class would friend foo and provide protected access to secret thus allowing foo to access secret without exposing secret to the public user through inclusion of foo.h

8084989
jar	manifest.mf
not to bother with -classpath parameter you could put references to the jar files into the manifest.mf of your application jar if it s you application of course

8085184
getter	setter
however this is not how magic getter and setter work in the first place

8085207
folder	directory
what i find happens every time is it can never find the umbtopnavigation.xslt when i install the starter kit i find out after changing skins it creates a sub directory in my umbraco folder with the same name as the install folder so if my virtual directory points to c apps umbracotest it creates a folder c apps umbracotest umbracotest which has the xslt folder css scripts images etc

8085212
imperative	declarative
programmers are used to the imperative procedural style of c like languages and fail to comprehend the declarative set based nature of sql

8085234
put	get
i tried to put that in python and instead of the pic i get an empty file

8085239

google-chrome	firefox
it could be that yui is able to leverage faster dom selectors in google-chrome than firefox

8085501
pop-up	dialog
facebook s login dialog would pop-up

8085550
textile	bbcode
i have already found some markup languages markdown textile bbcode creole... and some of them seem to have a java implementation but i have not found a well-established mainstream one for java

8085552
realloc	malloc
the important lesson here is that the standard describes the effects of malloc realloc not what they actually do

8085563
memmove	memset
if you meant an actual char array you can use memmove and memset

8085603
translation	localization
it doesn t translation output on its own when localization files exist

8085717
width	height
the use of a width or height declaration is required to make the

8085721
gridbaglayout	miglayout
you could achieve the same thing with gridbaglayout or miglayout but i ll guarantee you it d take much longer to implement

8085740
ivar	subclassing
this doesn t seem like an ideal solution but i had the same need and i found i could get the job done by adding a public ivar or method to the subclassing of contentprovider that handles the search suggestions

8085744
mallet	lda
looks like mallet could be part of a topic string analysis but she doesn t mention how she did the lda analysis

8085830
folder	directory
a developer added an image directory on the server without adding that folder to the .gitignore file

8085839

for some weeks i have researched on php frameworks and there are cakephp codeigniter zend yii kohana etc

8085839
codeigniter	yii
and i m leaning to yii even though codeigniter seems to have more followers i m stubborn on checking out yii because of the high praise is getting specially in its quality built and performance

8085879
getter	setter
if you define property then generally any time you access the ivar in your class you use the getter setter whether that be dot notation or standard method call

8085879
getter	setter
if you always explicitly use these getter and setter then you pretty much do not need to call release anywhere in your code apart from dealloc or an overridden setmyvar method

8085879
getter	setter
be consistant and use the setter getter that you took the time to synthesize

8085904
getter	setter
when you use this property always use the getter setter and make sure you ve autoreleased or released anything you alloc

8085924
braces	reformatting
when you are done reformatting to your satisfaction replace the braces characters with their original keywords

8085950

you need to include string for std string and std getline and ostream for std endl .

8086004
hide	show
it looks like when you load the page you have both the show and the hide functions running on the same element

8086004
hide	show
doing the above will make hide run on the element before the element the show runs on

8086010
width	height
my bitmap has a width of 240px and height of 180px

8086014
getter	setter

8086245
put	get
if your objects don t implement copying properly you will get segmentation faults at best and subtle bugs at worst when you put them into containers

8086247
versioning	upgrade
in general for major releases such as tfs 2010 and tfs 2008 we ask the build service and the tfs server to be installed with the same versioning which means if you upgrade one you should upgrade the other as well

8086270
children	parent
you should consider having the parent do nothing other than wait for the children

8086270
children	parent
if the parent dies for any reason then the children will become zombies

8086285
rspec	capybara
the following works for me with rails 3.1.0 rspec 2.6.0 capybara 1.1.1

8086316
jar	war
if you want to run from a copy of your app then just deploy the archive war rar ear jar file

8086346
inherited	subclassing
now if it s coming to serialization and networking i m asking myself whether i should create a subclassing for every command type which inherited from command or just put all possible arguments in the command class

8086346
serializable	deserialization
the second option seems much easier to use because i can use automated serializable and don t need to check the type before deserialization

8086362
children	parent
i m sending both parent and its children to be updated to my service layer

8086362
children	parent
the behaviour i d like is that the children are always attached to the parent so if a child is in the database that is not found attached we should remove it

8086364
loops	if-statement
at the same time the dsl should offer higher-level features for the more technically inclined - like loops if-statement possibly methods or lambdas

8086379
octree	quadtree
however you will need to use quadtree instead of octree as you are only in 2d not 3d

8086632
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine with google-chrome and firefox but when i try it in ie9 it doesn t disable anything

8086640
dbcontext	objectcontext
for those you can use applycurrentchanges for objectcontext or entry entity .currentvalues.setvalues for dbcontext

8086645
cstring	bstr
in the case of an array of bstr strings you can set the bstr values directly on your array and also you need to allocate memory for your bstr elements you could use atl mfc cstring for that

8086680
post	get
a http get may not hold enough data for all the information on my form so i need to switch to post

8086692

8086763
hide	show
i m using this script to show hide menu sections on my page but it doesn t seem to work on internet explorer

8086790
tcpclient	sslstream
i m trying to securely transfer files between 2 devices so i m using an sslstream attached to a tcpclient

if i go the other way around and register a callback with the service i m still a bit stump because i need to notify the service the activity has changed - i need to tell it not to notify me in the first activity s ondestroy and reregister in the second activity s oncreate

8086802
oncreate	ondestroy
and i need to handle the case where the asynchronous task completes after ondestroy and before oncreate

8087068
hide	show
this works for 1 div and 1 hide and 1 show link

8087084
sorting	grouping
you could get away with not using grouping in this instance as really all you are doing are sorting and just excluding some elements

8087117
post	get
the purpose of the tornado.web.asynchronous decorator is to prevent the server from automatically closing the connection when your handler function post get etc. returns

8087132
onclicklistener	onitemclicklistener
at first i was confused on which onclicklistener i should use and for buttons it works to add the onclicklistener to the button but otherwise it seems better to put the onitemclicklistener to the gridview itself

8087151
children	parent	min	max
either the keys of parent nodes are always greater than or equal to those of the children and the highest key is in the root node this kind of heap is called max heap or the keys of parent nodes are less than or equal to those of the children min heap

jar	war
a jar file for your war in fact this is the war with the classes in web-inf classes a jar file for your ejbs and a jar file for the 3rd type we ll call that a library

8088403
jar	war
but neither the war nor ejb depend on each other as they don t share anything directly only indirectly through the 3rd library jar

8088403
jar	war
the lib jar is stand alone since it doesn t have any dependency on either the war or ejbs

8088403
jar	war
in your ear you simply bundle the lib jar the war and the ejb jar along with a meta-inf dir and an application.xml file

8088403
jar	war
the war has its own structure with the web-inf and all the ejb jar has its meta-inf and ejb-jar.xml

8088403
jar	war
for example if you have say a simple static singleton in your lib jar then both the war and ejbs will share that singleton since they re all part of the same class loader

8088403
jar	war
the 3 jar idiom war ejb lib is one i ve used over the years because it separates the 3 concerns and limits dependencies

maven has a good feel out-of-the box super-easy to get going and with the neat dependency management but down the line tweaking the pom.xml your project s maven build file to fit your needs will require more fiddling with than if you used ant

8088868
ant	maven
it may not do fancy dependency management out-of-the-box like maven although for that you can integrate ant with ivy but it certainly provides you with all the flexibility you ll ever need and you won t find yourself fighting the build tool configuration file as it s fairly common with maven

8095315
int	double
in case a and b are of primitive types such as int or double the variables will contain actual values consequently these values and not their locations will be compared

8095320
typedef	struct
in a related node since there s no way you could include the definition of your struct in c there s no point to use the typedef here

8095408

should take me to the same page as assuming global.asax hasn t been modified however recently it just takes me to directory list -- and lists out the content of the project folder

8096078
flask	django
this is in a function that passes a string to response object django or flask

8096113
portrait	landscape
the main problem with it is when you switch from landscape to portrait the activity is not refreshing

post	get
to solve this problem i was thinking on adding some code to the top of every page to escape any post get request before getting it processed by the application

8096203
google-chrome	firefox
same happened in internet explorer 9 firefox 8 google-chrome and ipad ios 5

8096262
hide	show
you should be able to do it exactly like that as wxpanel inherits from wxwindow which provides methods called hide and show

8096277

8096861
post	get
i get to post a question about a stack overflow...on stackoverflow

8096865
melt	reshape
you might be able to get what you re after by using melt and cast or reshape but you re looking for something pretty specific so it might be simpler to do the reshaping directly

8096879
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
all works fine in firefox opera safari chrome.

8096887
g++	gcc
the problem is how to write cmakelists.txt files to use g++ for some subdirectories and gcc for another

8096904
downcasting	upcasting
upcasting and downcasting rules for numbers are pretty simple.

8096931
getter	setter
i d like to know whether when i am coding a class i should use getter and setter to access other instance variables or just call them by their names

8096933
put	get
i have also tried to put the database under profiling and i can see that the effective request is called even if i can see a discrepancy between the time the http request has been issued by the client and the time effectively the query get executed on the database

8096952
g++	gcc
the difference between g++ and gcc is basically that g++ passes -lstdc++ to the linker

8096952
g++	gcc
gcc and g++ are the same in this regard

8096957
post	get
i can retrieve the html of the first get and of the first post

8096957
post	get
but if i do a new get or a new post i obtain a blank response

8096970
width	height
you need to set width and height explicity instead of 100

8096973
getter	setter
getter setter main purpose is separate users of your class from changes of your class implementation

8096973
getter	setter
despite this i would still recommend to use getter setter until you re clearly need to access variables directly

8096991
post	put	post	get	put	get
http verbs while most firewalls and web clients allow for the http get and post verbs some of them do not support put delete and other verbs

in xcode go to the googleanalytics googsdk folder and drag the gantracker.h and libgoogleanalytics.a files to the plugins directory

8097040
maven	pom.xml
you should update the configuration of your test plugin within your maven pom.xml

8097053
versioning	upgrade
you should definitely take a look and upgrade to the dev versioning if you really need it

8097065
public	protected
finally your configuration specifies which keeps all public classes except those in testapph23 and their public protected private class members from being shrunk optimized obfuscated

8097065
public	protected
for consistency you may want to remove public for the classes or add public protected for the class members

8097067
bufferedreader	fileinputstream
he she seems to be alluding to the fact that using a bufferedreader as opposed to a fileinputstream made the difference for him her but i just don t see how that applies

8097073
hash	md5
i m using md5 to generate the hash code

8097085
hex	binary
binary manipulations are usually done in hex

8097098
scheme	racket
dyoo s solution is nice and succinct in a scheme like racket that has useful iteration routines built in

8097130
firefox	safari
i my testing it turns out that the attribute value has nothing to do with the value value - at least in my testing with safari 5.1 and firefox 6

8097139
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox this works as i thought it would - giving me a table etc

8097163
getter	setter
it may be helpful to use the getter setter if they actually do something like validation and to access this variable you need to do these things every time

8097163
getter	setter
otherwise if the getter setter do nothing but get and set the variable i don t see any benefit

8097201
junit	jbehave	junit	testng	testng	jbehave
selenium tests usually focus on the full system rather than units of code so you re more likely to get questions about bdd tools like jbehave or cucumber than lower-level unit testing tools like junit or testng

8097213
google-chrome	firefox
i am building a website for my compty and i need to change the css style for google-chrome ie and firefox

8097283
children	parent
i need to check uncheck parent and children inputs in order to be logical

8097283
children	parent
i think this is quite logical a child cannot be checked without its parent being checked and if i uncheck a child and this was the only one of the children checked the parent must be unchecked too

8097307
int	chars
the code only assumes the existence of the int types uint8_t and uint32_t and is agnostic to width and signedness of type chars as well as endianness

8097328
wav	aiff	mp3	wav	mp3	aiff
i know it s possible to covert from aiff and wav to mp3 but in my project i need to have available all three formats aiff wav and mp3 from aiff and wav inputs

8097369
explode	implode
if you have a bunch of text that has commas in it then you implode them all with a comma you re going to have an extremely difficult time trying to explode them all back on that comma

8097447
getter	setter
if you want truly constant data you might want to use getter setter object.defineproperty or the module pattern

8097511
superclass	subclassing
the superclass possesses a public property loss which is not overridden by the 2 subclassing

8097512
mp4	webm
mp4 webm etc..

8097540
explode	implode
the functions implode and explode are completely independently

8097540
explode	implode
so explode has no idea that implode used a character it is going to use

8097540
explode	implode
this is not just done with a simple explode implode

8097545
disk	ram
you can use memory to open a database connection to a database that resides in ram instead of on disk

8097566
disk	ram
that resides in ram instead of on disk

8097583
wmv	asf
up until now i ve used the asf writer to encode the input to a wmv file but it appears the renderer is too slow to process high resolution input such as 1920x1200x32

8097612
folder	directory
make that working folder a virtual directory of iis

8097652
floating-point	integer
your original code can by the way be sped up slightly by initializing total to 0 rather than 0.0 to use integer rather than floating-point addition

8097669
integer	fractions
after a tiny fractions of iterations it should produce a nigh-optimal machine code loop augmented with a few guards - simple integer comparisions jumping if they fail - to maintain correctness in case you got a string in that list

8097692
clang	llvm
switching between gcc and clang llvm using cmake

8097713
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox

8097745
httpresponse	request
modify your view to return an httpresponse object with the text you want as its parameter after you have validated the request

8097746
uitableview	nsindexpath
the indexpathforrow insection section and row methods of nsindexpath now use nsinteger instead of nsuinteger so that these types match with methods defined on uitableview

8097748
geany	gedit
however when i try to run the same scripts from say gvim i ve got a shortcut mapped to ruby or geany or gedit ditto i get ruby command not found in gvim or ruby not found in geany or gedit

8097784
jobs	cron
i have access to a dedicated server and i initially had a different bootstrap for the cron jobs

8097787
getter	setter
setting a seed for a random number generator is a pretty straightforward case where it totally makes sense to have a setter without a getter

8097829
int	chars
finally convert the line to an array of chars and convert each chars to an int using integer.parseint

8097861
hash	md5
while the md5 hash of the password means that someone can t sniff the original password there s nothing to stop them sniffing the hash of the password which works just as well to give them access

8097878
viewdidload	viewwillappear
i have already put it in viewdidload and viewwillappear but it doesn t help

8097881
cpu	affinity
if your os and the processes have no thread affinity this will cause your threads to swap from one cpu to the other and vice-verse

8097887
min	max
i ve searched in google and found that the format is 2 3 min max however this seems to be for a different way that the syntax i m using

8097900
google-chrome	firefox
works tested in google-chrome ie firefox

8097904
textview	simplecursoradapter
i ve tried implementing my own simplecursoradapter and rewriting setviewtext textview string but it didn t work

8098248
width	height
i need to split some html content to pages so that each page would have height of the screen and some predefined width

8098248
margin	height
this should give me the full height of element including padding margin and border

8098262
min	max
also i would like to apply min and max values for the height

8098309
put	get
you either have to mimic what liferay does in the portlet request handling not recommended or alternatively put your servlet code into a portlet - this can be the resource handling of a portlet - here you get full access to the http request and can do everything yourself with regards to data types transmitted in the stream

8098315
children	parent
i want to create a hash using base64 based on a composite of foreign keys from a collection of children objects that belong to a parent

8098335
uilabel	uibutton
there are some solutions for uilabel overriding drawtextinrect but uibutton has no such method

8098337
int	double
int double and struct types are examples of value types

8098388
post	get
this is a known post redirect get pattern to prevent users from posting the same data twise on browser page refresh user may press f5 in a desktop browser

8098388
post	get
at least if you need the response for some result evaluation then don t redirect using a post this time use a get

8098459
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
this seems to happen only in firefox and opera but is ok in safari

8098460
luabind	tolua++
tolua++ swig luabind etc

8098469
setinterval	settimeout
at least mostly - you won t be able to use call and apply on setcurrow or pass it to settimeout or setinterval without binding it first to your object designs since this is bound at call time in javascript

8098486
ubuntu	linux
if you are having a problem with using or configuring grub on your computer please consider asking your question on superuser.com the stack exchange site for computer enthusiasts and power users or on a site specific to the linux distribution you are using such as the ask ubuntu stack exchange

8098497
postgresql	mysql
that programs can use to communicate with rdbm systems such as postgresql and mysql

8098506
client-side	server-side
then to cover all possibilities for the greatest efficiency server-side you need to serve a sockets server of some kind then client-side offer ajax flash and web sockets possibly even java to capture that last 1

8098519
min	max
the trick is in expressing the min max elements as arithmetic operations not branching and then calling sort on pairs enough times to bubble sort them

8098542
min	max
you can write max min and swap branch-free functions

8098542
min	max
i have taken the implementation of max from david s answer from here and implemented min with little twist

8098545
google-chrome	firefox
ie and google-chrome reload the data upon completion of submit but firefox 7.0.1 updates but does not refresh the grid rather it displays only the header and footer of the grid only

8098566
hash	md5
alternatively you can have an api password which is turned to a key server-side before being compared for a greater amount of security if someone has the straight api key from the database and submits it to work.php it won t evaluate properly once run through say an md5 hash

8098590
int	double
ideally if you re working with a number to begin with like a float or double you could just cast it to an int then do myint.tostring like

8098591
folder	directory
we have a strange issue where randomly and infrequently the compilejava task which deletes the meta-inf folder and compiled classes to start runs but the processresources task reports up-to-date even though the meta-inf directory clearly doesn t exist

8098609
button	checkbox
i have a form that has a few groups of checkbox and radio button

8098644
superclass	subclassing
if a subclassing relies on superclass behavior and the superclass s behavior changes the subclassing may break

8098644
superclass	subclassing
we could remove the subclassing s addall but now we re relying on superclass implementation details which could change

8098644
superclass	subclassing
or a superclass might implement a new method that our subclassing doesn t meaning a user of our class could unintentionally bypass intended behavior by directly calling the superclass method so we have to track the superclass api to determine when and if the subclassing should change

8098653
hash	md5
i would like to write a script that would read the file s size and md5 hash string via http header s response and i would just generate a dummy file fake file with the same size and force that file to have the same md5 hash string on the http request

8098670
portrait	landscape
what i do is define a different xml layout for landscape and portrait

8098679
postgresql	mysql
jdbc guarantees that a resultset from the mysql jdbc driver will behave the same way as a resultset from the postgresql jdbc driver

8098713

8098732
post	get
it looks like your for is sending a get request rather that a post request

8098741
superclass	subclassing
in moxy the subclassing can map a field property with xmlvalue as long as the superclass does not have any mappings to an xml element

8098758
width	height
i saw another question here which suggested adding a 1-pixel height div to each cell with a width setting but that doesn t work - ie renders it as 18 pixels high for some reason

8098762
mouseover	mouseout
probably because the mouseover handler is triggering the mouseout handler

8098780
children	parent
assuming all the blocks are children of the same parent you can access them as through or through if the parent has n children that come before the boxes

8098789
width	margin
you can t a margin percentage will always be in terms of the width of the containing element

8098789
margin	height
you ll probably have to add an extra division of some sort above it that has a height with the percentage of margin you want to be there

8098794
post	get
it s really useful for figuring out these little things and i ve even used it to get clarification and verify answers before i post them here on so

but now hibernate will need another way to determine whether an instances is transient or persistent and the logical field to use for that is version

8099354
int	double
i have to convert a double value x into two int as specified by the following.

8099393
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
you could certainly add www-data to the sudoers list and then either hard-code www-data s passwd into your script not so good or read it from a file a little better to make sudo work

8099393
sudo	passwd
granting it a big one like sudo and putting its passwd in a file or script creates a significant security vulnerability

8099395
min	max
saxparseexception cos-all-limited.1.2 an all model group must appear in a particle with min occurs max occurs 1 and that particle must be part of a pair which constitutes the content type of a complex type definition

menuitem is a direct subclassing of uiobject that s the same superclass widget inherited from but menuitem is no widget

8099430
explode	substr
i know that you can use it in a where clause but i need a way of dealing with large strings text clob vars not tables so i would like to know if some function can return multiple substr somehow i am thinking at something like the explode or - even better - preg_match in php

8099463
folder	directory
the private key stays on your computer and the public key needs to be placed on the remote computer usually in the .ssh folder of the remote home directory

8099486
put	get
this is a little tool i put together since i m always needing to get and convert unix timestamps

8099490

8099541
clang	llvm
it happens if i use gcc llvm clang in whatever combo

8099545
g++	gcc
no g++ and gcc are not two different front-ends to the same compiler

8099545
fortran	ada
they are two different drivers for two different compilers cc1plus and cc1 sharing the same middle-end and back-end code withing gcc build-tree inside gcc libbackend.a a misnomer since it contains both middle-end the middle-end is the common part of gcc common to c c++ ada fortran objective-c .

8099710
datamapper	activerecord
just take a look at the difference between activerecord and datamapper patterns

8099711
width	height
height is slightly more tricky for it to work you need to have the parent of the overlay div to have a known width

8099718
post	put
edit i ve just put together a toy site and my routes work fine edit your post to show your route configuration i m guessing your problem is in there

8099722
post	put
simply put make a long list of all words in all your post filter out stop-words articles determiners etc. and for each document post count how often each term occurs and multiplying that by the importance of the team which is the inverse document frequency calculated by the log of the ratio of documents in which this term occurs

8099724

now i was wondering if i should use malloc free combo to allocate memory from the

8099854
implements	extends
i am implements more classes which extends the serializable interface

8099861
jqxhr	deferred
you can store jqxhr objects in an array and use a deferred to call the success functions in order when all calls have finished

8099899
put	get
the stored procedure that was written is for a listview so i was hoping i could put something hidden in there to get the id

8099899
put	get
when i put the hidden field on the page and tried to get the id i got the error i mentioned in the title

8099943

i want to do several aggregate functions at once eg to get the max and min id s grouped by status

8100193
min	max
volume rms min value max value

charindex	substr
you could for example use charindex to find the index of the - and then use substr to get the characters up to that point

8100216
accessor	properties
however in section 11.2.1 properties accessor using dot notation were changed from

8100235

8100425
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
firefox 3.5+ safari 4+ and google-chrome all support usage through the xmlhttprequest object

8100425
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	xmlhttprequest	xdomainrequest
the xmlhttprequest object in firefox safari and google-chrome has similar enough interfaces to the ie xdomainrequest object that this pattern works fairly well

8100425
onreadystatechange	onload
onload â use instead of onreadystatechange to detect successes

8100434
apache	nginx
the advantage of using apache or nginx as a proxy is that it can load-balance between different mongrel or thin instances

8100480
draggable	droppable
so you need to find and bind the draggable droppable to the iframe and fire an event to detect and handle that

8100491
width	height
the only thing u can do is to set it s position and height width relative to the closest parent with position relative

8100516
ceil	floor
substitute round or ceil for floor depending on what behavior you want with rounding

8100522
.htaccess	httpd.conf
after some more looking around i found out that lite version doesn t support .htaccess so only httpd.conf file that works globally

8100558
width	height	min	max
the div has the exact height set with overflow hidden and the img has min max width and height set

8100558
width	height	min	max
all browsers except ie will change the width height to the min max levels without changing the aspect ratio

8100558
width	height
ie changes the aspect ration changes width and height independently

8100570
width	height
so the only criteria that facebook uses to ignore images is the width to height ratio all other images in your page will get picked up and will be an option as a thumbnail

8100571
getter	setter
then from your ide go to code generation options - choose generate getter and setter for both fields

8100577
children	parent
also the node would be responsible for ensuring that the sizes and shapes of its children make sense -- that they don t overlap they fill the entire parent they don t go outside the parent

8100600
onresume	onpause
for whatever reason they queue them up until the activity goes through a onpause onresume cycle then they will fire all their queued events

8100621
width	height
the width and height are unknown variables

8100621
width	height
i can t constrain the width and height because i ll distort the image

8100646
folder	directory
i am trying to allow the user to upload as many images as they want place them all in a new directory based on the title of the form and then write that folder name to the database and i will call it later to do an image dump

8100657
width	height	min	max
instead of using min max width and height

8100661
width	height
yes set height of image height of div extra width will be hidden by overflow div

8100684
opera	firefox
firefox opera and webkit-based browsers have a document-level event domcontentloaded that you can listen for with document.addeventlistener domcontentloaded fn false

8100687
hash	md5
i have had the experience of coding a secure software activation key package in 2001 using pki and md5 hash

8100687
hash	salt
do use a hash digest and salt to store passwords

8100694
hash	whirlpool
using a hash algorithm like sha or whirlpool with a unique input like the users unique username will result in a hash that has an expected collision rate of 0

8100699
int	double
since you didn t use implicit none in rter3 it might do that in which case the bits of integ would be interpreted as an int while they are supposed to be interpreted as double precision -- the value would appear incorrectly

8100721
setinterval	settimeout
simple implementation would be javascript settimeout and setinterval to check server status with trigger stored procedure on mysql

8100749
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this works in all the browsers i ve tested it in google-chrome 15 firefox 7 ie 9 and opera 11.52 all on windows which seems promising

8100781
width	height
but you should add the img programtically and the get the image height and width straight from the object like this and then run the resize function above

8100817
stdout	stderr
i am trying to redirect stdout and stderr to a socket

8100817
stdout	stderr
i tried the flollowing it works but i can only redirect one of stdout or stderr

8100819
google-chrome	firefox
the edit button shows up in google-chrome firefox but not internet explorer with the same exact code base

8100824
openni	kinect
i would like to know if avin2 sensor kinect drivers work with latest versions of openni

8100834
width	height
both width and height can be individually scaled and the original width - height constraints can be lost but this is of no importance

8100842
ddms	adt
to solve this problem you have to update also android ddms adt and all other components on eclipse

8100865
udp	tcp
i want to identify an udp or tcp packet that have its source ip address faked

8100894
width	height
this will return a rect of width or height 0 if the two points are on a line

8100897
width	height
the absolute value of the difference between x values will be the width and between y values the height

8100906
cos	sin
cos sin etc

8100908
udp	tcp
the way i see it udp and tcp have nothing to do with this

8100911
folder	directory
i have a virtual directory on iis7 that is pointing to a folder inside my application root

8100970
google-chrome	firefox
this works for me in google-chrome and firefox but not ie9

8101004
width	height
i ve been trying to use a table tag but i need the whole screen to be used 100 width and height and i would rather use more modern tags since i will have to end up using canvas in one of those segments anyway

8101023
melt	reshape
i m not sure about the way your data were generated whether you use a combination of cast melt from the reshape package which is what i suspect given the default name of your variables but here is a toy example where sorting is done outside the call to ggplot

8101032
traceroute	packets
yeah you can send ack packets to the fake source address ip and then use traceroute command to know the path of the source packets so that you can atleast find the location of the originating

8101067
serializable	deserialization
i can write the serializable serializable the typerep then serializable the value but i can t figure out how to write the deserialization

8101067
dictionary	map
the basic problem is that given a typerep you need to map back to the type dictionary for that type - and i don t know if that can be done

8101130
udp	tcp
so i ve been programming with tcp for quite a while and decided to pick up udp

8101130
wan	lan
i m not quite sure what needs to be done in order for me to have communication both ways across the wan or lan for that matter easier on lan because i could just open two ports with udp once i send information from client to server how can i respond on that socket

8101148
put	get
we had to put in a special request with rackspace just to get access to that much disk space on our server

8101173
for-loop	arrays
also what is important to point out here if this arrays would have hundreds instead of 8 bookmarks for-loop would probably be statistically about twice faster as it does not have to iterate through rest of the arrays

8101173
for-loop	arrays
but in that case it would probably be a good idea to put for-loop into function which returns first found item which satisfies condition and with prototypejs it probably can even be hooked up to arrays

8101201
portrait	landscape
what is the best approach to change a css file when a mobile application page orientation changes from landscape to portrait and vice versa

8101203
width	height
the code executes without errors and all the width height stride and buffer size values are correct but the bitmap remains black as if wic never touched it

8101234
width	height
let nearplane be the height of the pyramid and w and h the width and height of the pyramid s base

8101239
pop-up	dialog
1 don t use another jframe as pop-up window use jframe with joptionpane dialog jwindow these container are same as jframe but can take parent and owner

8101239
jwindow	jdialog
3 depends if you needed decorated window then use jdialog don t forget look for setmodal or modalitytypes if undecorated then use jwindow

8101239
joptionpane	jdialog	jwindow	jdialog
4 don t create lots of joptionpane jdialog jwindow on fly becasue there object are still in jvm memory create this container once and re-use that by removing child for another action

8101245
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome firefox and ie9 all output

8101288
jtextfield	jlabel
if i just put it in jlabel jtextfield and text out of borders it wrap path from the right side like c my documents .

8101319
versioning	upgrade
i was on versioning 2.0.5 and have upgrade to 2.0.10 but that doesn t resolve the issue

8101328
freebsd	solaris
and as was mentioned freebsd and solaris has own implementations

8101350
httprequest	httpresponse
you need to read up on the httprequest and httpresponse classes

8101445
put	get
in each step you get a position from the queue put each neighbor to the queue change their neighbor data rinse and repeat

8101458
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this only happened in firefox though ie google-chrome and safari didn t register it

8101498
cvs	svn
if you setup your own svn cvs or other source management system you will have to maintain it

8101512
width	height
your constructor takes the arguments by non-const reference but you pass a temporary object dimensions2d width height to it

8101608
libs	buildpath
if you want to know how to load the archive google it s in in project properties java buildpath libs tab swt jar add jar add your swt.jar then expand and edit the javadoc location

8101609
cut	dash
at the request of a couple of you i ll clarify that i want to cut out the second - dash and replace it with a comma and space

8101623
post	get
the request parameter is also null but i m guessing that s because i m doing a get and not a post

8101627
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
i m trying to create an nsdate from nscalendar and nsdatecomponents with

8101655
pem	pkcs#12
i have also tried to change the file extension from txt to pkcs#12 pem in order to be able to import the file into windows certificate store but no success

8101679
int	chars
with php i wanna cut out the int only amongst the strings which are combined by chars + int

8101698
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
rem is supported in safari 5 google-chrome firefox 3.6+ and even internet explorer but for older browsers you still have to use em percent or px

8101756
width	height
width height buffer size format guid and scan size all seem correct

8101760
width	height
and this 2 in there should actually be your window s aspect ratio width height in your case

8101770
hide	show
here is the code i use to show the progress bar and then hide it on page loaded

8101780
getter	setter
making the cs be a member of the object and using the cs inside of property getter setter methods is the correct approach

8101785
width	height
one of these lines should be height not width

8101834
width	height
this sort-of-works if i set the video element s css height width to 100 so it s always the same size as its container

8101834
width	height
however if the containing div s dimensions go below the video image s inherent videowidth or videoheight then it starts to behave as though the css height width properties refer to percentages of the video image s inherent dimensions not the container div

8101844
onresume	onpause
not sure about how to handle the camera during activity lifecycle methods like onpause onresume etc

8101867
for-loop	loops
note the check on data is useless as your code loops elements of data ie if data doesn t exist data.codes.length can only be 0 and the for-loop never starts

8101882
folder	directory
i put it in the main directory not a folder

8101901
ubuntu	linux
the only difference i can possibly thing of is the different linux ubuntu versions i am using on each laptop

8101913
hide	show
and hide progress indicator which is show before ajax call

8101926
getter	setter
if you put a lock inside your getter and setter you can guarantee that your object is internally coherent but users of your object may see multithreading artifacts

8101992
free	malloc
i am struggling to wrap my head around malloc in c - specifically when it needs to be free d

8101992
free	malloc
i gather from the errors i m getting in gcc on program crash that i m just not understanding malloc and free

8101992
free	malloc
everything i see says that whenever i use malloc i need to use free

8102004
width	height
make a div put it on position fixed width 100 and height 100 left 0 top 0

8102005
versioning	upgrade
the oncreate only the first time when necessary or on an upgrade of versioning

8102010
free	malloc
in general every call to malloc must have one corresponding call to free

8102016
folder	dir
the first rename must be done over file 3.txt and folder 2 and then proceed upwards to above folder but the lines displayed by dir command are sorted in alphabetical order and the other available orders don t help in this case

8102023
free	malloc
well the scope of the malloc d memory lays between calls to malloc and free or otherwise until process is stopped that is when os cleans up for the process

8102023
free	malloc
the error you are getting is most likely either because function returns a pointer to some memory that was not allocated using malloc or it returns a null pointer which you pass to free which you cannot do

8102027
free	malloc
broadly speaking every pointer that is ever returned by malloc must eventually be passed to free

8102029
tiff	png
the sub-folder containers each has files of different file types pdf png jpeg tiff avi and word documents

8102034
hide	show
my first thought is that the interval was quicker than the script was getting rid of the last list item but i have tested this with a interval of 5000 for the get and 1000 for the hide show of the elements which should provide an extra 3000ms at least before the next call

8102039
onresume	onpause
add in your own onpause onstop onresume etc

8102056
versioning	upgrade
you might want to upgrade to the latest versioning 2.0 public or even the latest 2.1-level build from as you will get many reliability improvements and you will be able to push notifications with a single line of code instead of all these complicated steps

8102096
mouseup	mousedown
you should be able to dispatch a mousedown event with the subject element as the event target and it should stay active until a matching mouseup event is dispatched

8102110
width	height
i checked the position of child control in new parent left and top and width and height no problem

8102117
implements	extends
you can certainly implements these attributes yourself just as you would extends any class with a facade

8102149
ienumerable	iqueryable
ienumerable iqueryable or list

8102160
ilist	icollection
if there are to be no further queries and all the data will need to be read return an ilist icollection etc

8102197
width	height
when the user is finished with their caption and would like to submit i need a way to insert the width height and position left and right attributes into my database

8102205
for-loop	loops
your while loops terminates as count increases past mycnt and anoter iteration of for-loop is executed

8102215
hide	show
i can t put all the data into one table because each table represents a different category of information and is inside a custom control with a collection of collapsible panels so you can show or hide each category separately

8102218
accessor	properties
instead of creating a virtual static variable just create a regular properties that returns a sprite based on the type of the class switch on this.gettype .tostring in the get accessor

8102231
ienumerable	icollection
if the answer is not very i d just return icollection or even arrays if you want to prevent the query results from being inadvertently modified. in a pinch if you ever need to change a query to stream results with a custom ienumerable you can always have the old method call the new one and materialise the results to keep compatibility with older clients

8102233
quicksort	mergesort
insertion sort is simple and for small lists it is generally faster than a comparably implemented quicksort or mergesort

8102251
udp	tcp
udp is connectionless protocol server just needs to start listening on udp port and client can send data datagram immediately there is no need for connection establishment with connect accept like in tcp

8102272
opengl-es	glsurfaceview
i know that i can use opengl-es the ndk or an glsurfaceview but i would like to know from the community

8102336
free	malloc
if you don t want memory leak you have to free the memory from malloc

8102406
debian	linux
i am using debian flavor linux system

8102413
pop-up	dialog
a dialog box called application pool identity will pop-up

8102413
folder	directory
network service must be granted both read and write permissions to the app_data folder located within your web project s directory

8102447
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
firefox google-chrome and safari do things a little smarter differently

8102513
execvp	fork
the simple program i threw together to test with does not have the issues you are experiencing so i ll just go over the core of it around the fork execvp area with some error checking omitted for brevity

8102513
stdout	stderr
the above is the core of a very basic server only one client at a time that when it receives a connection forks a new process to run a command and sends its stderr and stdout to the client over the socket

8102544
pull	push
wicket is written so that you do not have to go pull data from a form submission and push it yourself onto your pojos

8102546
portrait	landscape
i am trying to programmatically select a tab when the orientation changes so that when the user changes from portrait to landscape for example the active tab remains the same

8102546
onresume	onpause
the issue also happens whether i use onstop onstart or onpause onresume for saving and restoring the active tab respectively

8102569
onresize	onscroll
utilising a jquery the solution i ended up with involved creating an onscroll and onresize for window resizing event listener that ran a check through all and checked their on the page

8102575
struts	wicket
the alternatives i m considering are struts wicket but frankly i editing big xlm files is painful

8102618
lisp	scheme
in the same way that a function is defined function-name in lisp scheme or there are do..end blocks in ruby the syntax of a java main function is with string args

8102674
stateless	stateful
why do they call webserver as stateless and database as stateful

8102731
stateless	stateful
networked filesystems might also be stateless earlier versions of nfs or stateful newer versions of nfs

8102734
free	malloc
note that since initqueue does not malloc its counterpart function emptyqueue should not free

8102751
folder	directory
i am working with an site where i have to store four images of different formats by creating a directory in an specified folder

8102781
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
if i was doing this in c i d just do a double for-loop that loops through an arrays doing arr i width + j arr of j+1 j-1 i+i i-1 the neighbors and have several different arrays that i d do the same thing for different qualities of the map i d be changing

8102867
put	get
user can insert new data using put command followed by id number and data value and retrieve data using get command followed by id

8102880
integer	unsigned
where nrows and ncols are integer constants and lc4uint is simply a typedef to unsigned int

8102933
nsstring	nsdata
if you really want to use it first you ll have to read your whole file or a large chunk into an nsstring or an nsdata and then convert that to nsstring

8102941
min	max
there could be more than an id with max and min temperature so i just pick one

8102975
post	get
what i need to do is cancel current post calls and just get the last callback

8102990
portrait	landscape
please go through this link iphone sdk orientation landscape and portrait views i think you are not putting your code in orientation changing method

8103000
folder	directory
for example in my .vim bundle directory it has two new folder delimitmate and colorschemes

8103026
implements	extends
i have public class experimentallinoneactivity extends activity implements onclicklistener on each button click listener i want to go some other class like public class temperaturestrategy and perform all logic calculation in this class but main thing is that i have class like public class dialogdisplay extends dialog implements onitemselectedlistener in this class a custom dialog is created

8103058
onresume	onpause
perhaps you can call onpause in the onresume called only after the screen turns on and call and onresume when your activity has focus again

8103085
querypath	phpquery
you can use domdocument or one of the simpler library frontends like phpquery or querypath

8103092
gson	jackson
i highly recommend abandoning gson in favor of jackson whenever possible.

8103162
width	height
you can define more layouts with different width and height.then check the height and width and density of device and use that specific layout for that device

8103194
width	height
for most width and sometimes height problems you can use layout_weight to assign the exact ratio catered for each view

8103197
getter	setter
i think you should consider data transfer objects dtos which would have public getter setter just to transfer the serialized object data

8103219
width	height
i have a string like this now how can i change the values of width height etc using javascript.there may be a n after or before the properties width height etc

8103275
emacs	aquamacs
i really like the xcode dusk color theme and i was trying to get something similar for my aquamacs emacs

8103297

8103297
superclass	subclassing
i am supposed to do an assignment where i execute a method from the subclassing which overrides the method from the superclass

8103297
superclass	subclassing
however when i declare the type to be of the superclass it does not recognize any of the subclassing s methods to even exist

8103299

8103653
bindparam	bindvalue
but i can t override the bindparam and bindvalue methods

8103661
equals	gethashcode
this is assuming that state overrides equals gethashcode and ideally implements too

8103674
express	node.js
you can use a node.js app built with express or whatever you like standalone you don t need to use something in front of it

apache	nginx
if you want to use something in front of it though i suggest you use something like nginx better than apache since nginx is also asynchronous like node and it s performs really well at serving static files

apache	nginx
apache has explored several models and nginx is using option #1

8103931
apache	nginx
now back to the question my guess based on reading tests published here would be that the proper multi-thread apache architecture should scale better than nginx on multi-core cpus

8103931
apache	nginx
paradoxally it does not mean that apache is faster than nginx it just means that on 1 2 3 .

8103931
apache	nginx
16 cores apache would scale better than nginx while nginx would process more client requests

8108104
implements	extends
the reason why works in controllers is because every controller is extends the base controller which happens to implements this method

8108158
pull	push
there are buttons that allow you to push pull files from the devices as well

8108165
mouseover	mouseout
the trivial solution which i m employing right now is to attach to mouseover mouseout and count them - if there are more mouseovers than mouseouts then the mouse should be within

8108165
mouseover	mouseout
added a case just came to my mind - a mouseover mouseout on a child element which is prevented from bubbling in its handler

8108216
spoofing	traffic
basically both methods try the same redirecting or forwarding traffic to malicious hosts but they work at a different level arp spoofing only within a lan up to the next router

8108226
keydown	keyup
if you are using keydown you can prevent it if your using keyup the event already happened

8108232
put	get
however if i change to then i get all the output of the files put on the terminal

8108236
zoo	xts
i have a df zoo xts whatever that is split by day of week

8108276
post	put	post	get	put	get
with the possibility of using get put post delete for each

8108300
folder	directory
that gives all users read permission on that folder and it makes sure the permissions are applied recursively to all files in that directory

8108336
mouseleave	mouseenter
they abstract cross browser differences between the mouseenter and mouseleave events which do not bubble

8108339
post	get
it would help you to get more accurate answers to post details about the crash -- such as the exception

8108352
hash	salt
the whole process of calculations with hash salt is certainly described

8108358
arp	dhcp
arp spoofing is when the attacker is sending out arp messages from a non-authoritative dhcp server in order to change the ip gateway or in that case the dns servers of the victim

8108372
for-loop	loops
the subtle difference with instead of piping is mainly that the while loops would execute in a subshell due the pipe and the variable in the for-loop would not actually be updated because of the subshell

8108392
folder	directory
so i placed my dlls including the tessdata folder in the same directory and deleted the dlls from system32

8108393
google-chrome	firefox
this opens firefox in google page from a nodejs script for google-chrome should be the same

8108394
google-chrome	firefox
if you have google-chrome or firefox you have many add ons that will help you with seo

8108427
getter	setter
this is related to getter and setter

8108427
getter	setter
from the code it could be either the setter or the getter

8108427
getter	setter
it does seem to be something that is called when the getter or setter is used not defined

8108427
getter	setter
also please pay attention to getter and setter rules

8108427
getter	setter
a getter must have at least as much visibility as the setter ie public if the setter is public etc

8108427
getter	setter
and since we are talking about a compiler bug here i d avoid weird visibilities ie anything not public or private inheritance or mixed visibilities eg setter private and getter public

8108427
getter	setter
so it is related to a getter or setter which is defined in a trait and used on a class or used on a trait

8108511
coffeescript	haml
i am tagging this as haml since i am guessing haml will have the same issue when using coffeescript

8108560
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
the page shows normally on pc every browser and on mac osx safari opera google-chrome and on some osx with firefox

8108586
width	height
in the following some of the width and height can probably be replaced by wrap_content

8108597
nsstring	nsdata
that means staying with nsdata the whole way through and not at any point trying to convert it into or interpret it as text for an nsstring

8108646
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
you could write a firefox plugin google-chrome safari extension to do that

8108655
getter	setter
more complicated getter and setter from within a class

8108683
fseek	fread
you can use the skip option of the fread function as well as fseek to read the records one column at-a-time

8108688
min	max
in fact implementing len max min as a built-in function is actually less code than implementing them as methods for each type

8108719
folder	directory
if you run android.bat from command-line with update sdk arguments it will run all items from a temp directory and not lock the tools folder

8108819
textarea	textbox
on the textarea textbox

8108823
hash	salt
the security class uses the sha1 scheme by default and cakephp also uses a salt which you set in your config.php to generate an even more unique hash

8108830
post	get
according to the samples i ve seen as well as the nice post by jeremy north at i should get what i need from the show method of my iotadebuggervisualizerexternalviewer implementation

8108834
execvp	fork
a job is started by calling fork and then calling execvp with the proper arguments

8108859
hide	show
so i think the flicker comes from this the animation reaches 0px which means sudden fullresize in chrome as show in the above jsfiddle and then the element hide

8108898
free	malloc
memory that is allocated by malloc for example and that is not free

8108912
do-while	break
expression statement do-while statement continue statement break

8108934
free	malloc
that claim about malloc and free is correct for all modern computing operating systems

8108946
button	checkbox
i already have the code for the checkbox and button

8108953
post	get
since you want the app to be able to post to your wall you ll need it to ask you for the publish_stream permission in within the scope but since you ve managed to get your app posting to its own wall as itself you ve probably figured that part out already

8108960
overwrite	preserve
then you would have preserve the old object and created a new object with any properties from the old object if they aren t present in the new object and overwrite any existing properties with the properties from the new data from the server

8108966
uninstall	upgrade
you should be able to uninstall the old products by authoring a major upgrade using the upgrade table

8108991
codeigniter	kohana
what you seem to want is a folder structure like kohana 2 codeigniter and most likely other frameworks which have dedicated folders for controllers models and views

8109006
children	parent
once you delete that parent key you ll orphan the children and won t have access to them anymore

8109008
button	checkbox	hide	show
if you want to prevent the user to find the i agree checkbox and submit button right way you will have to hide it and then show these inputs once he read the last page

8109008
button	checkbox
this loads the terms as you scroll the page and at the last one it adds a checkbox and submit button

8109008
button	checkbox
make sure the page is long enough so you have to scroll and also use the .live event because the checkbox and input button don t exists when you load the page

8109094
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i m currently building a site which looks very well in safari but many elements are out of place in other browsers ie google-chrome chromium canary regular firefox

8109096
int	double
i don t think there s significant improvement performing int arithmetic using matlab s interpreter using int data types might actually be slower because matlab s functions are optimized for double

8109157
google-chrome	firefox
i m getting the following error message in google-chrome and firefox while trying to implement gorbachev s syntax highlighter

8109159
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the longer version is that i m building a fullscreen extension for google-chrome that works the same as firefox and safari on pc

8109171
width	height
i m sorry for answering my own question but the answer is use a flow layout with a script that calculates the space to the bottom of the screen using percentages calculated by the current width and height of the window to calculate the height of the content and or footer div

8109181
daemons	systemd
you can run size geoip_server.o to make sure that the bss uninitialized static data is the same for the 2 daemons on each systemd

8109188
public	protected
default modifier in other words no modifier not public not private and not protected

8109194
viewdidload	viewwillappear
and then of course you have viewdidload and viewwillappear

8109202
firefox	safari
please test it in firefox safari

8109255
post	get
therefore cookies can easily be manipulated and should only be trusted in the same way that you trust post or get data

8109286
bash	zsh
you might try using zsh instead of bash

8109300
pull	push
i had a similar problem although with all internet and not just push pull of git

8109355
post	get
client does a get on the header location but post data is gone meaning the form cannot be repopulated

8109378
sudo	passwd
this solution here says to use sudo whoami and then rvmsudo because it will remember your passwd for 5 minutes but my passwd is not remembered

8109381
free	malloc	implements	extends
just implements a regular memory manager with malloc and free equivalents and extends it to support extra control data your process ids

8109412
innodb	myisam
but it does seem like splitting the product table to house main information innodb and the fulltext descriptions myisam seperately may help dramatically

8109507
google-chrome	safari
the problem occurs for me only in safari google-chrome is ok and only on certain machines reproducible on macbook pros 15 with non-retina displays but not on imacs and retina display machines

8109521
int	boolean
typically semaphores are boolean but they can be int for example if you want to allow a specific number of threads to enter the region at any time

8109532
int	chars
i mean i am seeing people use bytes int chars

8109552
for-loop	loops
of course you can shove multiple statements in a for-loop initialisation or final-expression by separating them with commas but if that is anything more complicated than i++ j++ k-- it quickly gets too messy for my taste and a while loops would be a better choice

8109559
boost	stl
i had this same problem the short answer to your question it s not possible with the standard stl libraries although it is possible with boost phoenix

8109604
textview	imageview
inside it put an imageview and a textview

8109639
width	height
another alternative could be to make a #container with the overall height width 400px then set the .divs to be height width 50

8109699
rss	feed
i am using domdocument to call an rss feed

8109727
post	put
you can replace the method with post delete put for profile editing

8109744
calloc	malloc
malloc will not initialise the memory but calloc will as mentioned by prasoon saurav

8109754
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
for some reason it seems to work in firefox and google-chrome but the slider is broken in safari

8109832
folder	directory
note that this images folder is located inside whatever directory contains your executable

8109884
folder	directory
then i copied this file privatekey.store from my user directory over to my project folder and did the following changes in my code

8109902
atoi	atof
then you can use atoi atof etc

8109905
put	get
i put in my api key but the problem is whenever i call this method i get

8109973
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
note i have tested the above cookie script in firefox google-chrome safari and opera and all work fine

8109973
google-chrome	firefox
it works in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie 8

8110012
realloc	malloc
make yourself familiar with malloc and realloc - here is some kind of example small tutorial

8110024
integer	fractions
you are using int s for currentsize and totalsize which results in integer division which removes the fractions part yielding 0

8110028
integer	fractions
if currentsize and totalsize are integers this calculation will do integer division which will truncate your fractions down to 0

8110053
sdl	glew
for the record i am using visual c++ 2010 express glew 1.7.0 and the latest sdl 1.3 revision

8110087
folder	directory
i think the problem is that the directory cache and fonts of tcpdf residing in the folder which path is stored in the constant k_path_main by default this is the tcpdf-directory are not writeable by your webserver

8110118
int	double
therefore i cast one int operand to double

8110118
int	double
after the calculation if you want the result to store in int you have to cast convert double to int

8110142
ubuntu	linux
i m using the latest v0.6.1 running on ubuntu linux

8110145
allocator	stl
allocator at least pre-c++11 were something of a late addition to the stl

8110157
realloc	malloc
implement your resizable array using malloc and realloc

8110189
unix	solaris
there is no library i m aware of but implementing it would be quite straightforward under solaris and all unix unix like oses supporting tmpfs and mmap

8110202
hash	salt
you can use something like sha-256 but you should also salt the password before hashing it and you can iteratively hash the password - so in the unlikely event it is cracked it will only reveal another hash in other words cracking the password takes much longer

8110235
google-chrome	safari
in safari google-chrome

8110235
width	height
these two sources help fix the jquery get image height or width returns 0 problem which was the initial problem

8110251
implements	extends
java will not allow me to extends from bytebuffer because it implements abstract methods that i am not overriding yet these methods work for any bytebuffer objects that are created such as asdoublebuffer .

8110251
implements	extends
yet if i extends a new class from bytebuffer it forces me to implements asdoublebuffer even though the superclass already implements this method obviously since i can call it just fine

8110270
textview	imageview
i have a complex row layout 2 imageview 3 textview so i have defined my own adapter

8110280
concave	convex
as you see it is neither convex hull nor concave hull

8110300
crypt	salt
also use a varying salt for each call to crypt

8110300
crypt	salt
to call crypt with the blowfish algorithm use a salt that begins with followed by a number the cost parameter between 04 and 31 followed by a and then 22 digits from the alphabet . 0-9a-za-z

8110301
folder	directory
if that is the case then the easiest route would be to simply create a new workspace whose root directory will actually be the htdocs folder

8110338
hash	salt
say i hash passwords with standardpasswordencoder which uses sha-256 and 8bit random characters as a salt and save it to db for registration form for example

8110338
hash	salt
and even if it knows how will it find out what salt to apply to get same hash

8110349
equals	tostring
tostring equals and hashcode method creation

8110406
hex	binary
the exception is for hex numbers that can be formed by two groups 4 binary numbers 2 4 16

8110406
hex	binary
1110 binary would be 14 decimal and equivalent of e hex

8110417
post	get
the method is a get instead of post

8110418
division	modulo
so if you do modulo and integer division in a loop stopping when x 0 you can output a number in any base

8110443
g++	gcc
please enable all warnings and debugging for your compiler with g++ -wall -g if using gcc and improve your code till you get no warning

8110464
hex	binary
to convert 1101000 into hexadecimal we can use a little trick very similar to your attempt to use 10 and 4 to build the hex version from the binary version without much work -- look at groups of four bits at a time

8110477
udp	tcp
if you start from scratch - you know nothing about the lan - and you want to find every possible service you have to scan almost all the tcp and udp ports for every possible host

8110477
min	max
this is the most efficient way both max speed and min network bandwidth

8110477
packets	multicast
your pc nic in promiscous mode doesn t receive all the traffic on the network because the switch forwards to you only the packets for your host or for all broadcast and - if registered - multicast

8110477
winpcap	libpcap
libpcap winpcap is the de facto standard to capture packets and it works

8110482
vim	emacs
you could also use gnu emacs instead of vim

8110492
disk	ram
and while their are workarounds like creating a ram disk i felt it was easier to just select the run only in memory option of sphinx

8110560
hash	md5
for a concrete example of why using plain unsalted md5 for password hashing is a bad idea try entering the md5 hash of some reasonably common passwords into a site like md5decrypter.co.uk or md5hashcracker.appspot.com or md5this.com

8110603
prepare	execute
you can have cached prepare statements and after each execute clear parameters

8110662
int	chars
use explicit cast to convert int to chars

8110738
udp	tcp
i m going to use the udp protocol as it is faster than tcp

8110738
udp	tcp
i like the kryonet api its very clean code however it appears to only allow running of servers on both tcp and udp when i only want a server running on udp

8110748
mailgun	cloudmailin
yes check out the add-on link for cloudmailin mailgun and sendgrid

8110761
for-loop	loops
i thought of an alternative but not yet tried vaz i wanna the way out this way only using a for-loop instead of while loops that might work.

8110762
udp	tcp
i don t think you should make the assumption that udp is faster than tcp

8110783
entities	entitymanager
you should never use the entitymanager inside your entities

8110818
button	checkbox
you could bind the toggle event without the onclick with something like adding a selectall class for the checkbox button

8110853
inherited	properties
the fileinfo and directoryinfo classes both inherited the non-abstract attribute properties from the abstract filesysteminfo class

8110864
post	get
reading these helpful tips and some other post about setting the android device i wrote down a step by step tutorial how to get the device ready

8110864
redhat	fedora	ubuntu	centos
ubuntu redhat fedora centos

8110925
entity-relationship	diagram
not sure if they do entity-relationship diagram syntax though

8110981
post	get
what i d like to know is why every post i read says there is very few places you would typically pass a ref i know the examples are contrived but i hope you get the idea when it seems to me that the ref example is smaller cleaner and more exact

8110982
hide	show
both the hidden show hidden files... and hidefileext hide file extension reverted back to their previous values as soon as i opened the view tab in folder settings

8110984
google-chrome	firefox
but this only supported by gecko firefox google-chrome and internet explorer 10+

8110991
setinterval	settimeout
what you want to do instead is use the settimeout or setinterval functions both methods of the window object

8110991
setinterval	clearinterval	setinterval	settimeout	clearinterval	settimeout
both settimeout and setinterval return an id that is essentially a reference to the timer that has been set which you can use with cleartimeout and clearinterval to cancel any queued execution that hasn t happened yet so another way to implement your function is as follows

8111013
post	get
i have checked with firebug and found that the post to jqpost.php is showing a loading icon and at the same time the get request made by poll is also showing the loading icon

8111074
keydown	keyup
you have keydown keyup and some other events you can use to check what keys is being pressed

8111089
uilabel	uibutton
please help me to add swedish support on uilabel and uibutton

8111168
subtraction	addition
why in the case of subtraction eax register need to be used and not in the case of addition

8111206
width	height
make layout width and height as fill_parent

8111208
inherited	properties
as you don t want to turn proxycreation off you are stuck dynamicproxy objects wherever you put virtual keyword for object properties ef context inherited your object and replaces virtual properties with dynamicproxy objects

8111208
inherited	properties
these dynamicproxy objects do not inherited from your poco entities they just have same properties and can be used instead of your poco

8111226
subtraction	addition
i m guessing because addition is commutative a + b b + a whereas subtraction is not a - b

8111260
coalesce	isnull
if it is possible i would advise to modify stored procedure and or sql call for this procedure and insert missing data with help of partial joins left right join and coalesce isnull functions

8111271
width	height
so i have to find the width depth height values first

8111289
width	height
it s much more easier to use a view for example instead and set it s layout width and height and add custom background

8111300
min	max
firstly the omission of min-heaps in the discussion probably isn t a typo it doesn t really matter if we re talking about a min heap or a max heap the comparator is just reversed

8111313
width	height
assuming you have width 80 depth 39 height 190 in an element ie

8111322
xlib	gdk
alternatively you could use clutter-gtk and the gdk api instead of using xlib directly

8111339
width	height
i have an rgb image matrix height width 3 represented in doubles

8111352
draggable	droppable
the only you need - draggable and droppable

8111415
ubuntu	linux
in linux ubuntu when i invoke the script via bash it works as expected but in windows when i invoke the script via powershell it behaves weirdly check p.s

8111415
ubuntu	linux
same erratic behaviour takes place with the changes and in linux ubuntu behaviour again is as expected

8111451
post	get
you ll need to post explain plan and probably you ll have to answer further questions if you want to get help on that

8111486
post	get
if you still have problems try looking in to this issues with passing cookies to get request after post

8111489
google-chrome	firefox
the following code works fine in google-chrome and firefox but causes an error error access is denied. in ie

8111489
google-chrome	firefox
the success function is called in google-chrome and firefox but the error function is called in ie with the above message

8111489
google-chrome	firefox
it works on google-chrome and firefox both locally and on my server it works in ie locally but not on the server

8111505
int	chars
it can any integral type int chars signed chars unsigned int and so on

8111522
folder	directory
the images folder should be resided in your project root directory

8111531
public	protected
in your code behind file expose the timer as a public protected or private member or field

8111546
google-chrome	firefox
here s a simple bespoke example that works with es5-compliant browsers or libraries that emulate es5 behavior live copy run in google-chrome or firefox or similar but look after the example for a more generalized solution

8111549
super	self
instance variable used while self is not set to the result of super or self init...

8111584
portrait	landscape
it works fine in portrait mode but in landscape it scales everything even the png and it looses resolution

8111609
google-chrome	firefox
i m surprised this works on google-chrome or firefox

8111617
free	malloc
sigabrt at the synthesize line in applicationcell.m with malloc error for object 0x6c30e60 double free

8111681
google-chrome	safari
i believe in google-chrome and safari there is a similar event overflowchanged

8111690
background-color	font-size
they can select the style background-color font-size etc from a drop down and they can provide custom value for the selected styles

8111698
hide	show
one other thing my view starts gone and when i have an ad i will show the view and when i don t have an ad i hide the view

8111702
sudo	passwd
my problem is with sudo the script prompts for passwd

8111723
button	checkbox
when the user click on button refresh don t work it refresh the content of the ui repeat.i expect the checkbox to be checked just as at the initialization

8111735
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome safari ie6 seems to work as i aspected but in mozila firefox 3.6 i have some problem

8111741
debian	linux
i m not going to open a war saying it s like moving from windows to linux or a mac or even moving from debian to red hat but the structures and systems are different so they have different concepts strengths limitations and purposes

8111773
mouseover	mouseout
if you move from one child to another child of #gifts then you have a mouseout and mouseover that get triggered

8111773
mouseover	mouseout
what you should probably do is implement a timeout of 200ms for example for the mouseout and clear that timeout if it exists when a mouseover is called

8111773
mouseover	mouseout
that way the mouseout will take .2s to trigger - plenty of time for the next mouseover event to trigger

8111775
profiling	instrumentation
this gives you a chance to run instrumentation and do a bit of memory profiling and allocation tracking

8111800
folder	directory
i am used to create a folder called work and put images sounds etc there and configure the working directory to use this folder

8111819
folder	directory
load multiple images from directory check rgb value of every file if too dark move to different folder

8111825
put	get
i put twitter and facebook authentication with their secret numbers and when i try to authenticate through facebook auth facebook i get this error

8111840
width	height
you can use this method in bitmap to cut it into a new bitmap of specified width and height pixels

8111853
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationitem	uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uinavigationitem
the dashboard has a uinavigationcontroller and a uitabbarcontroller if i click on one of this buttons it will be push to the specific uiviewcontroller and activate the current tab item and also it has uinavigationitem for back to the dashboard

8111865
mouse	keyboard
but when i press page down button from keyboard it works fine but when i scroll using mouse takes bit more time to load data and scrollbar of gridview displays abnormal

8111889
versioning	upgrade
i ve upgrade my site from versioning 1.4.0.1 to versioning 1.6

8111923
getter	setter
the following helper method converts a getter expression into a setter delegate

8111984
folder	dir
i just wrote those first few line to easily delete the last 2 folder from dir so i m sure that the path is right whatever __dir__ is

8111992
gif	png	gif	bmp	bmp	png
input is automatically detected as bmp png gif or jpg output is always jpg

8111993
sudo	passwd
you need a sudo configuration line which allows for the command to be executed by the user without passwd prompt

8112118
jboss	glassfish
so far most app servers i looked at glassfish jboss are all controlled from the os instead of being able to integrate into an existing java application

8112138
width	font-size
after experimenting with it i found that the font-size property seems to affect the width of the but i m not sure why or how to correct it

for-loop	loops
for each syntax is used to iterate through a collection of objects while a for-loop is a loops that will execute for a given range

8116389
for-loop	loops
both loops are essentially identical with the only difference being - with an ordinary for-loop you have an index which you might need depending on what type of data you are accessing and whether you need to do some calculations with the index and there is probably an increased chance of off-by-one errors

8116436
postgresql	mysql

8116452
superclass	subclassing
i think you answered it in your question elem is a subclassing of node or in reverse node is the superclass of elem

8116468
children	parent
so if you try to traverse the tree go to a node s parent then try to visit its other children you draw a bunch of null pointers

8116475

8116705
range	infinity
if your function returns a numeric value such that only certain range values make sense for instance only non-negative integers or only finite floating point values then use out-of-range values for error codes negative integers or nan infinity as error codes

8116707
superclass	subclassing
you ve overridden everything about superclass in your subclassing and instead having job_select be an instance of different subclassing depending on the job_type and using method resolution to call the right code job_select is always a superclass which contains an option1 or option2 and explicitly delegates to it

8116729
for-loop	loops
in a nutshell each loops of the for-loop is referring to the same variable i so the compiler uses the same lambda expression for all loops

8129153
icmp	udp
the reason it s only thrown by connected udp sockets is that thats how it works at the c level and the reason for that is that being asynchronous there is no other way you could tell which target address caused it because all you have at the c level is an errno not the contents of the icmp message itself

the contents method returns all of the children of the selected elements and unwrap removes the parent which in this case will be the unwanted span

8129558
google-chrome	firefox
it s working firefox and ie but not in google-chrome

8131636
folder	directory
created a development folder in the home folder same level as documents and i have all my projects in that directory

8131657
draggable	droppable
if the draggable has the same dimensions as the droppable the 1 4 overlap would suffice - in this case the right square

8131658
put	get
when it comes to recognizing sounds - it can also get arbitrarily complex but a clapper might be a simple task - you basically want to detect a sudden increase in volume which would manifest in a sharp short-term increase of the moving-average of absolute values in the stream so i d put a sliding windows on the stream and keep checking with certain thresholds - one short window for the high volume threshold and two adjacent longer and lower threshold windows to make sure there was no such noise before and after the clapper

8131685
pop-up	dialog
it would also make it easy to have a are you sure confirmation dialog that you want to pop-up just once and not for every row and using bulk delete features of your server backend one request instead of one for each row

there are also extensions for firefox and iirc for google-chrome too which enable you to easily switch on off passing of this parameter

8133253
getter	setter
this has the advantage that it works with just about any javascript engine not just es5-compliant ones and it s explicit that setting foo is a function call not just a property assignment whereas with the es5 setter getter syntax the person setting the foo property doesn t know that it s a function call mdash

8133294

you just need to call get_active method of gtk checkbox get object of check button from glade file and call get_active method on click event of submit button

8133582
comparator	comparable
see the comparable interface or comparator interface for a precise definition of consistent with equals. this is so because the set interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a sorted set performs all element comparisons using its comparator or compare method so two elements that are deemed equals by this method are from the standpoint of the sorted set equals

8133590
skip-lists	tree
if you go towards writing your own skip-lists tree to make the reordering of an item into a single - and hopefully faster - op then you might also go this lock-free route too

8133603
accessor	ivar
generally they re equivalent in objective-c 2.0 environment but the debugger for example won t see the generated ivar as this object s member in the variables view and you ll have to ask for the value by using gdb s command line po command using the accessor method not the short-form dot notation though

8133640
versioning	upgrade
onupgrade is called whenever the app is upgrade and launched and the database versioning is not the same

8133640

8133640
versioning	upgrade
when a user upgrade from versioning 2 to 3 they just get the revision 3 update.

uiview	subviews
if you tried to create one uiview as a subviews for the uiscrollview with a width of 3000 to match your content and added your uilabels to that view rather than directly to the uiscrollview perhaps then ios will be able to cache it and give you better perf

8133732
public	protected
your code is correct however if you don t specify the method permission ie public private or protected the default behaviour of public be assigned to it

8133738

8133877
width	height
basically view in side blockui has width and height set to 100

8133877
width	height
image has width and height set to 100 but this is wrong i know

8133879
width	height
change this to your needs you could for example adjust the width and height of the image to the surrounding border

8133890
daemons	systemd
its better that u can use the php socket library to connect with the daemons running in your systemd and then u can pass data to the daemons and can process the result sent back by the daemons

8133932
width	height
this keeps the img element s aspect ratio when resizing up to the maximum possible width and height

8133950
fastboot	adb
download android sdk i compiled sdk from source for adb and fastboot place all the bin files and executables and other java class librarirs in their respective system folders

8133975
int	chars
it is taking the one chars found there and casts that to an int

8133980
disk	ram
but this leads to not taking advantage of all that makes ram access different from file disk access

8133980
disk	ram
such an engine usually can be made faster if it implements ram specific optimizations so that it offers in each world ram versus disk the best .

8133993
int	double
that function1 and function2 have specialized versions for int long and double since scala 2.8

8134015

chars converted to an int and advances the associated file position indicator for the

8134054
int	chars
as i understood it int type can have the same width as an unsigned chars

8134080
cos	sin
if you are in 2d maybe it is enough to take the point you are calculating from camera field view and offset heading calculate the distance to the center of the screen and use that distance as a radius for a circle to do x + r cos y + r sin with -roll as the angle so the object moves in a circle against the roll

8134110
folder	directory
this is working on my local machine but when i tried it from the virtual directory it is not creating any file in the temp folder

8134122
cos	sin	cos	exp
instead of sin you could also use other math functions such as cos exp etc

8134129
client-side	server-side
using a timestamp in the name or correctly set cache headers would then enable you to save the time on both server-side generating the js-friendly output and client-side downloading data and still offer up to date data

8134192
spaces	delimiter
my file was actually delimiter by comma + spaces - not by - and lines were terminated by r n instead of n

post	get
get a post to post and so on

8134266
nginx	lighttpd	apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd
example use h264 streaming module apache lighttpd nginx iis

8134314

assuming an unsigned short int is 16 bits on your platform it might be different you ll then access the nsdata contents by 16bits

8145360
stdout	stderr

8145360
stdout	stderr
the important part to remember about stdin stdout and stderr is that they are completely unrelated to the graphical display that the terminal emulators offer

8145367
ceil	floor
if this doesn t make sense consider that in the special case of dx 1 dy 1 the grid points correspond with integers and you can get to grid points by floor and ceil

interested in other people s answer but one reason i ve found is that it forces you to notice if you re accessing the ivar directly when you should be using the getter setter

8145492
superclass	subclassing
to both force the subclassing to set the values in the constructor and to make the constructor call readable you re going to have to write a lot more code in the superclass

8145795
int	chars
i am almost tempted to convert the 6 int to a string as if each int is a unicode chars or something like that not by representing each int as an actual number and use hashcode but it sounds very inefficient to me i think want something faster

in batch files the parameter delimiter are besides spaces comma semicolon and equal sign so there is no direct way to do that

8145964
int	chars
basically i am trying to be able to get a string of digits that can be longer than an int which is why it uses chars to insert into the myint object using the overload for

8146011
post	get
displays the data sent to the server from a post request tab only shows for post requests not get requests

8146054

i ve also tried an alternative of using setinterval on the canvas mouse events and removing the settimeout in the timecount function but the timecount function is not called at all

8157246
content-length	content-type
if you do a head request you will usually be able to get some basic metadata on the file in question in the form of the content-type and content-length headers returned by the server but this is typically limited to the mime type and the file size and if you re dealing with a script that serves the file and that script doesn t set the necessary headers you might not even get that

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and safari the container rotates gradually whereas in firefox the container rotates immediately

8157408
udp	tcp
the first possible issue i can think of is that because udp doesn t have the overhead inherent in the transmission control that tcp does udp has higher data bandwidth and lower latency

8157408
udp	tcp
so it is possible for a udp datagram that was sent after a tcp message to be available on the remote computer s input buffers before the tcp message is received in full

8157408
udp	tcp
this may cause problems if you use tcp to control or monitor udp transmission

8157408
udp	tcp
for instance you might tell the server via tcp that you ll be sending some datagrams via udp on port x

8157428
udp	tcp
if you already have a tcp or udp server the easiest way will probably be to switch to unix domain sockets

8157428
udp	tcp
they come in stream and datagram modes just like tcp udp sockets and they re always local as they use the filesystem namespace instead of port numbers like tcp udp

8157440

8157809
int	chars
this separates the chars string into its right int and may be helpful to more people than just me
