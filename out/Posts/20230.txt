the main problem is that when requesting an int from std cin using the operator a sequence of numeric chars from the beginning of the input will be converted

24480145
swift	objective-c
as for your question yes its quite common to use as type all over the place in swift when using objective-c apis

24480145
swift	objective-c
that s a by-product of going from objective-c to the strongly-typed swift language it should get better when more libraries are written in swift and less objective-c is used

24480189
serializable	deserialization
as you step beyond inter-process communications and object sharing note any ipc can be an object sharing mechanism using serializable deserialization .

ng-view	ng-include
from what i can understand the xmen site navigation pulls in the html templates to the ng-view and within this the ng-include pulls in the content from further html templates

24480235
multiplication	exponent
it s possibly a better fit for this case because your exponent will be integers although it may be a bit less efficient as it uses repeated multiplication logarithmic in the exponent rather than constant-time floating point operations

int	chars
i m trying to write a function will convert the chars from an array into int so that i can produce a sum or other math process for each group

24480417

24480706
stdout	stderr
failing to close these means that when the parent itself tries to read the stdout and stderr of the child it will never see eof again for the same reasons as above because it itself still owns a write-end pipe in which it could write making new data appear to the read-end

24480707
children	parent
it s quite easy to tell that when going through the children of the given parent you ll need to get those descendants if you want to add the recursion

24480707
children	parent
if there are no children of it then it will return an empty array otherwise it ll add the information for that child and then start a new run for the id of the grandchild as parent id and .

24480913
cos	sin
the circular functions here cos sin take angles in radians 2 pi radians in a circle but the angles are given in degrees 360 degrees in a circle so the radians function converts degrees to radians so that the circular functions will give the correct results

24482870
getter	setter
you need to provide the objectanimator with the necessary getter and setter methods to do its magic as it essentially just calls those getter and setter methods to perform the animation

24482870
getter	setter
so to summarise the objectanimator itself doesn t actually do much animating it just calls getter and setter methods through reflection

24482870
width	height
since the screen width height will be different from device to device you need different animations for each device

24482870
getter	setter
you cannot do what you want to do with objectanimators without adding the getter and setter methods you need to the view you want to animate

24482870
width	height
with them you can define animations based on fractions of the width or height of the view

24482877
int	chars
the reason you are seeing your chars s cast to an unsigned value is because gcc is making sure that eof and the chars value 0xff are distinct behind the scenes in by casting the chars to unsigned chars before returning the int note that the standard also requires that returns eof and weof for wchar_t

put	get

however xcode s test runner insists on trying to run the superclass as well as the subclassing

24499151
ng-style	ng-class
i would avoid using ng-style in this instance you may find it easier to use ng-class and apply a different class depending this will allow you to keep all your css in a single place rather than overriding within the html

24499205
ng-style	ng-class
instead of using ng-style use ng-class to attach a class that will determine which before after pseudo class to use

memmove	memset
specifically i was looking helper functions of memmove memset string_at wstring_at

24499243

24499381
public	protected
this method is the public version of the protected method sample

24499384
public	protected
looking at the .net source code it seems they are doing exactly the same thing except one is protected and one is public

24499385
public	protected
as for your question as long as you don t override sample there s no difference between them as nextdouble calls sample but you can t call sample on a random instance as it is protected and not public

24499417
for-loop	arrays
you can try constructing the ret arrays with this function and test how the time compares by iterating in a for-loop or similar

24499432
preorder	inorder
to check if a binary tree is subtree of another tree i was thinking that lets store the inorder and preorder traversal of the tree as strings like assigning characters to each node and then do a substring match to check if the tree is subtree or not

24499442
nsurl	nsstring
_itemurl is an nsurl object not a nsstring

it s clear that the first is not a subtree of the second but your method would say that it is since the preorder traversals are 2 1 and 2 1 2 and the inorder traversals are 2 1 and 2 2 1

24499582
preorder	postorder
maybe preorder and postorder would work i can t think of a counterexample right now but i also can t prove it

24499584

width	height
the problem is probably that since the chart is not on the screen when the page loads so it has a width and height of 0

24503676
width	height
when the popover appears even though the width is 425 and height is 400 the chart still thinks it is width 0 and height 0 until you move the page in which it resizes and gains the correct size

24503676
width	height
the trick i have used in the past is using an ng-if directive to force the chart to instantly render to the correct width and height and never be set to 0 height and 0 width

24503676
hide	show
so just make a boolean that determines whether a chart is show or not and then use ng-if to hide show the chart

24503678
post	put
by default your browsers can t post it independently it needs an app to do post put delete

24503718
unix	bsd
you probably want the unix bsd class which means that you should be adding 0x2000000

24503960
subtract	add
you could add a baseline benchmark which executes the if and key++ in order to isolate the time required for key bookkeeping and the actual map.get time but you will need to explain the results the blog post linked above describes pitfalls with subtract baselines from real measurements

24504005
exponent	modulo
then divide x by 2 k run your original code shift its output left by k e where e is your exponent and reduce modulo m

fast-forward	merge
check if a fast-forward merge is possible

24504400
fast-forward	merge
i know the theory behind a fast-forward merge and it seems right to use master and origin master as arguments to merge-base but i m no git expert

24504430
sudo	passwd
after this i m asked to enter the ssh sudo passwd same passwd for both

24504461
hash	salt
both methods use a salt but they do not return the salt only the hash

24504461
hash	salt
then store that salt and the hash password in your db

24504461
hash	salt
this will allow you to store your salt in the database along with the hash salt password

24504461
hash	salt
prepend the salt to the password and hash it with a standard cryptographic hash function such as sha256

24504461
hash	salt
save both the salt and the hash in the user s database record

24504461
hash	salt
retrieve the user s salt and hash from the database

24504461
hash	salt
prepend the salt to the given password and hash it using the same hash function

the submit button is displayed below the data table.while submission the form i put validation for text filed.the validation is working fine for the first pge .if i navigate the second page .the validation.the validation used this

24504761
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
it should present a uinavigationcontroller and its rootviewcontroller a simple uiviewcontroller

24504766
min	max
i am able to take out max price from a given data but when it comes to min value it is showing default 0.00000

24504772
width	height
i am having a window with its width and height according to my window width and height

24504772
width	height
now i am adding grid inside this window but want to adjust its height and width on the basis of windows height and width i.e 4 rows and each should take only 5 of windows height

24504788
inherited	subclassing
usually the position of each subclassing in memory is determined uniquely by the inherited hierarchy but in this case since a is included twice in c the compiler must decide how to adjust the this pointer for the member function call - which it cannot do on its own so it will ask you to decide

24504815
post	get
then simply use a select query to get your post from db and fill in your page with the values

24504820
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is reproduced on latest version of three.js - r67 in firefox and google-chrome

24504828
google-chrome	firefox
the downloaded file name using google-chrome is always download.xls and using mozilla firefox it is random-string.xls

24504847
put	get
this is because the elements used for the dialog box get taken out of the page dom and put inside a new element

24504867
children	parent
as per this question on the parse forum saveall is using batches in the background if it determines that the object graph has unsaved children it does them in a batch then uses the results of that to be able to correctly save the parent

24504892
width	height
i want each button size to be let s say 60 of the height and the width of the div cells

24504898
width	height
the width height are properties that directly influence the scale of a displayobject

24504921
int	chars
thus you either have to remove the multiplication by sizeof int or if you really wanted to explore arithmetic on adresses make pointer a instead because a chars is one byte

24504963
opera	firefox
that close button changes its location in firefox and opera

24504995
width	height
if you want to constrain your grid to the top 20 of your window height 4 5 20 and the left-most 10 of your window width 2 5 10 then force that in a grid itself and then you can just allow your rows and columns to all have equal sizing

24505031
versioning	upgrade
i have just upgrade the apache hadoop on our cluster of 480 nodes from versioning 1.2.1 to 2.2.0

24505038
x86	64bit
installers for jdk 7u2 to 7u5 install the jdk first then start the javafx sdk installer which installs javafx sdk in the default directory c program files oracle javafx 2.0 sdk or c program files x86 oracle javafx 2.0 sdk on 64bit operating systems

24505069
post	get
i am struggling to get my head around an htaccess rule to redirect requests for an html file to go to a custom post

24505076
int	chars
chars data type is just like int in c

24505076
int	chars
now most of the times you have seen unsigned chars which is used to increase the range of int up to 255

24505086
viewdidload	viewwillappear
my button gets hidden when i disable the button in - void viewdidload or - void viewwillappear bool animated or in the nib

24505143
sidekiq	god
the basic idea is to run god as a system service and configure your sidekiq to be watched by god

24505143
sidekiq	god
when your server restarts god runs as a service and it will start your sidekiq workers

24505221
gruntjs	yeoman
i generated it using yeoman generator-jekyllrb and i m using gruntjs and bower

24505288
mousemove	mousedown
i have problem i have background image and changing it scale and position with mousewheel and can drawing with mousedown and mousemove events

24505290

24505380
min	max	range	min	range	max
i ve made ui range slider with min value 100 and max value 300

24505384
toolbar	tabs
jeasyui has a toolbar function within the tabs

24505399
erlang	elixir
you need to have erlang installed for escripts to work you don t need to have elixir installed though

24505456
min	max
in your code when you define the initial values for min and max you should change the values to

24505456
min	max
that way any value will be initially less than the value in the min variable and larger than the value in the max variable

24505543
int	double
i understand that in c++ when i convert a float double into an int whereby the floating-point number is beyond the range that the int can hold the result is not defined as part of the c++ language

24505614
typedef	struct
you create a typedef for a struct called hnode

24505614
typedef	struct
a simple way of fixing this is to create a struct and typedef separately

24505629
width	height
so if i add a breakpoint at the start of the pack function and i use a watch to check i can see that the width and height values have nothing to do with what is provided sometimes it s even 0 or negative

24505630
uilabel	uibutton
i have a custom view with a uilabel and uibutton that i use for my grouped uitableview section headers like so

24505630
uitableview	reloaddata
i use a uitableview category method to return visibleheaders so that i can refresh visible section header views without calling reloaddata or reloadsections withrowanimation

24505639
typedef	struct
the struct you ve typedef to hnode doesn t actually have a name you only said struct not struct hnode and during its definition the typedef does not yet exist so you end up creating two different struct one called hnode and one typedef to hnode

24505670
floating-point	integer
this is all it has to worry about because overflow in the conversion from floating-point to integer is undefined behavior

24505670
int	double
as another example in the particular case of the conversion from double to 32-bit unsigned int on the x86-64 platform the results can be funny

24505670
floating-point	integer	integer	unsigned
there are no instructions in the x86 instruction sets to convert from floating-point to unsigned integer

24505670
int	double
on mac os x for intel compiling a 64-bit program the conversion from double to 32-bit unsigned int is compiled in a single instruction the instruction for 64-bit conversions cvttsd2siq with destination a 64-bit register of which only the bottom 32-bit will subsequently be used as the 32-bit unsigned int it represents

24505670
int	double
this explains how on that platform a result modulo 2 32 can be obtained for double that are small enough specifically small enough to fit in a signed 64-bit int

24505670
int	double
in the old ia-32 instruction set there is no instruction to convert a double to a 64-bit signed int and there is no instruction to convert a double to a 32-bit unsigned int either

24505670
int	double
the conversion to 32-bit unsigned int has to be done by combining a few of the instructions that do exist including two instructions cvttsd2si to convert from double to 32-bit signed int

24505670
int	double
the high-level algorithm using only conversions from double to int would be

24505670
int	double
this translation of the c conversion from double to unsigned int gives the same saturating behavior as the 32-bit conversion instruction that it relies on

ubuntu linux is more strict when it comes to opening files that are already open the line

24505925
int	chars
if the subject sequence has the expected form and the value of base is zero the sequence of chars starting with the ï rst digit is interpreted as an int constant according to the rules of 6.4.4.1

24505926
post	get
but then the rest of the code is in braces after this initial block so it will get fired each time you post back therefore resetting the lists

24505927
put	get	post	get	post	put
using wrong verb to access rest entry get but should be post put or delete

post	get
the main difference between get and post are listed below as

24506021
gridview	rowdatabound
add rowdatabound event handler to the gridview

24506033
inherited	properties
please try below code you have to add one inline properties white-space inherited

24506050
button	checkbox
if you re interested in dynamically adding checkbox to your contentpane and adding a button to it the best thing you could do is create your own widget and use a store to represent the data

24506125
uitableview	uipageviewcontroller
what i m having is a uipageviewcontroller with several uitableview inside but the uitalbeview cannot get the tap gesture the didselectrowatindexpath of the uitableview delegate is not fired

24506222
google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari
when using safari google-chrome opera the anchors work as i expect just moving down and keeping the translated element in the correct position

24506314
implements	extends	checkbox	dropdownlistfor
my idea is to implements the usual audit-trail functionality which is discussed and shown in various other questions tutorials and should not be the issue here by extends the existing asp.net controls such as asp textbox asp checkbox asp dropdownlistfor etc with a simple property bool audittrail which can be set to true in my .aspx-file and then tracks the changes in code-behind

24506319
fseek	ftell
you should not be using ftell and fseek to determine the size of a file since it might be the source of vurnerabilities

24506350
invokelater	invokeandwait
is an ui update thread i tried things like invokelater and invokeandwait to order the events the hot keys work

i dont want anyone to view the games within this main directory so they cant view other games ids but if they have their games id they can view the contents of their games folder

24506504
hide	show
i want to hide all of the contents within that folder but show contents within the sub-directories such as this

24506511
slideup	slidedown
here it ll only slideup slidedown the relevant div

24506538
folder	directory
this will create a folder named overhere in the ec2-user s home directory on someserver.com if it doesn t already exist and copy the local data.csv into that directory

24506557
put	get
i don t get any error message in the log but my excel sheet is overwritten with the code that is in the put statement that is range a1 a3 .numberformat general instead of applying the format to it

24506565
children	parent
also most of the implementations that i am aware of implement binary splits meaning that each parent has two children

24506568
mouseleave	mouseenter
again mouseenter and mouseleave are probably the best options maybe try something like the following

24506570
x-tag	polymer
both x-tag and polymer provide a convenient and opinionated wrapper around web-components that greatly reduce boilerplate code

24506667
ubuntu	linux
now i encountered a stranger problem during setting the default locale i came from china locale is zh_cn by default when our system is deployed on windows server i can get the correct locale zh_cn from httpservletresponse but when our system deployed on ubuntu linux server i always get en_us locale from httpservletresponse

24506704
superclass	subclassing
however i don t quite understand what you mean about subclassing not having access to convenience methods as they can have access to whatever the superclass does so long as you import correctly

24506739
google-chrome	firefox
whenever i execute this in google-chrome or firefox most times i do only get the following output

24506740
folder	directory
in my servicedefinition.csdef file i refer to the source directory by going up three folder to the solution folder and then navigating from there

24506771
hide	show
if you want to hide these then set the option to on and then this will only show your custom error message page

24506792
spoofing	traffic
the mitm is intercepting the victim s traffic but will not need to spoofing the ip address as your system will only see the public ip which will be the same

24506792
spoofing	traffic
if they are within your server infrastructure network then may be able to use something like arp poisoning to intercept traffic - no spoofing of the victim s ip is necessary here

24506799
viewdidload	viewwillappear
now instead of assigning value in viewdidload in viewcontroller do it in viewwillappear

24506817
hide	show
i try to use in jquery with the slidetoggle effect to show and hide 2 div s content while click on buttons...but it isn t working as i excepted

24506854
jstl	taglib
i suppose i ve a problem mixing jstl tags + el expression + spring mvc taglib but i can t figure out why

24506865
folder	directory
admin has its own app folder and index.php its a sub directory

24506869
gwt	cssresource
cssresource in gwt is limited to css 2 plus a few additions

24506869
gwt	cssresource
it ll be bundled in the next gwt version 2.7 and will replace cssresource in the version after that

for-loop	loops
how can i do the same thing using for-loop or while loops

24507028
folder	directory
from the folder containing com directory something openjdk langtools src share classes

24507030
hide	show
i m stuck with the below code i want to show a table if data exists and hide it if there s no data

24507045
integer	unsigned
return a nsuinteger which is an unsigned integer value

24507045
integer	unsigned
when you compare an unsigned integer with an signed integer the signed integer will be convert to unsigned so the value i is not negative now

24507046
multiplying	add
we read each character strip off the last nybble the 0-9 part and add that to our final result after multiplying by ten

24507046
multiplying	add
now i imagine someone is going to ping me about doing the wacky adding to multiplying cx by 10 but it s easier to repeatedly add cx and bx to get the result than to manipulate ax and dx to use the mul 10 instruction.

24507054
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
special note when using this for-loop you should loops while the variable i is less than the length of the arrays upfiles.length and not less or equal because the arrays is 0-based meaning you ll get an out-of-bound exception if i equals the length of the arrays

24507140
folder	directory
you can simple put it in main folder when you don t want users to display files in this directory so in your case probably in directory

24507185
post	get
so i tryed ot do it via post an array which i transform and i get rows like

24507219
width	height
note this only works if the .link element has a height and a width specified

24507223
for-loop	arrays
and that s true because you re using the arrays charz in your for-loop condition without defining it anywhere

24507231
ubuntu	linux
i have used the ppa ppa fkrull deadsnakes to install python 3.4 in my elementary os a ubuntu based linux distribution

post	get
actually i just get a jwt but when i perform the post request to get my token google sends me

24507378
for-loop	loops
it s not super elegant but using the definitions for s1 - s4 above here is a quick for-loop of for loops that will print the vectors you requested

24507397
listview	gridview
i have a wpf listview which view property is set to gridview

24507407
width	height
but that makes the viewport height zero the width already seems to adapt to full width of the window

24507450
folder	directory
create a file called script.js and upload it to a folder inside your theme s directory

24507470
folder	directory
this creates a full listing of all files and folder starting from your start directory

24507509
prepare	execute
to avoid trouble like this i usually create shell scripts in bin which have the same name as the tool that i want to execute which prepare the environment

24507516
post	get
jquery is seeing the data type is a string and so it doesn t do any processing so you d have to access the raw post data on the php side and do a json decode to get it

24507521
rspec	capybara
i use rspec selenium capybara database_cleaner site_prism and factory girl

24507666
super	extends
the extends keyword automatically calls the super constructor if no constructor is given for the class

24507697

unfortunately result in web browser google-chrome is all cells in one column and in firefox in one row

24507721
range	min
using min to get the smallest number from the generated range that wasn t found on the table

24507730
width	height
using minwidth width height all don t display this correctly and all of them focus on the image size not the box size

24507752
width	height
i d also like to stretch this area to take up the full height width of the web page

24507783
hide	removeclass	addclass	removeclass
alternatively you can bond the event to an element and use addclass removeclass or toggleclass to remove the class which hide it

while you can pass objects with a get event by putting the object into the data property of the request i would suggest using a post method

the post method allows your object to be put into the body of the request which is much easier to pass when dealing with complex objects

24534558
put	get	post	get	post	put
with simple objects you could do this with a get and it would put the properties into the querystring but i suggest using a post and putting the object in the body

this will handle get and post requests with a lot of cool features such as custom timeouts json format onsuccess and onfailure methods etc

24535055
next	except
i get most of what going on here except for the throw right next to the destructor

24535074
int	double
the representation of a double with a value of 15.0 most likely contains several bytes of 0 on the stack which printf read as int s because you told it to do so in the format string

by default the method of form submit is get and you intend to do a post

24535124

24535241
folder	directory
then i go into my .intellijidea13 config folder and do a mkdir plugins to create the directory

24535263

if there is no chance to change the html you will need some kind of hack to workaround as like quentin answered all the child objects automatically inherit width and margin from parent objects in dom

24535279
width	height
i think it s because the order of width and height arguments is incorrect

24535297

if you run out of space in that chunk you can either malloc another chunk which probably won t be contiguous with the first or realloc to extend and probably move it

jmeter	soapui
if you won t be able to translate their php examples to jmeter xml-rpc xml body perhaps you can use soapui to generate stubs

24536090
post	get
your code is unreliable as you re only executing the code if code exists in the get or post request

24536094
width	height
therefore the resulting picture s width must be the original picture s height and the resulting picture s height must be the original picture s width

24536094
width	height
since you use the original width and height for the new picture if one value is larger than the other not a square picture you will go outside the picture

24536094
width	height
to flip the picture like intended instead of swapping the x and y values subtract the current x and y value from the width and height respectively minus 1

24536119
int	double
boolfcn 4 int 4 double

24536119
int	double
this is valid because int and double are both members of the num and eq typeclasses but they are clearly not the same type

24536119
int	double
sumthis 4 int 4 double

24536155
getter	setter
what you could do is to use the methods __definesetter__ and __definegetter__ to create individual getter and setter fiddle

24536160
google-chrome	firefox
this happens across the latest versions of google-chrome firefox ie

24536160
width	height	width	font-size
if i size a div and a button both with a width of 3rem and height of 3em i would expect them to be square unless there is a font-size style affecting one of them or an ancestor

24536160
width	height	width	font-size
the only font-size is on the body tag but what happens is that the div is square but the button has a smaller height than its width

24536185
google-chrome	firefox
the a only-child before works in all the browsers i have tested firefox and google-chrome and ie9+ but in ie8 it is ignored

24536200
lodash	underscore.js
i was reviewing some source code and underscore.js lodash was included just for the _.isboolean function

24536228
free	malloc
regarding #2 one reason for the results of calls to malloc not being exactly contiguous can be metadata when you ask for x bytes malloc implementations may allocate a little extra memory for internal bookkeeping processes tagging the size of the block pointers to other free blocks etc

24536276
backgrounding	multitasking
it is a good starting point to understand multitasking and the correct policy to adopt if your app has to responsibly run in the backgrounding

24536341
min	max
depending on the other data in the table writing rows to other tables can make it hard--if not impossible--to run accurate aggregate queries queries using min max sum avg etc.

24536352
portrait	landscape
delivering only landscape full page ads to the ipad and portrait to the iphone and not saying so is asking for trouble

24536352
portrait	landscape
i gave up using the iadsuite code which caused the landscape ipad ad to leave the screen in landscape even when the device was in portrait

24536374
fontforge	freetype
fontforge can do this if it has been built with freetype included

24536417
portrait	landscape
the problem is that when the phone switches between landscape and portrait mode the activity is recreated

24536480
jar	war
some of them are producing a war and other are producing a jar

24536487
portrait	landscape
don t forget that full page test ads are landscape only in ipad and portrait only in iphone

24536524
portrait	landscape
this implements a correct behaviour except if you rotate the device after a transaction for example if you are in portrait go to the screen b1 and then rotate the device to landscape the fragmenta slot is empty

24536548
jar	war
the project uses maven and structured to support any type of archival war or jar

24536548
jar	war
as we have abstracted much of our functionality in a seperate jar would be added as dependency to my spring integration project externalization will result in reducing the war file to 5 kb

24536576
postgresql	mysql
there s also date 2014-07-02 which is accepted by oracle db2 mysql and teradata but not ms sql or postgresql

24536619

width	height
change the top left width or height of the after element if needed

24536667
implements	extends
failing other solutions i implements a redirect in my base controller by extends onactionexecuting as follows

24536705
post	get
i couldn t get any conclusion from those post

24536706
cvs	svn
don t think dev team will start generating this artifact with a proper extension as this artifact may be hard coded everywhere in other projects where they are currently getting it from cvs svn source control somewhere - which is itself a bad practice to store an artifact in source control version tool

24536717
width	height
the width height data you are accessing is that of the images themselves not their placement on the page

24536718
google-chrome	firefox
when using ie its not working but using google-chrome or firefox it working fine

24536742
firefox	safari
however the second one doesn t seem to load correctly in safari firefox etc so probably not usable

24536821
margin	height
if you set widths height padding and margin in ems then you can shrink and enlarge the elements by changing the parent container font size with + - buttons and some simple javascript functionality

24536832
subtract	add
however for the add and subtract post requests i am getting an error 500 internal server error in the console

24536837
client-side	server-side
javascript is client-side and php is server-side the php code isn t run unless it s told to run on the server

24536868
post	get
to get it on another page means another controller say controller2 index method you should post view to another controller action with hidden fields bound to model

24536882
apache	lighttpd
tried switching server software on my test box apache and lighttpd both show this behavior

24536936
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox

24537063
put	get
now i m trying to put the title above the text itself and i get stuck there

24537118
folder	directory
we ve removed the website from the solution and deleted the testsite folder from the projects folder as it was writing to the incorrect directory

i ve added a class that limits the height and width of app but it still expands to full screen covering the confluence header

24537186
websphere	ibm
go to c ibm websphere wp_profile bin

24537209
multiplying	add
then i count my data array multiplying by the multiplier and add the base and echo it as the height of the chart s containing div

24537302
getter	setter
second you should implement getter and setter for that class property

24537359
post	get
you can also optionally specify method post for the link i believe but this is bad practice because links should be get requests and not post s

24537368
post	get
your second route new_opportunity get opportunities new . format will be called when your form renders on your browser window you can check it on your browsers address bar also and your first route post opportunities . format opportunities#create is the one which will be called when you submit your form and it will take you to opportunities#create

24537436
hash	salt
i ve got a user database of salt hash passwords and a java app they log into is it better to do

24537493
width	height
when you cannot decide your icon size but you are sure it is square and you want its width height same as your icon placed horizontally

24537515
put	get
i m sure there s probably a straightforward enough solution to get your desired size but i m afraid i haven t yet put the required time into this

24537519
uiview	uiwindow
you can animate a uiwindow like any other view using uiview animation methods

24537520
width	height
you ll have to do some guess-and-check work to figure out the percentage width height of the body at which you want to absolute position your icons above the houses -- but then you could just use css

24537526
dateadd	datepart
you should use sql dateadd datepart number date function pertinent to your case dateadd year number date

24537553
nsstring	nsdata
it compiles fine but it returns null every time when i run the application i ve tried different solutions converting nsdata to nsstring but that didn t spit out decoded string neither

24537602
post	get
i m trying to get data from a website and when i tried to get the date of a post expected 13 06 2014 11 55 i got

24537702
mouse	keyboard
i am looking for a way by which i can capture all events specifically keyboard mouse events in a javafx application

24537757
width	height
the coordinates given to the set_position are relative coordinates left lower width height where each direction is scaled by the page size

24537798
filtering	grouping
the -like will filtering it down to just the object-group lines and then the -replace will get rid of object-group from the line leaving just the object grouping names

24537807
post	get
this task is completed well when i use get method for submitting the form but when i use post then the whole array is empty in my template

24537822
range	minimum
to normalize any set of numbers to be between 0 and 1 subtract the minimum and divide by the range

24537822
range	min
in your case the min is -1 and the range is 2 so if a value in your set is -0.5 that value becomes

24537823
queue	fifo
this loop reads messages from the message queue in a fifo fashion and makes the calls to handle the messages including calls to your own event handlers

24538094
put	get
i get the an error 405 http method put is not supported by this url

24538124
java.util.date	simpledateformat
the java.util.date and .calendar and simpledateformat classes bundled with java are notoriously troublesome

24538175
g++	gcc
we have an opportunity to install the latest gcc including g++ of course in a similarly alternative directory tree

24538199
onclick	onchange
so my goal was to be able to select the same value multiple times which essentially overwrites the the onchange function and turn it into a useful onclick method

24538212
oncreate	recreate
now after switching on the internet i want oncreate to be called again and the activity should be recreate

24538231
hash	salt
seems to me the database will also have the salt and the application needs that to compute the hash

24538251
vim	emacs
for vim emacs

24538251
vim	emacs
another option would be to use ternjs and vim emacs as explained by slava kim at dev shop

24538291
jar	war
make sure the quartz jar is located inside web-inf lib folder in your war file

24538310
width	height
i am struggling to figure out something let s say im rendering some image that has a height of 100 and a width of 100

24538310
width	height
as lower left corner x lower left corner y width height

24538310
width	height
as lower left corner x lower left corner y width height

24538310
width	height
that basically means that in scenario a the image will be rendered to a lower width and height than it requires i.e will be rendered s.t every two pixels

24538311
implements	extends
java interface can extends multiple interface also java class can implements multiple interfaces which means interface can provide more polymorphism support than abstract class

24538365
put	get
you can put the broadcast receiver inside the activity class and use getapplicationcontext to get a reference of the activity

24538381
pop-up	dialog
sometimes if an active application pop-up a modeless dialog the modeless dialog will become the key window but it is not the first window with so i ll get a wrong window

i tryed to write an app that post a form to a website and then gets the result which will later be used in jsoup but everytime the app is run i get the same website back as a result

24538563
.htaccess	httpd.conf
not sure if it matters but keep in mind that this is not going in an .htaccess but is going in the httpd.conf file to apply the rules server wide

24538575
screens	hdpi
240 dpi for hdpi screens

24538575
screens	mdpi
160 dpi for mdpi screens

24538599
chunked	transfer-encoding
if you enforce http 1.0 the server is not allowed to send data with transfer-encoding chunked so this might explain why it works with http 1.0

24538642
implements	extends
public class setting extends activity implements onclicklistener

24538728
implements	extends
this code is from a class which extends package and implements ivstrackprojectdocumentsevents2

24538742
int	boolean
since a boolean is one bit by storing bits into a long or int operations are done in parallel

24538774
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	opera	safari
hsl is actually a much better format for working with colors and is supported in css ie9+ firefox google-chrome safari and in opera 10+.

24538805
bower	npm
the main reason bower works so well is it transparently works w npm

24538833
width	height
you say that the image has a width and height of 100

24538843
put	get
so i instead put the users list in the params argument of requests.delete so they would be specified in the query string and as expected i get

24538852
uipangesturerecognizer	uigesturerecognizer
create failure dependencies between the uiscrollviews pangesturerecognizer properties and the dummy uipangesturerecognizer corresponding to the direction perpendicular to your uiscrollview s desired scrolling direction by using uigesturerecognizer s -requiregesturerecognizertofail selector

after ensuring the scaled down versions in the mdpi and hdpi folder were proper 9-patch images the project exported properly

24538909
bash	zsh	awk	ksh
so i have at my disposal tools like bash perl awk and python but not necessarily tools like csh ksh zsh bc et cetera

24538924
superclass	subclassing
the version of the hidden static method that gets invoked depends on whether it is invoked from the superclass or the subclassing

24538929
build.gradle	gradlew
when intellij opens a build.gradle file it will generate an intellij project with the gradlew dependencies resolved and added to the project scope

24538956
bower	npm
you need bower and you already have npm

24538956
bower	npm
basically you will have to create a package.json in the root to install bower using npm

24538960
hide	fadeout
i think fadeout hide on completion but you could also use a callback

24538964
mouseover	mousehover
to gain click mouseover feedback i started doing this coloring the button on mousehover to grey and change the color onclick and onmove to green my.settings.colordark

24538994
hide	fadeout
fadeout hide on completion

24539036
ubuntu	linux
for example i use emacs across different platforms like ubuntu linux and windows 7 and i would like to keep my emacs environment consistent

24539037
rss	feed
i only want to grab a small snippet but i am not sure what to use to display this rss feed

24539062
mouse	keyboard
2 i could use mouse position which of course won t work if the input is via keyboard

24539120
client-side	server-side
the tool is node-based so a project relies on a lot of npm modules that operate server-side to build your assets but out-of-the-box it expects to find your client-side dependencies in copied and committed to vendor js

24539120
bower	npm
however a bunch of folks myself included have tried integrating with bower and we ve run into a lot of complexity and problems ranging from a npm modules being maintained by a third party which are either out of date or add unwanted changes to b actual libraries that start failing when loaded traditionally whenever a top-level function named require is even defined due to amd require.js baggage

24539146
google-chrome	firefox
so understanding this i have found the above solution and it works tested on firefox google-chrome ie8

24539166
put	get
instead i had to put date1 to get it to work

24539172
hide	show
when you show your first form you instance the first form then you show the second creating it instance and hiding the first one use hide not close then your instance will still on memory

24539172
hide	show
on back button click you only have to hide the second and show the first

24539314
hide	show
that seems to entirely conflict with the requirement that pages should be able to work even if user has javascript disabled. you could use noscript tags i suppose i haven t seen those in years not sure if they were ever technically standard or even just show the message by default and hide it with javascript as the page renders thus those with javascript wouldn t see it

24539395
hide	show
i m working on a personal website and i m trying to have a show hide on click of an image but i m not really sure where the problem is

24539403
for-loop	arrays
i don t often find myself needing to know the length of the list it s not like you need it to exit a for-loop like you would with arrays in imperative languages

24539410
google-chrome	firefox
works well in google-chrome and firefox

24539411
onfocus	onblur

so far i am able to get the pieces working together but when i put them all into a jframe they are not coming out as expected

24539497
put	get
i m trying to just get those values that are in the array after onepagecheckoutform and put them into an array i can access with other code

24539533
getter	setter
if so i believe the id property needs to have both a public getter and a public setter

24539545
children	parent
many to one relations must be by the code of both tables otherwise hibernate will not recognize the children of the parent table

24539573
put	get
i got a previously saved file and put it in the quarto savefiles map because i wanted to see if it did load correctly this also uses the user.home to get to the right folder

24539575
min	max
however setting the min max dates like i ve done below merely grays out the dates that are out of bounds but you can still scroll to them

24539578
portrait	landscape
there are option to use orientationchangelistener but i need only listen to switching between portrait and landscape modes not heading of device

24539583
put	get	post	get	post	put
btw i want a user.is_staff to be able to do anything and a user that is not staff to only be able to get put patch post on their own record

24539617
int	chars
i wrote a method that should convert a chars with the value 3 to 9 into an int value

24539662
listview	gridview
but the main problem is the amount of data you are trying to show at once but it is easily solved with an adapter you probably can use some default component for solve this like listview or gridview you can make your custom rows to work around the columns maybe

24539736
post	get
excuse me for the long post but i can t get this program to work unless i specify -fpermissive to gcc and not at all under clang

24539793
translation	localization
the translation tool is in the back-office localization translation

24539899
versioning	upgrade
all i changed in the codebase is that i updated gradle wrapper from versioning 1.6 to versioning 2.0 because using 1.6 was giving me some warning but i was getting the same casting error before the upgrade

24539909
width	height
i suspect you want .7 as the width height

24539925
for-loop	arrays
first of all your arrays size is 0 at first so that for-loop never runs

24539927
folder	directory
you re entirely correct you can just cp or mv the .git folder into the root of the new directory

24539931
post	get
i ll post some code and see if anyone else can get a grasp on this

24539934
int	boolean
the the datarow which is essentially a int and boolean type

24539946
goto	break
if you really don t want to use break you can use goto to get out of the loop or use return to bail out of the function if this loop is part of a larger function you d have to refactor

24539996
shiny	slidify
i m creating a slidify presentation that has shiny apps inside

24540014
fasta	biopython
biopython doesn t make any transformation from seqrecords or anything to plain fasta

24540091
width	height
i ve tried setting x y and width height but they seem to be ignored once fullscreen is enabled

24540098
width	height
your actual design will give you as many li you can have in your browser width due to you are using float and you have not provide a height so you have multiple height what will affect the design

24540126
udp	tcp
port 1433 is added to the firewall is inbound for udp and tcp and the sql server express instance service has been restarted

24540133
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
so far what i ve tried is in the super view i can get the touch events from touchesbegan withevent and touchesmoved withevent these two combined give me all the touches i need

24540133
uiview	subviews
the problem i am encountering with this is that i haven t found a way to get the subviews themselves to detect that they are touched when they are just dragged over and the touch actually originated on a different uiview

24540146
mktime	strftime
you can use date_default_timezone_set along with strftime or mktime to convert this to the servers local time

24540164
equals	tostring
marker.getid equals m1 is what you want since getid is already a string you dont need to do tostring

24540201
onresume	onpause	oncreate	ondestroy
make sure the fragment lifecycle code for oncreate oncreateview or even ondestroy onpause onresume does not have any heavy work being done on it

24540202
post	get
data are not creating pages an if you want to refer to data file from a page post you have to loop over to get a match between site.data.client and page.client or post.client

24540202
post	get
creating a page post with front-matter custom vars ensure that you get all datas in same place

24540202
post	get
and you can easily loop over page post variables to get things done

24540209
button	checkbox
secondly from any results page for example just clicking the browse button you can select a few records by checkbox and at the end of the results find the with selected text then click the export button there

24540255
hash	md5
i am calling an api that requires an md5 hash of the body of the request in the request s header

24540364
express	node.js
i am using node.js with express server and passport package for authentication

24540372
for-loop	loops
the for-loop will loops over each line of the file that has not already been read

24540373
children	parent
this means i want that all it s child entities are clipped so that only the parts of the children that overlap the clip-entity parent are visible

24540458
children	parent
when coming up with a name for the variable i realized i don t know what you call a parent with no children

24540497
setcontentview	recreate
for an activity once the view hierarchy is set through setcontentview view the view hierarchy cannot be changed unless the activity is recreate

24540514

24558615
inline	inlining
pretty much any function whose definition is available to the compiler can be a candidate for function inlining which is not the same thing as inline definition

24558615
inline	inlining
the only times that function inlining is mentioned in the c++ standard is to make it clear that if the compiler chooses to inline a function it should not have any visible effect on the behavior of the code they are all remarks like this should be true even if the function is inline

24558615
inline	inlining
the only relation between the inline keyword and function inlining is a suggestion in the standard that the keyword could also be considered as a hint that function inlining is desirable for that function because it often is but this is not a requirement and i believe many compilers ignore it completely when it comes to deciding whether to inline a function or not mostly because compilers don t need that hint they perfectly capable of making that choice on their own

so if you want to display the content of the folder corresponding to your subdomain you have to scan your directory then check if the folder called by subdomain exists and then include script from this folder

24558823
superclass	subclassing
if the tiles that you are trying to put into a single arraylist is subclassing of a superclass then you can set your arraylist to take in type superclass while disguising your subclassing into your superclass

and if that does not solve your problem consider zipping all or at least the largest of your images into a zip file to be stored in assets directory and at first run open it to an sdcard folder

24559771
selecteditem	selectedindex
one common one i see is that wpf can get confused when you bind more than one of the selected properties selecteditem selectedvalue and selectedindex

free	malloc
call free on memory that your program allocates using malloc etc

24560101
free	calloc	free	malloc	free	realloc	realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
no you should only call free for an object that you have allocated through malloc calloc or realloc

24560104
free	calloc	free	malloc	free	realloc	realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
argument to free must be a pointer previously returned by either malloc calloc or realloc functions

24560114
post	get
also i don t think link is a valid form method you have to use either get or post

24560117

24560200
width	margin
root cause your main container div with class nav does not have a size due to it is a div it is taking 100 of width perhaps you used margin auto it is not working because there is not margin to apply

24560221
children	parent
i want to increase the size of the container when trying to drag children out of it keeping the size of parent fixed hence a scroll should appear within parent with overflow scroll for complete scrolling of container

24560232
getter	setter
in this way you don t need to guess what getter setter names should be

24560244
google-chrome	firefox
however for the purposes of answering the question and anybody making google-chrome or firefox extensions where this is a common use case mutation summary and mutation observer will allow dom changes to trigger events

24560266
put	get
i can get it to work if i put the same code within my campaignsnew route and modify the template to each through controller.content

24560314
restrict	shared
also using a service account with a shared upload folder allowed me to restrict the access of the service account to only the upload folder

24560327
post	get
i have a model that has a list of objects as one of its properties and i m trying to figure out how to get them to post correctly

24560337
post	get
obviously i could script each input into a get request address and replace the img src with that but post is more desirable and it seems there should be a more elegant way to make use of the form s submit mechanism

24560372
ubuntu	linux
unfortunately on linux ubuntu 12.04 x64 with gcc the program is giving segmentation fault after some part of computations i am getting part of results

24560427
google-chrome	firefox
if you check your console hit f12 then select console in firefox and google-chrome you should see this causes a syntax error

24560468
children	parent
you can do something very similar to gitflow in tfs you just need to stick to the limitation of only merging a branch with direct parent or children

24560513
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
but the problem is on google-chrome and safari only not firefox if user select a textbox as in would like to delete the text highlight the text but release the button outside the div it will hide the login-box but on firefox it s not

24560525
opera	google-chrome
here is the function i use to prevent google-chrome and opera from showing the invalid input dialog even when using novalidate

24560598
outputstream	inputstream
how is the outputstream connected to inputstream

24560620
children	parent
the elements created using before after and content are children of the .rack and z-index applied to them is not global but operates within their relatively positioned parent

24560777
min	max
adjust your min and max to reflect the actual values needed

24560822
setinterval	settimeout
other ways you can do this are with setinterval settimeout a tweening library and an enter_frame event handler

24560843
post	get
for setting up a server on it your best bet will be to use the webduino library that implements get and post methods

24560862
google-chrome	safari
i know i can use conditional css to differentiate webkit browsers from others but it is my understanding that both google-chrome and safari are webkit browsers

24560862
google-chrome	safari
there is a safari specific fix that makes google-chrome pixelate the nivo slider when it gets small and i need to get this working for both browsers

24560866
versioning	upgrade
i would recommend you upgrade to that versioning

24560878
post	get
but when i try to make a post request to api users with the right information to create a new user i get back the following

24560951
putty	winscp
since you re using windows i m on linux it s a bit trickier you ll need to download an application such as winscp or putty

24560957
content-length	content-type
using the head agent.head method i can get the content-type last-modified date and content-length

24560957
content-length	content-type
now using the method is i think re-downloading the information so for the content-type last-modified and content-length calls - it is downloading the head 3 times

24561032
udp	tcp
tcp and udp uses port numbers to communicate with the upper layers this is what keeps track of the conversations crossing the network

24561032
ftp	telnet
ex telnet - 23 ssh - 22 smtp - 25 http - 80 https - 443 ftp - 20 21 pop3 - 110

filtering	grouping	children	parent
i have 3 tables one parent and two children and i m trying to construct a query that aggregates fields from all 3 grouping by and filtering by expressions entirely dependent on the parent table

24561150
width	border-box
the border-box value as opposed to the content-box default makes the final rendered box the declared width and any border and padding cut inside the box

24561159
integer	unsigned
so the microsoft website says it treats it as integer but even though the size and integer and unsigned long is the same for microsoft compiler i am not able to break it

24561213
keyup	mouseup	keydown	mouseup	keydown	keyup
we want to know when the control is focused mouseup keyup when typing has started keydown and when typing has finished keyup

24561213
keyup	mouseup
because of complications with the way chrome sets the cursor during the focus event we have to listen to mouseup and keyup instead

24561213
keydown	keyup
since tabbing through the fields will fire a keyup on the next field not the current one if the keydown that was pressed was the tab key we ll also trigger the keyup event manually

24561220
google-chrome	safari
if you are using javascript this code fragment will distinguish safari from google-chrome

24561237
ws-trust	ws-federation
it is open source supports many protocols such as oauth2 ws-federation ws-trust and it is easy to configure

inside the c++ header file winnt.h which i believe is the file that decides what constitutes as a short int double etc i noticed microsoft typedefs a few variables twice within the same preprocessor conditional scope

24561295
chunked	transfer-encoding
i see transfer-encoding chunked in the headers so the 191 and 0 are chunk lengths

24561347
cvs	svn
think of temporal database as the dbms equivalent of cvs svn git

24561409
bluestacks	android-emulator
you can use bluestacks which is an android-emulator put on steroids

it occurred to me that i could maybe use double ptrs int or vector but i m stuck on that

24561464
postgresql	mysql
it currently supports schema browsing sql editing and debugging for pl sql postgresql and mysql

24561494
for-loop	loops
this is because the while loops in sleep blocks...it iterates until the time milliseconds have passed before returning control back to the for-loop

24561500
put	get
note that i put long lists of use up there because use keyword does not get inherited

24561519

after the timer is up hide the first and show the second

24561566
hide	show
i want that items hide after the time expired only today and future items would be show

24561581
spring-data-jpa	spring-data-rest
alternatively if you are trying to implement a rest controller to pipe straight into a database with spring-data-jpa you should take a look at spring-data-rest

24561616
inherited	properties	children	parent
basically since the headerctrl nested into some maincontroller his scope protptypically inherited scope of the maincontroller and you can access properties of parent from any children controllers

24561640
cvs	svn
you will be able to setup git svn cvs on this server as well

min	max
i also have checked the site and it states that the input type number and the min and max attribute are supported

stdout	stderr
note the redirection will redirect all stdout and stderr output to a file

24561847
int	chars
int printf const chars f ...

24561865
folder	directory
you could also put the normal assets in a layout-normal folder put the small assets in the layout folder and nix the layout-small directory entirely

the grid has width and height n+2 +2 for a little border that should not be updated

24561939
apache	nginx
unless you re doing unusual things there s no reason to run both apache and nginx

24561939
apache	nginx
nginx + gunicorn is likely to work better than apache + modwsgi at this point in time

24561949
folder	directory
android-support-v13.jar from the sdk directory into the libs folder in your project

24561950
google-chrome	firefox
these issues do not affect all users of windows google-chrome ie firefox

google-chrome	firefox
this goes contrary to the azure docs but initial testing of the https url in firefox ie and google-chrome doesn t show any problems

24562111
cos	sin
i just guessed it has to do something with sin x or cos x

24562160
cos	sin
given an angle your ratio of len x to len y is cos angle sin angle

24562160
cos	sin
so in this intance you need to increment x by cos angle and y by sin angle

24562160
cos	sin
make sure they are both of type double since cos and sin will can be less than one

24562237
google-chrome	firefox
it opens the download dialog without a problem in firefox and downloads well in google-chrome

affinity	processors
you could try to set your process affinity in such a way that it includes only 1 processors at a time and see if it worked

24562519
children	parent
now to control your resize based on multiple elements all i can think of is adding a js threatment on the resize event telling to keep the size when the sum of the children s width reach the parent s width like this

24562527
swift	objective-c
i am trying to translate an old code of mine from objective-c to swift

i have downloaded an image on both ios and andriod device and created md5 hash as follows

24562660
children	parent
the itself should be defined in the children scope regardless of the parent scope being the one declaring it on the first place

24562690
for-loop	arrays
you can make a list arrays with the exceptions and check in the for-loop if the index is contained in the arrays and then skip the operation for that index

24562716
retrofit	okhttp
i am using retrofit okhttp 1.6 in my android project

24562920
crossfilter	rickshaw
i m experimenting with using crossfilter with rickshaw but i m running into this problem

24562920
crossfilter	rickshaw
rickshaw expects its series data array to be composed of objects with x and y properties where crossfilter outputs using the key and value properties

24562920
crossfilter	rickshaw
the only way i can think of getting it to work is on any change to the underlying crossfilter copy the crossfilter results to a new array and reset rickshaw with the new data which seems really ugly and an unnecessary copy

24562922
stdout	stderr
each external command stage had three pthreads -- for stdin stdout and stderr

24562952
for-loop	loops
once is in the for-loop and once is in the while loops

24562952
for-loop	loops
i would change this to use either a while loops or a for-loop and have only one place that checks for null and moves on to the next node

24562969

google-chrome	firefox
i m working on a project utilizing server-sent-events and have just run into something interesting connection loss is handled differently between google-chrome and firefox

24564030
opera	google-chrome
on google-chrome 35 or opera 22 if you lose your connection to the server it will try to reconnect indefinitely every few seconds until it succeeds

24564030
opera	google-chrome
i much prefer the way google-chrome or opera does it but reading it seems as though once the eventsource tries to reconnect and fails due to a network error or other it shouldn t retry the connection

24564030
google-chrome	firefox
i was set on requiring firefox to users mostly based on the fact that you can t have multiple tabs with an event stream from the same url open on google-chrome but this new finding would probably be more of an issue

24564100
int	chars
0 as a chars is represented by the number 48 and hence 0 really equals 48 since 0 is a chars and 48 is an int and they are different ways of representing the same basic data

24564100
int	chars
luckily for you there s a fairly easy way to solve your problem just convert each chars to its equivalent int

24564106
width	height
in the above example i know the width i want to constrain the label to but since i m not sure of the height i just max the height param out using cgfloat_max

24564166
int	chars
each element in a string is castable to an int implicitly a basic_string contains chars type items which are mapped to ascii chars in standard in out methods. since each chars is a number from 0 to 255 mapping to this table you can see how this plays out

the solution is to make sure the frame of your item is divisible by two for the height and for the width before anchoring it

24564565
docx	.doc
for html to docx as opposed to legacy binary .doc you can try

24564586
fixed-point	fractions
the method now multiples a b which are fixed-point numbers with 8 fractions bits rounding to the nearest result

24564586
fixed-point	fractions	integer	fractions
specifically the is the multiple the + 128 rounds to the nearest remember that this gets shifted out so it only has an effect if it causes a carry to the next most significant bit position after bit 7 and the corrects the position of the point because multiplying two fixed-point values with 8 fractions bits using integer arithmetic yields a fixed-point value with 16 fractions bits

24564590
folder	directory
i seemed to have gotten around it but the only way i could fix this error was by removing gdata from requirements.txt and including the build and atom folder from in my root directory

24564634
qfile	qtextstream	qstring	qfile	qstring	qtextstream
but really the whole exercise is not necessary since to access the files you should be using qfile which takes a qstring directly and console output can be done using qtextstream

24564642
operands	decrement
the increment decrement operators can be applied before prefix or after postfix the operands

24564672

there are no tags on this page yet i have set a breakpoint on both the get and post usersetaccess actions in the controller and the only one that gets hit is the post which messes up the dialog

24565084
pop-up	dialog	post	get
the dialog should initially pop-up and contain the view from a get and then allow changes so i can submit them and do a post

24565087

24565337
ubuntu	debian
actually in the default ubuntu configuration possibly the same for debian it is just a matter of enabling loading the ssl module and not providing a site configuration that uses ssl

24565364

if the document you are about to update is not already in ram but it is in the disk mongo will have to first fetch it from the disk and then update it

24565397
ubuntu	linux
because it does not occur on android nor on an ubuntu linux box

24565436
comparator	comparable
the simplest way to think about it is this you are trying to use type t with the comparator interface which imposes certain requirements on it in particular it has that fancy recursive requirement that t must implement comparable interface

24565436
comparator	comparable
it just takes a class which implements comparable and creates the default comparator for it

24565436
comparator	comparable
no way around it -- you can t create a comparator for something that is not comparable

24565436
comparator	comparable
you want treemap to require comparable but you can t because it is a valid case to use something that is not comparable as long as you have provided a comparator

24565437
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the effect works perfectly in mac google-chrome and safari but it stutters in firefox

24565443
versioning	upgrade
but of course it fails because you just upgrade androidstudio versioning and not introduce the newest sdk

24565447
comparator	comparable
i think you can use comparator in a class that doesn t implements the comparable interface at least in java 8 so they don t implements comparator object o but you have to implement this

24565447
getter	setter
then you can have getter and setter for this variable so you can change the way of ordering

24565485
for-loop	loops
the for-loop in cycle function executes 4 loops

24565499
width	height

width	height
the reason why this happens is you set fixed width and height for the div and when you increase the font size it could no longer fit inside the div

24570339
getter	setter
your code kind of relies on the order in which getter and setter methods will execute if you ll enable debug logging or fire up developer console you ll see that the order of get set statements kind of matches the order in which expressions appear on the page.

realloc	malloc
if _getline reads 10 or more characters it will call realloc on memory that was not allocated with malloc

24579755
realloc	malloc
you are trying to realloc memory that was not allocated dynamically with malloc

24579755
free	realloc
also if realloc fails the original memory is still allocated and thus still needs to be free with free

24579761
int	chars
it means _getline is a function returning int getting a pointer to chars by value

24579761
free	realloc
only use free realloc on null resp

24579873
swift	objective-c
what matt says is true there is nothing wrong with using nsset from objective-c as apple has made it pretty nice to be able to integrate swift and objective-c in the same app

24579873
swift	objective-c
this should not deter you from learning swift as well as objective-c so don t give up

24579873
swift	objective-c
as i can see a definite need for an nsset-like architecture in swift and if some day objective-c goes by the wayside swift would need a standalone api for it rather than relying on objective-c s nsset

24580323
memcpy	memcmp
there is also the memcmp structure comparison anti-pattern that is sometimes cited by some programmers for using memcpy instead of structure assignment

24580323
memcpy	memset
in the next step - to avoid differences in the padding bits of compared structures - memset ... 0 ... is used to initialize all structures instead of using the c99 initializer syntax or initializing all fields separately and memcpy is used to copy the structures

24580323
memset	memcmp	memcpy	memset	memcpy	memcmp
the use of memcpy memcmp memset introduce new error possibilities - supplying a wrong size

24580323
memset	memcmp	memcpy	memset	memcpy	memcmp
as a general rule to increase code correctness and portability use direct struct assignment instead of memcpy c99 struct initialization syntax instead of memset and a custom comparison function instead of memcmp

i ll post a trivial example which actually works just to get an approximate picture of what i m trying to achieve

24586763
networkstream	binaryreader
same thing on the client side using a networkstream and a binaryreader

24586764

this is more or less based on c# s conventions and the standard .net library ms has very precise guidelines about it except standard .net uses uppercase for public protected methods and properties and lower-case for private again usually

24586840
for-loop	loops
i don t want to overload the method for every single datatype there are plenty neither create separate classes that just change a single method nor have that switch loops inside for-loop nor have multible instances of nodelist according to datatype

24586842
subtraction	addition
i believe i ve figured out how i could detect overflow in addition and subtraction but i d like assurance anyway

24586842
subtraction	addition
any better ways to detect overflow in addition and subtraction are also welcome

24586884
integer	unsigned
the code for string to signed unsigned int conversion is written poorly in source code of cmd.exe and therefore not working right for minimum signed 32-bit integer number

24586929
ant	maven
there are other tools too some other well-known build tools that come from the java world are ant and maven

addition	multiplication
alas dekker splitting only works with a strict interpretation of ieee 754 multiplication and addition

24587229
backtracking	greedy
but this doesn t work too for two reasons this doesn t check if characters are digits and since the quantifier is greedy will match the all the characters until the end of the line and will backtracking until the last parenthesis

24587242
client-side	server-side
keep in mind that javascript happens in the browser client-side while jinja2 is python-based templating which will occur server-side

24587305
folder	directory
so my problem is while is using the directory views layout and the utilities only search through the webroot - folder they will never reach each other

24587308
int	double
this works up to a point--a typical implementation of double has a 53-bit significand so it can be used as essentially a 53-bit int type

24587308
16-bit	64bit
that s obviously quite a bit more than the 16-bit that s mandated for an int but equally obviously less than the 64bit mandated for a long long

24587333
onresume	onpause
i have a static boolean value that is set true inside onresume of mainactivity and false inside it s onpause

24587428
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
the arrays doesn t exist outside of the for-loop so sticking it into and even worse printing the arrays outside loops are both undefined behavior

24587695
urwid	ncurses
check out ncurses module or urwid library very good begning to start with console applications

24587695
urwid	ncurses
ncurses and urwid allows you to draw frame in buffer and then update screen only in places where it s needed

24587713
width	margin
since you are giving a specific width to your buttons - by setting a width to your container and using margin width set to auto i believe you get what you are looking for

24587740
children	parent
for the module system runtime is additional code emitted to track module parent and children

24587740
ready	each
for each new chunk request in the ready state the update chunk is also downloaded

24587820
swift	objective-c
i m new to swift and i would like to know why this piece of code i translated from objective-c doesn t work here

24587822
peer	p2p
the array contains peer information from a p2p app i m working on so it will be subject to change frequently as devices drop in and out of connection range

24587824
minimum	max
when performing the bit reduction you would need to check that the value is under the max and above the minimum negative number that you can support with the reduced width

24587824
min	max
i think that keeping a 32 bit output and comparing it to the max min of a signed 16 bit number will synthesise smaller than only using 16 bit multiplier and extra logic to detect the overflow condition

24587831
cos	sin
those two values are results of a calculation itself cos respektivly sin of the values e or l

24587831
cos	sin
because sin and cos only take 1 parameter there is no comma because no values have to be seperated

24587833
range	minimum
to the minimum token then the range from keyx to keyx is the full

24587866

same goes for google-chrome but safari on mac works

24587893
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
however though this works fine for me with google-chrome firefox safari i should point out that it doesn t really address your key questions

24587894
width	height
scroll view width height full screen

24587930
versioning	upgrade
your indexes may have been corrupted somehow for whatever reason crash improper shutdown or are simply out of date in case of upgrade from previous versioning

24587958
min	max
set the min and max of your x-axis to specific values as shown in the jfiddle example with the code

24587973
width	height
the variable size is a tuple made of two values width and height and their values are 512 and 512 resp

24587982
margin	text-align
also use margin auto instead of text-align center to align your elements in the middle

24588036
rank	max
if no rank is lower than its number there are no gaps in the table the query returns the max number + 1

24588092
vb.net	vb6
having noted the above the following advice applies equally well to vb.net or vb6

24588092
vb.net	vb6
you can certainly use the access database system with vb6 or vb.net

24588137
versioning	upgrade
you can either upgrade you framework versioning to 4.5 or you can get the microsoft.bcl.async package from nuget which adds those abilities to .net 4.0

24588158
min	max
to not use library min max and had it as much fast if possible

24588162
rar	zip
using switch -afzip informs winrar explicitly to use zip instead of rar compression

24588162
stdout	stderr
this switch is mainly for the console version rar.exe not supporting zip copmression for output to stdout and stderr but may work also for winrar

24588173
google-chrome	firefox
when i resize it 605 it should look like in the first image and it actually works on and firefox but on google-chrome it appears like this

24588205
typedef	struct
17 typedef struct mcs_lock_t mcs_lock

24588328
width	height
when drawing the edges i need to consider the bounds of the label however the width and the height of the labels seem to be initialized only after drawing it

24588328
width	height
e.g. when starting the application the label bounds have a width height of 0 but if a label is repositioned by the user the width height is correct

24588328
width	height
i also tried to wrap the text in a rectangle and then manually set the width height of the rectangle

24588341
std	ostream
i have a custom stream cfilemanagerostream that inherits from std ostream it takes unicode utf16 or utf32 strings from a network stream class ctcpstream and stores them on disk as utf8 strings

24588403
put	get
i have put commas in the html to get a comma separated set

24588426
int	chars
so if you ask for two int in your program instead of an int and a chars it works without the need to manually skip the newline

24588513
interpolation	splines
you could use a splines interpolation for the difference function

24588534
uiviewcontroller	uiwindow
but uiwindow s rootviewcontroller expects a uiviewcontroller

submit	submission
there is my code which i am using as you can see at the end of jquery there code for submission form #range_form submit

24588581
range	infinity
in contrast fixed-point numbers have quite limited range are only precise over a limited range and lack special values for infinity and not a number

24588603
hash	md5
for example md5 hash will change a lot if only one of the bits in the original data is changed

24588605
swift	objective-c
however tragically in the current version of objective-c aside - i don t know about swift sorry there is a risible feature where it checks if the enclosing block is a loop

24588612
cos	sin	pow	sin
i would like to do this for a whole lot of other operations like log10f cos acos sin asin pow

24588642
google-chrome	firefox
i checked my request using firebug network panel both firefox and google-chrome and the request had the file

24588736
x86	64bit
note that you are using 32-bit version of php so you need 32-bit redistributable x86 even your version of windows is 64bit

24588744
pull	push
it ll either tell you that your local version is ahead and you need to push it first or that your online-repository is ahead and you need to pull the latest changes first

24588785
post	get
and i am not using the post method but the get method which is being used in a request

24588821
google-chrome	firefox
were is the problema how can i make it compatible with google-chrome firefox etc

24588829
hide	show
it sounds like what you really want to do is show the #overlay_form on pop and hide it on close

24588829
hide	show
that way you can simply show hide when you click pop or close

24588849
min	max
can i prevent the conversion from a max problem into a min one

24588866
hash	salt
it does a few check salt and hash the password and then inserts the values

24588866

24588880
equals	tostring
any interface method plus object hashcode object equals and object tostring is then forwarded to an invocationhandler

24588932
jtextfield	jtextpane
this is easily done with jtextfield and jtextpane as they share the common parent class jtextcomponent which hold the get set methods

24588932
jtextfield	jtextpane	jtextfield	jlabel	jlabel	jtextpane
create a common interface editabletext then have my own alias versions of jtextfield jtextpane and jlabel that implement the interface

24588949
dumpsys	adb
i have played a bit with adb shell dumpsys activity p and found that the activity manager flags the process as cch-started-ui-services when there is a started service

width	height
what i want to do is make a voilet bar of width 800px height 50px

24589053
put	get
and nothing happens so i guess my problem is that i don t even get my code to start working i always thought that if i put it in between script tags it ll always run at least once as web loads so how do i actually run it on windows load i ve already tried this

24589101

celery 3.1.12 kombu 3.0.20

24589298
subclass	abstract-class
this problem wouldn t occur in c# because the property is stored in the abstract-class and it would just do the comparison without needing to know the type of subclass that was stored

24589336
for-loop	loops
i think for-loop or while loops should work berrter

24589349
versioning	upgrade
recently upgrade to lts versioning and for some reason slaves connects to master only when anonymous is given admin privileges

24589383
subtract	add
if you tried to implement it with looping you d have to revise your program to add subtract nested loops every time you were dealing with a different number of sub-designs to be crossed so you can t write an immutable loop-based version

build.gradle	gradlew
i tried to add the compile com.astuetz pagerslidingtabstrip 1.0.1 to build.gradle file but gradlew sync returned the above stated error

24589806
keyup	mouseup
instead as soon as either mouseup or keyup is pressed we ll call our function

24589806
keyup	mouseup
note most browsers naturally select all text during a tab event but as animatedgif pointed out we still want to handle the keyup event otherwise the mouseup event will still be lingering around anytime we ve tabbed in

24589806
keyup	mouseup
finally for extra protection we can add event namespaces to the mouseup and keyup functions so the .off method doesn t remove any other listeners that might be in play

24589806
google-chrome	firefox
tested in ie 10+ firefox 28+ google-chrome 35+

24589834
google-chrome	safari
but webkit browsers such as google-chrome and safari wait

that been said you can just use divs for that purpose and play with the background-size background-position properties to get the desired effect make the background fit the div size

24589982
inherited	properties
what you cannot do is to make the div inherited the size from its background properties

24590015
picasso	universal-image-loader
the problem has to lie somwhere with universal-image-loader picasso thinking the gridview in the separate fragments are the same object they do have the same images but in different orders

in j2se 5.0 from september 30 2004 also known as jdk 1.5 both stringbuilder non-thread safe but faster - + started using it instead of stringbuffer now autoboxing and generics with erasure were added - the whole paradigm shifted from metaprogramming using reflection to template programming with not-so-obvious casting solutions

24591375
multiplying	add
unlike what the instructions said you would have to add all the values together before multiplying them and adding them to total

24591412

i also added this type post in my jquery ajax call because i reminded that get method has some limitations when it comes to the size of data sent

24592029
swift	objective-c
the difference is that unlike objective-c swift can t see your names for those views

however when i copy the same url from the component directly to the clipboard into a web browser such as google-chrome or firefox it works perfectly fine

24592066
centos	linux	filesystems	hfs+	debian	linux	debian	centos

google-chrome	safari
for some reason both safari and google-chrome insert a random after the first one

24592193

it doesn t the apache web folder var www directory appears instead

24592230
google-chrome	firefox
i dont see any issue on your example with firefox or google-chrome and not with ie11

24592230

the solution was to change the onchange to onclick and set a timeout with 0ms

24592230
google-chrome	firefox
note this must be done by browser-detection since it won t work on firefox or google-chrome

24592255
unsigned	short
specifically the sh part is a short hand for this number of unsigned shorts which you then format to say the exact number of unsigned short you want

24592255
unsigned	short
because an unsigned short is normally 2 bytes wide

24592301
multiplying	division
another possibility is to combine this trick with the idea mentioned by dongilmore and supercat that instead of having a division by two specified or implied you can multiplying both the numerator and denominator by two

24592321
for-loop	arrays
do a for-loop on your current arrays and explode the content

24592328

24592370
switching	screens
you may combine them into one container and then switching visibility between different screens sizes

24592384
getter	setter
when the compiler sees a read write property with a hand-written getter or a hand-written setter it synthesizes a backing instance variable for you

24592384
getter	setter
however when it detects both a hand-written getter and a hand-written setter it decides that since you have implemented both methods it does not need to synthesize anything

24592384
getter	setter
this means that if you wish to write both a getter and a setter manually you need to add your own instance variable to the class

24592470
post	get
i get a list of the followers so i d assume this will have something to do with retrieval of the post

24593031
swift	objective-c
all objective-c frameworks are automatically bridged to swift and those include both spritekit and avfoundation

i post it here so that any one find this question can get benefit out of it

24593368
post	get
i can not post the full code so get only the concept from above

24593376
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
unlike the while option this will reduce the operations for each loops of the for-loop by reducing the ticket arrays by the uid

24593382
unsigned	short
char is unsigned while short is signed.

24593394
for-loop	loops
5 the logic in the first for-loop minus the incorrect break statement especially since there is interest in the number of occurrences and not just the first one and follows the while loops can be used and combined once the break statement is removed to count the number of occurrences as well as reporting which locations the number to search for has been found

24593398
hide	show
user roles can be used to show hide section on view based on roles

24593404
int	chars	unsigned	short
and it s expected since chars is an unsigned 2-bytes int whereas short is a signed 2-bytes int

24593427
folder	directory
i would like to have a folder red from the directory c users kyle desktop red and then copy it to d backups

24593427

24593470
setinterval	settimeout
maybe the api includes something similar to settimeout or setinterval in javascript

24593471
foldable	traversable
and you can have similar instances for foldable traversable applicative etc

24593490
disk	ram
in skype you send a file the other person accepts and select somewhere to save the file begins to be transferred and the data that have been received will now be saved to disk so the file is not in ram

when i set it to imageview with full_parent for the width and height

24593572
mp3	ogg
missing in your question worklight version device models used android version whether these are local or remote video files the video files format mp3 ogg mp4 m4v ... any errors found in logcat and even better - implementation snippets

24593585
fadein	fadeout
theres a callback for the fadein and fadeout functions in jquery you just need to add the code inside that callback

24593602
hide	fadeout	hide	show	fadein	fadeout	fadein	hide
if i understood correctly you can use the visible selector to check the visibility of an element to hide it using fadeout and show the other element using fadein in the callback of fadeout function

24593623
free	realloc
you should not free the original memory area after a successful call to realloc

24593623
free	realloc
if realloc moves your data it will also free the old area

24593639
free	realloc
when you call realloc and it is successful the old memory location has already been free and the new location is returned

24593643
realloc	malloc
of course the real realloc is a lot more complex because it checks the current block to see if it can be expanded before it allocates new data and probably doesn t call regular malloc but the functionality is roughly this

24593647
post	get
rfc3161 section 3.4 defines for http a particular mime-type application timestamp-query that is transmitted as either get or post to a timestamp server uri

24593652

free	realloc
in case realloc succeeded you free s after realloc already free it

24593764
put	get
this works fine when the blocks are on the same layer with others however if i put the blocks on a different tile layer i can t get the right tileproperty anymore

24593873
post	get
program is working fine with get and delete request but while trying post and other remaining method it throws not authorized response

i want to do some implementation handling in this propertyâ s getter setter

24593962
expander	grid
i ve come across a problem related to grouping in the wpf data grid where the right hand side margin does not match the left hand side when using an expander control

24593962
expander	grid
my intention is to have each group as an expander but with a margin either side so as more groups are added the grid columns become squeezed more into the centre

24594008
width	height
this can be done by dividing e.location.x by 220 the cell width and using that as the index to the inner list and dividing e.location.y by 220 the cell height and using that to index the outer list

24594057
post	get
every time i run the test plan i get an 500 error code internal server error response for the post request it looks like this

24594058
int	double	atoi	atof
i m using c_str atoi and atof functions for converting string variables to int or float double

24594068
notepad++	jedit
with a programmer s editor like jedit or notepad++ try a save as utf-8 without bom

24594093
multiplying	multiplication
some of your multiplication could be simplified to multiplying a register by 4 you can do shl reg 2 and to multiplying by 8 you can do shl reg 3

24594137
atoi	atof
the function c_str requires and including the c++ version of the header guarantees you have std atoi and std atof

24594140
maven	pom.xml
i am trying to create one project using the given pom.xml given in the maven repo

24594140
wildfly	jboss
as application server i used jboss wildfly

now when i create a variable to store that hashtable.get key i get error can t cast double to int

24594227
post	get
my helper methods to get data from server are perfectly fine so no need to post them here

24594267
google-chrome	firefox
it works in google-chrome firefox and even in ie.11 but works in ie8 if the variable is not used

24594297
google-chrome	firefox
although it was working with google-chrome and firefox there were issues to run it on ie9 that doesn t support websockets out of the box

24594335
post	get
this is the first time i will post data on server i have the request format and i try to send a request but i get error response

24594350
getter	setter
i wrote getter setter for the dbadapter

24594397
post	get
basically there is nothing further we can do unless you can post a better test case given that you cannot post the entire things and we don t want to go through hundreds of lines of somebody else s shonky code - i for one get enough of that debugging my own stuff

24594460
int	chars	int	double
if found it is double if the last chars is not f else int

24594490
getter	setter
do then you can use getter setter when the object is instantiated

24594652
int	chars
actually test the chars at that position not the int index

24594703
ssl	https
the whole system is running on apache with https ssl installed and configured properly

24594751

i ve searched through stack overflow w3schools and i m pretty certain i m using the correct syntax but it will still not show hide depending on the radio buttons

24594887
width	height
then when i stretch the screen the button s height increases but its width still remains the same

24594890
profiling	debugging
profiling as a guidence for implementation of such thing is a really sad and bad answer - to implement such god object optimally one would require tons of profiling debugging etc such god object is in a sence a micro gc becuse reduce vector size on each object addition or removal would be painfull... this is why i ve hoped existing vms already heve done that

24594912
imagej	gimp
however when i try to save it as a tiff file using the libtiff library the image looks perfectly fine when i open it in imagej however when i open it in photoshop or windows it looks strange look below and gimp shows a completely transparent image like there was no data in the image at all

24594924
int	double
double and int are different classes don t confuse them with primitives double and int no one of them inherits from the other they both extend number though so you are getting classcastexception

24594929
mouseover	mouseout
as the .active class is added between the mouseover and mouseout part of the hover function i added an if statement to the mouseout function to see if during the time in which the cursor has entered the element the class .active has been added

24594997
getter	setter
there is a java bean which has date setter getter

24595010
gridbaglayout	boxlayout
for instance borderlayout and gridlayout won t respect preferred sizes and will stretch the button the fit and flowlayout boxlayout and gridbaglayout will respect the preferred size

24595014
build.gradle	gradlew
i added the recommended code to build.gradle and waited after syncing gradlew

24595019
stdout	stderr
it s also helpful to read stderr â you can redirect it somewhere else a file or stdout or use a function that can read it directly

24595050
implements	extends
public class loginactivity extends activity implements

24595055
getter	setter
you are not actually overriding the getter setter at all

24595055
getter	setter
you could override the getter setter in a subclass which would be a very very strange thing to do

24595064
min	max
you will find here both for max and min

24595165
hash	md5
if you want to use a hash simply go for md5 as it s ultra-fast and you don t need anything that s cryptographically strong

24595225
udp	tcp
a potentially interesting alternative is to use udp instead of tcp

24595232
textview	imageview
i m using a viewpager with pageradapter to show a view that contains two imageview one with big image and on with a small icon and a textview

24595281
mp3	flv	mp3	ogg
i m trying to convert flv stream to another mp3 or ogg stream

24595281
mp3	flv	mp3	ogg
the point is i want to use mp3 ogg stream on html5 page because flv stream can t be played with html5

24595302
try-catch	exception-handling
as a general rule with async methods - avoid async void like the plague because an exception-handling thrown in a try catch inside such a method can not be caught by a regular try-catch

24595303
hide	show
basically it only adds classes to be able to show or hide a div

24595352

addeventlistener	onload
this means you should put the code at the end or add it to window.onload - using addeventlistener instead of onload

24595514
addslashes	multibyte
however addslashes does only work on bytes while mysql does also support a variety of character sets encodings of which some are multibyte

24595514
addslashes	multibyte
addslashes fails on multibyte character encodings while mysql_real_escape_string takes the current character encoding into account

24595514
addslashes	multibyte
and there are actual cases where addslashes does not sufficiently escapes data due to some multibyte character encoding

24595546
post	get
then in your android app you can use http request to get or post data

24595557

for-loop	loops
as your for-loop actually enters the if found block but return forces it to exist loops and the whole method

24595693
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
just store the data of third loops in an arrays and print directly after the second for-loop

24595763
hide	show
then you can use the hide show functions to show the right form and hide the other

24595785
put	get
if i just put all 3 files together i get error main redeclared in this block because i have 2 main functions in the same package

24595790
superclass	subclassing
it means that it will search for references to the field or method in the hierarchy of the class in all superclass and subclassing recursively

24595803
udp	tcp
tcp udp sockets can be used simultaneously in parallel threads for read and write operations

24595807
folder	dir

qplaintextedit	qtextedit
i know that qt tutorial recommends using qplaintextedit for text editor implementations and that the question except as mentioned in the title is more general than dealing absolutely with a qtextedit widget but i succeeded in implementing the behaviour line numbers + current line number highlight and i think this might be helpful for some people like me who really want to keep going with the rich text widget and want to share my implementation which is far from perfect - quite fast coded...

to actually upgrade to a newer versioning you have two options

24597047
onresume	onpause
in onresume you can call your asynctask and it should start download if the file exists paused download in onpause file exists

additionally casting the return value of calloc realloc is unnecessary and i m not sure why you allocate 2+length elements - 1+length seem to be enough.

24597214
mouse	keyboard
the trick is to move it over the container with the keyboard not the mouse

24597217
integer	unsigned
unsigned integer type - a type that can represent the size of the largest object in the allocation model

24597217
int	chars
and unsigned chars is definitely an unsigned int type as per s3.9.1

24597217
unsigned	short
or you could just use short unsigned int instead

24597305
for-loop	loops
i also put in an example of how you can iterate with an index over a for-loop instead of using a foreach loops since you don t use anywhere

24597321
addclass	removeclass
i then use accept checkreservation to insure that slots are empty before allowing the drop and if the drop is allowed swap the available reserved classes with removeclass and addclass of the two droppables so that the now-unreserved slot can be dropped into and reserved with a different item

24597321
addclass	removeclass
apparently addclass removeclass is not sufficient to tell jquery that the slot is now droppable

opera	google-chrome
i use jquery-ui for that managed to disable native datepicker in google-chrome but i can t find any way how to do it in opera

24597808

stdout	stderr
stdin is always 0 stdout is always 1 and stderr is always 2

24597897
subclass	abstract-class
you can t instantiate an abstract-class so to call an instance method of that class you need to subclass it

leftmost is sublimetext v3 middle is macvim and rightmost is textmate

24598390
textmate	sublimetext	macvim	sublimetext	macvim	textmate
macvim sublimetext is much thicker whereas textmate is slicker and sophisticated

for-loop	loops
i noticed some time ago that a for-loop typically generates several more machine instructions than a while loops

24598518
int	chars	int	boolean
variable alignment permitting it may also produce slightly smaller code too since the mov instruction and its operands take more room than for example an int boolean or chars value either ansi or unicode

24599589
int	double
when you get up into huge numbers the double are spaced more widely than int

24599589
int	double
between 2 52 and 2 53 the double are just the int

24599589
int	double
above 2 53 the double are spaced more widely than the int

24599589
int	double
it is rounded to the nearest double which is the same as the nearest int which is 5515202112762163

24599589

shadowing	named
shadowing affects which variable a named refers to

24599685
superclass	subclassing
that is since the subclassing win defines its own backimage instance variable methods of win that refer to backimage will refer to the instance variable in win and thus its value rather than the one in the superclass result

24599685
superclass	subclassing
also note that the initialization lines like run as part of a class s constructor and the subclassing win s constructor begins by running its superclass result constructor

24599685
inherited	subclassing
so if the subclassing didn t declare another backimage and its constructor assigned a new value to the inherited instance variable result#backimage this would happen after the result constructor built the content pane so it wouldn t change the display

24599825

the code explicitly subtract one from the number of bits in the modulus so it is safe to add one to size to get the modulus size

24601921
swift	objective-c
when you use a swift api from objective-c the compiler typically performs a direct translation

24601921
swift	objective-c
for example the swift api func playsong name string is imported as in objective-c

24601921
swift	objective-c
however there is one exception when you use a swift initializer in objective-c the compiler adds the text â œ initwith â to the beginning of the method and properly capitalizes the first character in the original initializer

for example this swift initializer init songname string artist string is imported as in objective-c

24602109
inline	inlining
about the second part of your question - how does inlining affect the attributed place for the compiled code in memory - if all the calls to this function are inline the linker needn t even include a definition for this function

std	ostream
i had to modify the header file so that i could get rid of some of the errors like putting using namespace std or changing #include ostream.h to #include ostream and so i managed to get the error count to only two which i can t manage to fix and which i think i won t be able to because there are two functions whose implementation i can t find anywhere the function is declared but the code that it is supposed to run when they are called can t be found

24602417
oncreate	setcontentview
so in your activity override the oncreate method and add this call setcontentview r.id.activity_event_example

24602417
oncreate	setcontentview	oncreate	onstart
also move the code you have right now in the onstart method into oncreate it s called once while onstart is called every time your screen is brought to the foreground but after the call to setcontentview

versioning	upgrade
i ve been running v16 forever because whenever iâ ve tried to upgrade to newer versioning theyâ d all pretty much just crash after 30 minutes of heavy use and not a single versioning of ff that iâ ve ever used has ever fixed the memory leak problems

24602648
versioning	upgrade
i assume this is because of the caret in the dependency entry which tells npm to go ahead and upgrade minor versioning 3.8 to 3.9

24602648
versioning	upgrade
if i modify the dependency and remove the caret then npm update works as expected except of course that i now have to manually upgrade the dependency versioning even for minor and patch updates

24602648
versioning	upgrade
i was hoping that would still allow me to upgrade through minor versioning without prerelease versioning but that s not the case

24602648
versioning	upgrade
the only reason it works is because the breaking changes being introduced are in 3.9.0-unstable and tilde doesn t allow npm to upgrade across minor versioning

24602781
subtract	add

24602822
viewdidload	didreceivememorywarning
i somehow found a way to amplify memory usage i just need to execute removeallcachedresponses for every viewdidload of viewcontrollers because the didreceivememorywarning was quite late or being delayed to clear cached responses when the memory warning is triggered it may not look good on the code but it prevents to store and fill up memory and caches

24602830
goto	break
this is rather convoluted you re using the break as a goto statement

24602834

first thing to notice is that angular has a set of directives that come out of the box we re using a few above ng-repeat ng-init ng-controller

24602957
inline	inlining
inline may or may not have an impact on the stack depending on whether the compiler is happy with inlining your code or not and whether the function itself needs to use the stack for its computations

24602957
inline	constexpr
you may be interested in looking at the constexpr keyword which i think is better than the inline keyword when you can make use of it

24602963
ssl	https
i received no errors at this point but when i started the server and tried using https instead of http i got an ssl connection error from the browser

24602998

24603367
google-chrome	safari
so in this case the second statement is read by ie but not by google-chrome and mozilla or safari so this also does the trick but again this is also a hack

24603386
viewdidload	viewdidappear
looks like i was calling the start animation in viewdidload instead of viewdidappear by mistake

24603387
post	get
it can not be done with get post needed and a big reason is that http get should be idempotent and it should not change any behavior in the application it should only be used to get data

24603387
post	get
so if you are changing the behavior from get please make it post and then you can use anti forgery token

24603465

serializable	deserialization
a constructor of a serializable object would have been called when the object was first constructed but constructors are not called during the deserialization because technically you are not constructing the object instead reconstituting it to the former state

24615950
serializable	deserialization	super	extends
deserialization of serlializable objects do not cause constructor invocation but when there is a super class that is not serializable that is you extends a non-serializable class with a serializable class then that class is not expecting to be deserialized and it has no mechanism for storing restoring its members

24615950
serializable	deserialization
if the super class is not serializable the deserialization mechanism needs to call the zero-argument constructor to make sure that the reconstituted object instance is initialized correctly

24615950
superclass	subclassing
furthermore your serializable subclassing must take responsibility for storing restoring any member values from the non-serializable superclass

ienumerator	idisposable
note that non-generic ienumerator doesn t implement idisposable but some implementations acquire resources

24616611
ienumerator	idisposable
the fact that ienumerator doesn t inherit idisposable doesn t absolve code which receives an ienumerator implementation that also implements idisposable from the responsibility of calling dispose --it merely makes it harder for such code to carry out that responsibility

for most perhaps all compilers that means it s going to be a a typedef for signed chars . because of a quirk in the definition of the term signed int type it cannot be a typedef for plain chars even if chars happens to be signed

24617967
int	chars
reading a chars reads a single input chars not sequence of chars representing some int value in decimal

24617967
int	chars
since a typedef creates an alias for an existing type not a new distinct type there s no way for the operator to know that you want to treat int8_t as an int type rather than as a chars type

24617967
int	chars
the problem is that in most implementations there is no 8-bit int type that s not a chars type

for-loop	loops
instead of having the run method run a for-loop with time.sleep we start an event loops inside the thread and use qtimer to do the desired printing at a set interval

24622554
width	height
to resize an image ensuring that it is the same proportions the ratio of the initial height x width h x w will have to be the same as the final h x w

24622554
width	height
the other way is to reduce the width to 290 which means to proportionally reduce the height you have to make the height be reduced by a factor of 1000 290 400 which will be less than 1000

24622560
int	chars	int	double
i need to know how to replace chars in a string with corresponding int and display it in double format

24622571
width	height
this will reduce your memory requirements immensely - for example reducing an image to half its original width and height reduces memory requirements to a quarter of the original image

24622682

24622809
opera	safari
you can find the syntaxes for ie and opera and safari etc online

24622837

awt	swing
i have been doing some reading on awt vs swing but i am not really clear on how swing works

24622968
awt	swing
i have read that swing sits on top of awt and that it is lightweight as opposed to awt

24622968
awt	swing
would awt slow the swing components down

24623030
express	node.js
the difference is that i m using rickshaw in a node.js app using the express framework

24623080
awt	swing
this native peer comes from the awt container it is added to this is typically the window and is shared amongst all the swing components within that container hierarchy.

24623080
awt	swing
awt provides the heavy lifting connecting to the native os and providing the core channel through which swing components get rendered

24623080
awt	swing
this is matter of opinion but generally awt was replaced by swing and provides a much more flexible graphical api from which to develop

24623080
awt	swing
swing also borrows much of the awt api including the event queue

24623080
awt	swing	jtree	jtable
jtree and jtable would be my first argument for using swing over awt

24623081
awt	swing
to understand how swing is lightweight than awt you need to understand the concept of peer

24623081
awt	swing
what swing needs is event inputs to drive the system and graphics fonts and colors which are inherited from the top awt containers

24623081
awt	swing
ordinary swing components can be seen as a logical area on awt containers

24623081
awt	swing
few swing components may require an os peer and would yield the similar performance as awt

24623093
getter	setter
do not use the getter setter dot syntax use brackets

24623093
swift	objective-c
the indexpath value type offers the same functionality as the nsindexpath reference type and the two can be used interchangeably in swift code that interacts with objective-c apis

the navigation link might get annoying to users when they are trying to browse the forums so how i can add functionality if they click a link hide navigation it will hide the navigation bar even if they refresh the page it will still be hidden until they click show navigation link

24623147
viewdidload	viewdidappear
reason - why it is not shown for count 1 is view did load called before view is shown to you so if you want to have animation just one time you can move this animation code from viewdidload to viewdidappear method then you will be able to see the animation even if repeatcount is 1

24623972
typedef	struct

i am guessing this is mysql since other dbms will throw a different error e.g sql server column world.population is invalid in the having clause because it is not contained in either an aggregate function or the group by clause or postgresql column world.population must appear in the group by clause or be used in an aggregate function

getter	setter
just make sure all your setter and getter are in place

24626768
getter	setter
1 i believe the reason for the setter as well as the getter is that it s generally assumed if you ve only got a getter then it implies it s not an instance property it s something that is derived

public	protected
the most important rule is working code trumps theoretical rules about public protected private

24634264
public	protected
if you can get there by writing tests for the public methods that sufficiently exercise the protected private methods that s great

24634264
public	protected
just because java or whatever language has a feature private protected public does not necessarily mean you are writing better code because you use it

24634264
public	protected
in most languages you can make a method protected instead of public and put the test class in the same package or whatever and the method will be available for test

daemons	launchd
it s not designed to launchd standalone daemons processes so i don t think it s appropriate for your use-case

portrait	landscape
i m still not 100 clear on what was happening but it seems that the device would try to rotate to portrait on activity change then go back to landscape before drawing the new activity since it was enabled in oncreate and then that somehow messed up the previous activity so that when i went back to it it would get shifted weirdly

24634277
portrait	landscape
changed screenorientation to landscape and it works fine now this problem doesn t arise when the first activity is in portrait and the second is locked to landscape in the manifest.

24634284
vpn	wlan
generally it is never guaranteed that a system will only have one ip address for example you can have both an ethernet and wlan connections and if you have an active vpn connection then you ll have yet another ip address

also getting the ip address becomes non-deterministic in case both a cable and wifi connections are established when a machine has more than one ethernet interfaces or when vpn tunnel are present

the above source directory xx.xxx.xx.xx ftpcopy has a lot of folder like xx x1 x2 etc

24635874

if you hadn t put your typekey s on the json on the way out you ll probably experience similar problems when you put or post data so you will probably need to overload the serializeintohash hook to remove the typekey s on outgoing data

24635918
pull	push
everything works pretty fine - now i want to add my user that is defined in tfs and which is different from the user i have defined on github or bitbucket to that specific repository so that i dont have to enter my username and password everytime i do a git tf push or git tf pull

24635966
children	parent
i want the error messages passed by the exception shown in the global messages area of the frame but i need to remain in the same conversation as before since the children that are being added in the dialog are children to the parent entity in the main page

24635966
children	parent
so to reiterate if i use the frame to upload files everything works and the frame continues on the same conversation adding each child to the parent if i upload a file that is too big i get the correct message in the global message area of the frame but the conversation get incremented and then the children are obviously being added to a new parent entity in the new conversation

i ve seem all kinds of post on this problem but it s hard to get a straight answer

24636071

if you printed it as a chars it would try to display whatever unicode chars is represented by 65534 but then when you cast to int you actually get 65534

24636116
setinterval	clearinterval
this could probably be optimised a fair bit but here is a basic example of how you could do it using setinterval and clearinterval

the most common reasons for this are when the migration is expensive the migration is non-deterministic or integrates with another database or you re in a hurry to upgrade an old versioning

24636161
int	chars
casting a byte to a chars first involves a hidden cast to an int as per the java language spec

24636161
int	chars
when we then narrow it to a chars the int is truncated to

24636161
int	chars
finally casting 1111111111111110 to an int is bit extended with zero rather than a one because the value is now considered to be positive because chars can only be positive

24636856
swift	objective-c
your basic problem is that in objective-c closures aka blocks are represented as nsobject or more precisely are transparently converted to nsobjects while in swift there is no such mapping

24636882
min	max
find the min and max values as you have done

24636900

int	chars
the int type is represented by 32 bits the chars and short types by 16 bits and the byte type is represented by 8 bits

24637624
int	chars	int	boolean
when converting between the int byte short chars and boolean types the jvm needs to either add or truncate bits

24637624
int	chars
a conversion of a chars to an int is therefore performed as

24637624
int	chars	int	boolean
as a matter of fact the jvm does not distinguish between boolean byte short chars and int types

24651282
width	height
i assume the scale can be found once a first edge is fixed first two points help determining two solutions as initial constraints and because i then know edge length and picture width and height i can deduce scale

24651282

24671638
consistency	acid
in reality instead of having one server with many connections queued you have many connections on many servers queueing for stale data since member consistency is eventual not immediate unlike acid technologies however that being said they are only eventually consistent by 32-odd ms which means they are not lagging enough to give decent throughput if the primary is loaded

24672250
width	height
i did this using ui- graphicsview- width and ui- graphicsview- height for width and height respectively

24672282
getter	setter
you should rather use normal non static fields with setter and getter

24672307
for-loop	arrays
up until the for-loop it just loads the json file names into an arrays and then processes it one by one

24672309

getter	setter
editted setter and getter methods

24672401
post	get
you could use a form tag and pass the information via post instead of get so that it s not a query string but you d have to use a little php in the destination to use the values with _post

24672423
getter	setter
you can use ctrl + shift + c kbd to generate getter and setter from a property declaration

24672423
getter	setter
but those getter and setter are empty stubs

24672602
gif	png
for example given gif may be deprecated in a system because png has proven better for the system s users - perhaps because it supports better colour depth preserving the colours more accurately or svg might be deprecated because some clients have been found to be using web browsers that won t display them jpeg might be deprecated because it s known the images in the system aren t natural photographic images and the format gives visually poor results despite larger compressed files slower processing speed and higher memory usage - lots of possible motivations for making things deprecated

versioning	upgrade
no problem mnt i mentioned possible compatibility between the method tried in 4.25 my solution and 4.00 your versioning but keep in mind the gap in time between these versioning is probably more than two years of upgrade and also a jump between backend databases versioning oracle 10g to oracle 11g r1.

from the above code you can find the x and y coordinates of the drawrect and its width and height

24673663

as far as i think you can t divide the page into different pages but you can make the whole document scrollable i mean you add overflow auto in your css after defining the the height and width of the div containing document

24673757

24673977
integer	unsigned
function strlen returns a size_t which is an unsigned integer type

24674034
for-loop	loops
it is not a good idea to use a while loops and manually increment a value where a for-loop could be used - the latter is easier to read and less error prone

24674045
floating-point	integer
this especially means pulling memory reads to the front so they have a chance of being executed before the data is used in a calculation otherwise the cpu has to stop there and wait for the memory access to complete mixing floating-point and integer operations because these are run on different circuitry and can be parallelized and calculating conditions for conditional jumps as early as possible so the instruction prefetch mechanism knows whether to follow the jump or not

24674679
getter	setter
getter and setter are a necessary evil in the world of oop

24674679
getter	setter
yes if a class is big enough it can be a pain to read through a list of getter and setter but with the help of a well setup enviroment and or ide this does not have to get in the way of productivity and readability

24674679
getter	setter
in the worst case the actual boilerplate of getter and setter is so commonplace that it s easy to skim when reading and makes the code easier to reason about if not boring

24674679
getter	setter
most code especially in larger code bases is write once read many change infrequently so the added time taken to implement the getter and setter is not something often repeated in a single class and with the use of a well configured ide such as vim or an ide such as phpstorm this is a non-issue anyway

24674738
width	height
you might also want to check which value is less width or height

hash	salt
as an example consider the following simplified set of passwords salt and hash

24683781
hash	salt
the attacker knows that your salt is y03sar and starts computing every hash with that start for every password from a to zzzzzz

24683781
hash	salt
if the attacker again starts calculating hash for every password from a to zzzzzz with the salt y03sar then i2chf1 won t be in their output list at least it s improbable with a reasonable length hash output

24683781
hash	salt
even if it is the computed password for salt y03sar still won t work to gain access to the aaaaaz account because the hash would be different with salt bbq9f0

24683781
hash	salt
to add some numbers to the mix using a single salt lengthens the attack time from instantaneous rainbow tables provide for a constant-time lookup on the hash digest to linear time

this is usually solved by pre-filtering the image into a set of images of half the width and height at each step

24683969
hash	salt
i am guessing that the issue is that the salt needs to update with the password hash in order to properly decyrpt it but i m unsure of how to update the salt

for-loop	loops
or a for-loop to loops over the list and remove each file

24684975
width	height
if you give the images a width height and a border it doesn t matter that you cannot upload them themselves

24684978
post	put
the relevant bit of code is supposed to pick out a certain class loop through its elements put the desired elements in an array and post that array

24684978
post	get
even though i use the .val method to get the text from the textarea and push it into the relevant array which i then post no text gets uploaded to the database

maven	pom.xml
i define the classpath in my maven pom.xml file and it works file

24684986
children	parent
when creating a parent i assign children to it via collection check boxes

24685001
folder	directory
the way i used this was instead of using the rxtx 2.1-7 jar i downloaded this project and pasted the gnu folder in my main directory of my project and used it as a source rather than a jar file

24685019
children	parent
you can float the children remove the whitespace between the children or set the parent s font size to zero so the whitespace has no width

24685019
children	parent
i don t like the font solution because it eliminates the children being able to inherit the font size of their parent

24685052
folder	directory
to import a database into my project however i do not want the database.orm.yml files to be in a bundle i want to have the orm and entity files located in a static directory in my src folder

24685066
radio-button	checkbox
suppose i can t use radio-button or checkbox

24685090

24685098
google-chrome	firefox
demo tested in firefox and google-chrome

24685105
sudoers	visudo
use the visudo command and look at the contents of your etc sudoers file

24685111
union	distinct
use a union to make a dervied table then group or distinct the results for example

24685128
hide	show
but when the show button btnshow is clicked i want to hide the keypad until the user taps an edittext box

24685207
folder	directory
the c inetpub directory has special permissions that require you to run it as an administrator in order to make any changes inside the folder

24685208
google-chrome	firefox
this code works properly in ie and google-chrome but doesn t work in firefox versions 23 24 both tested

24685208
google-chrome	firefox
in addition to the i have also tried formobject.submit - both work in google-chrome but both fail in firefox

24685258
maven	pom.xml
i m declaring quite a few dependencies within one package in a maven pom.xml and the document is getting very long and difficult to maintain as is even without a separate dependency block for each referenced artifact

24685323
hide	show
the easiest way is to just hide them all first then your loop will show the correct number of drowns after

24685330
google-chrome	firefox
now my understanding is that for this preflight should be enough for firefox google-chrome to let the request continue

24685416
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox both allow f12 debug mode

24685424
versioning	upgrade
i am trying to upgrade to new versioning of a library that depends on akka 2.3 but it conflicts with the versioning of play i currently have

24685491
google-chrome	firefox
if you check firefox it is working totally fine but google-chrome seems to make it invisible while still clickable

24685500
put	get
i am assuming that i need to place my subscribes in specific areas to get this to happen but i am not sure where to put them

24685510
post	get
so in get action edit we check if id exists but in post action edit not

24685521
for-loop	arrays
ideally i want to iterate through an arrays until i find the correct value attach a variable to that value and use it outside of the for-loop

24685550
width	height
i m a noob but i feel like this has something to do with setting the body head height width to 100 as well

24685570
hide	show
remove this and it will show hide correctly

24685578
put	get
edit if i put it in the operationcontext using an i can keep it around until i get to the ierrorhandler

google-chrome	firefox
i am using both colresizable for adjusting column and resizable function for adjusting row it is working good in mozilla firefox but not working in google-chrome

24685583
width	height
you can create a generic uiview and set its width or height to 1 pt in a storyboard

24685583
width	height
make sure you set its constraints or resizing mask so that it doesn t grow in width height when the screen is resized

24685640
hash	salt
suppose you store hash and salt passwords with bcrypt

24685640
hash	salt
as martinstoeckli says so long as you still have the old hash and salt you can always compare the user s input against it

24685650
typedef	struct
to fix the first warning drop the struct from the variable type since it is not a struct but a typedef for a struct thus warning for type mismatch

24685665
hash	md5
it has to identify md5 hash in file one per line and print it but it is not working properly it prints me nothing or if i modify something it gives me output

24685696
range	percentile
to my understanding this if statement will return the range of cells or data matrix that afterwards will be used by the percentile function.

24685701
client-side	server-side
to make it work both client-side and server-side just export it if module.exports exists

24685716
disk	ram
additionally there s only so much ram available in your system so it s possible that the data you want has been removed from ram and temporarily stored on your hard disk called swapping if it hasn t been used in a while

24685716
disk	ram
now what you thought was a simple ram access is actually going to your hard disk first

24685722
folder	directory
so there s 7 000+ files and each file is it s own line on list.txt i was wondering if there s a search that would look for the file folder from each line in list.txt to search a directory to see if it s found

24685829

if the height and width were both 50px then minus 25px .for example

24685876
post	get
and i got classic get and post actions in the controller.

24685904
integer	unsigned
the initial sample is an 32-bit unsigned integer

24685927
disk	ram
in your case if the amount of ram is m and m is a lot lower than 10gb then dbms will chop your data into blocks of data sort those blocks in ram save it to disk and do the sort merge afterwards resulting in a lot faster solution

24685956
spaces	delimiter
so you could use any other character for your delimiter like + for example which is a url-encoded spaces

24685966
put	get	post	get	post	put
i can t post exactly the code i m using to create this options page but i ll try and put together something similar to get the message across

24686006
width	height
the initial cgframe rect is x 0 y 63 width 284 height 705

24686006
width	height
cgsize width 28 height 961

24686008
width	height
however i am not sure if i should set the width 100 or height 100

24686049
mouse	keyboard
besides settimer you can also create threads that trigger on a schedule with a mouse or keyboard event or even for screen scrapping pixels in your active window

24686081
pydev	liclipse
for older versions keep using pydev 2.x use liclipse for a pydev standalone with all requirements bundled

24686093
put	get
now the problem if you go back to step 3 and instead of clicking the logo decide to hit the back button and go back from the books route to the index route the contents that get put inside the el .wrapper are repeated twice

24686169
highcharts	highstock
there you will see 2 charts the one on top is the detail chart highcharts scatter chart with mod for faster rendering with only x and y values the second chart is the master chart highstock where i only use the rangebar with seperated data

24686257
width	height
of course you cannot always fill 100 of both width and height and not more than 100

24686257
width	height
on parent div which is absolutely positioned or fixed and sized at 100 of height and 100 of width of user s browser window

24686288
hide	show
i would also like a button to clear that interval and hide the div that show up

24686294
width	height
i m working on one project and client has a requirement that each section should cover the whole screen by width and height too

24686305
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
the elastic beanstalk faq mentions the ability to deploy non-web applications here and i have found a similar unanswered question on the amazon-web-services developer forums here

24686305
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
of course if i were starting over i would just skip using elastic beanstalk and use the standard amazon-web-services auto-scaling along with a similar deployment scheme

24686321
width	height
i was never able to figure this out i know you can change the width and height but what about padding

24686372
postgresql	mysql
this works with mysql and postgresql and most others as well

24686430
swift	objective-c
this is not a problem that is specific to swift with nsstring in objective-c the doublevalue method returns 0.0 for invalid input which is pretty horrible

24686443
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in google-chrome but in firefox is shows the content for a moment and the disappears

24686447
qsort	bsearch
libraries like glibc with qsort and bsearch or more higher languages like java and its java.util.comparator class and java.util.sortedmap implementation java.util.treemap as containers use comparators

24686494
gif	png
if the request is for the image or other subdomain redirect to www unless the request is for a jpg gif png css or js file

24686524
mouseleave	mouseenter
the point here is that if you are on a mouse-enabled device like a desktop that doesn t have touch capability then the mouseenter mouseleave events are fired and the menu is activated without a click

24686524
mouseleave	mouseenter
if the user is not on a device that fires a mouseenter mouseleave event then the click or tap events are fired when the person taps the link and the click or tap handler handles the dropdown toggle

24686528
put	get
i can either put the jaxb.properties in the package of clock.java or get my jabxcontext instance this way

24686535

margin	height
i ve solved it i ve replaced the height on the substract for outerheight true and added overflow hidden to the three elements main header footer to avoid the collapsing margin effects

24686783
int	chars
fixed length data type such as int and chars use the same amount of space regardless of what s in them with a few exceptions such as sparse columns

24686825

24686999
touchesbegan	touchesended
i have two methods pertaining to my question touchesbegan and touchesended

24687016
getter	setter
what i d have for really providing getter setter member functions would look as follows note it s pseudo code replace t with the actual data types you need

24687080

filtering	grouping
then filtering the grouping and gets only those grouping which have 6 numbers 3

24687305
width	height
would be as valid development approach to put all my images in the most generic folder just drawable - for all densities and just specify the image width and height using dp density independent pixel will scale

24687323
action-filter	onactionexecuting
a custom action-filter authenticationrequiredattribute derived from actionfilterattribute overrides the onactionexecuting method and does a db call to get the clientid associated with a valid apikey

24687336
post	get
this can be for example a get or post request

24687348

bower	npm
i really like the way bower works but i am looking at incorporating grunt into the build process to do things like auto-wire dependencies via bower but then i am digging into npm anyway

24687773
for-loop	arrays
so i changed the for-loop to create recipient objects to store in the arrays rather than arrays in the arrays

24687777
bluetooth	usb
as both waynepiekarski and thoast83 have mentioned if the android wear device is connected via bluetooth instead of a direct usb connection when testing with the moto 360 then you need to use as instructed by directing commands to a specific emulator device instance in the adb documentation

24687789
g++	gcc
let s assume that the compiler can normally be whatever the platform expects typically gcc g++ or in a worst case msvc but that when we re using mpi we always know we need to compile through mpicc mpicxx

24687819
asp.net-mvc	html.actionlink
i am used to using this style of providing asp.net-mvc routing info using html.actionlink but the html.action should be similar-ish

24687830
post	get
part of the creation of the app asks you to specify a callback url this is the url on your website that is going to receive the token token related data in a hash tag i presume they did this so that only javascript can get at it rather than php directly however you could modify the hashtag in javascript to drop the hash and redirect it to another url which can collect it as get or post params

24687866
put	get
you need to get the value of the selected radio and put it in the delivery variable or use it directly to check if isselected or not

24687875

doctrine build queries using dql and not sql because it supports all kinds of database software sql server mysql postgresql etc. therefore you are limited to a certain set of functionalities

superclass	subclassing
if the method in the superclass has package access a compute method in the subclassing overrides it only if it is in the same package as the superclass

24688082
superclass	subclassing
since the superclass is in java.util.concurrent your concrete subclassing could only override it if your class was also in java.util.concurrent --which you wouldn t want to do and java probably wouldn t let you do

24688091

as noted here the default jmapviewer constructor uses a defaultmapcontroller which implements map moving by pressing the right mouse button and zooming by double click or by mouse wheel. to see map coordinates extends defaultmapcontroller override mouseclicked and use one of the viewer s getposition methods

bower	npm
i personally use npm bower and bower for purely front-end modules that aren t available through npm

24688193

24698968
width	height
how can i get the height and width

24699003
std	ostream
as commenters point out std ostream cannot be copied as it does not have a copy constructor

24699003
std	ostream
if the lifetime of the log_output object is static or otherwise long enough you can make the global log stream a pointer to std ostream and have it hold the address of said object you may consider taking the stream as a pointer already to make the intent clearer

24699003
cout	cin	std	ostream
this would for example work for std cout std cin or any std ostream you allocate locally in your main

24699003
std	ostream
with c++11 you can move a std ostream

24699072
width	height
also you way want to set this all up using values for width height so that you can get the responsive resizing effect

24699079
np-hard	np-complete
that scheduling similar to course scheduling is np-complete or np-hard

24699087
width	height
you could also set the size of your icons to a percentage value rather than a fixed width or height and this would scale dynamically but will not re-flow very gracefully

24699095
std	ostream
an std ostream is not copiable

24699127
swift	objective-c
you can find some examples in objective-c and swift and check how they work for you

24699128
stdout	stderr
but according to the question it outputs messages to stdout and stderr which only console applications do

24699146
stdout	stderr
you have the option to mix the stdout and stderr redirecting the stderr into stdout

24699146
stdout	stderr
here we are asking cmd to execute some command and redirect the stream 2 stderr sending its output to stream 1 stdout

24699175
bitblt	gdi
the 2 system.intptr creation calls create 2 gdi objects each and the bitblt creates 1

24699190
uicollectionviewcell	uipangesturerecognizer
i m trying to make a custom swipeable uicollectionviewcell with a uipangesturerecognizer

24699198
portrait	landscape
what i want to do is having an application which works only in portrait mode on phones and in both portrait and landscape mode on tablet

24699198
portrait	landscape
now if i start on my phone the application in portrait mode everything works flawlessly while if i start the app with my mobile in landscape mode then the first fragment gets loaded perfectly but when the line

24699198
portrait	landscape
but above all why everything works fine if i start the app with the mobile in landscape or portrait mode

24699251
128bit	64bit
i try to do that by registry but it s not good idea because withe almost every one new version of windows 2000 xp vista 7 8 and 32 bit or 64bit and may be 128bit the registry keys get change

24699277
pop-up	dialog
by default this property is false and show pop-up the dialog as

24699294
min	max
i know i can select the min max and union these for the table as a whole but i m unsure how to do this for each group where its online state is true

24699354
folder	directory
i would consider mapping the folder where the scripts are stored as a virtual directory in iis so that the web server can serve them in response to web requests

24699410
post	get
curl will allow you to perform post get and even ssl requests to the form s submission page

24699436
width	height
also see for image size width and height

24699436
width	height
now u can see difference by changing result section width and height in this jsfiddle

24699438
put	get
if you want to get rid of the you basically need to put the elements into the appropriate namespace - so it s changing the element name

24699466
bluetooth	usb
if so mount it as a usb device remember bluetooth uses the usb bus i think

24699472
width	height
it s contentoffset is the screen height which is why i don t understand why it would cause these problems x 2 screen width

24699478
getter	setter
in addition to simple properties that are stored properties can have a getter and a setter

24699521
onkeyup	onkeydown
so far i ve tried to override both the onkeydown and onkeyup methods of the datagridviewtextboxcell class which i m inheriting from and neither of these methods seems to be called if the cell is in editing mode

24699567
swift	objective-c
i was succeeded on importing the cocoaasyncsocket library using a bridging-header.h i could call the functions from the objective-c classes but i m not able to write the delegate function on swift

24699568
getter	setter
use the getter and setter like kyle said he just went further showing the property

24699573
post	get
i get this error fatal error class cmodelevent not found whenever i try to save model without using a post form but directly get data from an excel file and assign it to model attributes as given below

24699586
getter	setter
in your code sample perimeter is a property not backed up by a class variable instead its value is computed using the get method and stored via the set method - usually referred to as getter and setter

24699586
getter	setter
computed properties can be readwrite if both a getter and a setter are specified or readonly if the getter only is specified

24699598
folder	directory
ibredistdir environment variable should be properly configurated with the directory containing library folder and licenses

24699646
pysimplesoap	suds
i created sample scripts with suds pysimplesoap but they did not work as i would like so i made something using urllib2 and it worked perfectly

24699706

what ordous is suggesting is that you create a jpanel with your 3 buttons give them actionlisteners and place that jpanel into a joptionpane or into a jdialog and display it

24699825
maven	pom.xml
in the update maven project dialog ensure that update project configuration from pom.xml is checked

24699836
getter	setter
this is where the getter and setter come in

24699949
google-chrome	firefox
in ie11 the calls takes around 3 seconds while in google-chrome firefox it takes about 0.2 seconds

24700045
inherited	subclassing
because of the â œcategorization by inheritanceâ system you mustnâ t directly import the subclassing of iplugin in the main plugin file instead import its containing module and make your plugin class inherited from containingmodule.specificpluginclass as in the following example

24700121
google-chrome	firefox
note that this unfortunatly only works on some browsers tested on firefox doesn t work on google-chrome

24700139
post	get
please post the function if you get it to work using the above expressions

i ve have managed to change the shadow color in my code using setcolor qpalette disabled qpalette light qcolor # # # on the qcombobox s palette

24700396
qcolor	qpalette
calling setcolor qpalette active qpalette buttontext qcolor # # # on my palette before assigning it to by qcombobox resolves the issue but i m still looking for a style sheet solution

24700415
inherited	properties
check the underscore docs on what this does it creates a new parent instance and copies the name properties and maybe some inherited ones to it

24700415
inherited	properties
to copy them and then the new child-specific properties onto the prototype object but the standard solution is to create an object that dynamically prototypically inherited from parent.prototype

24700425
qmouseevent	qwidget
so far this is working great with the following exception when the cursor reaches the edge of the screen the qmouseevent position no longer changes and it appears to the qwidget that the mouse is not moving

mysql treats boolean as int with true being 1 and false being 0

24700667
mergesort	timsort
java 7 uses timsort java 6 used mergesort

24700667
comparator	comparable
your comparator always returns 0 which breaks the comparable contract and timsort is picking up on that

24700689
post	get
you are telling your code here to remove the sprite from the scene and to clean it up but based on your post i don t get the impression you actually want that to happen at that moment

24700713
put	get
put that commit id in there specify a new branch name hit create branch and you should get a new branch with your lost commit

24700715

24700884
box-sizing	border-box
if you really want to use the horizontal controlgroup you just need to add the css box-sizing border-box

24700964
valgrind	memcheck
i understand that valgrind can call memcheck to perform memory leak check and in this case the compiled c++ executable program must contain debug information

24701207
profiling	debugging
without debugging info the best valgrind tools will be able to do is guess which function a particular piece of code belongs to which makes both error messages and profiling output nearly useless

24701220
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
i also add log times in viewwillappear and viewdidappear

24701220
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
i don t know what can slow down my app between viewwillappear and viewdidappear calls

24701220

24701230
elasticsearch	fluentd	elasticsearch	kibana	fluentd	kibana
i have a fluentd + elasticsearch + kibana setup

24701230
elasticsearch	fluentd
fluentd is configured to output to elasticsearch with this plugin

the problem is that fluentd will never flush its buffers to elasticsearch whilst it is running it just stores the data in the memory buffer

24701274
cpu	processors
processors intel r xeon r cpu e5-2420 v2 2.20ghz 24 cores threads

24701323
width	height
and then use those for your width and height

24701323
width	height
my guess is that at the time you are calling the width and height those values are 0 because they are not done drawing or something

24701340
stdout	stderr
if there is no mail make sure the processes write messages to stdout stderr when there is a problem

24701369

24701514
switching	screens
in screens b i have mobile pages ant the program logic either switches between those pages within screens b or makes new webservice rq to switching to screens c

24701514

folder	directory
here is a nice helper to get all files and folder of an ftp directory

24701786
super	extends
an easy-to-remember rule of thumb here is the pecs rule producer extends consumer super

24701786
super	extends
this means that if your member has a collection with type parameter foo all producer type methods ones that insert into your collection will need t extends foo and all consumer type methods those that return values from the collection should have t super foo

24701798
min	max
you can always use ng-minlength ng-maxlength for string length and min max for number limits

24702145
versioning	upgrade
if you use anything less than the required versioning upgrade

24702145

24702405
children	parent
now the query should return a result set that has the section or parent first then all the children fields after

24702417
put	get
i can also confirm that the same object works correctly when posting the object only put fails to update that field and it s only that field that doesn t get updated

24702477
put	get
it threads some transformable data type through your application and allows your application to transform it via get and put methods

24702479
for-loop	arrays
you could add all of the results to an arrays and then do a for-loop in which you could access any of the rows by numerical index

24702490
jar	war
- this is in a separate ejb jar and included in the webservice war as a dependency

24702497
google-chrome	firefox
the code i m working with not my code was written a very long time ago perhaps even long before firefox and google-chrome existed

24702505
subtract	add
for example c and c++ call it undefined behavior for signed integers and the behavior is defined unsigned integers take the mathematical result add uint_max + 1 as long as the result is negative subtract uint_max + 1 as long as the result is greater than uint_max

24702833
tunnel	vpn
application servers have an internal non-routing 10.x type ip that should be used for access control and any external ips like your home network should be specifically whitelisted if vpn access or ssh tunnel is not practical as those two are far easier to secure

24702843
folder	directory
i build and run the project successfully but the problem is that the execution directory path is from build folder not target folder

24702847

i m trying to set up an onclientclick listener for a gridview

24703352
ready	each
if i call this function repeatedly from within oncreate then the time taken for each call is very consistent + 3 but if i call it from within oncameraframe a function that opencv calls when it has an image ready from the camera then the time taken for the maths test in each fram varies by anything up to a factor of two

24705556
charindex	substr
you can use substr and charindex function to get your desired result like below

24705651
inherited	properties	inherited	subclassing
it feels like a timing issue but whats odd is that bar is created atomically in its own tx which sets its and its inherited properties so i am not sure how when the polling thread picks it up the base class properties are filled in but the subclassing properties are still null

though the theoretical max payload of a udp packet is 65 507 in practice you are probably not going to get messages over 1400 bytes because of path mtu limits

24705836
oncreate	ondestroy
the reason it works when you launch from multi-tasking is because normally the activity state is started in oncreate persists until ondestroy is called

24705856

those bin folder are protected to those who are not super users therefore sudo must be used to elevate your access level and allow npm to write to those directory

24706390
children	parent
property injection would save my parent vms from having to know about their children s dependencies but that only works for interface properties and if i litter the code with a bunch of useless interfaces to accommodate dependency injection then i m just trading one problem for another

24706411
uilabel	uitextview
after some thought and research i realized that while uilabel doesn t support uitextinput uitextview does

uilabel	uitextview
otherwise you don t get exactly the same wrapping and placement of the text in the uitextview as you do in the uilabel

swift	objective-c
note this was written in swift but should be easy enough to convert to objective-c

24706499

if that does not work then remove the other chars and just pass value with either as int or long and see if it makes a difference

24706887
hash	md5
i am setting up a hash function that takes the md5 of an object and tacks on the first four bytes of the object to prevent collisions

int	boolean
on php 5.3 int 1 is implicitly casted to boolean true while on 5.4+ you d be passing the real flag value

24707180
width	height
it wasn t acceptable for me to hard code the width and height of the info window or to set white-space nowrap the maxwidth solution didn t help me and everything else either didn t work or was otherwise inappropriate for my use case

24707196
serializable	deserialization
whatever approach you choose you ll be able to accomplish same results using either newtonsoft or the .net serializable whilst the newtonsoft approach would allow you to query without creating strong types for deserialization

24707207
onresume	onpause
alternatively add matching removelistener calls for example in onresume onpause

24707211
google-chrome	firefox
it s possible google-chrome isn t reporting the specific line but using line 975 as a reference to the segment of the code where property e doesn t seem to be found thus line 975 could be in the middle of whatever code is problematic some debuggers do this instead of reporting the first line they find a problem on - maybe google-chrome s interpreter works like this i don t know though since i use firefox for development instead

24707461
width	height
you can t really specify a height and width of your shadow only a spread

24707461
width	height
so if your container shrinks by 10 in width but does not shrink in height then your shadow will shrink by 10 if it were possible your shadow s height would scale even though it probably shouldn t

24707461
width	height
if you want the box-shadow to actually scale correctly with regards to height and width you would have to create multiple shadows - one for height one for width

24707551

24714952
public	protected
this is because p and glass are declared as package protected since you did not put private protected or public before them as in public point p

24714954
implements	extends
even if you get rid of extends master and add implements actionlistener you could no longer write a method like

24714993
vbo	pbo
you can use that as vbo or as ibo or as pbo or ubo or whatever later un even if the initial binding target was gl_array_buffer

24714994

1 place the folder outside of the www directory

24716833
inline	constexpr
yes unlike other functions inline and constexpr functions may be defined multiple times in the program

24716833
inline	constexpr
constexpr functions and constexpr constructors are implicitly inline

24716833
constexpr	inline-functions	inline	constexpr
thus since a constexpr function is implicitly inline it has all the attributes of an inline-functions

24716877
put	get	post	get	post	put
that is a request using standard http methods get post put delete to query a server

24716908
integer	unsigned
however printf is expecting an unsigned int because you re using u and not d and thus interprets the integer as that signed -56 and unsigned 4294967240 have the same representation in x86

24716941
inline-functions	inlining
this is the case to allow inline-functions in a header in order to make inlining possible at compile-time instead at link time

24716941

inside of this i put images with unknown width and height

24717205
width	height
this works fine when the img dimensions are smaller than the width and height

24717205
width	height
but when the height img is more than 500px or when the img width is more than the width of the carousel the img overflows the carousel

24717208

x86	64bit
this means that single byte char types are promoted to 32 bit or 64bit types on modern x86 computers when passed into a function like printf

24717776
int	chars
i know for a fact that gcc s chars and evidently whatever compiler you re using too defaults to being signed so your value of 200 is actually -56 in a 2 s compliment signed int scheme

24717776
integer	unsigned
however by printing it as an unsigned integer you ve made the compiler reinterpret a 32 bit signed value as a 32 bit unsigned value

24717776
int	chars
in this case you ve passed in a single signed chars to printf which caused the binary blob to contain contain a signed 32 bit int and you ve told printf that it s actually an unsigned 32 bit int

24717793
cpu	processors
edit i know it is supposed to be using multiple processors because when i ssh into the node and do top -c i can see above command sometimes running like 3200 cpu all the time and sometimes only 100 cpu all the time

personally i have worked with maven and ant

24718074
maven	pom.xml
dependencies can be added to the pom.xml in maven s dependency format

24718074
maven	pom.xml
if you find it there you can simply copy the xml snippet to your pom.xml which has been created by maven s archetype system for you

24718074
ant	maven
while maven usually works out of the box ant requires you to write your build file manually

24718144
int	double
in this case you have to cast numberofcorrectansers to a double so that the division gives you a double backâ otherwise java will round your answer down to the nearest int 5 6 0

24718152
swift	objective-c
i m in the process of converting an objective-c file which uses lumberjack logging into swift

you can check when width height is different from 100 like this

24718301
bower	npm
from your app root npm install -g bower then update so bower components are piped into vendor.js or app.js using jointo as described in the brunch config doc

punctuation	words
i am trying to parse the string into words and punctuation marks using javascript

24718348
punctuation	words
i am able to separate words but then punctuation marks disappear using the regex

24718380
post	get
i would also recommend against using all and prefer either get or post so you set up a minimal restriction

24718380
getter	setter
so i definitely let the controller be responsible for the glue having repositories for any collection matter services and hydrators to change the object and the model itself staying for only getter and setter managing their own data in their own scope

24718399
punctuation	words
this matches the actual words an punctuation characters separately using an alternation

24718399
punctuation	words
the first half of the regex matches whatever you consider to be a words and the second half matches whatever you consider punctuation

24718406
folder	directory
i need to be able to access a file in a folder located in the root directory on each of my pages

24718411
children	parent
i have the following classes enemy class is the parent class and boss and superduperboss are children classes

24718489
width	height
set the image as a background image to a div with a set width and height and you can change that value with css

24718489
put	get
ideally put both graphics into one image so that you can just shift the background position and you don t get any flicker during the transition google css image sprites

24718489
hide	show
you could also have two images and use display block and display none to show hide them as appropriate but i don t think that would be the best approach

24718500
integer	fractions
mysql s syntax for delimiting the fractions part of a floating point number from the integer part always uses a dot

24718512
move	drag
drag that line across to the view controller that you want to move to in your case offerdetailviewcontroller and release

24718538
integer	fractions
extract integer part so you have fractions part less than 1

24718538
integer	fractions
find nearest 16th of fractions multiply by 16 and round to nearest integer

24718566
for-loop	if-statement
i have a for-loop to run through the entries and an if-statement to perform the comparison

24718586

however i want to generate the setter and getter instead of having to code them myself

24718587
spaces	delimiter
basically we iterate over the array split each name into parts delimiter by spaces and try to find the maximum length among first parts of names

24718645
outputstream	inputstream
i recognize the difference between inputstream s outputstream s and play s enumerator iteratee paradigm so i expect there will be a specific way in which i need to generate my source data serialization of sql results so that it doesn t outpace the rate of download

24718649
ivar	subclassing
regarding define cancelled property or define _cancelled ivar inside nsoperation subclassing normally that is not necessary

24718655
folder	directory
im trying to iterate over each file and folder inside a directory and extract part of the file name into a variable but i can t make sed work correctly

24718723
punctuation	words
if you want to allow only words characters and whitespace avoiding punctuation you can do

24718763
swift	objective-c
this is on top of not being able to use objective-c macros in swift

24718764
children	parent
so the problem i have now that the parent div height is larger than his children s height

24718813
width	height
use a rectangular element having width greater than the width of the vertical line and a height of 1

24718820
post	get
currently i am using a nsurlsession task to send a post request and get the response and results like the following

24718828
spaces	delimiter
i m wanting to make a query which will list the tags ordered by the most unanswered questions which have that tag however as the tags are stored as spaces delimiter varchar and as i understand it sql server which stackexchange uses doesn t have a function to split a string i m a bit unsure on how to proceed

24718834
width	height
your drawv view will be laid out below the buttons view and then will match the parent container s width and height fill it

if i change the title of my window always change my program icon always or call the system menu sometimes the native titlebar is drawn over my custom extended frame

24718897
http	spdy
i ve configured spdy on my nginx instance and used to confirm that its setup but for some weird reason nginx redirects the http to the default nginx page i ve deleted the default symlink from sites-enabled restarted the server but the problem persists

24718955
int	chars
it is impossible for an int to store such a huge number ..so you have to use string or chars array or int array to solve this particular problem.

24718974
hide	show
but i don t know how to activate an onmouseover event so that it will hide all the text and show a new text content when the mouse hovers over it

24719011
division	addition
i m working on java ee projects using hibernate as orm i have come to a phase where i have to perform some mathematical calculation on my classes like sum count addition and division

24719023
width	height
so i made the width + height equal to that and then manually adjusted the image myself

24719048
int	chars
textboxes contains strings which is a string of chars and cannot be assigned to an int

24719054
intersect	contains
both ideas below assume that your query point p is directly above the heightmap -- that is that the normal from the plane of the heightmap to p intersect the region that actually contains the heightmap

24719080
int	chars
the c library function chars fgets chars str int n file stream reads a line from the specified stream and stores it into the string pointed to by str

24719091
listview	gridview
if it is either listview or gridview then you can access the rows of the view using getview method

24719092
width	height
very little custom css needed - just the height and width of the right .div and the left-logo .div only if the logo size doesn t dictate that for you

24719107
post	get
i would like to get the comments of a post the id is 100006454706505_1649297628628711

24719130
width	height
if the specified width and height are the same as the current width and height of the source bitmap the source bitmap is returned and no new bitmap is created

24719148
swift	objective-c
if you re reading from a file that was generated from encoded objective-c objects and each object had the objective-c class name stopwatch you won t be able to directly decode that into swift objects because swift performs name mangling on class and symbol names

24719148
swift	objective-c
to get around it specify that your swift class should be exported with a specific objective-c class name

24719148
swift	objective-c
edit 2 contrary to what i wrote above this isn t limited to just reading objective-c instances from swift

24719169
post	get
for testing purposes they have a simple enough page you can do a post to and get back a response without any real data exchange

24719169
post	get
if i use the parameter i still get a successful post but nothing back

24719169
post	get
and again with the postto_url i don t get an error back in the original ajax call either so it acts as a successful post

24719188
mouseup	mousedown
with the following code the text field will get the focus on mouseup no matter where you started the mousedown .

24719188
mouseup	mousedown
you could fine tune the behavior by matching the positions of the mousedown and mouseup events so that the text field would only get focus if both events were above it

24719200
subtract	add
only snag here though is if you add or subtract any menu items you ll have to edit the fixed height of .top-bar.extended accordingly

24719253
google-chrome	safari
on the other hand link aggregators like lobsters have the following which ensures that the whole url will always be provided in the referer by browsers like google-chrome and safari since link stories are public anyways

24719253
google-chrome	safari
as of mid-2014 this is just a proposed functionality for html5 and it doesn t appear to have been implemented in gecko for example -- only google-chrome and safari are claimed to support it

24719264
width	height
not that i know of however to be sure you code against this your app can receive in the screen width and height and divide out to place your labels and buttons in the correct spot

24719285
strsplit	melt
i tried the melt command but i cannot combine it with the strsplit command

24719329
versioning	upgrade
with mysql non-functional i decided to reinstall mysql and upgrade to the newest versioning

24719329
versioning	upgrade
make sure you stop mysql before installing the upgrade versioning

24719329
folder	directory
the easiest way to do this is to open the usr local directory from the finder and choose go to folder from the go menu and with the usr local directory open in the finder choose enter time machine from the time machine menu

24719329
folder	directory
find the folder of your previous mysql install and open the data directory

24719329
folder	directory
basically copy everything in the mysql data folder except the mysql performance_schema and test directory

24719334
width	margin
i believe it s because you haven t specify the actual width and instead of using display inline-block it would be better to use float left and add some margin if you need any space between those div

24719343
width	height
and count the oa ob that value can count the view new height and width

24719343
width	height
and then just set new height and width for view and count the left and top for view

24719379
portrait	landscape
i have 5 xib created for iphone portrait iphone landscape ipad portrair ipad landscape and iphone 4 portrait and here goes the issue

24719400
width	height
sounds like you should open the original svg in illustrator or another editor change the height of the canvas to match the width and export the svg

24719409
xmlhttprequest	jqxhr
the beforesend callback receives jquery s xmlhttprequest object jqxhr rather than the actual xmlhttprequest object xmlhttprequest which is not even instantiated until after beforesend is called

24719409
xmlhttprequest	jqxhr
the setrequestheader method in jqxhr adds headers to an object which is then iterated later using the xmlhttprequest method of the same name just after adding the x-requested-with entry to the headers object

24719440
for-loop	arrays
however in the last for-loop in main when the arrays is printing the first two elements of the arrays are not 0 and 1 like it is supposed to be

24719520
put	get
and finally this is my form that the user will put the name of object and when he click in add that should save the object and get his name to set it as a name of labelname of the node

but you have lingering issues it looks bad on narrow screens ul s start to overlap and in firefox i don t see this in google-chrome or ie there s a massive invisible ghost below them

24719589
dplyr	tidyr
finally using mutate from dplyr smf extract_numeric from tidyr extract the numeric part of month

24719709
width	height
probably the width height of the canvas you are calling is still 0 at that time

24719709
width	height
add some listeners of the width height of the canvas and make sure it has it s height width set other than 0 then try calling that button attributes

24719721
width	height
however i m having trouble making the width equal to the height in order to achieve this 1 1 ratio

24719721
width	height
currently i have the width as a percentage and the height as a arbitrary pixel count which i eyeballed

24719735

a stateless session bean can implement a web service but a stateful

24719792
swift	objective-c
xcode automatically generates a yourmodule -swift.h header which you can simply import from your objective-c code it has to be objective-c since swift classes are exported as objective-c classes

24719792
swift	objective-c
see importing swift into objective-c

24719823
post	put
i ve tried put and post but these return 405 method not allowed and 403 forbidden respectively

24719885
screens	hdpi
it works great on my galaxy s4 but when i run the app on an emulator using the nexus 7 which has a hdpi screens it seems the sprite sheet isn t scaled perfectly

24719892
superclass	subclassing
you can declare a field in the subclassing with the same name as the one in the superclass thus hiding it not recommended

24719892
superclass	subclassing
you can declare new fields in the subclassing that are not in the superclass

24719911
button	checkbox
i want to show a next button once my checkbox is checked

24719911
hide	show	button	checkbox
once the checkbox is checked the next button should show up and the submit button should hide

24719911
button	checkbox
if the checkbox is not checked only the submit button will be shown

24719913
for-loop	arrays
adding event to arrays to be sent is a for-loop that adds database ids into arrayofids

width	height
i d like to display them in a row that wraps to the next line depending on the width of the browser window with a constant height but fixed aspect ratio to prevent skewing

24724677
width	height
each image would have a fixed height but the width could vary

24724686
int	double
for the reason that especially for larger projects if you ever need to add source code from another coder if they have used lots of custom types like tcustomerid thashvalue tinterestrate instead of int cardinal double then you have lots of the above mentioned e2033 to resolve

24724704
implements	extends
the only other way to affect the applicationcontext before it is refreshed is to implements a smartcontextloader or extends one of the provided classes and configure it via

24724719
sorting	filtering
i can suggest add sorting by filtering and not by directive

24724724
imageview	universal-image-loader
i am trying to show an image in an imageview with universal-image-loader but only part of the image is shown

24724761
apache	nginx
if using one server what is better apache or nginx

24724761
apache	nginx
i am experienced in apache but i have heard only good things about nginx

24724784
inherited	properties
i tried realize solution by .net remoting windows service is server console application is client but i couldn t get com interop object in client i made .net class inherited from marshalbyref in shared library created public properties with com interop object

24724793
screens	tablet	google-chrome	safari
i ve got a first gen ipad for tablet screens testing and react won t load my components in either safari or google-chrome

24724811
nsbitmapimagerep	nsimage
these two routines typically exist in either the nsimage or nsbitmapimagerep classes

24724820
debian	linux
on linux debian wheezy x86_64 w ext4 file system

24724821
hash	salt
however if a sufficiently random salt is used for every hash value creating a rainbow table would become impractical requiring the attacker to computer a rainbow table as many times larger as the number of possible values of the salt. 1

24724823
width	height
however this element seems to also rely heavily on a specified height as well which struck me as odd since image tags can use the width attribute without a specified height in which case it would re-scale the image based on aspect ratio

24724830
put	get	post	get	post	put
typically individual resource methods will differ by either method type get vs post vs put or by path by marking the method with a unique path

24724893
next	except
this will either cause the exception to be handled by the next higher-up try except block if there is one or terminate the program if there isn t

24724910
slideup	slidedown
write css to slideup and slidedown

24724924
width	height
there is an inline-block element with 100 height and width

24724956
coldfusion	railo
railo and coldfusion are a language and a server service

24724960
width	height
unless specified otherwise block elements take full width but only as much height as needed - it is only natural since html was originally meant as a way to format text documents

24724970
width	height
the 100 width and height of the inline-block respect the used width and height of its containing block which in this case is body

24724970
width	height
note that because an inline-block is essentially the same as a block box except laid inline percentage width and height are calculated the same way as if the element were block-level

24724982
width	height
making it inline-block just allows it to be inline but preserving its block nature such as setting width and height top and bottom margins and paddings

24724987
avr	microcontroller
i am using a 32-bit avr microcontroller at32uc3a3256 with high speed usb support

24724991
min	max	range	min	range	max
if you want your numbers to be in an range use min and max

24724993
post	get
a again learn the basics client side server side post get ...

24725046
config	ini
in virtualhost config you can revalue ini variables by using this syntax

24725056
int	chars
if i understand your question right you are asking how you can check that no-one tries to insert say an int into your queue of chars s

24725056
int	chars
converting a chars to an int is perfectly allowed and will not generate an error but passing an int as a chars may trigger an error warning depending on the situation

24725056
int	chars
note however that you are in some cases allowed to pass an int to a chars if a asking specifically for it with a cast or b if the compiler can know that the value of the int is small enough to fit into a chars

24725056
inherited	base-class
if you are planning to use this queue with classes that inherited from each other your question becomes more relevant as you are allowed to pass an object of a derived type as a reference or pointer of the base-class type

24725066
setinterval	settimeout
3- and in settimeout s callback you should call setinterval again

24725085
setinterval	settimeout
but in fact the underlying code of the plugin uses settimeout setinterval

24725120
int	boolean
and since .length is an int i would compare it with another numeric value instead of just evaluate it to boolean like in other answers

24725145
post	get
one obvious way would be using post instead of using get

24725155
libjpeg	libtiff	libjpeg	libpng	libtiff	libpng
libpng libtiff libjpeg etc

24725155
tesseract	leptonica
but tesseract based on leptonica uses older versions of these libraries which have incompatible parameters

24725155
libjpeg	libtiff	libjpeg	libpng	libtiff	libpng
eliminate libtiff libpng libjpeg etc completely from my project

24725155
tesseract	leptonica
in tesseract leptonica

24725155

this following code produces a form upon button press the form has checkbox and a richtextbox

24725211
width	height
the border of an element takes its entire width and or height

24725257
post	get
it would be way easier to do this with a get request rather than a post request

24725272
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
my website is working fine on safari and firefox and kind of also on google-chrome

24725272
firefox	safari
when first entering the website on safari and firefox it looks correct

24725276
int	chars
the function fgetc will always return an int to handle all the chars values and eof which is negative

24725290
width	height
this description includes the width height the pixel format the number of mips number of arrays...etc

24725301
int	chars
the fgetc function returns a signed int representing a chars in the range of an unsigned chars or eof which is a negative value

24725301
int	chars
you should store the return value of fgetc in an int variable compare it to eof and then convert it to chars

24725342
apk	dex
chris stratton the memory mapped classes.dex file will be different from the dex file inside apk on disk for example in cases of packed dex files some part of dex will be deobfuscated question is to dump the memory mapped classes.dex file by getting the process memory

24725368
getter	setter
all the fields of both the class have getter and setter methods

24725379
maven	pom.xml
for maven edit pom.xml file like the following

24725410
swing	windowbuilder
when i try to start a simple swing jframe application for example generated by a gui builder like windowbuilder or from small examples out of my programming handbook the program will run without any error but the jframe won t by visible

24725410
swt	swing
it seems that swing applications don t work when they are inside a project which has referenced swt jface libraries 1

24725412
post	get
i also suggest you check out my blog post imap downloading emails to get up and running quickly

24725462
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade to 2013 versioning

24725470
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this appears to be working how you want it in firefox opera and google-chrome for me

24725533
nsurl	nsstring
each dictionary has an avasset an nsurl an nsstring and two uiimages

24725563
accessor	properties
to get the data array you need to use a properties accessor

24725574
folder	directory
inside the google_appengine directory i created a folder page with the page data and the app.yaml

24725625
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome tolerates that but firefox doesn t understand that _-

24725627
for-loop	arrays
i e in the below code i want to assign the value of filename to an javascript arrays in each iteration of the for-loop

24725660
versioning	upgrade
don t try to upgrade from previous versioning because it doensn t work at all

24725736
jscrollpane	jlayeredpane
i want to add a jlayeredpane to a jscrollpane

24725736
jlabel	jlayeredpane
the jlayeredpane has an jpanel with an image as default layer and some jlabel s over it

24725740
decltype	auto
thus my need for auto decltype in this example

24725869
chown	sudo
also normally redis-server executes as the user redis therefore its also nice to give the user redis the ownership of the folder by executing sudo chown -r redis redis path to rdb folder

24725873
google-chrome	firefox
use firebug firefox or developer tools google-chrome to see what is actually being send and received

24725887
versioning	upgrade
if you upgrade to osx 10.9 mavericks this might be caused by a leftover executable from an old versioning of bundler previously installed with ruby 1.8 and still present because bundler has not yet been installed for ruby 2.0

24725890
put	get
i am trying to get some data from my database to put it on my website

24725907
dplyr	tidyr
another option would be to look at dplyr + tidyr

24725980
box-sizing	border-box
also your center div should be box-sizing border-box

24726043
post	get
when any user post on the page we get the update from facebook realtime update api

24726057
width	height
try adding a width equal to the height like this

24726081
prop	each
the problem is that i do not know how to pass the local variable from the loop which is a different string on each loop iteration to the actual callback function without passing it explicitly using prop

24726149
onclick	onmousedown
consider using onmousedown instead of onclick

24726153
hash	md5
to hash users passwords you re using md5 which can be broken with a brute force attack

24726153
crypt	hash
you can fix these problems using this code for login obviously after you have hash all passwords with crypt - to do that see the last point of my answer

24726154
hash	salt
salting hash with an unpredictable salt is used to prevent collision attacks

24726154
hash	salt
if the hash is salt by a value you don t know you ll not be able to generate colliding keys

24726203
jtextfield	jtable
i am trying to search data using jtextfield and view in jtable i am using the following code but i get the following message

24726239
min	max
the problem is that sometimes the function is not working fine because it is giving me chains of numbers with very low difference for example i m calling the function with min 0 and max 1000 and sometimes i get these values in a chain 500 500 502 500 500 500 520 530 503 500 500 501 etc.

24726239
min	max
with a min and max values for the random

24726250
post	get
i am using nsurlsession and nsurlsessiondatatask to send a post request and then get the response and store it in a variable that is an nsstring and then log it

24726300
min	max	range	min	range	max
if the arguments are close to each other say min is 500 and max is 525 your outputs will all be in a very close range

24726300
min	max
if the arguments are far apart say min is 0 and max is 1000 your outputs will vary a lot

24726301
nsstring	nsdata	nsstring	nsjsonserialization	nsdata	nsjsonserialization
nsjsonserialization uses nsdata not nsstring

24726336
int	double
i have problem with sorting numbers int double shorts in a jtable i have overwritten the getcolumnclass method however it still does not sort numbers correctly

24726348
mouse	joystick
i have no joystick so i can t test it but normally i would do this similar to mouse and i wouldn t wait for controller

24726376
put	get
even if i put anything in the block i get the same error message

24726376
post	get
if the block is empty i should get an error message saying so and if there is anything in the block it should be displayed to me on the post action

24726411
min	max
i able to set images for min and max but i can t show steps

24726469
mouse	keyboard
there is no mouse or keyboard

debian	linux
platform is debian linux

24726535
kde	gnome

24726538
implements	extends
but in this case preview class should not extends viewgroup but only implements surfaceholder.callback

24726577
switching	screens
therefore the mainactivity is called each time over and over when i switching screens

24726579
submit	submission
on click of submit button i am submission the form using java script

24726612
gson	jackson
you will see that the jackson outperforms gson in here

24726641
dplyr	tidyr
you can also use tidyr and dplyr together like this

24726654
getter	setter
you can also extend epstatementobjectmodel class as it is not final and wrap all getter and setter in your own setter getter methods

24726682
subtract	add
by putting this code into a function or class-method you could add a parameter to automatically be able to tell the code to add subtract or do other modifications to the trailing number

24726711
avd	galaxy
sadly i recognized that my app that displays content from a csv file looks different on my galaxy siii mini comparing to the avd

24726724
put	get
then all you have to do is put all your person objects in an arraylist and use collections.sort to get them in the right order

24726740
comparator	comparable
simply implements comparable interface add put your logic in overridden comparator method

24726757

the above code takes about 85 s to run on my machine but the data will mostly fit in ram and i have a ssd disk

24726776
opera	google-chrome
this supports google-chrome opera

24726779
ssl	https
heroku uses piggyback ssl so if you setup an http server your app will respond to https requests without any additional config

24726779
ssl	https
the problem there is that the http routes are still available so i ve stuck to setting an https server only - but it s timing out with nothing in the logs so i think that there s a problem with the ssl setup

24726782
stdout	stderr
when using a process in java it is crucial to read stdout and stderr in two independend threads your while loop

24726782
stdout	stderr
with java 7 you can actually redirect stderr to stdout and possibly redirect the resulting stream to the parents stdout

24726788
int	chars
define an array of int of a size large enough to accommodate all possible chars values arbitrarily we could make it 256 for a utf-8 string

24726788
int	chars
for each chars convert the chars to its int equivalent use that as an index into the array and increment the value at that index

24726828
put	get
you can just put the title in the main content s element and then use jquery s .closest method to get the closest parent the content element

24726841
mouse	keyboard
are there any examples around how to create windows like controls for xna including events like mouse over click and double-click and even accept keyboard input if possible using language specific keyboard input

24726858
width	height
in layman s terms you want your site to look nice across all devices screen-sizes versus rendering the same website meaning you put it fixed values for width height etc.

24726890
hide	show
i have to show hide the toolbar buttons conditionally

24726959
post	get
now lets say i post 4 then i echo the height variable i get 5.

24726963
put	get
for jvm to get pick up correct class please put htmlunit dependency on top of dependency so it will be first in classpath taking priority

24726976
udp	tcp
either you have a network with negligible packet loss in which udp would be delivering every packet or you have loss in which tcp is doing retransmit delaying everything by multiples of the retransmit interval which is at least the round-trip time

24726976
udp	tcp
only when packets can be discarded unordered can udp be faster than tcp

24727005
google-chrome	firefox
and again when i test this using curl i get the correct headers and yet somehow google-chrome and firefox are going to a route that i have never defined

24727005
google-chrome	firefox
but in both google-chrome and firefox the browsers do a preflight options call that gets a response that does not seem to come from any route that i have defined

24727005
google-chrome	firefox
and why don t firefox and google-chrome end up at the same route as when i make my call in curl

24727009
enlive	hiccup
then again i use enlive in an odd way no deftemplates or defsnippets use of hiccup style html and heavy use of macros

24727019
128bit	64bit
i know that floats 32 bit and doubles 64bit are binary floating points and decimals 128bit are decimal floating points

24727049
floating-point	fractions
choosing b as 2 or 10 does not make a difference for small integers 0 1 2 â can be represented exactly both in binary floating-point and in decimal floating-point but the fractions numbers and the very large numbers that can be represented exactly are not the same in binary and decimal

24727049
floating-point	integer
it probably uses something similar to the â œbinary integer significand fieldâ technique from the ieee 754 floating-point standard where the allocated bits are used to encode in binary a number between 0 and b n -1 since this is what works best in software

24727063
thin	webrick	passenger	thin	passenger	webrick
it works with passenger but with webrick and thin it doesn t

24727063
thin	webrick
it looks like both webrick and thin parse a request too so the failure happens before initializer is loaded

24727078
post	get
the share dialog opens correctly but then after i hit post i get an

24727105
memcpy	memmove
memcpy or memmove or is copied as an array of character type then the effective type

24727113
nsstring	nsdata
instead of converting nsdata to nsstring better way is convert to nstimeinterval which is double using nsdate -timeintervalsince1970 method then you can sore it in nsuserdefaults if you like

24727133
put	get
you could get creative with form containers such as page or put your one expandable field in the detail section but i seem to recall deciding one time that none of that worked so well

24727145
post	get
i ve simplified my remote code which actually sends the query using post instead of get and you can see it here

24727152
free	malloc
when you pass 0 as an argument to malloc then it free the allocated memory to the pointer which malloc returns to

qmenubar	qmainwindow
i m trying to implement the mvc design pattern in a qt app i m working on and would like to put menu bar in its own class derived from qmenubar i m calling it menu while the window itself is another class derived from qmainwindow i m calling it mainwindow

24727361
memcpy	malloc
malloc may return a null pointer for an allocation of zero bytes and passing a null pointer to memcpy is undefined behavior even if ã ts third argument is 0

24727415
bash	zsh
you could of course invoke zsh or a bash command that turns on extglob directly to run the command

24727434
qmenubar	qmainwindow
i m not sure if sub-classing such qt classes as qmenubar and qmainwindow with your current level of experience is the right way

24727457
post	get
you can override dispatch but a more common approach would be to override get or post depending on whichever request type you are dealing with

24727457
post	get
the base implementation of dispatch calls the appropriate method depending on the request type get or post

24727564
int	double
i have written this code for getting the index of the row which is double clicked by the user the problem is that i want to make the cells non editable as well for that i have extended jtable and overridden its iscelleditablemethod int int

post	get
once the view get the post object it can get every data inside the post

24727740
int	chars
and then we get into the realm of the truly bizarre if you are on a platform where and plain chars is unsigned then size will be promoted to unsigned int which is incompatible with the signed int expected by the d conversion specifier which also invokes undefined behaviour

bower	npm
i ve set up a new npm bower grunt sass compass project and now i m trying to get bootstrap in there too

if i select generate from database the auto-created context file extends objectcontext as opposed to dbcontext

24727838
post	get
as pointed out you re making a get request with jquery while php expect a post one

24727838
post	put
then on your php the post fields aren t good you put value post field

24727838
post	put
edit change to in the post datas in your jquery code this value was the reason why the data wasn t succefully sent to php in you console.log you ve put the right id but not in the post data that s why you where thinking the correct values was sent by php

listener	eventhandler
i have a listener that implements eventhandler org.osgi.service.event.event registered for some events

24728065
post	get
you re submitting your request as a get instead of post which causes it to fail

24728065

swift	objective-c
and from apple s using swift with cocoa and objective-c

24728235
swift	objective-c
it sounds like they completely negated the safety of the optional type in swift for objective-c apis by doing this

24728244

for example you can expect no image to have more than 2048 pixel length for either width or height so 11x2 bits will be enough to encode this information

24742430
width	height
we let the header format to be in the order of message length secret type padding height width last two only if necessary

24743796

so it does seem allowed but in general it seems to be better design to use qtimer or qthread

24744689
min	max
if you need to identify the array values with the keys 01 02 03 create an array of objects and operate on the values to get min max

you could try using the same min and max zoom values each set at 120 minutes

24744703
division	modulo
i m trying to learn to use sse one of the programs i was making required the use of modulo division and so i wrote this to do it sorry it s overcommented

just replace the background-color by background-image url your_url

24744742
post	get
i have a code that can get and display post just before the latest post

primes	modulus
factorize each modulus n as a product of primes powers

24744958
exponent	modulo
with the right data structures you can do all this in a single pass through your congruences for each prime p encountered you ll need to keep track of the biggest exponent e found so far together with the corresponding right-hand side reduced modulo p e for convenience

24744958
primes	modulus
you can skip the factorisation step and instead find a coprime base for the collection of moduli that is a collection of pairwise relatively primes positive integers such that each modulus appearing in your congruences can be expressed as a product possibly with repetitions of elements of that collection

24744980
min	max
it can be done iterating over all points and finding min max coordinates every time when one point is moved - o n on every move

gridview	rowdatabound
rowdatabound is triggered only if the gridview gets databound so when you call gvdata.databind

24745133

24745183
subtract	add
because i need to write down some of those numbers i always need to add subtract zeros after before the

24745209
min	max
secondly assuming label2 is your max value and label3 is your min value and that you want your progress bar control to simply bounce back and forth between the min and max values i would do something like this

24745209
min	max
since i m assuming your label2 and label3 are your min max values i m also assuming they should stay static and never change which is why i don t change their values in the tick event

24745291
cos	sin
to get x y coordinates from this use x r cos theta y r sin theta

find the max and min if your list is not ordered

24745568
min	max
take the difference between max and min and convert it back to pattern

24745568
min	max
for example in your case the difference between max and min is 43

24745568
min	max
and the min is already 57 you can quickly deduct that if the min ends with 157 the max should be 200

24745569

24745589
screens	tablet
i personally wouldn t set a minimal distance to a percentage of the screens as it ll give a fairly different experience between a small phone and a 10 tablet

24745600

keeping all of the setter methods and getter methods if you are so inclined on the prototype will also reduce memory overhead since you won t be redefining the functions every time you build a fence

24745626
maven	pom.xml
just get this resolved in my jenkins job i didn t build the project was just pulling the pom.xml and execute the mvn exec exec on top of it this makes maven fail to add target classes that re generated by mvn install the job

namenode	hdfs
because on default hdfs namenode address is assumed to be hdfs localhost 8020 it needs to be changed

24745768
required	placeholder
one option i can suggest if possible just have a template web.xml with placeholder for values and during build for each environment have a step in build process that will substitute required values from required properties file of that environment

24745779
post	get
the curl command you posted performs a delete request and in this sense post and delete and get are alternative http request methods

24745779
post	get
there might be web services that accept some kind of delete command in the form of a post and or get request but that s not what curl is doing

24745857
width	height
i won t be able to use image.resize since that requires me to give both the new width and height

24745857
width	height
both the width and the height are provided in order to create the thumbnail

24745872

24745911
put	get
if you get a duplicate register request you can just put up a the same see your email click here to resend screen

24745916
post	get
but ultimately the baseline from the other post is if you don t want the sql database to be set in a specific way for your product and don t have any other registry tweek to do you might just get on of the auto-installer

24745917
for-loop	arrays
if you have a 2d arrays and want to work by columns a for-loop over columns is probably the best option

24746014
width	height
the outside border is made up of 6 lines whose coordinates need to depend on the height and width of the button that the template is applied to

24746014
width	height
alternatively if there is a better way to draw that 6 sided shape as a border that still allows dependency on the height and width i m open to that as well

24746036

post for create put for update etc

24746036

background-color	transparency
the default background-color of html is transparency

24746615
width	height
i see that image height and width can be defined in the actual html img tag in fact the way i read it it should be defined there

24746615
width	height
if i do not specify the height and width of an image in the html is the only problem that i am not conveying the actual image size to a non-visual user agent or are there other problems such as the browser can t allocate space for the imgs during page load

24746647
hide	show
i added a few changes to add a show hide button

but when i click on load more post the new post that get added to the page don t change the source of the image so that they are blurry

24746712
for-loop	loops
here since we are iterating a set of tuples by using dict.items with only the key in the for-loop loops should run for the same number of times as the first example since there are as many keys as key value pairs

would i need to put a count in the wordpress loop which would give each post a unique number which i could combine with a class

int	chars
thus the most general way to get an unicode code point value for a chars in a string at a specified index is char.converttoutf32 string s int index

24747411

min	max
i have tried settings axisx min and max but it only set the initial values

24747449
min	max	range	min	range	max
i also found xaxis#minrange but there is not an option like xaxis#maxrange so i can set min and max range to the same value to avoid zooming

24747456
folder	directory
the reportng folder is made and the index.html with the file is produced in my directory on my computer and the tests run and output the correct results

24747469

we would like to separate this input.csv into 2 files so that we can do the following step do averages on rows if 2 are the same where the max minus min in 17 1

24747469
min	max

if the 2 is the same and the max minus min in 17 1 put it into another file

24747469
min	max
outfile2.csv where max min in 17 -1- -3 2 1

24747469

24747763
subtract	add
how much you add subtract is up to you and changes the height of the greyback background

24747909
folder	directory
then it should iterate through the directory and if the directory contains an image file namely a jpeg as only jpegs may be uploaded to any given folder then that directory gets printed out in a table

24747962
ssms	sqlcmd
but the script does pretty much nothing apparently if i copy it to ssms and try to execute it in sqlcmd mode

the program uses sqlite3 api to open a data base and writes some data in it within a loop.i am running the program on two different machines a desktop ubuntu linux and an arm based embedded device running a custom built linux

24748054

after following a nicely made tutorial we have completed our game except for one thing in the tutorial s game you select a tower by clicking a button with the mouse however for our purposes we need it so the user presses a keyboard button to select the tower we already got it so when you press a button on the arcade box and it presses a key

24748149
post	get
there is also a better way to get the post category

24748153
google-chrome	firefox
the browser both firefox and google-chrome appears to be ignoring the attachment indicator because it changes url to the corresponding action and does not present a save as dialog

24748165
width	height	google-chrome	firefox
in both google-chrome and firefox there appears to be a limit due to the way the browsers process width and height through css

24748165
google-chrome	firefox
i found this post about it after using the inspect element in both google-chrome and firefox debugging tools

24748165
google-chrome	firefox
contrary to the post i found maximum values of 17895698 for firefox and 33554428 for google-chrome

24748190
setinterval	settimeout
however because you are loading an external script which might take time to load the condition might be false if the library is not loaded so it s better to use setinterval or settimeout to check whether jquery is loaded or not and if it s loaded then execute your code

24748194
width	height
when you code a ui using wpf avoid using width height etc

24748194
width	height
if you still have to define height width etc

24748195
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade express.js from 3.2.5 to 3.14.0 and used to output the versioning like this

the dialog pop-up and the image and text i specified is present but when i hit send the loading bar appears doesn t load then i am redirected to my app

24748204

preface traditionally many os x developers have implemented demo time-limited usage-limited shareware licensing schemes by encrypting private data the number of app launches and storing that data in files with obfuscated names usually within the preferences and or application support hierarchies

24748245
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade socket.io from 0.9.16 to 1.0.6 and used to output the versioning like this

24748271
width	height
everything is working fine but i was wondering if there were a way to alter the text s height without changing the text s width font width 100 font height 120

24748275
free	calloc
there has to be one call to free for each call to calloc

24748286
put	get
you can put your block into an html element as its value then get the value easily using javascript or jquery

24748308
for-loop	loops
turns out that i needed a do-while loops inside a for-loop to get this cleaner

24748310

if ssl or https capability is not shown by libcurl functions check using rcurl with https

24748436

i m not really familiar with obtaining data from an http post url but i do know how to get your xml data to your list view

24748574
versioning	upgrade
so either you have to manually handle each conflict yourself or you have to upgrade your ext versioning

24748592
gson	jackson
i would use jackson or gson to serialize pojos

24748599
converter	multibinding
secondly as you are using a hardcoded value -15 for first binding in the multibinding perhaps you can bind the y2 inline using converter parameter

24748616
hide	show
if all these hide and show calls are removed the buttons rendered in the correct location both of them

24748623

see that set d contains 1 which intersect with l1 we change c4 to point

24748669
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the code i ve written works fine in safari firefox and google-chrome

24748673
getter	setter
that object has the simple field private field integer tempvalue with the standard setter getter methods

24748678
put	get
this is not very efficient because whenever i want to save a new data i need to get the whole json array from the preference deserialize it add the data and then put the json array back

24748697
width	height
the problem is that you have set the background-size 100 for the header section this will cause both the width and the height of the background image to resize according to width

24748697
width	height
so when you resize the window the width of the background image changes and the height also changes accordingly

24748697
width	height
this will make the height of the background image constant and the width will respond to the container width changes

24748705
nsurl	nsstring
each table view cell will have the following all unique an nsurl for an audio file a uiimage an avasset and an nsstring

24748739
google-chrome	firefox
i tested with a few browser windows on a single machine ie firefox google-chrome and as far i as can see the state remains consistent between my clients

24748784
division	logarithm
note this is not the fastest way to accomplish a base-10 integer logarithm because it uses integer division which is inherently slow

24748789
button	checkbox
i am trying to on click of a yes radio button to fire off a check on a checkbox

24748790
multiplying	transpose
i want to multiplying a1 b1 and a2 b2 to form a 80 30 matrix the difference here is that a1 is defined as the transpose of a2 with 10000 rows in a1 but 80 row in a2

24748848
range	minimum
i m attempting to find the column that has the maximum range ie maximum value - minimum value

24748941
box-sizing	border-box
if you want to apply vertical padding to the inner div you need to use box-sizing border-box which may work as far back as ie8

24748968
post	get
once i am at work tomorrow i will post what i had to change in order to get it to work

24748975
multiplying	multiplication
mcm is an algorithm that computes the most efficient way to multiplying a set of matrices it s worth studying to learn more about matrix multiplication

24748980
min	max
here we use with so we don t have to write a bunch of times. and assuming the lenght of the chromosome is just the max end less the min start then

24749055
union	distinct
if t_a and t_d have non-overlapping data it doesn t make sense to use a union which does an implicit distinct

24749065
versioning	upgrade
as of this writing the best option to upgrade to the latest released versioning of atom is to check out the most recent tag and build it especially if you built it in the first place

24749066
mouseevent	mouseenter
void mouseenter mouseevent e

24749076
post	put
if however you have more data in your post along with the array you should put it all in a special model class in the controller like you do in your second example

24749082
google-chrome	firefox
i find there s no sound when using google-chrome but firefox has its own default alert sound

24749108
free	strdup
to store copies of the arguments in that array you d need to free those afterwards since strdup allocates memory for a new string

24749141
raft	paxos
in reading up on paxos and raft it seems like it must be doing leader election internally but i can t seem to find any comprehensible explanation -- i left my phd in my other pants

24749191
int	chars
because string - int - chars conversions are not cpu intensive i believe

24749192
hide	show
what i m trying to do is hide a component and then show it in response to user input

24749208
subtraction	addition
i am trying to write calculator program which performs simple mathematical calculation addition subtraction and so forth

24749219
division	modulo
i think you ll find that converting an integer into a string actually calls the modulo or division function quite a bit anyway so i suspect the string one will be slower

24749251
width	height
i m trying to create a custom linearlayout where the height is 80 of the width

24749254
versioning	upgrade
note whenever i have delayed upgrading in the past mysterious bugs would surface with every patch upgrade to the old versioning after a new versioning was available

24749258
next	except
also the next hlist release will have a monoid instance which works like yours except it isn t restricted to records with length 2

24749322
int	double
hence it does not work with primitive types such as double or int which are neither pointers nor objects

24749343
firefox	safari
microsoft edge and safari 9 both added support for the supports feature in fall 2015 firefox also -- so here is my updated version for you

24749343
firefox	safari
the previous css hack before edge and safari 9 or newer firefox versions

24749343
google-chrome	safari
or instead this one which goes back to google-chrome 22 and newer but safari as well.

24749343
google-chrome	safari
now follow up with this next couple i also created that targets safari 6.1+ only in order to still separate google-chrome and safari

24749343
google-chrome	safari
so if you put one of the chrome+safari hacks above and then the safari 6.1-7 and 8 hacks in your styles sequentially you will have google-chrome items in red and safari items in blue

24749363
mouseover	mouseout
i made a menu with divs and am using mouseover mouseout functions to append and remove a tongue like a description for each menu icon

24749400

for this method to work you should correctly implement comparator method of comparable interface

24749444
post	get
i know i m sending nothing worthwhile but if i actually manage to get something then i ll procceed to whatever i come up with to actually retrieve database post in an orderly manner

24749465
quicksort	mergesort
if you want to write your own sorting algorithm since you cannot include interfaces instead of using one provided you can try the commonly recursive and nlogn time quicksort and mergesort

24749471
translation	localization
i load it with tables of localization strings during .config of my module specify a default language and just use the translation filter when displaying questions and choices

24749487
folder	directory
however keep in mind that mod_dir and the directoryslash directive which is turned on by default will redirect all requests to directory folder that are missing the trailing slash to the same url with a trailing slash and this rule will create a redirect loop

24749576
restrict	shared
you can restrict the domains that can access your api key in your google api console so if you have a repository on github you can restrict it to your username like username.github.io but that will also block you it in your localhost unless you get a static ip then you can whitelist it locally so i recommend just keeping it to yourself and restricting if you want to shared your code with the world

24749588
implements	extends
the catch is if you want to add one more filter you got have a new class and implements the ifilter to that filter class and have it invoked from product.that is your extends but not modifying the class preserving open and closed principle

24749594
for-loop	arrays
to avoid repeat calculation for-loop in fibonacci method use integer arrays to store the fibonacci values and pass integer arrays instead of integer for small input number such as 16

24749647
post	get
ok after a lot of searching testing a nutsenses made by me i finally get to one point that the package that xamarin generate actually don t work for me so the solution was given by this blog post maded by andy ayre

24749768
versioning	upgrade
either install an older versioning of this gem or upgrade your database

24749905
mouseout	mouseleave
use mouseleave event instead of mouseout this will make sure child elements are detected as part of parent element and the event will only trigger when mouseleave element and it s child element

24749905
mouseover	mouseenter
similarly change mouseover event with mouseenter this event will only trigger if cursor enter element or its child

24749914
apache	nginx
for example if nginx apache is already running on my load balancer

24750176
swift	objective-c
you don t really say whether you are using swift or objective-c

24750176
min	max	range	min	range	max
another way you could do this is to determine a min and max y and pass that to a function to return a random range between those values

24750195
subtract	add
now if you want to add your fixed footer you would also need to subtract the footer s height from map-canvas when setting the height

24750196

24751038
public	protected
first of all lets take a look at standard password protected systems which have multilevel users ranging from super user administrator to the users you are calling public users or otherwise may be known as registered users members

24751108
width	height
width height you can set according to your requirement

24751178
width	height
so for instance if you give the value 0 0 here the rotation and scaling will happen around one of the corners of your texture the bottom left i believe whereas if you give the center width 2 height 2 the rotation and scaling would happen around the center of your texture this is probably what you want for any normal rotations

24751178
width	height
similarly these two values are the width and height of the actual region of the image file you are using in pixels

24751198

division	multiplication
if you try for example x 7 and look at the assembly output from gcc or msvc you will see that they don t actually do integer division they do multiplication and a shift using the same magic numbers and shifts as calculated from

sse	avx
both libraries will calculate the magic numbers and shifts for you at runtime for sse and avx integer division

24761160
for-loop	arrays
java gets really upset when you try to access past the end of an arrays example your inner arrays only contain 4 elements but your inner for-loop iterates until meaning you re accessing the 5th element in a 4-element arrays

24761216
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
this may not quite work as you want however - in order to ensure there s upper-case characters you ll have to match in a case-sensitive manner but your expressions for password and qwerty will only work if you match in a case-insensitive manner

24761800
uilabel	uitextview
use a uilabel instead of a uitextview and it should work

24761800

24762358
shapefile	geojson
2 when ready i translated the shapefile into geojson using ogr2ogr

24762384
superclass	subclassing
the problem is because you re declaring the fields in both the subclassing and superclass so the subclassing ends up with 2 copies of those fields eg enemy.currentx and basicenemy.currentx

24762394
put	get
both are working but when i put my logic in there i get null value for the currentfragment

24762405

24762501
maven	pom.xml
based on one of the comments i have looked in to the maven solution as we are using open shift - there is already some pre-generated pom.xml code which looks as follows

24762529
getter	setter
most of these functions are one liner which is pointless except for getter and setter but it is not the case you can create a function with the constructor logic if you need reusability

24762583
filtering	grouping
i need to filtering these grouping and drop all grouping which have no time greater than 5

the code above works fine in firefox however in google-chrome and all versions of i.e

24762795
for-loop	loops
a couple of caveats 1 doing a nested for-loop was making my head spin so i decided to just use 2010-11 for now and just loops through the institution name

24762802
notepad++	sublimetext
notepad++ supports this not sure about sublimetext but i would image it does also

24762855
regression	anova

here is a python example to test the module i also show a comparison against numpy scipy matplotlib

24763193
dplyr	tidyr
i also tried a dplyr + tidyr approach which looks like the following

24763209
int	double
generally speaking you probably wouldn t want anything more complicated than what is available as a constant you likely would only want primitives types like int and double or strings

24763216
for-loop	loops
unfortunetly this means when using a for-loop if there are just 1000 unique numbers and 5000 numbers to look for matches my loops can end up iterating 1000 5000 5000000 times

24763241
boost	allocator
of course in most cases there isn t any need for dynamically allocator boost thread objects in the first place

24763271
chr	multibyte	ord	chr
i just wrote a polyfill for missing multibyte versions of ord and chr with the following in mind

24763277
hex	binary
-- other math if you use binary oct or hex -- diff in unsigned signed values

24763291
swift	objective-c
if you know objective-c you should be able to translate that snippet in swift - let me know otherwise and i ll post it here

24763294
regression	anova
the error message means you need to specify a sub-model - for non-linear regression there s no obvious choice and so you ll need to do anova model3 model0 where model0 corresponds to a fit of another model - probably where one or more of your parameters are held constant

24763301
pop-up	dialog
i have an editable table and i would like to know how to pop-up a confirm dialog when the user submits his edits for a row

24763336
put	get	post	get	post	put
i have enabled cors on s3 and allowed get put and post requests

24763437

24763492
hide	show
i am trying to figure how to show or hide a list of ids and references filtered by name with an input text

24763521
hide	show
for example when people visit mydomain.com it should show ..loading... indicator in the middle of the page after the page starts to be visible then it should hide the loading indicator

24763536
swift	objective-c
-copy is not defined using property notation in foundation so you can t treat it as a property in swift even though you can use dot notation in objective-c

24763654
width	height
i have a fixed height and width for the grid to keep the listbox looking nice

24763655

24763883
crypt	hash
the passwords were hash using crypt as follows

24763883
hash	salt
while the salt part of the password is identical and indicating that the correct algorithm was chosen blowfish the second part differs from the stored hash

24763887
hide	show
your code is if count 2 hide buttons else if count 0 show message

24763898
post	get
as daniel roseman mentions order should not be significant between post or get request parameters

24763912
integer	unsigned
the problem is that you are dividing the difference in addresses by the size of the elemsz property which is probably a 32-bit unsigned integer in other words sizeof returns 4 regardless of your element size

24763919
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine on google-chrome not on firefox 30.0 and i can t see why

24763928
for-loop	loops
answering the question you asked without changing the datastructure around there s no real faster way of looking without a loops and checking every element and doing a dictionary lookup for each one - but you can push loops down to the python runtime instead of using python s for-loop

24763971
gruntjs	package.json
the compass processing should be all setup for you in gruntjs as well as compass contrib in your package.json file

when writing all the values to the console to see where the problem is in firefox and ie i m getting different values than what i m seeing in google-chrome

24764170
for-loop	arrays
i tried writing the following function but the problem with using splice in a for-loop is that splicing will change the length of the arrays and i end up trying to access undefined elements

24764171
int	boolean
where the gluniform1i method takes an int as a uniform location and a boolean

24764177
ssl	https
i already bought the ssl certificate from bluehost and they say it s now installed and told me to change the url on a working page to https to double check and thats working fine

24764177
ssl	https
i thought i still had to implement the ssl certificate through a plugin like the wordpress https plugin and would be able to do so only for that single page leaving the rest of the website as is

24764183
oncreate	findviewbyid
in oncreate method because findviewbyid call after setting content layout

24764187
oncreate	setcontentview	oncreate	findviewbyid	setcontentview	findviewbyid
move these initializations to oncreate and the findviewbyid calls after setcontentview

24764210
apache	nginx
the actual serving program on the server eg apache nginx node.js etc.

24764210

24764442
post	get
http client libraries like libcurl gives you the ability to programmatically get and use cookies and do post requests so you should in principle at least be able to mimic in your program what is happenning when you browse such sites

24764456
google-chrome	firefox
how do popular desktop applications like google-chrome firefox evernote etc

24764491
debian	linux
i am using a raspberry-pi so my os is raspbian or debian linux

24764502

before meddling with partitions my advice is to ensure you have the correct indexes in place they are being hit by your queries no table scans and your server is appropriately resourced i.e got enough fast disk and ram and you have tuned your server caches to suit your queries

24764520
width	height
i ve subclassed a progressbar when i try to get the size of the same text with the same font i get distinct values textrenderer.measuretext gives me a rounded value of 13 height and 300 width while graphics.measurestring gives me a very precise height of 13 xxxxxx and a minor width of 275 xxxxxxx

24764549
versioning	upgrade
since the python packages are suffixed with the versioning number they don t seem to upgrade

24764549
versioning	upgrade
as andy mentioned in his answer packages are pinned to a specific versioning hence it is not possible to upgrade packages through pip command

24764551
min	max
instead of calculating the min max of the complete area you do it in multiple steps

24764551
min	max
- calculate the min max of 2x2 blocks 16x16 blocks per area

24764551
min	max
- you have now the min max of the complete area

24764553
post	get
if you still get an error please post that as well

put	get
to get current time in milliseconds then u can put this in to contentvalue to insert it in database

24764628

it seems #pragma pack 1 is only allowing the boolean to be packed into single bytes by themselves instead of words but not the boolean with the unsigned int at all

24765685

hash	salt
when the user connects the form is given the number called a salt the form packs the salt with the typed password in a predefined encoding such as utf8 and produce a hash on that and transmits that on the wire as base64 for example i mean your password field could be just a text field containing that base64 encoded hash

the reason for the salt is to hugely slows down attack based on pre-built dictionaries of md5 or sha hash being matched against your database of passwords if it happens to be downloaded by hackers

i was trying to work out how to access use fields methods of an abstract-class in any subclass and i came across this example on the web

24789322
super	abstract
there is no constructor given in the abstract super classes

24789322
subclass	abstract-class
when an abstract method is specified in the abstract-class doesnt that just tell the compiler the method must be specified by any subclass

24789327

there is no constructor given in the abstract super classes

24789444
subclass	abstract-class
when an abstract method is specified in the abstract-class doesnt that just tell the compiler the method must be specified by any subclass

24789444
superclass	subclassing
the annotation allows the compiler to verify that the subclassing is actually overriding a method in the superclass

24789454
chef	god
turns out this was a chef god issue.

24789521
width	height
the width and height of the svg are fixed

24789556

where defaultfunc is a function that goes from int to boolean

24789600
disk	ram
i have read a few posts about this topics but still i am not sure if matlab 64bit on mac os can use the disk space for allocating the matrix or need everything in ram and anyway if the use of such a big portion of disk space can make things almost unusable

24789601
int	chars
that was a good idea unfortunately you are trying to parse a string with non-numeric chars as an int

int	chars
i have a large string of binary data and need to pull 32 of those chars starting at a specific index and store them as an int

24789768

post	get
i can echo the post variable that is being passed in fine but once i try to actually call the method i get a 500 internal server error

24789802
getter	setter
you can see all getter setter here

24789802
getter	setter
there s no getter setter useful for holding a string value

24789813
getter	setter
you could create a myjpanel class that extends jpanel and is identical except including a string field with getter setter

24789819
post	get
you can get directly the json post

24789830
ssid	wlan
however we would like to remove the existing ssid profile from the system which isnâ t an issue with simply using â œnetsh wlan delete profile nameâ

png	ico
the root of the site works for an ico files named favicon.ico but not for png or other file types

24790141
swift	objective-c
it would be interesting to know how performances compare though using a fully swift solution and bridging to objective-c instead

24790171
width	height
setting width and height is mandatory for jquery flot if i doesn t set width or height the chart won t appear anymore

24790240
installation	upgrade
you probably installed it with sudo apt-get install ipython but you should upgrade using sudo pip install ipython --upgrade and then making sure that the previous installation was removed by running sudo apt-get remove ipython

24790279
width	height
knowing the approximate width which becomes height after rotation of div i can compensate the difference by adding br s around this div so content above and below gets pushed accordingly

24790315

use2files macro is supposed to switch between using either 2 file descriptors to the same file which get duped to stdout and stderr respectivly or 1 file descriptor which gets duplicated both to stdout and stderr

24790397
stdout	stderr
showing pretty clearly stdout stderr are competing with their writes over the same file

24790451
werkzeug	gevent
edit - gevent.monkey.patch_all - run at the wsgy.py script file - automatically patches the threadlocals to become greenlet locals so this alternative using werkzeug is not needed for gevent or gunicorn with gevent workers - if somehow you use greenlets without gevent you may need this solution

24790470
ionic	angular
ionic uses angular so this should be included inside a controller

24790490
for-loop	arrays
additionally you will need to stop your for-loop halfway through the arrays before x reaches s.length 2 or else the second half will swap the values back to their original locations

24790497
put	get
since put get operation usually takes o 1 unless there is a collision which would require o n when that happens

24790534
openrowset	openquery
you can t use variables with openquery openrowset

24790544
post	get
change the method on the form from post to get and that should resolve your problem

24790562
junit	easymock
i am writing a test using easymock and junit that should be fairly simple

inject	interceptor
the right way to use a session in action class is to implement sessionaware that inject via servletconfig interceptor a session map to the action bean property

24790617

the approach i ve chosen so far is to create an a4j jsfunction for each list of numbers that have to be loaded and use jquery to fire these functions when the document is ready

24790620
fast-forward	merge
git will never perform a merge on the remote unless it s a fast-forward merge meaning only one branch has advanced so it requires you to pull and do the merge locally

24790686
int	chars
if you have some sort of small-ish limit on the range of chars that can be included in the then you could potentially encode the whole thing in a single int long which would be a substitute for the i mentioned above

24790689
width	height
you know you have 8 buttons so you can use math to figure out the width height of the panel

24790693
lxml	celementtree
celementtree is a part of the standard distribution lxml has to be installed separately

24790740
gruntjs	grunt-contrib-watch

24790838
vim	emacs
my solution is to set the key binding to emacs while keeping editor vim

24790907
junit	powermockito	junit	mockito
junit mockito and hamcrest plugins of the powermockito feature and not

24790947
jar	war
war files are web archives meant to run inside a web container think tomcat jboss etc - probably you want an executable jar file

24790964
stdout	stderr
in your example the strings written are the exact same length so the write to stdout exactly overwrites the preceeding write to stderr

24790972

i d like to know how to debugging profiling this scenario so i can see if that is the reason it is crashing

24791164
post	get
perhaps you only populated the viewbag in your post method but not your get method

24791164
post	get
thus i believe you are not populating the view bag either on the get and or the post controller method

24791202
pull	push
there are even other messaging patterns apart from pub sub you can use req resp or push pull

24791203
uitableview	reloaddata
edit i change reuseidentifier to tell uitableview s cellforrowatindexpath to recreate all cells and then call reloaddata method

24791207

children	parent
now when you destroy the parent record the children will get their sync_type_id attributes nullified

24791253
dictionary	map
my idea was to use a map dictionary that given valuetypeenum returns the bitmask to use and the offset for access to the right field of the structure but i think it s a little tricky and not so elegant

24791273
width	height
2 the div with the scroll needs to have height and width specifiers

24791273
width	height
3 the height and width specifiers need to be in the same style element with the overflow specifier

post	get
if you just wqant to have an image asigned to a post check the thumbnails feature of wordpress that let you get the post image from outside the content

24791404
min	max
a common cause of audio pop is due to the rendering process not starting stopping sound at the zero cross over point assuming min max of -1 to +1 cross over would be 0

24791404
min	max	range	min	range	max
if an audio rendering process fails to start stop from to this zero the transducer is being asked to do the impossible namely instantaneously go from its resting state to some non-zero position in its min max movement range or visa versa if you get a pop at the end

24791417
getter	setter
for some things it s supposedly faster to use a getter and setter if they only access a field

24791417
getter	setter
always use getter and setter

24791433
queue	fifo
however i already planned for this there is meant to be one queue which is fifo which is fine but this worker thread non gui is competing against the gui because there are some gui events that need to go to the db too and they are banging into each other

24791439
chown	chmod
i thought maybe it is a permission thing so i ran chmod and chown according to the laravel documentation

24791454
super	implements
i m guessing i could use inheritance and pass a concrete instance of a class that implements myinterface that is a super class of all the types i want to render but i really would like to just pass the interface to the template if this is possible

24791483
uilabel	nsstring
based on the comments it s likely email is a uilabel property not an nsstring

24791496
crossfilter	dc.js
i m using dc.js and crossfilter to create 3 rowcharts from a csv

24791506
children	parent

24791609
versioning	upgrade
i had to upgrade to latest adt versioning 23 to see google play sdk appear as an option

24791624
hash	salt
there is numerous was to implement this but if you want to keep it simple and own the process you could implement your own authentication method which on a successful authentication you could build a hash value from their password and secret salt which could be returned to the user as a cookie etc

24791648
daemons	launchd
note this question is not about launchd the docker daemons itself using socket activation which is already supported but about starting individual containers on demand

i would like it if the editor s toolbar only show if users click focuses on the textarea box and then hide the toolbar when they click away

24791709
min	max
how do i save this plot without having the savefig inside the function definition and that is because i need to change the min and max temperature parameters

24791732
mouseleave	mouseenter
take it further still by using .hover and .toggleclass and you then can use one function for both mouseenter and mouseleave

24791741
htmlpurifier	tidy
if you want to make your site secure also you certainly have to use an html purifier like htmlpurifier tidy etc

24791743
post	get
should have been a post to users rather than a get from login

24791743
post	get
and then the get which is actually a post just need to changed the method name

24791750
post	get
should i have a routes.pl file where i can listen for all get post requests and based on those requests call the appropriate .pm method and return a tt template basically acting like a front controller

24791756
dateadd	datepart
what i cannot seem to wrap my head around is how to use that seed date 01 02 1970 with datediff dateadd datepart etc

24791791
google-chrome	firefox
the following works correctly in every browser tested except for ie9 firefox google-chrome ie8 10 and 11 work fine

24791873
crossover	mutation
first you need to understand the ga and best way to do that is to play around with the parameters crossover rate mutation rate no

24791971
put	get
it seems that the div s that get wrapped around the select by the selectmenu widget are not being put in the right place

24791983
maven	pom.xml
following in pom.xml if it is maven

24791996
integer	fractions
perhaps the timestamp could be there too in element zero maybe using spreadsheet conventions integer part is days since 1970 or 1900 and fractions part is portion of the day so noon .5

24792018
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
and after some tests with firefox ie google-chrome safari i ended up with this snippet

24792123
width	margin
width of #footercontainer i set to 100 and left margin 10px

24792140
google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari
opera including devices such as the nintendo dsi or wii webkit-based such as safari including ios android s browser kindle 4 s browser epiphany and midori webkit is a derivative of konqueror s khtml engine but mac os x does not share the kio architecture so the implementations are different and webkit chromium-based such as google-chrome

24792193
width	height
i needed the image height width to scale them appropriately later

24792227
pull	push
sourcetree is an app that will make your life easier i personally like using it because you can easily detect issues like this sourcetree will show you that your local copy is not in sync with remote and will offer you to push pull respectfully

24792257
spaces	delimiter
i don t even know where to start with white spaces delimiter column separated values

24792297

you should store this kind of information somehow encrypted on the user s machine and load it into variables or better yet release two versioning with the option to upgrade

24792310
decoder	encoder
step 3 now apply the tutorial command concat demuxer is more reliable it doe s not break the encoder decoder just copy

in order to subclass uinavigationbar you must define the intptr constructor in your derived class and instantiate the uinavigationcontroller using the public uinavigationcontroller type navigationbartype type toolbartype constructor

24792461
vbscript	vb6
it s vbscript but vbscript works in vb6

24792470
qtcpsocket	qtcpserver
i was thinking about creating a qtcpsocket variable on the server and sending information to the client the same way i send information to the sever but that seems wrong because then the client would be behaving like a server complete with a qtcpserver variable on the client

24792584
hash	md5
when people say md5 hash are one-way they really mean that when you have outputs which are chosen from a sufficiently large input space then there are no known methods to reverse them efficiently

post	get
consider this real world example which is code written to make get and post calls to the same rest service endpoint via the rest client builder grails plugin

24792649
post	get
i dislike the duplication in that the header and content type setup is identical but am not sure how to refactor the common pieces out given that they are calling methods on the closure that is being passed to the get or post method call

24792659
put	get
what i am not understanding is how all this fits together where do i put the php scripts how do i access them how do i allow and connect to the webserver to get the data out of the database

24792710
int	chars
this only works because batch s poor usage of variables not designating between int chars floats strings etc naturally

24792801
versioning	upgrade
in the problem environment we had recently upgrade the versioning of java

24792881
implements	extends
extends both an abstract base class and a class derived from object works as you would expect if you you haven t implements all abstract methods and properties you get an error

24792881
implements	extends
strangely replacing the object-derived class with an class that extends exception allows you to create instances of classes which do not implements all the required abstract methods and properties

24792882
postgresql	mysql
i have only used python with mysql but postgresql doesn t seem too different

24792903
put	get
credit for the core of msys2 lies with cygwin provides etc fstab you might think to use that to enable you to put mingw 32 64 elsewhere and to an extent you can get away with that but i strongly urge you not to do this as it will just result in problems

24792916
winpcap	libpcap
assuming the packets weren t actually delivered to your machine out of order you can avoid them by doing your capturing on an operating system that doesn t deliver packets out of order to the capture mechanism libpcap winpcap uses

prepare	execute
to make a variable table name like you describe you ll have use format an sql statement as as string and then use prepare and execute to run it

24793097
division	multiplication
you can mess with a call to int together with multiplication and division to shift the decimal point back and forth or you can use a string substitution as shown below which will work for anything less than 1e15 and greater than 1e-4

24793098
prepare	execute
the idea for concat prepare execute was taken from

24793145

24793213
public	protected
i don t know if what you are trying to do is a viable plan but regardless if you need to access an inherited protected method then you should consider creating a public wrapper method that outside objects can call and that calls your protected method method

24793225
width	height
to elaborate what i really want to do is have the collectionview expand and resize as the window is resized and have it take up the same width as the tableviewcell and depending on the number of items in the collection view resize the height of the outlineview hence determine the height of the outlineview s row

24793228

note that pydev now requires java 7 and at least eclipse 3.8 if it s hard to get things up to date you may want to check liclipse which gives you an eclipse standalone with pydev bundled

24793307
post	get
you should pass a dictionary object to the post function the data argument only in the get method you should pass a query string

24793315
post	put
here is my whole code i would post a small concise code example but i can t seem to put the finger on the problem

24793332
width	height
make sure width and height are not constrained

24793349
mouse	keyboard
i have not done this since long ago in nextstep and seem to remember that you could create objects which could be made part of the event loop and could generate events that were co-equal with those from mouse and keyboard events

24793349
mouse	keyboard
i need this to happen without disturbing the mouse and keyboard events although it would be nice if i gave the udp check a higher priority

24793371
put	get
when you create a class in eclipse you have the option to add an superclass when you create a class however in as you can only name the class and you have to put the methods manually by writing for instance extends broadcastreceiver and then press ctrl+i to get the method list

put	get
however if i try to put the datepicker and the tooltip on the same input element i get

this is not a nice solution a recommanded way is creating a worker to do all the job and then use qobject movetothread as said in qthread document

24793889
union	distinct
after i finally figured out what it was exactly you were trying to do it is pretty much similar to your version the union in the first subquery is going to basically select distinct values which will slow things down

24807214
min	max	range	min	range	max
i want to draw the y-axis so that it is identical in each plot i draw regardless of the data range max min etc that is used

24807232
hide	show
this basic idea of the code at the moment is hide the selected div and show another

24807242
implements	extends
now it s easy to add more commands later by simply extends the command abstract class and implements the runinternal method

24807263
width	height
you can set the height and width of the plot area as well but this doesn t include the scales

24807346

you would need to implement some kind of tree structure where the children nodes keep track of its parent

24807346
children	parent
this is a simple implementation of a tree that keeps track of children parent

24807349

width	height
i know the math to get the height from the width is h w x 0.5625

24807570

stdout	stderr
the stdout and stderr of phantomjs is being assigned to pipe_cmd_out but you close that stream with pipe_cmd_out.close then try to read pipe_cmd_in which isn t defined

24807656
stdout	stderr
and rather than double up the output for stdout and stderr into one variable i d probably use

24807668
ant	maven
personally i do prefer the maven way but if i have to deal with migrations of an existing app which wasn t mavenized in thinking to begin with i would start with the ant run plugin to just import stuff to ant and use the maven assembly plugin to set up which parts to release

24807735
hide	show
i attached a link below to an article explaining how to only show menu items to guests and have them hide when users are logged in

24807750

24807826
agda	idris
at the end of the spectrum you find full-dependent languages and proof assistants such as agda idris or coq where pattern matching on a piece of data can mean accepting an arbitrary logical proposition as true in a certain branch of your program

24807859
int	chars
because ascii value for a is 0x61 and c take chars as int

24807866

24807958
stdout	fflush
so in order to solve this problem you will have to fflush stdout just before forking

24807958

i create a page with dimensions width x maxheight and a graphics2d template with dimensions width x height

24808016
wildfly	jboss
my code is all right and it is the jboss wildfly s fault

24808018
equals	gethashcode
you can use your own type or even use the site itself with an appropriate override of gethashcode equals or an implementation of

24808073
superclass	subclassing
thus it can be defined separately for the subclassing which will prevent the defined superclass method being called and avoid the recursion

24808088
hash	salt
if there is a better method of salt hash i will take that advice as well

24808140
hide	show
this image button should be able to hide or show corresponding inner table

24808141
equals	gethashcode
to test type and index you ll need to either override gethashcode equals or create a custom equality comparer

24808209
children	parent
this parent will notably have the responsibility for handling its children deletion

24808217
onchange	onblur
if we wanted to grab the entire updated input we could just use the onchange or onblur events

24808593
ubuntu	debian
if you tell us which distribution you are using ubuntu debian ... maybe we can help

24808631
children	parent
i guess you could write a custom observablelist for example the parent children have a similar behavior

24808638

folder	directory
which prevents emails sent from my app from displaying the containing images the images are sourced from a folder outside the document root projected via a virtual directory

24808695
width	height
either visibility hidden height width 0 or are better alternatives

24808706

24808726
stdout	stderr
this is the docker-recommended solution for software that writes its log messages to stdout stderr

24808726
stdout	stderr
some software however does not write log messages to stdout stderr

24808726
udp	tcp
if the app accepts a syslog endpoint in its configuration configure the host s syslog daemon to listen over tcp and or udp on the docker bridge network and use that endpoint

jquery that hide and show the the content

24809388
hide	show
instead of ul li and div i ended up using for ul li and for div because i will have to show and hide the tab from code behind

24809466
post	get
i tried post cookie get session but i got nothing

24809484
javassist	cglib
alternatively you could check out javassist or cglib if you don t work with interfaces but with classes

24809508
stdout	fflush
by default stdout is not fflush to the screen until it sees a newline n character

24809522
min	max
place a tnumberbox on a mobile form and set min property to 18 and the max property to 65

24809530
put	get
if you have a pre-defined set of values you want to choose from randomly then put them in an array and use rand to get the index into the array

24809546
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
read more about customizing amazon-web-services resources with elastic beanstalk here

24809568
stdout	stderr
also note the newline i added the message asking for input may not appear until after you ve written a newline to stdout stdout is usually line buffered and so is usually a terminal a better alternative would be fprintf stderr enter name

24809568
stdout	stderr
as stderr is unbuffered and this output shouldn t really go to stdout anyway.

24809663
csv	tsv
i don t know what you mean by columns btw if it s a csv or tsv file check the csv module in the standard lib but arknave s comment is the right answer

24809723
uiview	subviews
i have a uiview that has 3 custom subviews whose class is called for now lvstemp and that represent nodes in a tree

24809794
octal	decimal
for the interpreter this is not a decimal hexa or octal valid value

24809821
for-loop	arrays
after i initialize it i will fill it with a for-loop that runs through an existing arrays of strings

24809835
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in google-chrome and ie but not in firefox and i can t think why

24809846
sys	subprocess
this version works interrupting the top-level program correctly prints sys exit and output of the subprocess is printed line by line

24809855
jboss	glassfish
on jboss forum i found solution which works for me on glassfish

24809871
hide	show
binds onchange to selector gets current value hide all options show the related ones

24809914
cos	sin
i have a stream of data sin cos coming into a limited resource fpga

24809914
cos	sin
by limited i mean i cannot afford to instantiate a massive block-ram to store an entire cycle of sin and cos data

24809940
submit	submission
when i submit the form i am getting it returning submission array instead of the actual unique id from my db

24809941
int	chars
edit to get around the implementation detail that sorts int before strings one could use the following key function this will however cause the chars to remain unsorted

24809960
google-chrome	firefox
obviously google-chrome and firefox seem to implement the file api differently handle the abort differently

24809960
google-chrome	firefox
ps i only care for google-chrome and firefox

24809960
google-chrome	firefox
edit here is the final solution that works nicely in google-chrome and firefox

24809977
hide	show
i have a list of this html code in my page - the requirement is that on click of .cta-button i want the .title div to hide and .alternate-input div to show both only from the same parent - the jquery i have written for it triggers all the .alternate-input divs on the page to show

24809997
serializable	deserialization
as i understand the model manager s get_by_natural_key is used in deserialization and the natural_key is used in serializable

24810000
min	max
i believe that i have to modify the css the media min and max width but is not working properly

24810019
swift	objective-c
in swift there is no language-sanctioned mechanism for print description like for objective-c so while you can type po self unless self is an objective-c type you will pretty much see the same thing that p self or even frame variable self would tell you - which is entirely based on the lldb data formatters mechanism

24810037
google-chrome	firefox
my problem is it will pop up a failed alert window if i open the html file in ie or google-chrome but a successful window if i open the html in firefox

24810056
width	height
the issue stems from you setting the divs to the same width and height the second div is covering the first div so clicks won t fall through

24810089
profiling	benchmarking
using a profiling is often more appropriate than benchmarking but it seems to be even more tricky

24810107
int	chars
i m trying to draw a texture from raw data which elements are unsigned chars or unsigned int each 3 subsequent elements rgb representing the pixel data

24810107
width	height
what i want is to display this rgb raw data width 640 height 480 on my phone s screen 1920 1080

24810132
switching	screens
however if i just go to hardware - device - ios 6.1 to switching the ios version to 6.1 instead of 7.1 it will launch the home screens so it must be an issue with the 7.1 simulator that came with the fresh xcode install 5.1.1 and i got the ios 6.1 simulator using the xcode downloads

24810174
stdout	stderr
some programs write to stdout and also stderr

24810174
stdout	stderr
to build on tichodroma s code the following prints stdout to stdout stderr to stderr merges the two streams and captures both outputs correctly

24810218
width	height
now you can init the app with any width height and your whole view will be stretched scaled down to it

24810288
multiplying	add
as an exercise change expparser adding a calculator class with unimplemented methods for mathematical operators add multiplying divide and so on and then change the rules to use those methods instead of the operators

24810340
min	max
this is code that i use can someone tell me how to make that input have min and max value

24810340
min	max
i want to set min value to be 0 and max 10

24810344
min	max
i m trying to generete random integer starting with min and ending with max which i enter in alert dialog

24810353
centos	linux
both server are linux centos and i m working on my localhost using windows

24810361
box-sizing	border-box
a simple solution would be to use box-sizing border-box

24810366
slideup	slidedown
if i understand the question correctly the closest thing is the jquery slideup or slidedown methods

24810373
multiplying	add
as to mixing convert the bytes to pcm then add yes simple arithmetic then check for out of range numbers in the sums may need to scale inputs a bit to keep all sounds within range--scaling can be done by multiplying each pcm value by a scaling fraction

24810429
prepare	execute
you are hoping to speed up your software by caching results yet your valid subroutine does connect prepare execute every time it is called

24810460
converter	multibinding
i am trying to use stringformat instead of a converter to present some text in a devexpress grid column header sourced from a multibinding

24810472
ng-show	ng-class
several simple ways are ng-show ng-class or ng-if

24810534
swift	objective-c
the solution works for both objective-c and swift projects

24810596
min	max
the functions min and max are more succinct

24810599
getter	setter
this means all of the code that you write involving doctrine entities and getter setter functions are a high-level abstraction of what doctrine actually queries mysql for with as statements and highly unique names along with fetching the id of objects instead of the actual object which would only get loaded lazily.

24810599
getter	setter
the doctrine generate entities command will happily create your getter setter functions for you automatically but the database schema isn t touched until you run doctrine schema update from your console as per this documentation

24810613
clang	llvm
it turns out that some of llvm clang libraries use _libcpp_begin_namespace_std and _libcpp_end_namespace_std definitions instead of using namespace std

24810613
pop-up	dialog
in the add dialog that pop-up just put it in the name input field and press ok

24810613
cout	cin
this will also add many of the missing std namespace functions like cout cin etc

24810642
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this works fine on google-chrome and safari in os x but not firefox

24810664
domxpath	domdocument
got my turducken of a curl instance inside a domdocument inside a domxpath

24810697
implements	extends
i looked into other solutions but they were using custom classes that extends surfaceview and implements runnable

24810701
width	height
so in libgdx i flipped the orthographiccamera with cam.settoortho true width height but this obviously ends up in drawing all my textures upside down

24810728
comparator	comparable
you can just implement comparable interface on your patient class and implement the necessary comparator method

24810787

24810804
post	get
to get the php code to post to your facebook wall

24810811
pull	push
your local git repository determines where to push pull based on remotes

24810811
pull	push
you can now push and pull as you did before and it will use your fork instead of the originally cloned repository

24810819
hide	show
i have read that the display can t be called in this animate fonction and that just the opacity can be called but that does not solve my problem beacause a hidden ellement is stil visible for a screen reader so i presume i need to use the show and hide functions but how can i have the same testing

24810824

24810890
children	parent
parent updates can have many children

24810896
put	get
if i put 1+1 i get a value.

24810910
for-loop	loops
the last two loops which calls the parsing method should be inside your first for-loop

24810947
cos	sin
i m further assuming that sin cos are measurements of the sin and cos values that can be converted to x y coordinates

24810947
cos	sin
if this is the case then the extreme values of sin and cos should correspond to points on the axes of the ellipse

24810947
cos	sin
that should result in four sin cos pairs

24810958
google-chrome	firefox
this works in internet explorer and google-chrome but firefox doesn t display these tags for some reason

24811417
width	height
you can absolute center just in css but you need to define a height and a width for the div you are trying to absolute center

24811420
google-chrome	firefox
msie11 + google-chrome + firefox

24811463
width	height
i think the problem is that you re declaring the height and width of the canvas element in two different places the tag itself and the css file

24811463
width	height
the style attribute gives the canvas a height of 713px and a width of 475px

24811463
width	height
the height and width can be changed either by changing the style attribute or using the

24811463
width	height
using this code will override the height and width of the canvas as defined in the style attribute of your canvas element

24811479
jboss	glassfish
well i don t understand all the question but i use birt with glassfish and jboss you need to configure a jdbc in your server i suppose you already have done that then you have to change your datasources erase all and use a jndi url with the name of your jdbc for example if you create a datasource jdbc test this is the jndi url

uiviewcontroller	uiwindow
you need to set the windowlevel of the uiwindow which contains that uiviewcontroller

24811505
inherited	properties
an object literal the curly braces inherited from object and so the constructor properties will be the same as object s unless you override it with your own value like in zzzzbov s answer

24811505
inherited	properties
inheriting from an object that inherited from function gives you the constructor properties you are looking for without having to define it yourself

24811511
int	chars
such as if the structs in c# and c# have a very small difference such as a chars field in c# struct is mapped to a int field in c++ you program will just crash and no details about it

your only problem is that you aren t updating the totwei variable when you create a voxel.you will need to subtract the value of the voxel from the remaining desired weight and add it to the total weight

24811671
for-loop	arrays
you can do this by following code it will intialize the two dimensional arrays with same default value which in this case is same instance of myclass object and this is not that great.in case you need different objects you need to make for-loop to intialize the objects.but in case for same instance the following code will work.this code is better for primitive type like int or structs string but not for classes .but in case i am showing the syntax for two dimensional arrays intialization

24811709
width	height
there are some variables that haven t been set like doc width and height

24811746

hash	hmac
there might be an additional secret key used with hmac eg. but that is external to a base bcrypt hash

24812011

post	get
create a init action hook and manage all the post and get parameters in the callback function

24813823
swift	objective-c
it s made a little confusing by the naming involved in this case - the first part request is a label that tells swift which init function to call - in this case it s mapping back to the objective-c initwithrequest method

24813851
int	chars
nul is different from null because null the null-pointer is cast as a pointer as so it the same size as other pointers where as nul is a null-character and either the size of a chars or int

24813872
lxml	celementtree
so basically is there a way to properly indent and whitespace using celementtree or should i just throw up my hands and go learn how to use lxml

ethernet	wireless
this way i can tell what type of interface it is ethernet wireless loopback tunnel etc. whether it is active or not and sooo much more

24814045
free	malloc	free	realloc	realloc	malloc
on the other hand if you want an array with adjustable size in c you ll have to use malloc realloc keep track of the size keep track of the lifetime call free at the right time worry about dangling pointers which is an awful lot easier to handle in objective-c

24814062
sudo	passwd
when run with sudo yes ansible will run with --rsh sudo ssh which will break if the remote sudo configuration requires a passwd and or tty

24814117
width	height
you can try as setting the object s width as width auto and then set object s height as your wish for example height 100px

24814117
width	height
and width auto is usually used for landscapes and height auto for profile pics this tip is not any standard but based on my experience

24814120
box-sizing	border-box	width	border-box
try width 100 and box-sizing border-box

24814147
jpql	hql
i meant something like this in hql i m using jpql in this example if you prefer jpa interface

24814194
ng-show	ng-hide
if you modify your ng-show and ng-hide attributes to react to this flag on each item i guess you would reach your goal

24814224
post	put
if each post had a show page i know that i would put post on the show action and then make it an instance variable but since the each post needs a separate comment dialogue box i can t make it that general

24814280
min	max
also you can use the math library s min and max methods to do it all on one line if you so desire

24814299
apache	nginx
since i am running php-fpm as nginx user therefore i had to change group from apache to nginx on var lib php session

24814330
min	max	range	min	range	max
create formulas to get min and max values from the range

24814330
min	max
link the subreport parameters which will be the sp parameters to the formulas in the main report for min and max daterange values

24814340
min	max
another way to do that would be to make it a helper method calculatesumplusdifference int max int min and then use it

24814347
put	get
if you need to use it for a distributed application as the users might put in values greater than the number of split elements or get delimiters wrong etc

24814401
uiview	subviews
both subviews are plain uiview s with a frame and backgroundcolor

24814435
hide	show
you could use direction to show a scrollbar that goes opposite direction or use float right on content to hide it on the left side

24814452
children	parent
adding float left to the final one prevents the enclosing parent container from wrapping all the children and it loses its height

24814477
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
in testing with various browsers google-chrome firefox safari phonegap- ios the behavior seems to be that the watchposition function is called once and the html is correctly updated but it is never called again unless i do something like switch to another tab and back minimize the browser and bring it back up etc

24814482
for-loop	loops
i have it in a for-loop but whenever loops inserts the new member into the list it is automatically destroyed right after i m assuming because it is out of scope

24814492
post	put
i just register the routes and consume the api methods post put delete etc

24814512
allocator	stl
although this is fairly obvious if you read all the replies what wasn t clear was the way these allocator are passed to the object which isn t like most of the stl allocator i ve used before which take an allocator type not instance as part of the type specification

24814516
getter	setter
when you do that the compiler creates an instance variable named instancevariable if it doesn t exist yet and generates code for the setter and getter as needed

24814516
getter	setter
there is one exception if you implemented all the required methods both setter and getter or just the getter for a readonly proper yourself and you don t use synthesize then no instance variable will be created

24814516
getter	setter
if you implement both setter and getter or just the getter of a readonly property you may not need an instance variable

24814611
hide	show
as i said i d like to be able to click on a link show the div then hide the div again when the user clicks outside of it

24814631
equals	tostring
the same result can be obtained also by comparing tostring of each map as you suggested but using equals is a more intuitive approach

24814634
equals	tostring
tostring itself uses an iterator just like equals but is a more inefficient approach

24814634
equals	tostring
note warning your question and my answer assumes that classes implementing the map interface respect expected tostring and equals behavior

24814634
equals	tostring
tostring fails miserably when comparing a treemap and hashmap though equals does compare contents correctly

24814656
google-chrome	firefox
when an html5 video audio element is served from a source that does not support byte range requests currently in the latest versions of google-chrome and firefox at least the associated media element to the tag seems to have an empty seekable timeranges object

24814667
post	put
you put a name in the url doen t have to be unique as it gets given a unique prefix set the content type and post the file in the body

24814682

when an event is called in bukkit the listener are called from each class under eventhandler

24815071
post	get
the page renders fine but when i try to post to save the updates the controller s post action does not get hit and the page reloads with the old values visible

24815075
next	except
everything seems to work correctly except the part where it stops if a user enters a number in two or more textfields the loop is working it just does not insert the next textfield value into the database this is the scenario

24815097
listview	gridview
the point is to use the new controls - listview gridview and semanticzoom

24815157
subclass	abstract-class
it is an abstract-class so i have a subclass of it level1 in the case it is the one in the image

24815160
jaydata	breeze
for this i hav looked into ms sync framework jaydata and now looking at breeze

24815171
draggable	droppable
i want to have it so that when i drag a draggable object a onto a droppable object b the drop event for b is triggered and a is reverted to its original position

24815172
packets	pcap
what i m trying to do is create a web app to run on the bro server that allows me to send a get containing tcpdump filter information such as source ip source port destination ip etc which will then trigger a bash script to run tcpdump to go through all my pcap logs and create new pcaps of the filtered packets

24815216
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
and after some tests with firefox ie google-chrome safari i ended up with this snippet

24815225
for-loop	arrays
you are using the index of the for-loop not the arrays element that matches that index

24815251
aggregate-functions	sum
alternatively you can just sum components if ie when used in mysql sum aggregate-functions

24815312
packets	multicast
my application is a specialized user space udp router that uses raw sockets to produce unicast and multicast output with actual or spoofed source addresses in the ip packets headers of the sent packets

24815312
subnet	packets	packets	multicast
i can t create a udp packets writer that successfully sends packets that 1 contain a spoofed source address 2 to a multicast address 3 if sending host is on subnet a 4 receiving host is on subnet b if the valid spoofed source address is on subnet a

24815360
google-chrome	firefox
on google-chrome and firefox it works fine as they reposition the actual cursor position whereas ie leaves it at the previous position

24815360
google-chrome	firefox
see the following script - works on touchscreens in firefox and google-chrome and by using the mouse

24815364
build.gradle	gradlew
i have a build.gradle file that calls some svnkit stuff to svn export some directories that make up a gradlew multi-project

24815365
google-chrome	safari
now the code is working good in google-chrome but when it comes to safari the animation becomes very slow

24815428
post	get
i have tried uploading the js as described in this post but i could not get it to work no matter how many times i tried yes i matched all the correct ids and classes

24815440
factors	mean
this file size has a default limit that you hit the error line say the fix using compiler flag zm microsoft help to override the default limit this option is an scale factors that mean that zm100 is the default limit zm200 is double of the default limit and so.

24815459
hide	show
however i show hide columns in the grid based on user s choices

24815542
filtering	grouping
jerry gave me the great idea of using grouping on row labels rather than attempting to filtering the dates one at a time

24815734
caliburn.micro	prism
also i d like to avoid the use of frameworks prism caliburn.micro since this is primarily for education reasons

24815737
getter	setter
i ve been using a java book which has been excellent so far but it hasn t been to good at explaining the reason why we use setter and getter

24815737
getter	setter
anyway my understanding is that encapsulation to me this basically means getter and setter prevents the direct access to instant variables

24815746
width	border-box
you could make it responsive like this and you could use a trick using a white border instead of margins and combined with border-box will make the images fit the right width in percentage out of the 100 of the .container div

24815757
hide	show
the first bind regulates the event of modal when it hide and enables the scroll of whole page while the second one regulates the event when it show up and disables the scroll of whole page

24815774
getter	setter
using private variables with getter and setter provides a number of advantages

24815794
pull	push
suppose that you are the only one allowed to push to that remote repository but others can pull from it

24815794
pull	push
then you can pull whatever changes you want from them and push them to your remote repository thus integrating these changes into the official version

24815819
division	modulo
to check a digit you should isolate it by using modulo arithmetic remainder and division

24815859
getter	setter
that way the values of share will automatically update without needing to use watch or setter and getter

24815863
hash	salt
just transmit the salt with the hash password

24815863
hash	salt
then transmit the salt with the hash password

24815869
swift	objective-c
it is only make objective-c methods looks nice in swift

24815869
swift	objective-c
the default behavior described above mean that method definitions in swift are written with the same grammatical style as objective-c and are called in a natural expressive way

24815892
swt	swing
i ve been experiencing with swt gui lib eclipse uses and i m wanting to create the following using swing

24815924
button	checkbox
now forget about the radio button and the checkbox

24815926
swift	objective-c
all including class functions in swift and objective-c follow the same pattern

24815926
swift	objective-c
as bryan said it s to make swift method calls make sense when called on objective-c methods that have parameter names in the method signature

24815926
swift	objective-c
init methods include the first parameter because swift changes the init methods from objective-c from initwith .

24815948
submit	submission
this submission had the potential to submit part of a form

24815954
put	get
if i put a .ppt file id in the second link i get a this file doesn t exist error from drive

24815984
put	get
i order to get it published i need to put in a sandbox

24815989
google-chrome	firefox
i tried to trigger the method through curl on command line google-chrome and firefox

24816107
getter	setter
so my instinct tells me to make getter and setter for the variable

24816107
getter	setter
here are my getter and setter for the key returned from the database

24816139
move	drag
this is also important because i don t want the mouse to actually move to a location on screen and perform drag and drop because then it is a pain to maintain and run tests with open windows

24816174
dictionary	map
i want to map this string to a dictionary to look like

24816213
post	get
the basic logic of the application is that if the server request is get it displays the form see index-get.php while if it is post the form has been submitted then it validates the form

24816238
getter	setter
i my formname form i have created getter and setter for classobject as shown below

24816249
versioning	upgrade
note just be aware that if you modify the template or css files they could get overwritten if your application were to be upgrade to a newer versioning

24816265
calloc	malloc
note it is not necessary to cast the results of malloc or calloc in c

24816269
getter	setter
objective-c doesn t really make use of getter or setter but rather does the above

24816319
int	double
change all type of int to double in both mergesort and merge methods

24816335
swt	swing
otherwise you could use a swt shell with swing components embedded in it but in my experience this is extremely fiddly and hard to debug

24816336
int	double
if you want the int nearest to the double value you ll need to do this

24816349
mouse	keyboard
obviously awt.robot is the obvious answer but it does affect the windows mouse and keyboard

24816349
awt	swing
another possibility would be a swing browser that runs on awt but i have yet to find a working up-to-date browser besides djnative let alone one that runs on awt

24816380
macports	homebrew
i got this to work using macports instead of homebrew

24816380

sudo port install libxml2 libxslt

24816435
srt	subtitle
both subtitle files are in srt format

24816463
nsmanagedobject	mogenerator
i can t get mogenerator 1.27 to generate the nsmanagedobject classes as i m getting this error

24816499
splunk	logstash
in this case any useful data like application logs should ideally be stored outside of ebs like syslog-ng s3 or logging solutions like splunk loggly logstash etc..

24816566
post	get
if you don t want to use ajax make a get or post request via js to the php file where you had coded the delete function

24816569
hide	show
use command 1 to show all hidden files in finder and 2 to hide them again

24816634
nexus	artifactory
however if you use either nexus or artifactory in your environment it will make it easier for developers to configure their pom.xml without having to include repository information

24816634
nexus	artifactory
you simply add this configuration into artifactory or nexus

24816652
int	boolean
timer java.lang.string boolean in timer cannot be applied to int java.awt.event.activelistener

24816689
distance	mercator
also degrees of latitude are non-linear - the linear distance varies depending on the angle due to the shape of the earth - maps look linear because they use a projection - typically the mercator projection - to project the surface of an almost sphere onto a flat surface

24816782
groupbox	panel
use panel or groupbox to wrap your textboxes labels and buttons

24816782
hide	show	groupbox	panel
ps you can do hide and show to panel also actually all your form element but grouping your element in container like panel or groupbox will be best

24816786

make sure you are using the latest rvm than you can update your certificates and rubygems

24816943
cefsharp	awesomium
of all the chrome projects including cefsharp etc awesomium is the only one that actually renders a page out-of-box without endless hours of fixing stuff only to still be no further ahead

24816943
mouseup	mousedown
the following code is a workaround for click mousedown mouseup etc .

24816970
width	height
you would probably need give some height and width to the label and set the position absolute in order to give some space to empty label

24816977
background-image	background-color
i noticed when you disable the background-image from #our-team and the background-color from #ot-window and then clearing -webkit-backface-visibility from .ot-badge will make them behave like your jsfiddle

24816998
bash	zsh
the shared language that posix-compatible shells such as bash ksh and zsh speak is defined here

24817009

but the problem is iam getting the value 0 of height width

24817062
getter	setter
other than that you have no deleteâ s in your program trivial getter setter

24817092
hive	hdfs
the hdfs file system is not restricted to mapreduce jobs.it can be used for other applications including the hbase database the apache mahout machine learning system and the apache hive data warehouse system

24817094
jobs	cron
the only way i currently know of doing this would be with curl and cron jobs but i feel like there s a better way to accomplish this and i d like to avoid using crons because i feel as if the one minute interval behind checks wouldn t be fast enough

24817109
hide	show	mouseleave	mouseenter
i m trying to hide and show a div when mouseenter and mouseleave

24817143
super	abstract

i have seen many example like siphon linphone idoubs but it is not direct communication between logged users of sip voip

24817190
cashapelayer	uibezierpath
i initially planned to use plain cashapelayer s to create objects and add it to the superview s layer with help of cgpaths or uibezierpath so that i will reduce the memory footprint of the application

24817190
uiview	cashapelayer
so i am planning to create a custom uiview backed by cashapelayer so that i do not bother about handling the touches and spotting the specific object interacted by user

24817207
freemarker	velocity
change any content-generation libraries you use velocity freemarker etc. to use utf-8 and to specify utf-8 in the content type of the responses that they generate

24817234
temp	tmp
sudo rm -r app hadoop tmp #delete the temp folder

24817234

texreg	stargazer
i m sticking with texreg rather than one of the other packages like stargazer because texreg allows me to group coefficients into meaningful groups

24832463
hive	hdfs
that s why it usually takes longer to run the query because without the where clause hive can simply return the content of the file that represents the table in hdfs

24832506
post	get
i know that this has been addressed if you re using using post but i want to adhere to restful designs so the request verb needs to be get

24832538
button	checkbox
if you don t already have this referenced go to the visual basic editor alt-f11 and in the tools dropdown select references... tick the checkbox next to microsoft scripting runtime and then click the ok button

24832561
inherited	subclassing
since your classes descend from baseclass and support baseinterface remember that supporting one or more interfaces it s also inherited by subclassing

24832561
inherited	properties
in this example achildclass bchildclass and cchildclass that are descendants of baseclass inherited the someproperty properties

24832580
jar	war
i think the requirement for the leading depends on whether you are calling getresourceasstream from a static or non-static method and whether the resources are packaged in an archive zip jar war or whether the app is unarchived into files in the deployment environment

24832581
box-sizing	border-box
you could try adding a padded container around each div that uses box-sizing border-box and position relative

24832581
box-sizing	border-box
in terms of browser support i would argue that box-sizing border-box is fine source

24832611
subtract	add
the key idea here is to subtract the day of the month and add 1 to get the first day of the current month

24832653
post	get
i am trying to get a post method in my rest api to properly interpret the json it is consuming

24832657
jtextfield	jfilechooser
want to create a jfilechooser and a jtextfield then browse an image from any folder

24832657
jtextfield	jfilechooser
jfilechooser and jtextfield is created

24832696
hide	show
without listing all the show as well as the hide is there a more efficient way to make sure when you select another option that it doesn t hide that specific row

24832698
stateless	stateful
this is why it may make sense to write fake implementations to represent stateful objects and leave mockito mocks for stateless service interfaces

24832709
tunnel	vpn
one more thought - it s possible that your vpn uses a common feature called split tunnel which means that all destinations behind your firewall would go over vpn and have the associated routing rules applied but any destinations outside such as your external provider are split and instead go straight out without any routing

24832709
tunnel	vpn
the only way around this would be to setup a vpn tunnel between your firewall and your external provider at my company we ve done this with our cloud servers so they are accessible over vpn

24832735
folder	directory
however you also need to push the source of your octopress project to source branch of your repo as follows change directory to source folder and run

24832738
button	checkbox
there is a suppress checkbox to the right if it there is a button with a x2 click this button

24832784
getter	setter
my bean has a very basic getter setter for this

24832817
elasticsearch	kibana
i try to use elasticsearch rest api for posting events and kibana for presenting the results

24832823
put	get
i get invalid credentials but this should be ok as you d put your valid ones in there

24832825
for-loop	arrays
you can use below function and make for-loop for arrays

24832851
postgresql	mysql
mysql maria postgresql oracle etc relational data

24832875
post	get
on post when i debug i get the inner and outer html as desired with the second div text

24832912
stdout	stderr
you need to redirect stderr to stdout since backtick ing something will get you only stdout

24832937
width	height
thus size 2 height 0.5 will give a barcode twice the default width x-dim 0.76mm and at the default height set in mpdf 10mm

24832937
width	height
the results may vary according to the value passed to the barcode class so i think if you want a fixed width and height you should try an external library that creates an barcode image file with the desired size or forcing the barcode to adjust to a fixed row or div in a table

24832965
free	malloc
note that you ve also got to have some way to remember the pointer for each malloc so you can free it at the appropriate time

24832973
strcpy	strncpy
to copy a string in c use carefully strcpy 3 often strncpy is better

24832973
g++	gcc
also compile c++ code on linux with g++ -g wall and c code with gcc -g -wall to get warnings and debug info

24832982
width	margin
basically floating the blocks and letting their width be determined by a percentage of the parent up to 25 since there are 4 - notice that i used only 23 and then i placed a 1 margin around all blocks giving you a 2 space between any two blocks -- adjust these numbers as you see fit

24833001
system.data.oracleclient	odp.net
i have a legacy dal with like 100 tableadapters dataset xsd but because we got new servers with oracle client 12c i had to made the switch to the oracle.dataaccess.client odp.net from the old deprecated system.data.oracleclient

24833047
scheme	racket
if you want to learn more about scheme you should download racket and read how to design programs which is a good introduction to programming

24833107
strcpy	strcmp	strcpy	malloc
when you re allocating memory with malloc or new you get only a pointer in return so you have to approach to that differently - with functions like strcpy strcmp if you need to check equality of texts you can t compare only pointers either

24833164
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
a little faster in google-chrome opera worlds faster in ie and firefox

24833187
sys	argparse
maybe you can do this with argparse but another option is to use the sys module

24833201
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
and the answer is - bad in google-chrome opera very bad in firefox horribly bad in ie

24833204
matplotlib	colormap
you re passing in specific rgb values so matplotlib can t construct a colormap because it doesn t know how it relates to your original data

24833207
post	get
i edited the pre-revprop-change.tmpl file inside the repository s hooks folder changing the suffix to .bat but eclipse says that .bat is not a recognized win32 file couldn t get the error message to stay displayed for some reason to post the full error message

onresume	onpause
then in the onresume onpause i handle registering and unregistering the receiver

24833308
int	double
i ve tried int float double

24833321
dirichlet	multinomial
the dirichlet is often used as a prior to multinomial probabilities in bayesian models

24833321
dirichlet	multinomial
the values of the dirichlet parameters can be used to encode prior information typically in terms of a notional number of prior events corresponding to each element of the multinomial

24833321
dirichlet	multinomial
for example a dirichlet with a vector of ones as the parameters is just a generalization of a beta 1 1 prior to multinomial quantities

24833370
children	parent
i want to have one parent template and many children templates with their own variables that they pass to the parent like so

24833423

because references to it are kept by the timer system because it s set up callbacks to functions closures that reference it via setinterval and settimeout

24833436
children	parent
one message can have multiple children but each message can have only one parent

24833465

bison	lemon
version of lemon bison 2.41 and gcc tdm64-2 4.8.1

24833506
jboss	glassfish
a realm for jboss likely won t work on glassfish or tomcat for example

24833507
int	chars
since the unsigned chars is passed to a variadic function it will be promoted to int or in obscure cases unsigned int which will in all probability be printed just fine

24833532
int	chars
if i send memcmp two pointers to int then it seems to interpret the int as chars

24833535
width	height
if you don t want that add constraints to maintain the height and width at some constant value explicit height and width constraints

24833550
post	get
now this example is stringifying some json to post to the server how you would do this with an image is beyond me but this should hopefully get you started

24833562
int	chars
when i try to print the uninitialized static chars array it gives run time error null pointer exception whereas the uninitialized static int array gives null value

24833614
width	height
third your list items had to be floated and given a width x height otherwise the browser thinks they all line up on the left side of the page since the elements inside of the list items are all floated

24833630
filtering	grouping
this is extendable to the other kendo-specific parameters like filtering grouping

24833654
filtering	grouping
another approach would be to grouping rowfield items by date ranges then filtering by those grouping

24833654
filtering	grouping
you can t grouping items when the field is the report filtering area of the pivottable

24833654
filtering	grouping
however you can temporarily move that field to the row labels area grouping by dates move the field to the report filtering area then hide the grouping items that are outside your desired date ranges

24833657
vbscript	vb6
it s vbscript but vbscript works in vb6

24833658
width	height
when messing around with background colors and images i noticed that if i placed a background image or color on the body it expanded to the full width and height of the page even though the body element only took up a much smaller space

24833658
width	height
it doesn t seem to matter whether the height or width are declared either

24833669
google-chrome	firefox
i have tested this with my primary browser google-chrome v35 and a copy of ie 11 i have on my computer commentors point out that firefox 30 did not exhibit this issue

24833862
google-chrome	firefox
mousemotionlistener works in eclipse applet viewer but not on browsers i tried google-chrome and firefox and ie

24833901
multiplying	division
as explained in my other answer the newton raphson iteration is there to get a close approximation of the reciprocal 1 d but this is not sufficient for producing an exactly rounded division n d by simply multiplying this reciprocal approximation by n further steps are required

24833905
macports	homebrew
for example if you used macports they are probably installed in opt local bin while homebrew should have installed it in usr local bin i think i haven t used hb in a long time

24833912

for each form when the user hits the submit button i need to iterate over the checkbox of the corresponding form and perform some logic

24834116
post	put
i like pre and post conditions they allow me to figure out when i have put square pegs in round holes more quickly

24834121
post	get
you can also simplify this by using which contains both post and get variables

24834164
seaborn	matplotlib
oh and if i was really giving too much advice i d say import seaborn to make the matplotlib results a little more beautiful

24834191
put	get
i want to get the xml data and put it into an array of objects

24834248
min	max
the second simplest answer is to use the unique parabola which goes through the 3 points quadratic interpolation but that violates the requirement that all the values must be between min a b c and max a b c

24834265
osx	yosemite
this is on osx yosemite beta 3

24834320
mouse	keyboard

24834327
for-loop	arrays
i m trying to use the items of one arrays within a for-loop that is looping through another arrays

24834330

24834441
width	height
i m working on upload script and i would like to resize uploaded image so that maximum width and height are 500 pixels

24834441
width	height
for example if width is greater than height then resize width to 500 pixels and scale height accordingly so that original aspect ratio is preserved

24834441
width	height
and opposite if height is greater than width then resize height to 500 pixels and scale width accordingly

24834460

i want to print persons in this format where each person is in a column and each person is delimiter by a spaces or a tab

24834576
ubuntu	linux
if the guest system is ubuntu or any linux system then having done this all the synced folders should now be visible within to the guest but the guest won t automatically mount them

24834576
cifs	smb
to the guest system in linux depending on your version of guest additions this looks like either an smb cifs share with the name by default of vboxsrv or a file system of type vboxsf

24834578
ssl	https
this will also support all forms of urls that file_get_contents support including https if compiled with ssl support

24834666
hide	show
because you are changing pages when you redirect to the home page the javascript that handles an event on the logout button won t do anything to show and hide the message on the home page

24834688
setinterval	clearinterval
you should really look into setinterval and clearinterval

24834713
children	parent
thus in general the children of a node are very very far away from its parent in the array thus falling out to another page

floating-point	integer
i want to define a function that can take either an integer or a floating-point number as an argument and return the nearest integer the input argument itself if it is already an integer

24835005
width	height
a greater ideal might be to declare a class for your landscape-oriented divs in your css define a uniform width and height there and assign that class to all landscape-oriented divs

24835005
width	height
that way you could easily change that width and height in one place and it would apply to all divs with that class assigned and multiple classes can be assigned to a single div

24835008
int	boolean
sqlite uses 0 and 1 small int for boolean values

24835041
hex	binary
this resulted document id id solr field as sequence of lowercase hex digit string matching row key binary representation

in case of binary bytes strings like hashes they are transformed into sequence of lowercase hex digits 2 digits per byte

24835067
screens	tablet
i have a column in my database which contains text strings such as tablet with 7 screens and 3 stylus for example

24835067

hide	show
first we need to hide show the navigationcontroller on the source viewcontroller and before it disappear we need to show it again

24835151
16-bit	64bit
assuming just for the sake of demonstration a short is 16-bit 2 bytes a float is 32 bits 4 bytes and a double is 64bit 8 bytes then the union is 8 bytes in size

24835151
int	double
unions are not meant to do a proper conversion from int to float or double

24835211
httprequest	httpresponse
i have a question about the httprequest and httpresponse

use attr to change the src

24835294
hide	show
but is an array of object and i can t hide show them

24835324
pycassa	cqlsh
as a side note at this point you should generally be using cqlsh instead of cassandra-cli and the python cql driver instead of pycassa i maintain both especially for new projects

ng-switch	ng-show
inside of your template you can use ng-if ng-show or ng-switch to change elements based on if you want element-structure to change

24835331
folder	directory
but sometimes i was denied to create file or folder in certain directory since i do not have enough authority

24835395
post	get
i know this is redundant...but the point is...the function never gets called when the page loads...and all the post content that it needs to get from the database never arrives because the request never happens - i can see that nothing happens in the console - and you can too check out what i am talking about in the forum section of my page -

24835395
put	get	post	get	post	put
to post you will have to sign up as a user...and then you can see what i am talking about by going to the forum clicking on one of the posts...making a comment...and then navigating away and coming back...you don t have to make the comment you will see that nothing shows up...but it will help you see the problem because when the comment is created a put request is supposed to happen which updates the post but that never happens either...along with a bunch of get requests that don t get called too

24835398
hide	show
you can use that selector to show hide all of those elements by

post	get
if you post a parameter which doesn t match any field of your form you will get a validation error like this form shouldn t have any extra fields or something like that

24835463
width	height	children	parent
you should use it if you are changing child view s size on runtime but only in particular cases like constraints from the parent view by that i mean that the parent height or width are wrap_content and so match measure the children before they can wrap them again

24835470
coalesce	isnull
the coalesce and isnull t-sql functions are used to return the first nonnull expression among the input arguments but there are few differences between those which you can find here

24835492

ant	maven
i am concerned that mapping this three-project dependency tree in their three poms will essentially require that i duplicate much of my ant build process in maven

24836224
ant	maven
i am hoping with all hope that i don t need to do this as ant works well for me and maven and i do not get along

24836231

integer	unsigned
the macro fits_unsigned_type can tell if an object has unsigned integer type or not in most cases

24845253
width	height
all you need to do is change the height and width on the .tile and the rest is taken care of

24845255
for-loop	arrays
namely i have a for-loop that goes through an integer arrays and compares it to another integer

24845255
int	double
what i m wondering is how could i modify this code so that i could input any type of item and array ie string or int or double etc and have it do the same thing

24845281
for-loop	loops
i know for the regular for-loop the arr.length will just evaluate to 0 and loops wont execute

24845286
stdout	stderr
stderr output is rerouted to stdout with so that it is included in the output

24845296
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
the only difference between them is use foreach loops when you want to iterate all the items of the list or arrays whereas in case of normal for-loop you can control start and end index

24845300
lua	scheme	lisp	scheme
ps some of the dynamically typed compiled languages i know of include scheme lua and common lisp

24845383
for-loop	arrays
however the for-loop that you have between arrays initialization and the problem line is iterating over all of the arrays components and initializing them so every component will be assigned to

24845438
prepare	execute
i create a pdo connection object then prepare and execute a query

24845486
swift	objective-c
after that you will need to include import the bridge s header into an objective-c bridging header which xcode should have generated when you added a swift source file in an existing project

24845494
versioning	upgrade
during an upgrade the windows installer will not replace a file with a lower versioning of the same file

24845525
spaces	delimiter
i want to detect those spaces in between as delimiter and also the linebreaks but would like to ignore or skip spaces or n or t characters at other places

24845544
put	get
in designing gui netbeans instantiates all the variables at the end of the program which cannot be manipulated.now i want to get the jtextfield data and put it in a string object

24845548
getter	setter
you can access it only through setter and getter

24845572
post	get
so if anyone sends a post or get request to that particular php file we are able to receive the response

24845606
width	height
i want to set width height cllpadding and cellspacing and valign of a table but i did not find these attributes in asp.net

24845606
width	height
height width valign top is also not available in visual studio

24845618
fgets	fread
i suppose you should be using fgets to read each string separetely instead of fread and then trim them to remove those characters before processing

24845624
portrait	landscape
so i went for a custom view to display the logo this looks good in portrait but in landscape the custom view positioned after the tabs

24845630
hide	show
you should make use of the show and hide dialog options

24845630
hide	show
also see jquery ui dialog show hide effects with options

24845637
accessor	properties
if the string resides as a properties in a class you could make it a read-only properties - accessor method but no setter method

24845642
swift	objective-c
this function is linked with a custom back button and the h file is linked in the objective-c swift bridging file

24845683
google-chrome	safari
this works fine on my desktop windows google-chrome but on my iphone ios7 safari and google-chrome it reloads the page which first of all takes time and is annoying

24845683
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome then scrolls back down but safari does not which means that the user is back at the top

24845707
width	height
i resized it to a width of 150px and it calculated the height as 185px

24845731
knitr	latex
in rnw latex one use of the common output from knitr hooks might be decorating with some fancy environment the data from chunks

24845734
addition	multiplication
a floating-point multiplication and a floating-point addition are

24845738
folder	directory
under c c++ general add devil s include folder under additional include directory

24845738
folder	directory
then under linker general add devil s lib folder it should contain devil.lib ilu.lib and ilut.lib to additional library directory

24845738
folder	directory
for x64 it may not contain a lib folder it may be just the devil directory itself for version 1.7.8 it was that case

24845740
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i tried safari google-chrome and firefox and the issue only appeared on google-chrome and firefox

24845765

if i remove the min and max attributes from complex-slider it works fine but i cant explain this something weird is going on

24845771
wav	ogg	mp3	wav	mp3	ogg
also i solved my problem by using this pattern below to show only the mp3 ogg m4a wav and wma formats from my wordpress post contents

24845780
nscolor	nsfont
i am styling setting text colour background colour etc. the rows based on persistent transformable nscolor and nsfont attributes in my data model which the end use can modify

24845796
int	chars
list of names chars and site acreage int where site acreage int less than first ave s chars site acreage

24845798
post	get
probably my biggest confusion is in the controller actions themselves get and post

24845801
children	parent
needed to set a relationship in the parent to the children

24845804
hide	show	children	parent
oddly if i don t hide the elements when the page loads and change my click event from show to hide children elements are appropriately hidden as parent are clicked

24845866
width	height
when you leave off the width and height they get set to 100 which means that the height will be 100 of your viewport

24845866
width	height
you can create a function to set the height attribute based on the width of the container perhaps the body element in your case and the ratio of the height and width in your viewbox

24845872
children	parent
i wish to find a solution that when im on the grandparent page that it will only return the parent and not the children ie

24845872
children	parent
this is the code i have at present and it produces all parent and children of the grandparent page and places them into a table

24845914
config	ini
i find it nicer to have the config that a scripts needs in the script itself rather than via extra commandline parameters or ini files

24845967
width	height
you can get the width height of the whole imageobj by requesting its .width height properties

24845967
width	height
if the imageobj is a spritesheet then there is no way to programatically get the x y width height of the individual sprites on that spritesheet

24845967
width	height
your kineticjs demo required the coder to know where the x y width height of each sprite on the spritesheet

24846000
button	checkbox
on otherhand when i add pnlmain in jframe and click x button on top it returns checkbox value as false ref line#424-433

24846038
uiview	subviews
to flip the uiview it has to be a subviews of another view.

24846065

i ve just created a form with blade and for some reason its posting with get even though the html says post and to a different url see gif

24846090
width	height
you can t change height and width of inline elements

24846110
keydown	keyup
also you have to use keydown when the user presses and holds this fires all the time keyup when the user releases fires even when pressing enter and onpaste for richtclick - paste always

24846125
joptionpane	jdialog
one solution display it in a modal jdialog or in a joptionpane not a jframe

24846160
google-chrome	safari
this is not the case in ie safari and google-chrome

24846160
google-chrome	safari
my process for doing things works perfectly in ie safari and google-chrome

24846162
firefox	safari
but on firefox and safari none of the methods work

24846162
firefox	safari
nothing works on safari and firefox

24846162
firefox	safari
i m starting to think this is a browser compatibility issue but i doubt myself when i think that without any change in the versions of anything stuff used to seamlessly work on safari and firefox too

24846167
getter	setter
using is useful when you need to create a get set property with your own custom code in the getter and setter

24846167
getter	setter
this is useful if you need a mutable property with a getter and setter that just read write mutable backing field

24846219
pyenv	virtualenv
i find this especially useful when using pyenv or virtualenv

24846221
hide	show
the only time you would need to manually call show is if you had previously called hide or setvisible false on that same widget and now you wanted to make it re-appear

24846256
width	height
i want to add to the app that whenever the certain point is met the button height and width get smaller

24846269

24846355
mouseleave	mouseenter
hover with only one callback will cover both mouseenter and mouseleave events

24846359
post	get
the mental is process is simulate a person login in the website some logins are made using ajax or traditional post request so the first thing you need to do is made that request like browser does in the server response you will get cookies headers and other information you need to use that info to build a new request this are the scrappy request

24846365
post	get
if i make a post to api v1 users create it is never processed by createuserresource since tastypie interprets as a detail view for usersresource and subsequently i get a 404

24846451
width	height
they became ovals since the width is in and varies based on the viewport so i cannot make its height to be the same amount

24846458
addclass	removeclass
i created a quick and short demo using addclass and removeclass to toggle css border for div being clicked

24846504
min	max
when you use vowpal-wabbit adds a confidence min max interval resulting from the multiple bootstrapping samples to each prediction line

24846566
min	max
set the numberbox min property to 0 instead of 18 max property to 65 and define the following onchangetracking event

24846589
hide	show
unfortunately switching between fragment doesn t invoke different oncreate hookmethod so i cannot hide or show the window title depending on the fragment i can do this with activity

24846619

24846743
portrait	landscape
the ipad on the other hand will display a different splash screen image in portrait and in landscape mode

24846743
portrait	landscape
if your iphone interface supports both portrait and landscape then you must decide which way round you d like to display that splash screen image

24846743
portrait	landscape
as kanan says design your landscape image say in photoshop then rotate the canvas so that the image is portrait but the content is still landscape

24846749

post	put
note you would put my_update_postmeta in your page or post template

24847682
int	chars
for an int with a value 500 if the most significant byte comes first then you get a string pointer to a chars array of or 0 but if the endianness is lsb first x86 is little endian then you would get a usable 3 byte string chars not necessarily human readable chars but there is no guarantee that there will be a zero byte in an int and since all you have is a pointer to the address where the int was stored if you were to run normal string functions on it they would go past the end of the original int into no-mans-land in small test programs it will often be environment variables .

24848871
nsurlconnection	nsurlsession
i ve favoured nsurlsession even though i m just then telling the returned task to resume and never using any of the improved functionality over nsurlconnection s asynchronous mechanism such as cancellation because it is anecdotally much better at caching and because it ll automatically ensure an appropriate place is found to accumulate results and ultimately dispatch the completion handler asynchronously

post	get
you can use to get an indexed array from your post so you can drop size and just foreach over the array instead

24855118
for-loop	loops
if you really want to keep the worse method with size and for remove the is_array check and replace with your own loops structure but keep the internal checks and move e initialization out from your for-loop

24855160
int	double
however is_c_str captures not only but also int and double

24855175
put	get
i am now certain that im is interpreting your h value as a percentage if you put in 50 you get out 180 50 of 360 and if you put in 10 you get out 36 10 of 360

24855217
width	margin	width	height	margin	height

so the timeout param for a thread should stop the thread after timeout seconds if it hasn t terminate yet

24855345
min	max	range	min	range	max
instead if you want continuous output regression then you have to create a bijective map between range of your output min max and 0 1

24855345
min	max
in most cases the map f min max - 0 1 f x x-min max-min is sufficient

24855352
dictionary	map
to create the dictionary for edge labels all you need to do is map each edge pair of nodes to its label like so

i am trying to avoid using many getter and setter for future projects and if i m correct property can help me with that

24855503
hide	show
you can use the table view s -rowforview and -isrowselected methods to determine whether to hide or show the button

24855508
cpu	processors
it s relatively simple to implement a cpu this way but it makes very inefficient use of the processors s resources

24855508
cpu	processors
a simple cpu with a really short pipeline might be able to get away with always waiting but modern processors have to do something else

24855517
getter	setter
yes objective-c used to require getter and setter to be written out laboriously by hand

24855517
getter	setter
nowadays if you use property and don t go out of your way to do anything else then a suitable instance variable and an appropriate getter and setter will be generate for you

24855517
getter	setter
so the following is a complete class with usable properties accessible either via traditional setname name -style setter and getter or via the dot notation which calls the setter and getter despite looking like a c struct access

24855523
width	margin	width	height	margin	height
i ll be honest this stumped me for a while so i did some searching around about margin behaviour and found out this critical piece of information the percentage is calculated with respect to the width of the generated box s containing block. so the browser height is completely ignored in the calculation

24855523
margin	height
well that completely invalidates using a percentage margin to attempt to vertically align relative to the viewport height

24855558
getter	setter
you really won t avoid using getter and setter

24855558
getter	setter
underneath it s using getter setter methods

24855571
spaces	delimiter
this is a way of breaking a sentence string apart into a list with single words but replacing all non-alphanumeric characters with a spaces which gets deleted by being a delimiter

24855593

it says implicit conversion loses integer precision size_t aka unsigned long to int

24855646
min	max	width	height
try and give the header min max width height

24855667
post	get
sometimes the best way to get the right answer on the internet is to post the wrong answer giving a more informed nerd something to pounce on. that saidâ

24855678
maven	pom.xml
i m sure i can write some custom plugin code to achieve this and i might very well end up going that way but i d be interested in achieving this using pom.xml configuration could be using existing plugins from maven central

24855836
bluestacks	android-emulator
also i recommend you to install free third-party android-emulator bluestacks it work very fast

24855853
cpu	processors
unfortunately this pegs the cpu even on my core i7 macbook pro and i m using a macmini with a core 2 duo processors at actual shows

24855875
subtract	add
in the callback function depending on the mouse button clicked add or subtract the desired unit 25 in this case

24855901
pop-up	dialog
although the dialog pop-up to let me choose the selection of ringtones it does not save the setting

24855927
free	malloc
so i have a program with one malloc followed by some complex code followed by one free

24855935
maven	pom.xml
you can also add jndi properties and maven commands in your pom.xml to do the same thing

24855986
queue	fifo
however there are both the queue fifo and the stack first in last out classes instead of just a list

24855996
maven	pom.xml
suppose i d like the ability for the user to paste a fragment of xml code from a maven pom.xml file into the sbt repl and have it convert all the dependencies into sbt syntax

24856003
pop-up	dialog
clicking on configure pop-up a dialog box that has auto schema update checked but there is no option for schema and data - unlike package publish options which allow schema only schema and data etc

24856026
post	put
and put a backslash infront of pdo constructor like so as recommended in this post php namespace pdo not found then the code fails

24856051
stdout	stderr
redirect contents on fd #4 to avoid overriding stdin stdout or stderr so vim will still work properly

24856088
pull	push
commit changes to a container with docker commit and push it to a private docker repository and then pull it with docker pull to the production system

24856096
libxml2	libxslt
i also installed libxml2 libxslt w brew

24856124
websphere	ibm
ibm keeps talking about a containment path used in their id definitions and i am only assuming that it corresponds to an xml element within file in the websphere config folder hierachy but that s only from observation

24856124
children	parent
due to the apparent lack of a reciprocal adminconfig.children function it appears as though obtaining a full hierachical tree of parent children lies in calling this function on each of the elements returned from the call and combining the results

24856148
bash	zsh
works with zsh bash dash and ash

24856148
bash	zsh
type -p foo it appears to work with zsh bash and ash busybox but not dash it interprets -p as an argument

24856148
bash	zsh
command -v foo works with zsh bash dash but not ash busybox -ash command not found

24856150
int	double
the first number represents the isbn number and is the type string the second number is the price and is type double and the final number is the number of copies in stock and is an int

24856166
width	height
when you re-size the browser window the width and height dimensions are recalculated so that left me thinking a jquery plugin could be doing this

24856188
google-chrome	firefox
how do i fit these columns in firefox alongside with google-chrome

24856198
maven	pom.xml
that play app s dependencies can be transitive using the maven pom.xml support in sbt

24856299
hide	show
the load event fires before the form is show so hide has no effect

24856302
put	get
you can put in say 1.23 and get out 1.229998 or some such because 1.23 is represented exactly

24856302
int	double
similarly casting from an int to a double causes no loss of information since a double can contain every value an int can contain and then some

24856302
int	double
but casting from int to float or from long to double or float can result in loss of precision though there can never be an exponent overflow underflow

24856302
int	double
casting from float or double to int or long can easily result in overflow underflow and major loss of data if the float or double value has a large positive exponent or any negative exponent

24856302
floating-point	fractions
and of course when you cast from floating-point to fixed the fractions part of the number is truncated essentially a floor operation

24856481
post	get
create a link such as yes i agree with the link getting pulled from the get or post

24856499
nsmanagedobject	nsmutableset
expanding on the solution above one to many relationships are nsmutableset so this allows you to directly add or remove the person nsmanagedobject to the roles in this case a person has one role and roles have many person s

width	height
dimensions 978 308 width height of gallery in pixels

24856524
hex	binary
every j8i binary file is then padded with 00 hex for approx 256bytes before 1kb of data and then eof

24856543
width	height
you could start by getting the window width and height

24856551
for-loop	loops
in case you need a for-loop you need to break loops when you hit a match and print false in the else block of the for-loop

24856639
portrait	landscape
but when i play the video on native video player it s shown on portrait despite of being recorded on a landscape orientation

24856708
innodb	myisam
although that can be done with myisam tables innodb tables won t work simply by copying files

24856766
width	height
focusing on those two and substituting width height for asprat

24856766
width	height
all that is left is choosing between the two depending on if width or height is bigger

24856788
content-length	content-type
q 0.5 accept-encoding accept-encoding gzip deflate nil nil connection connection keep-alive nil content-type content-type application x-www-form-urlencoded content-length content-length 44 nil nil nil user-agent user-agent mozilla 5.0 x11

those two will never almost never be equals unless the dom element s tostring methods produces exactly the same string

24856809
folder	directory
and hkcr directory background shell cmd extended for the empty space inside a folder window

24856839
for-loop	loops
first i tried to do this in a for-loop where i get the fieldnames then for each field i break in and try to add the values for each element across the 30 trials though this strategy doesn t work for fields with differently sized dimensions i d need to variably create differently sized for loops according to dimensions of current field

24856846
int	chars
1 convert the int into an array of chars using

24856846
int	chars
3 convert the array of chars back to an int using

i need to know change the title of a uibutton from a uilabel or uitextfiled

24856909
imperative	declarative
a typical programming idiom in xslt is using templates hence the t in xslt which is declarative programming not imperative you don t tell the processor what to do you just tell what you want output if certain conditions are met

24856917
addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	addition
i made a vector of pointers to function of type int int int made four functions of that type addition subtraction multiplication and division and added pointers to them to my vector

24856927

i m having a hard time figuring out what it all means....i ve been fiddling with php and functions for a while but i never learned much about how to post with curl....where to put headers....etc

24856935
hide	show
because of how the script was written though if the header was show by scrolling up any scrolling down at all would hide it again so i made a second total variable and named them uptotal downtotal

24856935
hide	show
you can change the amount scrolled up down needed to show hide the header by changing the values respectively

24856948
memcpy	memmove
iff hole_len - head_len â head_len equivalently iff hole_len ã 2 in your case 2 â head_len you can avoid using memmove by using memcpy instead

24857068
int	double
for floats and double it s more difficult as with plain int as these may or not may be in the host machines byte-order

24857101
put	get
we can put that function in the before-save-hook to get the functionality you re after

24857114
.htaccess	httpd.conf
using .htaccess is fine even better if you have access to httpd.conf

24857160
punctuation	words
that means we need to find the first and last letter in case there is punctuation before or after the words

24857162
lodash	underscore.js
i would recommend at least downloading and using underscore.js or lodash for declarative programming

24857162
express	node.js
you could do it all without express but it makes working with node.js so much easier

24857162
cpu	processors
you can create a node process per cpu processors core

24857162
express	node.js
again it would be good for you to describe more about what you are trying to do but you could build a web app with just node.js and express

24857274
background-position	background-size	background-image	background-size	background-image	background-position	background-repeat	background-image	background-repeat	background-size	background-repeat	background-position

but after the copying the app folder into that directory building and rebooting android i don t see my app in the launcher

24857315
realloc	malloc
so for example malloc realloc error checking excluded for brevity

24857352
client-side	server-side
the answer is that you cannot nest scriplets tags and it also doesn t make sense to do it becuase you can t evaluate server-side variables on the client-side

24857361
swift	objective-c
is the swift bool value not being bridged properly to objective-c

24857431
freetype	libpng
i think the problem is that you upgraded libpng since you installed freetype so freetype-config --libs is giving a bad answer

24857448
for-loop	loops
in other words you can t reference the variable i from outside the for-loop because you don t have access to it from there so you need to move everything inside of loops

24857474
spaces	delimiter
semi colon followed by spaces delimiter string for all the cookies

24857591
post	get
being passed through a variable values â â is not necessary to make post or get the same since there is already the case the value increment

24857664
screens	mdpi
where should i store the dimen values for smaller screens size as in for mdpi screens

24857693
for-loop	arrays
second you were traversing the for-loop one too many times and going off the end of the path arrays

24857698
google-chrome	firefox
my script draws on a canvas at the position of the cursor so simple numbers from firefox s and google-chrome s developer tools aren t sufficient enough to gauge responsiveness

24857731
qpainter	qimage
qpainter is essentially the only way short of manipulating individual pixels in a qimage or using opengl to paint something in qt

24857741

note this works in jar and war applications

24857785
screens	mdpi
you are talking about small screens and then randomly refer to mdpi screens

24857785
screens	mdpi
so just to be clear you can have a device with what android categorize as a small screens with a normal pixel density screens mdpi but you can also have a large screens with the same pixel density

24857785
screens	mdpi
if you only want to target mdpi screens then add the dimens.xml file inside a values-mdpi folder

instead of assigning your uisearchbar directly as a tableheaderview create an empty uiview with the same size as the uisearchbar and add the uisearchbar as a subviews to this view which you assign as the tableheaderview

24866603
uitableview	uisearchbar
this will prevent the uitableview from getting pushed down when the uisearchbar begins editing

ienumerable	ienumerator
however it would probably make much more sense to return it as in which case you have to change the method signature to specify ienumerable instead of ienumerator

24866966
ienumerable	ienumerator
an ienumerator can only be iterated over once whereas an ienumerable can be iterated over more than once which is why i think you probably want the latter

24866984
ienumerable	ienumerator
the fact that a foreach loop can accept an ienumerable and not an ienumerator is the primary reason for this practice

24867017

24867099
portrait	landscape
here i have the compassheading value which is approximately the same when i hold the device heading towards noth for example and i change the orientation from portrait to landscape and vice-verse

24867099
portrait	landscape	switching	screens
i have taken the implementation for getting the compass heading from here but that is not what i was looking for because the trueheading values gives me the angle between the north and the device s top screens heading which is modified by 90 degrees when i switching from landscape to portrait

24867099
portrait	landscape
i cannot find a detailed documentation about this issue or an implementation for xamarin.ios to determine the correct device heading independently of the device s orientation - portrait landscape

24867351
width	height
also if you manually set the height width of an image you will need to be careful to maintain the aspect ratio of the image otherwise you will see it stretch or skew when rendered

24867359
put	get
i wrote a simple javaclient to put data in to the database but i get this error

24867369

the first pair is known as measured width and measured height

24867369
width	height
the second pair is simply known as width and height or sometimes

24867369
width	height
drawing width and drawing height

24867369

24867381
hide	show
the typeahead is comprised of a text box for filtering the options an unordered list for displaying the menu of short-listed options and a show hide button for manually toggling the list

24867416
integer	unsigned
use biginteger instead of int integer to avoid the precision problems pointed out by ivaylo java s int and integer cannot represent unsigned integers of more than 2 63 bits

24867563
width	height
the user is usually resizing the frame to fit the app on their desktop and will get frustrated if they fix the width and the height changes

i ve had to download 5 jars for powermock to work and it s still asking for hamcrest selfdescribing

24867690
uiview	uiwindow	uiviewcontroller	uiwindow
it s because you snapshot uiwindow who don t handle rotation like uiview uiviewcontroller

24867694
subtraction	addition
for addition and subtraction use regular function syntax into ranges of cells and enter them as an array formula

24867695
post	get
first off i know this program is kind of lengthy but if i don t post all of it you would probably get confused

24867704
next	except
so it correctly enters the code in except printing out the error message but then just goes along to the next line which is the comparison

24867734
post	put
everything is working fine...but not the file upload using the post method put is not supported with forms

24867736

24867768
innodb	myisam
this is a myisam table which offers less contention between inserting queries and reporting queries than innodb

24867768
put	get
if you do this you can put in the query and get rid of your need for the subquery.

24867806
hide	show
from my point of view you will want to fire a function on mouse-over mouse-out that broadcasts the status then functions subscribed to that broadcast can update the show hide status of the divs

24867816
put	get	post	get	post	put
the server is telling you that the method post get put etc that you are using is not allowed for the url that you are requesting

24867830
children	parent
if you pass the qstackedwidget in as the parent to the children i don t know if you get any guarantee that they re actually added to the qstackedwidget s underlying layout

24867864
google-chrome	firefox
the second problem is that while my implementation works quite well in firefox in google-chrome there is no fade the music simply drops to 0 volume

24867891
folder	directory
but the second one is in temp directory var folder and binary equals to system library frameworks python.framework versions 2.7 python

24867971
maven	pom.xml
to reproduce use the following maven pom.xml to pull down dependencies and then run the code above exactly as it is just use your own chef server and linux vm

png	ico	gif	png	gif	ico
msie does not support png gif and jpeg type icons only ico files

24868036
png	ico	gif	png	gif	ico
the best cross browser approach iâ ve found assumes that you have a png gif or jpeg for major browsers and a fallback ico file to use for ie7 and below

24868040
tez	hadoop
i m creating a validation tool which checks whether apache tez is working or not in hortonworks distribution of hadoop in order to do that i need to check whether a simple map reduce program is getting executed on tez i could see that a property in mapred-default.xml has to be changed

if i put back in the loop the only thing i m changing i get these weird stty errors

24868198
versioning	upgrade
you must upgrade to the google play services versioning of the mobile ads sdk by then.

24868206
memcpy	memmove
most compiler do not optimize std vector for type such as char by using std memcpy and std memmove

24868223
getter	setter
you can have a reference to the getter or setter but that is also a lambda and you do not know the actual name

24868270
inherited	properties
the documentation output for the above code lacks the comments available on the inherited properties

24868295
ienumerable	iqueryable
if you actually did pass in a func and not a lambda which could be either then you would get an ienumerable for your result not an iqueryable

24868323
hive	hdfs
i have been googling it seems that i would have to write a shell script to upload the csv file into hdfs and then write a hive script to import the csv into the table

just use a valid pointer you can allocate some heap memory using malloc sizeof int and later release it using free or just use stack-based memory for local automatic variables

24868506
ubuntu	linux
i know this is probably a question that has been asked many times before but i just can t seem to find the right article because i am quite new to ubuntu and linux in general and have no idea who to look for exactly

24868507
versioning	upgrade
i ve just upgrade nuget package manager in tools extensions and updates which reports the versioning as 2.8.50313.31

24868539
int	chars
i have an 80 element chars array and i am trying to specific elements to an int and am getting some number errors

24868575
g++	gcc
this forward declaration works great with gcc g++ to prevent a warning like

24868589
int	chars
this is so because chars is treated as signed number and the promotion to int preserves the sign

24868591
google-chrome	firefox
javascript clients on firefox and google-chrome are running fine

24868593
int	chars
because 0xc0 is negative in chars and the cast is preserving the sign as an int

24868644
chown	sudo	chown	chmod
try sudo chmod -r 775 home verendus desktop rails sample_app or sudo chown -r username home verendus desktop rails sample_app

bash	zsh
i m talking about dash here not bash or zsh

24868940
button	checkbox
while ajax request is in progress if user performs any subsequent action on other input elements select checkbox or radio button on same page that request is not getting queued up

24868967
width	margin
all boxes that scale dynamically cannot have a width defined so they cannot be centred using the margin auto

24868967
width	text-align
however it is possible to achieve the same effect by wrapping the whole thing into another box that covers the full width of the page text-align centring that box and then making the outer box displayed inline-block

24868981
ubuntu	linux
i tried to deploy an application qt 5.3 on linux ubuntu 14.04 which use qtmultimedia

24868992
put	get
note that you have to put the condition in a case statement or you might still get an error

24869030
getter	setter
i found the answer by myself we need to use the setter and getter for the corresponding field i.e datasource and collectionprefix in the class where you have implemented jobstore

24869188
integer	unsigned
for c90 the widest integer types are long and unsigned long and you can convert to those and use ld and or lu

24869191
ubuntu	debian
the ubuntu debian repositories have node also but they are not regularly updated and sometimes contain very outdated versions

24869198
width	height
my strong hunch is that the width and height in this case are taken to be equal to those of the smallest bounding rectangle

24869208
post	get
i am open to suggestions and changing it to post if i can get a clear explanation

24869223
children	parent
any ideas how to stop children hiding parent groups

24869324

i used objectoutputstream and objectinputstream to write and read from the file

24869487
pull	push
i found some way of doing with push and pull but it s only put the black block last instead of first

24869499
hide	show
the way the quiz survey creation works is a series of show hide display relevant form fields

24869526
post	get
for it should be http localhost channel v1 test also note if you define a post route but call the page as get without a form there ll be an error

24869550
listview	gridview
you can use listview and gridview

24869550
listview	gridview
the trick will be creating custom adapters for your listview and gridview

24869550
listview	gridview
in those adapters you can overwrite the getview method and programatically add items like imageviews etc. you add the listview and gridview in the xml file and then populate them with other items using the adapter

24869556
google-chrome	safari
both formats run on time in google-chrome 36 on pc and the mp4 is fine in google-chrome and safari on ipad

24869757
post	get
so the only way for very good reasons to get to all likers is to post something on the wall of your page

24869766
getter	setter
3 if you are attempting to simply do method level validation it does make sense to simply do the validation by hand in the class setter getter itself

24869809
profiling	benchmarking
if you are truly concerned about the performance then i suggest you perform some concrete benchmarking using a profiling

24869849
folder	directory
after uncompressing the folder and going to the directory of the uncompressed folder and performing the following command

24869851
addclass	removeclass

24869871
post	get
when user accesses page get i store attributes in session scope so that they are available after form submission i do page reload on post

24869923
disk	ram
a 64-bit process needing 4gb on a 64-bit os can generally run in 2gb of physical ram by using virtual memory assuming disk swap space is available but performance will be severely impacted if all of that memory is frequently accessed

24869940
implements	extends
to not mess with httppostedfilebase but rather to be able to use byte array for model binding i decided to extends bytearraymodelbinder and implements it so that it automatically conerts httppostfilebase to byte

24869961
folder	directory
right now it looks as if you are keeping your css file inside your download directory so you would need to copy your images folder it should be part of the jquery-ui zip file there

24870013
post	get
what this means is set note_id equal to what came through the form s post in the note_id field but if nothing came through that field set note_id to an empty or blank string. when you get to the sql portion of your code if that note_id variable is an empty string then your sql will read shortened for clarity

24870033
versioning	upgrade	uninstall	upgrade
for starters the upgrade process didn t work so many of us had to uninstall the previously perfect adt and install a new one which happened to use an older versioning of eclipse for some reason

24870183
margin	height
i put fixed height on .bs-grid-big and half of it to .bs-grid-small + additional 20px to .bs-grid-big since you have h2 inside of small and it gives margin top 20px

24870202
put	get
if you put it back inâ just looping not doing anythingâ then you don t get a deinit

24870208
disk	ram
if you use the first method to get the plaintext password there s a possibility that the ram location that stores the pwd variable will be paged out while the script is running resulting in the plaintext password being written to the disk

24870211
portrait	landscape
if you create an app single view app for example and you set on your project portrait and landscape right in this order then on your view controller you overwrite the method supportedinterfaceorientations with return uiinterfaceorientationmasklandscaperight

24870239
int	boolean
for instance if you want to store a boolean which would be your checkboxes you ll have to do it by storing say an int or a string instead of an actual boolean

24870296
ceil	floor
instead you should use the round instead of ceil or floor

24870321
post	get
i want to get the total number of the blog s post for pagination purposes

24870321

x86	64bit
i ve looked at dependency walker but i get inconsistent results between the 32- and 64bit versions of depends.exe -- c windows system32 kernel32.dll is recognized by the 32-bit version of depends.exe as 32-bit cpu x86 but is recognized by the 64bit version as 64bit cpu x64

24870446
post	get
i had this problem because eclipse age generates the listmethod as post then i care that method doing it a get then the client does not need send any post argument

24870471
mouse	keyboard
it s possible as a general solution with autohotkey a keyboard and mouse shortcut program for windows although it s going to take some work to make it happen without breaking right click on your entire system

24870481
margin	height
crucially the images displayed need to retain their aspect ratio 5 4 and fill the remaining height left below the header bar a small margin top and bottom

24870481
put	get
even this isn t right as i ve had to put a fixed width in to even try and get it to work

24870539
user-controls	tabcontrol
i have a simple tabcontrol inside my user-controls which is embedded in the parent control like this

24870544
width	height
for efficiency though i d probably get the two image buffers of size width height bytesperpixel and use memcmp on them

24870548
int	double
i m doing a random exercise where given an int array and double array you are supposed to calculate the size of an int and a double

24870575
put	get
i have used the datetime-local input to get a start date and an end date from the user to put into the native calendar

width	height
the width and height it takes on the screen

24870763
width	height
specifying width s and height s helps pass google validation rules

24870796

24870797
decoder	encoder
apache commons codec provides a base64 encoder and decoder

24870837
hide	show
just use jquery to hide show the data as the user clicks on the radio buttons

24870896
post	get
well although i know that an angularjs form value must be loaded from controllers and that i can create routes and restful resources with angularjs i am using python and flask to get the page and data but angularjs to post data to the server

24870904
post	get
if they start spamming every post they get their hands on then it s probably time a feature like that should just go away

24870924
width	height
it fails only if the constraints determining the height and width of the subviews are all absolute as opposed to intrinsic

24870924
width	height
it does not respect the absolute width and height constraints of the content view

24870928
setinterval	settimeout
regarding choosing between setinterval and settimeout

24870928
setinterval	settimeout
setinterval and settimeout both simply schedule the execution of code

24870928
setinterval	settimeout
setinterval schedules events every x ms from when it is executed whereas a series of chained settimeout s schedules an event in x ms then executes again then schedules another event in x ms

24871014
google-chrome	firefox
using google-chrome firefox ie - i can browse to all four of the sample urls

24871052
folder	directory
from there i want to save them to the folder upload in the same directory as the handler

24871214
disk	ram
i m trying to locate exact machine memory pages that have been allocated back files which are stored in a linux ram disk

24871214
disk	ram
i m looking for similar thing for ram disk

24871214
disk	ram
for example if i create a ram disk 1mb in size assuming 4kb pages that means there should be 256 machine pages assigned to that ram disk 2 22 2 14 256

24871214
disk	ram
ram disk build on linux s page cache so seems like a good point to start at but i m not sure how to correlate which page cache entries correspond to a ram disk

24871241
post	get
why do you have i usually get get post parameters into model rather than into dataprovider

24871311
google-chrome	firefox
i believe rest console is for google-chrome only but a quick google search yielded a similar looking extension for firefox called restclient

24871323
folder	directory
the content should be located in your theme directory in a folder called woocommerce assuming the programmer made the appropriate overrides

24871324
post	get
if you look at your firebug it is doing a get request instead of a post

24871372
lxml	libxml2	lxml	elementtree
the alternative is to use lxml an elementtree implementation on top of libxml2 which supports all of the xpath 1.0 spec

24871394
children	parent
unfortunately this doesn t work because the parent s children do not get loaded and the loop crashes with a nullpointerexception

24871423
width	height
you can use the getbounds method of a display object to get the bounds actual width height and position relative to whatever display object you pass to the method as an argument

24871423
width	height
the width and height property of the returned rectangle would be what you d use

24871437
stdout	stderr
you need to redirect stdout and stderr for sleep

24871475
punctuation	words
making the method clever enough to take into account words and maybe punctuation so that it doesn t return cut results

24871476
kerberos	ntlm
the supported values for authtype are ntlm digest kerberos and negotiate

24871503

google-chrome and firefox on android support webgl

24871563
mp4	webm
the control currently supports mp4 ogg and webm as seen here

24871595
width	height
you ll also need to set a specific width height in this case

24871650
comparator	comparable
you probably want to have func extend comparable and define a comparator function to make sorting easier and to make the code clearer to read

24871698
width	height
while calculating the width and height after snapping i am using currentpos instead i should use endpos

24871699
portrait	landscape
my application requires to support both portrait and landscape mode except one view in portrait only

24871734
google-chrome	firefox
this does not crash in firefox so i am assuming i am doing something that google-chrome doesn t like

24871776
int	double
java truncates rounds towards zero when you use the construct int d where d has type double or float

24871776
int	double
the issue you allude to does not exist with int which are exactly representable as double for those between -2 53 and 2 53

24871776
floating-point	integer
if the number you are rounding comes from previous computations that should have produced an integer but may not have because of floating-point rounding errors then int math.round d is likely the solution you should use

24871776
int	double
if the computations producing the double d are only computations + - with other int producing intermediate results between -2 53 and 2 53 then d automatically contains an int it is exact because the floating-point computations involved are exact and it is an int because the exact result is an int and you can convert it with the simpler int d

24871827
udp	tcp
that is it not tcp but udp

24871846
maven	pom.xml
fixing up the root maven pom.xml file to include the children dirs as modules and voila they are treated as real java files again woot

subtract	add
i m doing a very basic calculator program in java that asks for the users input and based on what he inputs if add or else either adds up the two values or subtract them

24871872
subtract	add
the problem is i want it to loop so after every equation is finished and the result is displayed it asks the user again if he wants to add or subtract

24871898
children	parent
your parent div is going to be the one whose immediate children comprise the dropdown the links buttons etc.

24871943
nunit	mstest
names for nunit mstest and xunit.net can be found on xunit.net codeplex page

24871943
getter	setter
have a getter setter for user s settings

24871964
implements	extends
the above can be achieved by extends abstracttablemodel too but for my requirement simplicity i will be implements jrdatasource as above

24871987
int	boolean
since any non-zero value is true the not is negating a boolean value not an int so the next steps go like this

24872006
button	checkbox
i currently have a system in which the users employees checkbox radio button to let the employer know whether they are available value 1 or unavailable value 2 on certain dates

24872016
int	double
i also added a cast to eliminate a warning about converting double to int

24872039

your distinct is not working because presumably - you didn t provide the code you have not overridden the equals and gethashcode methods in your lookupitem class so instances are being compared using reference equality

24872618
stdout	stderr
otherwise you couldn t redirect to a filename starting with a literal and any program wherein a user could specify a filename would allow the user to target stdout stderr etc -- but that s no loss of flexibility since you can open any filename on any fd using exec in its redirection-enacting usage mode

similarly this tells us that ieee 754 single precision is good for representing decimal values with at most 6 significant digits because but while double precision can handle up to 15 decimal digits faithfully

24873884
decimal	ieee
ieee 754 quadruple precision gets us 33 decimal digits

24873884

24880258
udp	tcp
the reasons for this are a deep subject but suffice to say that tcp provides many very useful features that udp does not such as ensured delivery of the packets and corruption detection

24881403
udp	tcp
tcp has bigger overhead than udp because it needs to add more data to your payload but you are guaranteed that your data will be received in it s destination in the order you sent it and not corrupted

24881403

24884997
post	get
on the collection archive template there is a custom query that sorts post by season but i can t seem to get the order option to work

24885005
hide	show
how you hide and show the fragments makes no difference all the fragments are sill constantly in memory

24885005
hide	show
instead of combining all of that into one is surely a much bigger drag on performance than the difference between detach attach and hide show

24885005
hide	show
but for the record using detach and attach instead of hide and show would be slightly better memory-wise because those two methods allow for the view hierarchy of unused fragments to be destroyed

24885018
g++	gcc
if you use gcc g++ or compatible tools you can add it as a compiler directive for example in your makefile

24885384
google-chrome	firefox
with most browsers tested google-chrome and firefox my backend will receive no file null but with ie8 there is one with size 0

24885428
put	get
as stated above after you get your matches and put them in an array or something you can check for any string that starts with and you ll know its a tag - the rest of the attributes are captured along with their contents so no worries there

24885461
width	height
this string is basically width x height x depth

24885490
google-chrome	firefox
all same problem on the following browsers - ie google-chrome and firefox

24885545
post	get
the other is you can also use the .ajax which can let you do both post and get requests as you wish

24885547
post	get
i want to send post request to another domain and get json data back

24885571
liferay	web-inf
normally kernel package is in the portal-service.jar which is globally visible to portlets if you have two implementations my bet would be always the kernel version as there s a good chance that the other one is located within portal-impl.jar which sits in liferay s web-inf lib folder hence it s not visible to other applicaitons like portlets hooks etc

24885593
icomparable	compareto
i have series of classes that are implementing compareto method from icomparable interface

inside the for-loop you randomly pick element 2 to 7 of the arrays and increase its current value by 1

24885729
folder	directory
i have below directory in public folder

24885758
jobs	cron
cron jobs do not have access to your environment variables although they are owned by the user they do not run in that user s full desktop environment

24885781
int	chars
this behaviour is beacause the size of int in 32 bit system is 4bytes and when i say ptr_int++ it will increment the value of pointer to size of int which is 4 byte similarly the ptr_char value changes to 2001 as a chars size is byte and ptr_float value changes to 3004 as float size is 4 bytes

24885781
int	chars
in the above example we are assigning address of a chars variable to int pointer and later on incrementing the pointer value by 1 int this will give the address 2004 to the int pointer as the chars was stored at 2000 location

24885792
hide	show
better approach would be not to change existing button but hide it and show another

24885876

multiplication of two n -bit numbers can in fact be done in o log n circuit depth just like addition

24886154
addition	multiplication
i won t explain it here but you can find reading material on fast addition and multiplication by looking up carry-lookahead and carry-save addition

24886167
hide	show	setinterval	settimeout
setinterval is calling itself again and again this will show the content again if you will hide it so remove this or use settimeout instead of using setinterval

24886198

recently i had code in c where i passed the address of an int to a function expecting a pointer to unsigned chars

24886660
getter	setter
all javabean properties must have public setter and getter methods as appropriate

24886670
int	chars
ofc you can use if statements to differentiate between input as chars int etc

24886675
for-loop	loops
like the for-loop can be converted to while loops similarly a foreach loops can be converted to while loops like this

24886699
getter	setter
these objects have getter and setter methods to get and set individual attributes which are also validated there

24886731
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
assuming that you determine the correct method to do a case-sensitive comparison cs and a case-insensitive comparison ci then you probably want to rewrite your algorithm as follows pseudocode not python code

24886768
getter	setter
and contact pojo contains getter setter

24886795
uiview	uipangesturerecognizer
the uipangesturerecognizer is always setting the translation to 0 0 after reaching the uigesturerecognizerstatebegan state - since even the slightest translation is recognized it s designed to work as a trigger only if you set up large threshold for beginning the recognition like 50 50 you will obviously get a lag in ui behavior - as a workaround i would suggest to store the value of the translation and then use a uiview animation to pan the object more smoothly

for-loop	loops
i can t figure out where to put my int victimcount to make it work not just inside the while loops but to use it for my for-loop as well

24887297
getter	setter
my first thought was that we could just apply to this property and then create a string property in which the getter and setter just serialised deserialised the dictionary to xml json or whatever

24887310
for-loop	loops
the compiler can t prove that the while loops will run at least once even though it will so it can t prove that victimcount will have a value by the time it reaches the for-loop

24887359

24888020
equals	compareto
note that hashcode must also be implemented as it must be conform to your definition of equality two instances that are considered equals according to compareto should have the same hash code and because hadoop requires the hash code of a key to be constant across different jvms

should you be using eclipse adt you should upgrade to the latest versioning juno released on jun 24th 2014 at the time i am writing this

24888714
put	get
if the conversion still doesn t work you may have additional problems with the mapping of your json to your object but don t confuse the two issues and put the quotes back - you will get nowhere with that approach - you need valid json first then you can work on making sure that the valid json can be deserialized into the expected object

24888789

one simple solution maybe not the best one is load all your data in one request and work with css to show and hide the group of checkbox

24889886
stdout	stderr
- stdout and stderr from file2.exe should be written to a logfile

24889968
for-loop	arrays
your choices arrays allocating and initializing in for-loop for every k values

24889968
for-loop	arrays
create arrays out of for-loop like that

24889988
width	height
only a block element can have a set width and height making only block-elements susceptible to any form of overflowing

24889988
width	height
this is why it will work the same on both elements when they get a display block so that they re both block elements which an a element isn t by default and they get their width and height set

24890015
width	height
assuming width height of the activityindicator of 32 32 you can pick a size that fits your needs or calculate the size on the fly

24890025
subtract	addition	subtract	add	subtraction	addition	subtraction	add
as for addition and subtraction one can only add or subtract zero to a null pointer and subtract two null pointers - which may be useful in generic programming

24890034
udp	tcp
i want to set oversip as a sip proxy to handle tcp tls and wss connections and relay all traffic to opensips sip server converting all connections to udp only

24890043
put	get
i can put in bad login information or good information and still get a 200 code

24890055

recently upgrade to rabbitmq versioning 3.2.0 from 2.x previously

24890070
subtract	add
you can on the other hand add or subtract the value 0 which is covered in paragraph 7

24890079
folder	directory
however i messed up on the directory and it date stamped everything in that folder

24890098
implements	extends
i decided to implements runnable instead of extends thread for the playthread private class after reading this

24890269
superclass	subclassing
however if i create an inline formset for answer the form only shows the fields for this superclass not for the specific subclassing answer types

24890273
post	get
what you might want to try is using ajax post and get requests to a dedicated page that will handle your database request

24890310
hide	show
when you click the change button you can show the hidden dropdown box and hide the span tag

24890340
versioning	upgrade
so you just need to upgrade to the newest versioning of moq at least it started returning non-empty tasks in my case

24890376
portrait	landscape
in both cases landscape and portrait

24890436
folder	directory
the default root folder is defined in the httpd file found in the apache conf directory

24890448
swift	objective-c
i wrote it with objective-c and don t know enough to convert it to swift

24890503
folder	directory
to use an existing database you need to copy the database from your assets folder to your app s internal data directory on the device before trying to use the database

24890514
post	get
i thought my comment might of been not worthwhile because i reread your post and you said you had the get working so i thought i was wrong

24890537
getter	setter
it is annoying to have to write boilerplate getter and setter but in a long-term view it pays off

24890537
getter	setter
oftentimes though classes that have too many setter and getter pairs have other design flaws and generally too much mutable state

24890537
getter	setter
also in c++ if a class with thousands of getter setter pairs only holds state and defines no behaviour at all it should rather be a struct

24890549
spaces	delimiter
you could in theory use spaces delimiter but reading it in as fixed width is better

24890566
plot	errorbar
i can then plot using facetgrid and errorbar

24890566
plot	errorbar
however keep in mind that the there are seaborn plotting functions for going from a full dataset to plot with errorbar using bootstrapping so for a lot of applications this may not be necessary

24890570
ubuntu	linux
i m using linux ubuntu server

24890608
min	max
support for the max and min operators was added to the c# driver in version 1.9.0 of the c# driver

24890608
min	max
you have to be using at least that version of the c# driver to use the updatebuilder to create update specifications that include max or min

24890608
min	max
these are not the same as the setmax and setmin on cursors which are a different kind of max and min

24890651
post	get
you can use the new taggable_friends api to get ids of friends you can tag and then make an api call to me feed to post an update with tagged friends

24890716
pydev	liclipse
i use pydev liclipse and haven t really figured out how to run all tests at once from the gui

24890720
width	height
i don t think you need to keep changing the source width height and it should be 150 all the time

24890724
put	get
now lets say if we want to search by employee that s easy we put an index employee_id in business_employees_tab and we can quickly get the business ids of where employees works

24890753
google-chrome	firefox
ask your user to run in firefox with firebug or google-chrome with developer tools without vpn and report what s shown in the console tab

24890769
getter	setter
i think what you need to realize is that you re really testing the getter setter and not the actual logic you re implementing

24890841
google-chrome	firefox
if you re running this in firefox or google-chrome i haven t tried in newer versions of other browsers then you could also do this to see the contents of each object

24890856
width	height
the problem is you re sizing the canvas using css rather than the width and height properties of the canvas element

24890856
width	height
however i realize you probably want it to be more than the width and height so you don t see the edges of the shapes but i figure you can fix that up

24890858
integer	unsigned
in c# byte is a unsigned 8 bit integer 0-255

24890898
width	height
the width and height trick was to ensure i get the proportions i wanted.

24890901
width	height
the surface itself doesn t really want to answer what its width and height is therefore it s easier if we get its measurements from the outside and provide it for our custom view from the outside

24890903
filtering	grouping
similar to the sps this non-vcl contains information on entropy coding mode slice grouping motion prediction and deblocking filtering

24891000
width	height
if the source and destination coordinates and width and height differ appropriate stretching or shrinking of the image fragment will be performed

24891007
ssl	https
for https and tls ssl generally the first byte will be 0x16 tls or sslv2

24891031
keydown	keyup
get a variable that knows whether or not the key is down then add a keydown event listener to whatever you re pressing the key on that triggers a timing loop function that stops when the variable is false and add a keyup event listener that makes the variable false like this

24891043
groupbox	panel
the easiest way to accomplish this is to just wrap your listview in an asp.net panel or groupbox and asp will implement the grouping you want

24891109
maven	pom.xml
then i used the maven ear module to add them all in the ear s pom.xml

24891112
sorting	filtering
it s important to understand that if one uses loadonce true option and datatype json or datatype xml or if datatype is neither json nor xml then jqgrid makes filtering sorting and searching on the client side

24891112
sorting	filtering
your current server code don t have server side implementation of sorting filtering and paging

24891167
classcastexception	runtimeexception	nullpointerexception	classcastexception	nullpointerexception	runtimeexception
a failed downcast trying to cast an error declared as throwable to exception will simply result to classcastexception just like dereferencing null will cause nullpointerexception accessing array beyond bounds will cause arrayindexoutofboundsexception and all the other runtimeexception

24891188
stdout	stderr
to demonstrate why i made a little test script with ruby that reads stdin and writes to both stdout and stderr

24891198
submit	submission
what i would suggest is to either use ajax to submit the form or add a check to see if the form has been submitted before and if not prevent a submit via javascript return false javascript code to stop form submission and then also when you have returned the values from your call to googles api you can force another submission via javascript but this time return true if you have verified that the data is in the hidden inputs

24891217
spaces	delimiter
however in the case of the first example it only prints the following due to the spaces delimiter

24891218
udp	rtp
i m dealing with udp rtp multi program transport streams with directshow

24891228
maven	pom.xml

24891233
put	get
but i also get an error when i put the second tag inside the first like this

24891265
isnull	nullif
i have tried the nullif and isnull combinations i have seen posted in a few forums but the syntax in these are causing errors

24891288
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome desktop versions have no error

24891299
integer	unsigned
however your calculation is vulnerable to numeric overflow which is potentially very bad â it leads to undefined behaviour with signed integer types and wrong answers for unsigned types

24891306
width	height
i ve substituted the values of width and height to 512 and 512 respectively and it solves my issue

24891351
ionic	angular
i m trying to figure out how to use standard cordova plugins with ionic myself but the ionic team just recently built ngcordova--an angular wrapper for common cordova apis which includes the camera api you want to use

24891483
hide	show
you can hide show any editable column inside of beforeshowform or aftershowform callback

24891504
width	height
if you want to use different ratios for width and height use the following code

24891632
int	chars
a -normal- keyboard func will get unsigned chars int int as parameters and not int int int you re just consuming more place in memory

24891653
pop-up	dialog

centos	linux	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	linux
note #1 this happens in centos linux i think when i was using ubuntu it was fine

24891664
post	put
i tried with post and put requests but response is always 404 not found

24891665
width	height
gl_invalid_value is generated if width or height is less than 0 or greater than gl_max_texture_size

24891669
ubuntu	linux
now if this error occurred on a linux distro - say ubuntu - it could be remedied by running the following commands

24891669
folder	directory
do i place the folder above in the relevant msys directory

24891671
ng-show	ng-hide
on a crowded screen i have it is is incorporating many ng-hide ng-show directives

24891704
hash	hmac
instagram changed the way it rate limits like comment and relationship endpoints in its api recently...you can sign api post requests with an hmac hash of your client secret and app ip address

24891745
equals	gethashcode
but i have always thought that you more-or-less had to implement gethashcode if you were overriding equals

24891779
pickle	dill
the package dill includes functions that discover how an object fails to pickle for example by catching the error it throws and returning it to the user

24891779
pickle	dill
dill.dill has these functions which you could also build for pickle or cpickle simply with a cut-and-paste and an import pickle or import cpickle as pickle or import dill as pickle

24891792
ienumerable	ienumerator
as you notice here when a type implements the ienumerable interface it should have a method that will return a enumerator an object that implements the ienumerator interface

24891824
nswindow	nsbutton
i was wondering if it s possible to pass the reference of an nswindow to a custom object and then use that object to to add an nsbutton and associated action selector for that button

24891827
puts	gets
when an event occurs in the erp the erp puts a message in rabbitmq and the website gets this message when the internet connection works

24891839
google-chrome	firefox
tested in google-chrome and firefox for windows

24891876
get	http-method
i am trying to update one column using http-method patch and i get the below error

24891895
equals	gethashcode
since you ve changed what equals means adding in wildcards changes things dramatically then you re already outside the scope of the normal use of equals and gethashcode

24891907
google-chrome	safari
linux x86_64 applewebkit 537.36 khtml like gecko google-chrome 36.0.1985.125 safari 537.36

google-chrome	firefox
the menu works fine in google-chrome firefox and ie 10-11 but it doesn t show the sub-menus in ie 6-9

24891971
ssl	https
the problem is that if a user types the redirect url into their address bar directly rather than clicking the link for directly typing the original pre-redirect url the ssl certificate doesn t match correctly not sure how to state this and the user will get a this may not be the website you re looking for error and then the https padlock symbol with a red x over it in the address bar

24891974
min	max
descrption i did it with authsubtoken as well as hard coded login credentials but not receiving response my app having min version - 14 max version - 19 library used - androidmarketapi 0.6 protobuf-java 2.2.0

24892039
equals	gethashcode
in general whenever you have changed equals you must implement gethashcode if you want to be able to store the objects in a hashtable a and have it work correctly

24892039
equals	gethashcode
the general contract is to always implement gethashcode if you override equals as you can t always be sure in advance that later users won t put your objects in hashtables

24892041
equals	gethashcode
having gethashcode always return a constant is the only legal way of fulfilling the equals hashcode constraint

24892043
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox and google-chrome

24892086
post	get
get for new and post for create with a single route

24892166
chown	chmod
chown that folder to www-data appservers and chmod 0770

24892271

note the use of save_reply_board_conversation_path instead of reply_board_conversation_path given that the form would be submitting a post request instead of a get request

24892382
ubuntu	linux
i am writing a script that will be executed on a linux ubuntu vm as the myuser user

24892429
post	get
this is extremely strange at first i thought it was an issue with formmail but upon further inspection i realized that i can not pass any post or get variable with the value of search engine optimization

24892431
boost	allocator
in the case of boost fast_pool_allocator the pool is a singleton owned by the allocator implementation

24892431
boost	allocator
you can access the allocator via get_allocator function of std vector or you can use static functions in boost fast_pool_allocator

24892488
int	chars
i was originally extracting by masking and shifting the hex values to obtain a c++ chars short int of 4 7 11 8 bits

24892528
ddms	adb
it doesn t have the same problem or any similar problems that eclipse ddms has connecting to devices which are recognized by adb

24892551
sudo	passwd	sudoers	passwd
what you do instead is configure sudo via etc sudoers to allow exactly that user to execute exactly that script without a passwd

24892551
sudo	passwd
if you remove the path to script part myuser will be able to sudo anything with no passwd

24892576
portrait	landscape
draw 1 visual per page i would suggest keeping them all landscape or all portrait oriented to keep it simpler for now

24892580
sudoers	visudo
run visudo to edit etc sudoers with validation in place

24892580
sudo	passwd
this will prevent sudo from ever asking for a passwd for any user for any command

24892769
maven	pom.xml
it seems in this case i was dealing with a jar that didn t have an associated pom.xml file in our maven nexus repo and also my local repository

24892769
maven	pom.xml
if this is also your problem urrent work around if you do not actually need to use classes from that jar in your own code for instance a transitive maven dependency only you can actually get away with commenting it out from the pom.xml temporarily maven project reload and then uncomment it

24892784
many-to-many	one-to-many
i have a one-to-many table actually application will actually use a many-to-many but that is not relevant to my question

i saw the source of the controller class from github the controller class in symfony extends the abstract class containeraware which implements the containerawareinterface interface which has a method setcontainer containerinterface container null

24893466
portrait	landscape
this works great on an image in landscape mode but a picture in portrait mode results in a thumb that s too narrow

24893466
width	height
i m looking for a thumbnail from a picture that either has the full height and crops the width to fit or the full width and crops the height always resulting in a 154x208 thumbnail with no padding using imagemagick

hex	binary
i would like to be able to convert from a hex byte to an 8 bit binary string or bit array modify a single bit in the string and convert back into a hex byte

24893684
getter	setter
it s been observed that hibernate marks an entity as dirty when there are trailing spaces in the database value and trim is being used in getter setter

24893684
getter	setter
so the issue here is that loadedstate is having the values read from resultset as is with trailing spaces setter method is not used where as values are prepared using getter method - this is causing the entity to be marked as dirty and trigger unwanted update queries

24893721
build.gradle	gradlew
i make all of the solutions in here with no result so i look in another place and i found a way to trick the ide so you have to put a line in the mainfest to make the gradlew use a different one the one that you put on build.gradle the line is

24893728
button	checkbox
as you can see i am attempting to make checkbox behave as radio button it is impossible to change the html in this scenario

24894023
for-loop	arrays
i then created a for-loop that goes through the arrays and finds any object with missing data

24894073
viewdidload	viewwillappear
also you should be doing this in something like viewwillappear or viewdidload and not initfromnib as you re guaranteed that outlets are set up correctly by that time

24894085
folder	directory
you manually inject the package into a folder that is managed by composer which can wipe that directory if seen fit and you incorporate the autoloading sort of into your own code

24894101
versioning	upgrade
if you are a php developer you can install the last versioning of apache mac os x uses 2.2 php and all the extensions you need then upgrade all with one command

24894327
width	height
there are only 2 possibilities either fit the picture s width to the container s width or fit the picture s height to the container s height

24894327
width	height
for each calculate the ratio needed to scale the dimension width or height you are fitting to the container and use that to scale the picture s other dimension if this causes that picture dimension to exceed the corresponding container dimension then this possibility cannot work

24894350
post	get
i am trying to get a count of how many post contain the text emailed-image to use down the line but something here is tripping me up and i think its just my syntax but i can t quite seem to catch what it is

friendly advice keep the size of your image both height and width dividable by 4

24898136
width	height
so if you downscale it from 3000 width to 1499 than you will not be able to choose an integer for image height to keep the original aspect ratio

if the file is spaces or tab delimiter looks like it to me then you could use

24898973
many-to-one	one-to-many	many-to-many	one-to-many	many-to-many	many-to-one
however you are not using an actual habtm association in the sense of using the habtm functionality provided by the orm but you are manually creating a many-to-many association using one-to-many and many-to-one associations and so the default table name conventions apply where the plural model name is being used and that is permission_roles

hide	show
i m aware that i will have to create 4 separate divs but i don t know how to show hide the ones depending on

post	get
so as an example if i create a new page post in my wordpress admin i get the following permalink url provided after publish

24918711

24918986
hex	binary
i have a binary buffer data which has some hex data and if i print it i d get this

24919007
width	height
typically you would set width or height to 0dp and then set the weight

24919007
width	height
if you have 2 items and you set the weights to 1 they would both take up half of the respective width or height

24919007
width	height
if you set one to 1 and the other to 2 then the one set to 2 would take up 2 3 of the layout s width or height and the one set to 1 would be 1 3

you can test by using the postman plugin for chrome it ll let you send put post delete as well as get and you can see the results

24919409
filtering	grouping
from the query and the results it looks like there is 2 categories that meet the filtering criteria grouping by will not make them go away you might be missing a join which might filtering out one but most likely you need more filtering criteria to eliminate one of the category names

24919455
pull	push
i also some time ago had to change the directory structure of the project on my machine though have had no issues with push pull

24919467

ok using directory you should not talk about folder but organizationaunit ou

24919483
pull	push
this way you have a local repository where people can pull or push according to their permissions and you have an external one which you will have to keep up-to-date manually

24919514
printf	strcpy
you would expect the printf to print 42 but the variable foo gets overwritten by the strcpy

24919526

width	height
we are using tinymce 4 and our users are annoyed that you cannot take a table within the tinymce textarea editor drag its width and height and change it

24920106
width	height
the only way you can adjust the table is by going to the menu selecting table and modifying values for width height in pixels

24920106
move	drag
it ends up in a state of confusion...you basically cannot release the drag of the table it keeps getting bigger and smaller as you move your mouse - but you can never let go and release it to get the size you want

24920116
set	bag
update if i set the bag input so that each tuple has one value then this script works

24920154

24920160

while using 5.4 i could go to var lib php and would chmod 777 sessions -r and the problem would be fixed but now i can t find a sessions folder in that directory

24920168
folder	directory
in addition to this the jar file will launch with the working directory as the parent folder if it s dist app.jar dist is the working directory while the application will show my user drive as the working directory

24920168
awt	swing
the jar looks like swing and says users me documents app dist . while the app looks like awt and says users me .

24920171
folder	directory
there is no htaccess file in the sub directory neither in checkout folder

24920188
put	get
this approach is sensible when you expect to get arbitrary large lines for example someone will decide to put some base64-encoded data to the configuration file

24920219
onchange	onfocus
when onchange onfocus are triggered the client sends a get request towards to the server

24920226
versioning	upgrade
now my development device is running android versioning 4.4.2 so my goal is to upgrade my application to handle gcm properly for all devices for now lets ignore the fact that i ll have to differentiate how to handle push notifications depending on api level

24920359
post	get
i am trying to clean up the release folder using post build event so i delete .xml and .pdb files and try to copy all dll files into custom lib folder bug i get post build exited with code 1

24920400
post	get
i found this post discussing how to send an array but i can t get it to work

24920403
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
it appears that a subclassing is considered to override the superclass behavior even if all it does is inherited the superclass behavior

24920403
inherited	subclassing
the subclassing does indeed provide the reflected method it just provides it via inherited

24920403
superclass	subclassing
if you actually remove the reflected method behavior in the subclassing by returning notimplemented the superclass method is correctly called after the subclassing one

24920403
superclass	subclassing
it should say that the subclassing reflected method is always tried first for comparison operators regardless of whether the subclassing explicitly overrides the superclass implementation

24920403
superclass	subclassing
in practice this is unlikely to matter since the only time you notice it is when the subclassing doesn t override the superclass

24920403
superclass	subclassing
but in that case the subclassing behavior is by definition the same as the superclass s anyway so it doesn t really matter which one is called unless you re doing something dangerous like mutating the object from within the comparison method in which case you should have been on your guard anyway

24920432
width	height
for instance you could manually adjust the width and height of the tablelayout or set a scalegesturedetector on it

24920447
put	get
and you will either get a no change if you have uncommitted changes that conflict with upstream changes or b the same effect as stash pull apply a rebase to put you on the latest changes from head and your uncommitted changes left as is

24920476
post	get
instead only instantiate one time for each of get and post

24920485
implements	extends
of course this means implements caching mechanism yourself maybe by extends ehcachecache or since you re using spring maybe extends abstractcachemanager or ehcachecachemanager could be an option

24920523
hide	show
if there is a trigger from drop down selected then you need javascript to show and hide

24920683
post	get
to get all the comments for a post you have to make a separate request

24920698
width	height
it is distorted because you are using a fixed width and height for the camera so it simply stretches to fit whatever size window screen you re putting it on

24920698
width	height
your viewport won t properly respond to screen rotations or desktop window resize unless you put viewport.update width height into the resize method

24920698
width	height
this is most convenient by simply putting viewport.update width height into the resize method

24920834
datastax	solandra
afaik datastax enterprise search is the commercial successor of solandra

24921175
orientdb	neo4j
graph neo4j orientdb etc - the most intriguing the use of both edges and nodes makes for an interesting value-proposition but mostly useful for highly complex relational data rather than general use

24921206
octal	decimal
seems octal doesn t get much attention at least not as much as decimal and hexadecimal

24921209
exploratory	metrics
the equivalent problem but in unsupervised learning is called clustering you have a dataset you have no model to support on and you want to get an idea this is best suited for exploratory analysis on hoy your data is grouped based on some metrics variance mean distance between each individual on the same group so on so forth

24921324
children	parent
it looks for siblings as in elements at the same level essentially this is just a count of the children elements from the parent excluding the the current one

24921345
post	put
on the other hand new_delivery might be nil as per your sample data at the beginning of the post probably because you assign a value to it after you ve put it in the array the value in the array will not change - you need to swap those lines

24921391
sorting	filtering
this way you store day month year hour data directly into your events and you have much more flexibility for sorting filtering and all sorts of usage

24921393
getter	setter
if you create a file with public wrapper class lets say personwrapper that provides getter and setter for age

24921393
getter	setter
but these getter and setter can have your desired logic of validations such as what values can be set for age who can etc

24921393
getter	setter
within the same file person class may be defined as private but with plain getter and setter for age param

24921393
getter	setter
your personwrapper should only use person class getter and setter on some predefined conditions

width	height
what i want is the form to be position absolute and keep it s width and height to the 100 of the div not more not less

the third way i can think of is sort of a hack that takes advantage of boolean can be upgraded to int in type conversions

24922266

it s not a good aproach to mix types like this int with double

24927288
int	double
since you are using object as a type you won t be able to get both int and double from the map

i do get a logfile but there is no date time the out put is just bunch of messages underneath each other

24928467
portrait	landscape
first you have to understand that in order to open even just one view out of over 40 in landscape your app should allow both landscape and portrait interface orientations

24928467
portrait	landscape
then because you allowed both landscape and portrait for the entire app you will have to tell every portrait-only uiviewcontroller that it should not autorotate adding this method s implementation

24928514
post	get
normally to add a single post view to a uiview i simply instantiate it feed it my post object and then add a single constraint that pins the width of the singlepostview to the superview at which point things get laid out nicely

in google-chrome the icon is displayed in firefox it is displayed too

24930395
for-loop	loops
however if your use case falls into one of the above categories you ll just have to fall back to using the standard for-loop it s hardly that much more code to write after all and is certainly much better than hacking around a for each loops to get the same result.

another method using a single global variable you can store all objects to be free in an array of pointers or a linked list this example uses realloc doesn t check m re alloc for brevity

24930932
int	chars
i found the nan responses lacking because they don t pick up on trailing chars so 123abc is considered a valid number so i tried converting the string to an int and back to a string and ensuring it matched the original after conversion

i am not looking for html5 validation i.e input type number min and max value

jar	manifest.mf
if yes unzip your output jar find meta-inf folder and check what is inside manifest.mf and tell us

24931615
decoder	encoder
before looking at this i would have expected there to be an abstract onmessage function which needs to be overridden and explicit registration functions for encoder and decoder

24931704
centos	linux
i am running centos 5.8 linux and plesk 11

24931791
neo4j	aerospike	aerospike	couchbase
since you already use a nosql engine which is rather efficient neo4j you need to consider only engines which are truly designed for raw performance low-latency stores memcached redis couchbase aerospike to name well-established open-source products

24931791
aerospike	couchbase
i would say you can probably implement what you want with redis couchbase or aerospike but aerospike 3 does not seem to have yet an officially supported ruby client

24931791
aerospike	couchbase
supporting multiple data accesses paths consistent indexing data structure will be easier with redis and aerospike than couchbase

24931791
aerospike	couchbase
high-availability will be easier with couchbase or aerospike than with redis

24931791
aerospike	couchbase

24931923
min	max	union	distinct
if your columns are indexed individually or as the first field of a composite index using min in this way will allow use of min max optimisation thanks cl. although i d use union all instead of union to avoid a distinct step

24931923
min	max
since this query contains more than a single min it will not use min max optimisation either

24931945
viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidappear	viewwillappear
btw typically you d create the uilabels in viewdidload as you have it but put the animation in viewwillappear or viewdidappear

24931968
pow	sqrt
note that such an optimization may not always be possible for pow d 0.5 since it returns 0.0 if d is a negative zero while sqrt d returns -0.0

hide	show
if it is show it will hide it

24941680
hide	show
this is what show or hide is going to do for you under the covers in jquery so you might as well avoid conditionally adding in javascript and just add this style yourself

24941687

here is a jsfiddle that demonstrates a simplified version of this using button instead of checkbox and divs instead of images

24942333
sequence	permutation
i think the next step is to decide the sequence in which you wish to generate permutation

24942333
sequence	permutation
if you are happy with this sequence of permutation there is little more to do

24942333
sequence	permutation
if you intend to generate every possible permutation and then sort them by total say the generation sequence does not matter

24942333
sequence	permutation
before adding the explanation for this sequence i saw your comment saying you would be happy with every permutation

24942507
portrait	landscape
i have a root rectangle the window itself which contains some other rectangles in qml and i want it to be rotatable from portrait to landscape but currently when rotating to landscape the window stays the same size while the image and contents of the window rotate and part of what was visible in portrait mode is lost beyond the borders of the window because the window does not resize to reflect the rotation

int	chars
because it s faster and simpler for the computer to compare int than chars for example

24942581
ssl	https
2 3 transport level security means that all traffic is encrypted by the transport layer ssl https

24942644

looking at the documentation you sent - you cannot push pull to the repository with the api instead you use the normal way to interact with the git repo - using a commandline tool or whatnot

24942656
portrait	landscape
so i have a game surface view and thread that draws on the cavnas and all that gamy stuff and everything works fine in portrait mode but i want my game to be played in landscape mode so i have changed the mode in the android manifest like so

qlayout	qwidget
attempting to set qlayout â œâ on qwidget â œwidgetâ which already has a layout

24942847
swift	objective-c
the anomalies you are seeing are because there is some implicit conversion happening between the basic swift types and the basic objective-c types

24942849
int	chars
function sscanf expects to get pointer to unsigned int when you specify x but you pass pointer to chars and there is no way sscanf itself can validate that

24942849
int	chars
so here sscanf dereference pointer temp as pointer to unsigned int and overwrites memory around temp variable as sizeof of chars 1

24942859
oncreate	recreate
when the activity is recreate your code should take those variables from the bundle passed in oncreate and use them to display the correct fragment with the correct information

24942870

24942965
aggregate-functions	sum
in mysql you can use the condition in sum function to get your desired count sum with condition will result as boolean 0 or 1 and you can have your count based on different conditions also you are using an aggregate-functions but with out grouping them i.e group by somecol so this will apply to whole table and considered as one group

bower	npm
i am installing bower locally in my directory using this bower.json file after having done npm install

24943392
for-loop	arrays
because this is a two dimensional arrays you will need a nested for-loop

24943461
for-loop	arrays
you cannot use indexof to do complicated arrays unless you serialize it making everything each coordinate into strings you will need to use a for-loop or while to search for that coordinate in that arrays assuming you know the format of the arrays in this case it is 2d

24943480
post	get
i realize that you show a json array in your example above but it is worth double-checking since you re getting the exact same error you d get when trying to post a single document that is not part of an array

24943484
qtoolbutton	qpushbutton
you can use a qtoolbutton instead of qpushbutton and add actions to the qtoolbutton

in general you ll have more variation with multiplication and division than with addition and subtraction

24943516

you could create a subclassing of android.view.button and override its ondraw canvas method to draw the image before calling super.ondraw to let the superclass draw the text and border

24943592
serializable	deserialization
you can try use json.net newtonsoft to do the serializable and deserialization

24943613
free	malloc
so it s nice not to have to think about malloc and free and just to rest some trust on that but that doesn t mean it can read our minds

filtering	grouping
you can use a self join and count query with grouping by and also a where clause to filtering out reviews only

24943959
pull	push
however i didn t get the push and pull working

24943965
oncreate	recreate
you should store the id of the image that the button had on it and then when onrestoreinstancestate is called or if you are having it recreate your activity oncreate is called re-initialize the imagebutton with the id

int	boolean
i have a bunch of fields that i am parsing in xml and they need to be converted to int or boolean type depending on the field

24944103
int	boolean
this naturally throws a runtime error when i try to convert an empty string to boolean or int

24944117
haskell	ocaml
you end up with looping recursion due to the strict semantics of ocaml as opposed to the lazy semantics of haskell

24944138
opcache	apcu	opcache	apc
while opcache doesn t support the user-side caching functionality of apc it can still be a useful tool and so the pecl module apcu was extracted from the original

24944182
pull	push
so the pushes and pull don t cause the divs to wrap around to the next line and just push them over more

24944193
int	boolean
php is automatically casting those boolean values to int

24944196
int	chars
i understand that a chars is a smaller size than an int

24944311
stdout	fflush	stdout	stderr	stderr	fflush
if you can t get a debugger working then you can output to stderr or to stdout with fflush to find out where it is getting up to

24944314
int	chars
you are reading an int probably 4 or 8 bytes from a pointer that only has one byte of storage sizeof chars

24944314
int	chars
you can t read an int worth of bytes from a chars memory slot

24944335

if you are talking about your activity getting visible invisible check onresume and onpause of the activity life cycle in the android documentation

24944348
int	chars
i understand that a chars is a smaller size than an int

24944354
width	height
but now the issue is height and width

24944354
width	height
if height width then i want width 100

24944354
width	height
if width height i want height 100

24944354
width	height
min-height 100 but then without setting the height or the width the image is way too big

24944369
hide	show
you are using getelementsbytagname incorrectly it returns a nodelist which doesn t have a style property but that s just preventing your having a different problem if you hide body it doesn t matter what you do with anything inside body it won t show

24944409
getter	setter
getter and setter

24944478
folder	directory
i ve tried coding it to where certain flags on the directory will stop this but i then do not get all the folder on the computer...

24944535
width	height
one solution is to use jquery to set image width and height based on the aspect ratio

24944536
width	height
using vector instead of void could be a problem in the original code if the width and height provided was wrong or miscalculated the program will read invalid memory because there is no notion of size of lpbits

24944563
onchange	onsubmit
then you can deal with them as you wish onsubmit onchange

24944583
setinterval	clearinterval
every time you hover over your image you kick off a new setinterval since your clearinterval command isn t really doing anything

24944591
subtract	add
the code should add and subtract binary numbers

24944600
touchesbegan	touchesended
i guess it s because method - void touchesbegan and method - void touchesended cannot be called at the same time

24944617
plot	heatmap
the dendrogram plotted with plot rowdend is what i would like to see on the row dendrogram for the following heatmap

24944647

as you can see in this article there was a time when firefox google-chrome and webkit did not support the value copy

24944679
width	height
the dimensions are height 340px and width 260px

24944722

i get the proper min max sales week range

24944846
range	max
if there are 2 or more sku sales week range then pick up the max one better if it starts from week 1 of 2011

24944846

if the view s width height change tough and following that the width height of the windowmanager.layoutparams the view animates to its new place

24944925
screens	tablet
the site has a full screens background image across mobile tablet desktop

24944925
google-chrome	safari
using ios safari android browser or google-chrome on android the background jumps slightly when a user scrolls down the page and causes the address bar to hide

24944928
getter	setter
here is my object class that has all the getter setter

24944938
inherited	properties
if all your pocos properties are virtual ef will use proxy object that inherited your poco type with all the properties overridden to track changes

24944945
sorting	grouping
and will be quite efficient especially if you have large grouping as this doesn t require fully sorting them

24944999
width	height
i assigned some random static width and height values because i can t get them from your code example but it works the way you are trying to achieve

24945004
google-chrome	firefox
it usually but not consistently works in firefox google-chrome when run from the console but not from an embedded script

24945041
int	chars
now reading the dereferenced pointer causes ub because we treat some memory as if it stored an object of type int which is not true unless we copied one there from a valid int variable - treating both as buffers of chars - or we last stored an int there

24945116
int	chars
the currently proposed resolution seems to be to specify that these chars literals are also int s and have implementation defined values although the proposed language isn t quite right for that just like multichar literals

24945184
swt	swing	awt	swing
i m not using swt i m using swing and the regular awt that comes with java

24945214
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested this across google-chrome and firefox on osx and windows and ie11-8 and it works on all although ie8 will freeze for a bit if you don t actually have a printer installed

24945240
google-chrome	firefox
but it looks like labels are not tabindexable in google-chrome - firefox and ie are fine

24945280
blogspot	blogger
i thought of using php to render the same but the platform blogger blogspot doesn t support php either and obviously usage of scripts is a big no no considering crawlers won t crawl them

24945280
post	get
note manually adding meta tags for each post is a big no no considering how much lengthier it will get inside the html template besides that it s not productive at all for 1000 s of post besides that everything is there the data tag and all i need is a way to include it inside the meta tag

24945283
optgroup	fieldset	optgroup	checkbox	button	checkbox
this works on multiple checkbox and radio button too but instead of optgroup wraps elements in fieldset

24945300
width	height
_screenparams will contain the width and height of the current render target

24945328
post	put
this is done through a post request usually but others such as put can also be used

24945328
post	get
a lot of contrived examples of rest i myself did this tried to follow as much of what has been defined in the http protocol after going through that i decided to be more pragmatic and left it to get and post only

24945337
put	get	post	get	post	put
i want to add a header to any endpoint no matter what method is used get post put delete

24945339
int	chars
i want to apply a long index vector 50+ non-sequential int to a long list of vectors 50+ chars vectors containing 100+ names in order to retrieve specific values as a list vector or data frame

24945340
width	height
here s a list of values for this.app.dpi.active and the resulting tile width and height

24945340
google-chrome	firefox
i have checked these vales in google-chrome and firefox and they are identical but things work in firefox

24945340
width	height	google-chrome	firefox
the this.scale value 4 and when the width and height aren t multipled by this.scale it works fine in firefox and google-chrome

24945352
mapply	lapply
whenever you have a problem that is like lapply but involves multiple parallel lists vectors consider map or mapply map simply being a wrapper around mapply with hardcoded

24945365
iboutlet	ibaction
lplrich from the comments above is correct writing the iboutlet and ibaction by hand and wiring up in the reverse direction to storyboard works for now

24945377
width	height
as it is now it is adjusting its width based on the browser window but i can t get it to adjust its height

24945378
mp4	h.264	h.264	hevc
i am trying to support mpeg2 h.264 avc and hevc codecs either elementary streams or in mp4 container

24945379
websphere	ibm
we re using ibm websphere was spring framework mybatis and oracle

24945382
mouse	keyboard
example javascript apps include everything you see on the web on the popular sites whenever something animates makes a sound reacts to your keyboard or mouse input or shows you 3d content without loading flash or similar plugins you re usually dealing with javascript

24945402
ceil	floor
for floor and ceil the reasons are the same but note that

24945407
ceil	floor
ceil and floor by definition return integers so how come they don t return ints

24945407
int	double
so if you take a double argument that is too big to fit into an int there is no good way for floor to deal with it

24945410
int	double
because all int s can be upcast to a double without loss and the pow function on a double is no less efficient that that on an int

24945423
ienumerable	icollection
icollection and ienumerable list shouldn t implement only

24945439
.htaccess	httpd.conf
have a look at your httpd.conf to see how mime type handling is done for .php files and simply do the same thing for .blah or use mod_rewrite to change urls ending in .blah to internal redirects to .php through an .htaccess

24945443
width	height
it involves resizing the div to +400px +400px and repositioning instead of resizing to a negative width height

24945459
integer	unsigned
to an unsigned integer

24945466
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
it breaks in google-chrome and the new opera but no in firefox

24945500
int	boolean
if i convert these vectors into string with whitespace-separated numbers i would be able to use boolean query with should statements for this search but i think that using arrays of int should be faster

24945551
versioning	upgrade
it is possible that the tests failed because there are some differences between your php versioning or possibly because the way you upgrade the language caused a problem

24945555
rss	feed
i am trying to get my rss feed to appear floated right about as high as the nav

24945555
rss	feed
i floated my rss feed to the right and it still won t go

24945592
int	double
there may be some fringe conversion issues such as the next full int in a double may not exactly be representable but by and large you re going to get a much larger range of numbers than you would if you strictly dealt with int or longs

24945602
folder	directory
you need the specified file inside of the project directory folder outside of the src folder then access it by name and the type if necessary

24945653
erlang	elixir
i ve been looking at the erlang documentation and the elixir documentaiton but i don t seem to be able to get it working

24945677
free	malloc
the heap can be dynamically allocated to any size necessary limited by system parameters but all memory allocated on the heap must be explicitly deallocated using call pairs of malloc free so the programmer is given more responsibility with dynamic memory management but also more possibility of screwing up with things like accessing free memory and dangling pointers

i am using a command item template to provide the show hide button which is appearing but when i click the button to show or hide the filters with the showhidefilters javascript method using the grid.get_mastertableview function it can not find the get_mastertableview method on the grid object

24956071
put	get
if it is possible to put that div into some another then you can simple get it like below

24956081
for-loop	loops
you ve probably thought that the break statement will somehow magically know that you don t want to end just the for-loop but also the while loops

24956169
hide	show
here is the jquery i am using to hide show the individual elements

24956169
hide	show
my aim is to simply show the selected div and hide the other three depending on which element is selected

24956182
fast-forward	merge
it makes things clearer in the picture so i assumed the merge are non fast-forward so that we always see what happened even if those merge commits are actually useless

when you launch an ec2 instances you get a root volume c on ebs by default it would only be transient if you are using instances storage

24956397
folder	directory
i have extracted that jar by renaming it as .zip and what i found is that the origin jar lies inside that zip folder with the name i have provided my_jar_name.jar along with an meta-inf directory

24956461
for-loop	loops
that s simple the condition for your for-loop is - it only loops as long as t is five but since you set at first it doesn t loops even once

24956503
equals	tostring
in your entities you have to exclude the tostring hascode and equals method of the entity that you have the relationship because if not they will start trying to create the tostring and will use the entity you have relationship and this one will do the same with you and then....

24956608
amd	umd
the latest version fuelux 3 is a wip branch and is umd universal module definition which means it can be used with without amd via tags with only bootstrap and jquery as dependencies

24956614
treemap	treeset
one possibility is that you dont use hashmap or hashset but treemap and treeset

24956716
ceil	floor
floor rounds down ceil rounds up

24956789
hide	show
and i am using jquery radio buttons to hide show the tables alternatively

24956813
hide	show
you can toggle a class for any elements to show hide them

24956833
sudo	passwd
for clarity you can use the -p option to sudo to present a custom prompt which can explain exactly why the user is asked for their passwd

24956833
sudo	passwd
option two is also preferable because sudo is highly configurable and the user may already have permission to run specific commands with sudo without a passwd so it s possible the user would not be inconvenienced by a passwd prompt

24956833
sudo	passwd
it s less likely that the user is allowed to sudo arbitrary commands such as your script without a passwd

24956909
pull	push
instead of trying to push data into the fragment view as its activated instead i ll get the view to pull the data in oncreateview - which is called each time the fragment is activated

24956926

tested in firefox google-chrome ie11

24957032
folder	directory
basically i have a directory in which is test.html and a folder called images

24957065
put	get
imagine shelve is a way to keep your work saved when you get up of your desk at 18 00 pm at company on friday and put in a drawer.

24957069
voip	sip
some people say that viber seems to use a modification of sip for signaling with voip phones

24957173
free	malloc	free	realloc	realloc	malloc
you might also think of replacing free malloc with realloc but that would result in an unnecessary memory copy and with the error checking wouldn t even be less code

24957211
inherited	properties
now i am creating a second axes and i want it to inherited the properties of the first one

24957218
post	get
as an alternative i am using the below code to pass values as arguments instead of get or post method

24957257
put	get
when i put the oracle query directly into excel the columns i want come out as column_name column_name_1 column_name_2 not literally column but you get the drift

stdlib.h file contains the header information or prototype of the malloc calloc realloc and free function

24957338
vim	sublimetext
the canonical vim way to do that the dot formula as coined by drew neil is the reverse of the sublimetext way

24957402
pop-up	dialog
dialog can pop-up other dialog but that should only be used when the new dialog is a child of the old one since by default it will be modal and block the parent dialog this is the behavior you are seeing

24957403
width	height
aspect ratio so that both dimensions width and height of the image

24957430
post	put
when i post the form1 details say it then _post all inputs and uploads to the database i keep a couple of fields in the _session so that i can use them on the next forms but when i submit the next form the data that is put into the _post doesn t store anything and submits a blank row to the database

24957471
width	height
the width is determined based on the height and since the height is changing when the image slides down the width changes with it

24957486
submit	submission
then if you try to submit the form again and it has this class jquery will prevent the form from submission and exit the function at return

24957486
submit	submission
for instance have a session variable that stores the last submit date time and ignore any further submission within 3 seconds

24957501
width	height
you re allowing the width of each picture to be automatically determined based on the height

24957550

24957555
webkit	blink
this has only been reproduced in webkit blink browsers on mac osx 10.9

24957628
put	get
my other approach was to put the fincontrols outside the routines but i would get errors that it could not be found

24957636
post	get
i d suggest doing an ajax post and have that return a url which you can have the borowser get to display the page you want

24957637
google-chrome	firefox
the only way to visit the page is to make sure the route is correct in the url bar typing or clicking a link and refresh the page without caching ctrl+shift+r in firefox or ctrl+f5 in google-chrome

24957686
children	parent
you are casting a parent into a children

24957721
for-loop	arrays
ugly solutions create a for-loop that fills up the currentquestion arrays with a large amount of zero s at startup

24957727
put	get
i need to get all the values from a database and put it inside the jtable filling all rows

24957767

google-chrome	firefox
i have no idea why is this happening since it works smoothly in firefox firefox and google-chrome are both last version

24957839
innodb	myisam
your primary problem is that myisam is not the best engine neither is innodb

24957839
tokudb	myisam
if you change to tokudb the inserts will be much faster if you stick with myisam then you could speed the whole thing up by using insert delayed instead of insert

24957869
hide	show
workaround on that is to use widget hide show mechanism believe me i ransack your code and it works

24957881
httpconnection	downloading

24958095
opennlp	maxent
i want to write my own model using opennlp maxent for that i want to implement contextgenerator and eventstream interfaces as mentioned in documentation

opennlp	maxent
i did look at opennlp maxent page but it is not helpful

24958096
ati	nvidia
from a newbie on gpu programming i resort to you for advice be aware that i am not really interested in a particular hw solution so nvidia ati is ok although probably opencl would be better

24958104
maven	pom.xml
the problem i had is that i didn t initially saw with the maven dependencies report that the org.clojure tools.logging jar library was including the slf4j jar version 1.6.2 which i found on the project s github pom.xml file

24958147
coalesce	isnull
precedence would have mattered were we to be using coalesce instead of isnull which is usually preferred

24958166
ubuntu	linux
on my system ubuntu linux with sbt 0.13.5 and some projects from the coursera functional programming course i found the folders all totalled up to 2.1gb for 12 projects due to all the cache files and duplicated scala downloads

24958179
hide	show
the only direction i may work on is to hide some columns and only show them under the trigger of clicking a button or hovering some elements

24958220
qtextedit	qtextdocument
when i do not set a qtextdocument as a document of qtextedit with qtextedit s setdocument method it is shown very small in previews and pdfs like in the image only occupies very small place of the page with whole data and there are no page margins

24958247
mp4	webm
webm is usually more robust than mp4 which can be all over the place

24958298
for-loop	loops
recall that any for-loop can be expressed as an equivelent while loops

24958299
emma	jacoco
if you are using emma or jacoco you can use filters to only instrument or report the results of specific classes or directories

24958312
rss	feed
i am using org.simpleframework.xml to parse rss feed in android

24958400
post	put
i guess it somehow calls .to_json but why is it missing an argument and where would i put it in my post call

24958400
put	get
the whole test looks like this haven t put in assertions yet as i am still trying to understand the error i get

24958472
qabstractitemmodel	qcompleter
i have a qcompleter using my own qabstractitemmodel to help autocomplete a qlineedit

24958514
portrait	landscape
i am trying to have 2 image views sit next to each other on both portrait and landscape

24958570
width	height
this suggests the size is right and the bitdepth is 16 width height bitdepth 8

24958570
fseek	fread
if there is a header and you have some idea of the size of it you can either read that in with fread first or fseek to the start of the image data if you don t need the contents

24958593
getter	setter
this is a very powerful feature of enums in that not only is each enum a fully fledged class that can have constructors setter getter etc but each individual member of the enum can have its own anonymous implementation of the main enum class

24958606
min	max
the ref shows the groups so you just need to grab the min and max wk for each ref to find the first and last records

24958619
width	height
you can setup your collectionview s width and height and then use the center property to adjust it s location

24958621
inherited	properties
note that this version doesn t return properties whose types inherited from

24958627
config	ini
i am trying to edit an ini config file that already has the sections and options i need

24958630
width	height
if no height is given full height is assumed and set width of column to something smaller than you need

24958650
bash	zsh
here s a posix-compliant sed solution that should work on most platforms using either bash ksh or zsh as the shell

24958650
bash	zsh
the while loop then reads each output line and uses typeset to declare and assign the variable note that typeset was chosen for ksh compatibility - while typeset also works in bash and zsh you d typically use declare there

24958654
post	get
and it s working well on normal get methods problem occures when there is some post method

24958660
width	height
the height and width is being calculated directly on the div not in an element in a stylesheet

24958660
width	height
i want the javascript code to add 28 pixels to the width and 55px to the height

24958666
nunit	moq
for testing we using nunit and moq for mocking

24958686
range	max
it s working very well but the matter is when i use some range of number n value max is 52 and k value max is 4 it keeps me returning a wrong value

24958758
width	height
the biggest one is the fact that your background image is probably a large resolution that you are drawing many times just at a smaller width and height

24958761
switching	screens
using this method to switching to a screens which has already been added to a screenmanager will throw an exception

24958784
pop-up	dialog
so on a button click the facebook login dialog pop-up

24958803
width	height
if you want to add height and width dynamically

24958813
google-chrome	firefox
i know sni in not supported by all browsers and it only works with tls but i tested it with google-chrome 36 firefox 30 and ie 10

24958865
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it works fine in firefox safari and google-chrome but when i scroll with the mousewheel in internet explorer in ie 11 this is a slight offset happens and the image returns than to its original position as it is forced

24958874
listview	gridview
i have a wpf application where i use a listview with a gridview set as its view

24958874
listview	gridview

24958945
websphere	ibm
i am getting repeatedly below error while running java application on ibm - websphere application server

24959078
google-chrome	firefox
i used the techorder option to force flash player and viewed in ie firefox and google-chrome

24959110
post	get
and here is dump for get and post vars

24959126
width	height
on every click calculate the new height and width which you can easily find using jquery height and width functions

24959211
union	distinct
select a union all columns except the pks will give you only distinct rows

24959231
ienumerable	iqueryable
gives me an ienumerable iqueryable int

24959232
setinterval	settimeout
another thing is that you can use the native javascript function setinterval instead of settimeout

24959232
setinterval	settimeout
setinterval executes a given function periodically as opposed to settimeout which does it only once

24959240
chown	sudo
i need to execute some sudo commands like chown over files created with apache

24959306
int	double
don t cast double to int since it obviously loses precision

24959343
javadoc	enunciate
i have used enunciate it parses the javadoc and jax-rs annotations of your service classes to generate documentation

24959344
google-chrome	firefox
the following approach works in ie10 firefox 28 and google-chrome 36

24959406
launch4j	jsmooth
you can then generate a .exe file from the .jar using tools like launch4j jsmooth or several other packages search the web for jar exe

24959409
put	get
in order to get access to the package-access lock i had to put my sub-class within the same package

24959412
hide	show
then the action will be called and show hide will happen automatically

24959431
firefox	safari	opera	firefox	opera	safari
but it doesn t work in firefox opera and safari

24959457
hash	md5
fyi mongodb as at 2.6 uses md5 to compute a hash shard key so effectively you are doing the same work in your application code already and making more effective use of the _id index

24959457
hash	md5
if index size is a concern the smaller precomputed values will definitely save you space in the _id index especially if you are storing billions of urls and only want to find documents by the md5 hash

24959477
hide	show
but after this toggle menu button does not show hide the list again or in other words toggle button functionality is all gone doesn t work

24959517
width	height
i took the ratio of the image height to width and then adjusted the div based on the width of the window

24959522
maven	pom.xml
either is manually set in your pom.xml to point to some variable which is not a string but some kind of specific object provided by a third party maven plugin i guess a custom plugin that you or your company may have written and that contains the de.zeb.control.cfgmgnt.tools.contentbuild.utils.applicationcontextholderimpl class

24959548
spaces	delimiter
this chops a string of two words delimiter by one spaces into single words

24959561
thunk	trampolines
the implementation of lazy-sequences will in general unwind nested thunk trampolines style when seq ed and not blow the stack

24959577
google-chrome	firefox
works perfectly for google-chrome and firefox here

24959653
children	parent
the thing is the children and parent are both stored in the same table

24959703
marionette	underscore.js
i am using jquery 1.9.1 underscore.js 1.4.4 backbone 1.0.0 marionette v1.0.3

24959759
post	get
e.g if it is a post request or a specific get request

24959775
min	max
here s the ruby way for the common case of setting an array s min to 0.0 and max to 1.0

24959775
min	max
for a min and max other than 0 and 1 add arguments to normalize

24959808
inherited	properties
your class inherited a public properties called content and exactly this properties is the dedicated contentproperty of the baseclass caused by an annotation like at the baseclass level

24959874
itertools	functools
and the standard library contains functions also found in most functional programming languages standard libraries like map filter reduce and the stuff in the functools and itertools modules

24959885
javadoc	enunciate
also try enunciate it parses the javadoc and jax-rs annotations of your service classes to generate documentation

24959912
folder	directory
collectstatic will take all static files from different static folder in different apps main static directory etc. and put them in the location specified by static_root

24959923
folder	directory
i changed the directory browser settings in iis to enable and when i refresh i get the directory listing of the folder where my site exists

24959933
rss	feed
this is the structure of my xml data from an rss feed

24959950
flask	django
oauthlib a generic implementation of the oauth request-signing logic is avaliable for django and flask web frameworks

24959957
post	get
this post suggests gson are unlikely to support property set get though

24959975
for-loop	arrays
if you want to save the constituent arrays in eventdata to different files you ll need an additional for-loop
