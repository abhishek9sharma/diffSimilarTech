but adding a class to swt package seems harder first because there is different jars depending on the operating system used org.eclipse.swt.cocoa org.eclipse.swt.gtk .... and also because copy pasting the code of styledtext is not that easy since there is call to external methods waiting for a strict styledtext
it s probably overkill for what you need but sproutcore is an mvc framework and it doesn t look any more heavyweight than javascriptmvc or trimpath s junction
i should also say that i have the token at ctx.request.get authorization koa based i think it s something like req.header authorization with express in all routes
slower than the cstdio ones and extensibility iostream allows

so i think afnetworking would a better choice than sdwebimage
dist fonts gruntjs gruntfile.js js less license package.json readme.md
it seems like if the uiimage is slightly larger the ciimage is double the size whereas if the uiimage is slightly smaller this isn t the case
why atom-editor uses more memory and takes more time to start as compare to sublimetext editor

you will probably find that bitvector performs a good deal better than bitarray
telerik has a control called radwindow which is more or less a modal window
odd that elasticsearch is more tolerant than kibana
based on why lodash is faster than native foreach post maybe it s justifiable to use lodash in favour of both underscore.js and native foreach to loop
joe duffy s blog implies using substr is more efficient than strsplit
i find this method simpler than using clearinterval to pause and setinterval again to restart
the only solution i have found is to restart emacs aquamacs which is obviously less than ideal
both a renderscript and opengl are used for getting high performance graphics and animation s.but still opengl is the best option to get high performance graphics because it is well documented and you will have more control over the glsurfaceview .but in renderscript some of the classes are depreciated in the current versions .its almost not possible to make a rssurfaceview to transparent
i double checked the build.gradle s and synced the gradlew files once more
but on the other hand although new the ember.js package is actually more complete imo than backbone.js

as mentioned by loã c faure-lacroix js numbers are much more complicated than unsigned short
but when i change my maxbetamt to 241.55 or 2400.25 this message comes out max bet amount must be greater than min bet amount
it is a feature it is about objectcontext api but the same is true or worse with dbcontext api
mostly interpreted-language are a bit slower compared with compiled-language but i guess the difference is almost negligible in coffeescript javascript because of node.js

i think jedit is equal to or better than notepad++
even more oop-like with setter getter
or scikit-learn directly .for more details nltk 3.0 documentation

dbcontext is much simpler to use than objectcontext and will serve the most common development needs
for more complex xml reading writing you better check xerces which is heavier than tinyxml
note using treeset instead of hashset would give directly sorted arraylist and above collections.sort could be skipped but treeset is otherwise less efficent so it s often better and rarely worse to use hashset even when sorting is needed
in your case whats happening is that your galaxy tablet has a lower pixel density and android down-scales the image from a xxhdpi to whatever density the tablet has hdpi or xhdpi ....so it your image is a 512px image android would down-scale it to 341px for xhdpi or 256px for an hdpi device
currently macports has many more packages 18.6 k than there are homebrew formulae 3.1k owing to its maturity
update i ve created a webhelper class that takes the place of webclient but provides more access to the necessary features of the underlying webrequest
is openrasta better than wcf
so every multiplicative-expression is an additive-expression but not vice-versa and this is what makes multiplication bind tighter than addition
tornadoweb and nginx are popular web servers for the moment and many benchmarkings show that they have a better performance than apache under certain circumstances
for semantic zooming you ll notice that d3.js is significantly faster than protovis
a way with a partialfunction and implicit which looks more like your mapfirst

consider if toggleclass is more appropriate than addclass removeclass
i like to use bufferedwriter more than printwriter and its working with the bufferedwriter
i hear oursql is nicer the mysql-python
the reason for this is that and is strong than or it s like in math where multiplication is stronger than addition 3 5+3 15+3 18
well jspm is much larger and ambitious project than bower
boxlayout is far easier than gridbaglayout because you don t have to learn how to specify constraints

i like caffe but the amount of gpu memory caffe use is larger than mxnet i test in resnet-50 with mxnet-memonger
i read in couple of blogs that in java modulo reminder operator is slower than bitwise-and
a better way to do that instead is taking in an ienumerable which is more generic than icollection since icollection implements ienumerable and simply checking it for null and else returning any from linq s operators
uiview is more generic than uiwindow and should be preferred
go to your user directory c profiles youruser there should be a folder called .m2 may be hidden
thus write-heavy data structures are probably better implemented mutably and with something like a skip-lists where you only need to lock locally while read-heavy data structures are probably better implemented immutably where a tree is a more natural data structure
django s is better web2py s appadmin is for administrators only
if more than one uiviewcontroller hangs off the applicationâ s uiwindow only one of these will get the messages for changes in orientation

seems like paperclip is more file oriented and carrierwave is more object oriented
xna + monogame --- monogame s performance seems only slightly lower than libgdx can build to most platforms
you might be better off with a profiler like visualvm or chronon
use a singletable strategy and if you thing one of the subclassing has more number of fields and need a separate table then mark that subclassing as a secondarytable using secondarytable annotation and use primarykeyjoin there is an annotation for this to join with superclass on pk column
so i went with the alternative approach of using subclasses for uitabbarcontroller and uinavigationcontroller which feels much cleaner and only slightly more verbose
i have read many times that one may not use more than one objectoutputstream or objectinputstream
that s easier with phpquery or querypath
you may also find that opencover will work better than partcover as it has 32 and 64 bit support as well as supporting .net2 and .net4 - and copes much better with target processes that spin off more processes to do the actual testing
gevent is inspired by eventlet but features more consistent api
i d expect gcc g++ is more popular on open-source oses
however converting from nsstring to nsdata gives more reliable json data
sublimetext has better performance than atom-editor
aside from obejctive-c convention and best practices nserror is much more robust and flexibly than nsexception and allows the caller to effectively ignore the problem if they want to
as hroptatyr mentioned the multiplication is quite fast and it s much faster than division
as you can see the keyup events of numpad5 and numpad6 occured earlier than their keydown event
since ireadwrite implements ireadonly ireadwrite is said to be a subclassing of ireadonly although subclassing is more accurately used to describe a class which inherited a base class rather then implements an interface--for the sake of simplicity they are very nearly the same concept
in java-8 permgen was replaced with metaspace which is more flexible in terms of memory usage so you rarely need to tune its size explicitly
...i suggest doing all of the scripting from within the vbscript file and avoiding the use of .cmd .bat files completely if you can as vbscript is much more readable and powerful though i prefer using the jscript language instead but that s just me
other then hiccup and enlive there is the lesser known fleet which is closer to popular ruby php solutions
for something more robust check out highcharts or d3.js or something built on top of d3.js like nvd3.js

and my test result show it s more accurate than math.h s sin cos at -m_pi angle +m_pi range
you can use asihttprequest which is quite better than cfnetwork
lodash is more modular than underscore.js underscore.js around 5kb lodash around 17kb but is generally lighter because you only include the specific modules you need
i naively assumed that gradlew is better than ivy then when i created my build.gradle the dependency management is even greater mess than of ivy s for the first look
pytables seems more flexible but i am unclear about what the most direct way of using it to save a full pandas dataframe with multiindex and all
see also the retrofit guide which uses okhttp and makes it easier to

using dependency injection e.g autofac this is much easier to assemble than before and with mocking tools nsubstitute moq this is much easier to do than you think
as dimitre says xslt is much better at this class of problem than xquery
to answer part of your second question with .net if the post is larger than maxrequestlength part of the .net configuration but smaller than maxallowedcontentlength part of the iis configuration you can create a custom http module to get at the portion of the post that came through
additionally using java.util.date is not good practice at all since most of its method are deprecated so i suggest you to use java.util.calendar which is more flexible
ienumerable is more abstract and is generally preferred to list or ilist if possible
beststat is innodb so i have row-level locking and consindering i do a lot of inserts-updates it should be faster than myisam
if you have more than one post with the same com_id in eve.com_id you will get multiple post in your result
tvos is more similar to ios than it is to watchos although they all have some similarities
if you are using something like paintcode or have large chunks of uikit code in swift change it to objective-c it compiles far faster
salt sha-512 offers a higher level of security and implementing a scheme where you stretch the hash is even better do some high number of iterations of sha-512 - starting with the password+salt of course
one option is to install testdriven.net which makes it easier to run unit tests on any of the major unit testing .net frameworks nunit xunit.net vs tools etc
keep in mind that i am using lodash by john-david dalton instead of underscore.js because lodash provides better performance and a custom build process
this is better than alarmmanager pending intent - no wakelock draining of battery etc.
again because atom-editor is still in the beta stage sublimetext has much more native plugin packages

i ve written chars counter c extension to python looks like 300x faster than collections.counter and 150x faster than collections.default int
i think the preview function in openkm is more well than alfresco
this one is more for bigloo - is it more functional than ecl
the posts you see seem to be logical as jsr286 is a newer spec and there are some features that make jsr268 portlet not a jsr168 portlet
the union all with a distinct gives better performance though i believe..
in specific i would like the uinavigationbar in the uitabbarcontroller s more view controller to be an instance of my class
the lxml library is proven much faster for parsing and un-parsing xml but celementtree is much faster for certain kinds of manipulation
powermockito might integrate a little easier with testng but i have never used it with junit
usually better than filewriter already suggested is to use fileoutputstream which also like filewriter has an append parameter in one of its constructors and which unlike filewriter does not silently assume the default charset encoding slightly bad practice imo
indeed it would be relatively easy to preprocess a bison grammar file but it is easier with jison because you can compute the grammar programmatically and pass it to jison as a json object
warning mt_rand function.mt-rand max 0 is smaller than min 1 in users avsm www pa-include functions.php on line 332
are compiled-language better than interpreted-language or vice-versa
while openmpi supports more connection protocols there is an infiniband-enabled version of mpich called mvapich
performance of programs in compiled-language is significantly better than that of an interpreted-language
in fact each uiview has even more than 1 corresponding calayer
2 if your host machine laptop doesn t have more ram then you might want to find alternative android-emulator like genymotion bluestacks which takes less memory than android-emulator
based on the output in this example one conflict is that datalab currently has oauth2client version 1.4.12 installed and the google-api-python-client library requires a version of oauth2client that is greater than or equal to 2.0.0
having different ones based upon screens size is reasonable bigger margins on tablet though the mix then would be something like res values dimens.xml and res values-sw720dp values.xml
the basic one and i think the simplest is okhttp but you have to understand that okhttp is no more supported but still work when you downgrade your sdkversion the best solution is to use volley or retrofit
i have simplified the app so the post is shorter but the basic problem is that if i get test in workouthandler - it cannot recognize methods in wardenstrategies or loginhelper unless i also include those files in the handler they are already included in app.rb
it works similarly to mxmlc and compc but compiles faster
jvectormap comes with more pre-generated maps than jqvmap
ps i d suggest using lodash instead of underscore.js if possible as lodash development is more active but that s my opinion
you can create custom controller to serve that files and use send_file mentod in it with disposition inline also you may be interested to x_sendfile_header setting to serwe that files with apache nginx which is faster
if you re looking for a ctrlp equivalent webstorm has a fuzzyfinder that s actually much more powerful than ctrlp
after jgauffin suggestion i used johnskeet code and found that the for-loop with arrays is faster than following
does that mean the the view controller has multiple uiview or that the uiview has more than one calayer
headline qqmlapplicationengine is newer and more powerful than qquickview
i noticed calayer had worse performance than uiview
i d say iqueryable is more suitable for interaction with a database than ienumerable is
my speed test claims that svg is significantly faster than canvas at least snap.svg seems to be significantly faster than fabricjs
shellcheck tends to be more explicit than bash
in my fragments data handling is taking place starting from oncreate which happens earlier than onstart
update for our purposes bltoolkit ended up being a better solution than nhibernate
when i expand the widgets on the left pane by clicking on the controls and the height of the qwidget of the qscrollarea is bigger than then height of the qscrollarea itself the scrollbar appears as expected but it s overlapping the content of the qscrollarea
which java profiler is better jprofiler or yourkit
there are many reasons why git-svn is worse and the kde svn2git is superior
possibly part of the reason of my problems is that the original code from ramnath uses rmaps while i m using rcharts also developed by ramnath as it is more developed better integrated with shiny and of course includes leaflet
i wrote a detailed description of the sstable format on scylla s site scylla is a more efficient c++ re-implementation of cassandra to which i contribute
agreed that using odp.net is better than deprecated system.data.oracleclient
as of now i think dotcover and resharper combined are less expensive than ncover
or if you feel more comfortable with webclient i personnally prefer it over webrequest
dotnetzip is much easier to use than sharpziplib example of zipping all files in folder
i ve found that in my jtable which is in a jscrollpane nested in a jinternalframe there can be issues with scrolling and resizing when the jtable was larger than the jscrollpane
janusgraph is a more up-to-date version of titan despite the low version number
bellman-ford as suggested in your question tends to be slower than either dijkstra s or a - it is primarily used when there are negative edge-weights which there are not here

i expected avx to be about 1.5x faster than sse
you are better off with jacoco than cobertura
grafana is more of visualization only while kibana is for searching the logs is that right
and else is explained why requestanimationframe is better than setinterval or settimeout
did i configure something wrong with kairosdb or opentsdb is actually faster
if you still would love to manage onclicklistener i will tell why onitemclicklistener is much better than onclicklistener

if the taskproperty class is decorated with datacontract attribute and with datamember attribute for each property the deserialization is much faster than when it is decorated with serializable attribute
for listening changes into jtextcomponent is there documentlistener if you have to need control over inputed char sings whitespace chars or word s you have to implements documentfilter
but in your case alertview is displayed above alertcontroller ie why it feels like uialertview is whitier than uialertcontroller
stargazer is at least in my experience more general than latex from hmisc
using libjpeg inside cimg is definitely better
edit h.265 hevc is even better at compression 50 of h.264 size in some cases but support is not yet widespread so stick with h.264 for now
i tried constraints spacing each imageview with xdp it is ok if all textview are not higher than the imageview but if a textview is higher than a imageview it will overlap
the use of gevent is also a performant option but slightly lower than eventlet
also linearsvc class from scikit-learn performs even better than liblinear whch is also surprising considering that it s a wrapper of liblinear
i also think working with seaborn is much easier using pandas dataframes and not numpy arrays
using apaches httpd.conf is faster since accessing the .htaccess adds a small overheadâ apache checks every directoryâ and parent directoryâ for the file and it will be loaded for every request
i need show files from qfilesystemmodel in qtreeview and customize that tree to show one more column with qcheckbox so user can pick 0..n files from that qtreeview
but because of the overhead in the for-loop and the second arrays it is slower as the before mentioned arr.filter as shown by this jsperf
sdwebimage claims that afnetworking doesn t cache the image itself but just the http response so sdwebimage is faster in recalling the image from cache and presenting it
in this case i used one or more spaces as a delimiter s+
the description is related to objectcontext api but dbcontext api is just wrapper suffering same issues actually dbcontext api suffers even more issues in this scenario and because of that i will skip solution with manually setting relationships
for example setting the background-color on a transparency element turns it black...rather than the intended color.
where application authentication authenticationservice is nothing more than an extends of the zend authentication service and implements the identityproviderinterface
i did a lot of research and most people said that split is better than stringtokenizer and bufferedreader
easier than ncurses would be to use urwid
moles is more often compared contrasted to typemock in that it offers a set of facilities outside of moq and or rhinomocks sweet spot
while gulp gruntjs is very popular for build automation which includes bundling all dependent javascript in file and minifying them in to one file webpack browserify is a better option as it supports module import
and perl like any interpreted-language is much slower than a compiled-language
in xda-forums i read about memu - most powerful android-emulator for pc better than bluestacks
should i be surprised that the keras theano backend is about 18x - 19x slower than the keras tensorflow backend
than use bcpow on the integer part and bc_exp on the fractions part which now converges from the get-go since the fractions part is smaller than 1
here is the blog post about the comparison how tidekit would be better than tidesdk
like bruz says cappuccino is probably more freeform at the data layer than sproutcore
for a few bytes passed in just one call probably the bufferedwriter is even worse because it problably later calls fileoutputstream
sorteddictionary offers same advantages than sortedlist but performs better if values to insert are not already sorted
naturally interpreted-language will run slower than compiled-language as compiled code can be ran blindly by the cpu where as compiled code needs to be checked ran line by line
i have read about ienumerable and iqueryable i have read that iqueryable is better with linq because when you use where clauses it creates the exact query it needs but with ienumerable it retrieves all rows from database and then filters on memory
3c why does my uiviewcontroller which is inside my uinavigationcontroller has a longer height than the uinavigationcontroller
using qmap instead of qhash seems more reasonable as neox recommended on his comment
i had the same problem with jsdom and switcht to cheerio which is much faster than jsdom and works even after scanning hundreds of sites
it should be noted that interpreted-language are inherently many time slower than natively compiled-language
for instance for this really_trivial class i just assume that move semantics cannot offer anything more than return-value-optimization and nrvo already does when copying around instances of it
for general testing phpunit is a more well-established product while behat is focussed on tests written using bdd methodology behaviour driven design
in safari 10.0.3 cloneelement is 31 slower for the jsperf test mentioned above in google-chrome createelement is 17 slower for me
i know summernote does that but fckeditor is a more complete tool than summernote so i cant switch to that
h.264 is more often encapsulated in mp4 container and vp8 in mkv
so using easymock with junit should give you better coverage and better tests than junit alone
textcontainer s height need to be set depending on the content height for it to work and that is no better than using uitextview or uilabel
evidently though mod-alias can be somewhat faster than mod-rewrite all other things being equal of course
lubridate is another package from the tidyverse it makes easier work with dates and times
use .val and .keyup using keydown doesn t register the newest value it registers the value before so keyup is better to use for this
i was thinking of using the accounts app but django-userena seems better so i created a project zero with pinax and tried to integrate django-userena with it
i think a tool like lodash or underscore.js is more suited for something of this nature
justmock less expensive than typemock but still expensive
i m not sure if printwriter or filewriter is better but printwriter worked for me
ember.js is larger than backbone.js but thanks to expires cache-control this only matters on the the first load
my imade doesnt display when the image height is less than 981pz width is less than 477pz
you may also want to consider exploring the stringi package which has a similar approach to stringr but has more flexible functions
i don t quite understand why you don t want to use mapply but do.call is probably better anyway
i d rather use fsunit or fstest to write tests in f# it feels more natural than oo xunit.net style tests
the qtablewidget is slightly easier to implement than the qtableview which also needs a qtablemodel as backend but it has less capabilities
using a-star instead of brute force pathfinding will be faster just like how bresenham circles are better than using sin cos
the documentation for deactivate method for nsapplication says that i shouldn t call this method directly since appkit knows better how to deactivate stuff
you can use setinterval instead but for most animations settimeout is easier to control and more importantly.
using an html parser like beautifulsoup or lxml.html is a better idea
i use quadtree more than r-tree and find them super flexible
so i d rename xmlhttprequest to jqxhr which is more dogmatic jquery
this is perhaps a bit cleaner with a setinterval instead of a clearinterval
moreover when .preview div has in a way bigger width than height .page should take heiht as a standart to prevent overflow like youtube player does for example
sorted vector resizable array if getrandom is much more frequent than get put
on intel cpus before skylake packed-integer instructions can always run on more ports than their floating-point counterparts so prefer integer ops
if the layout is repetitive a uitableview uicollectionview is a better choice
i did some benchmarking 3 years ago may be stale... which showed that on large datasets basically postgresql fulltext is 10-100x faster than mysql and xapian 10-100x faster than postgresql but not integrated
nltk is shy of stanford-nlp in terms of quality of output and for everything other than statistical collocation analysis as far as i can tell stanford-nlp has a broader range of practical algorithms
technically you can do it dynamically but that would require doing the registration unregistration somewhere more permanent than onresume onpause which i don t think is really what you want.
or even easier rather than adding uilabel objects to a uiscrollview you could just use a uitextview
it will wrap the original stream in a bufferedoutputstream which is more efficient which is then wrapped into a dataoutputstream which offers additional nice features like writeint writelong and so on
it theano runs much faster than tensorflow
i think datatrigger instead of eventtrigger is more suitable and you need to use x type to specify the bound data to the item
my understanding is the requestfactory is more efficient and recommended over gwt-rpc but it s more of a data entity persistence framework than a request-response framework like rpc
the floyd-warshall algorithm has a worst case performance of o |v|3 where as dijkstra s has a worse case performance of o |e| + |v|log |v|
similarly you might find using jacoco easier than cobertura
glut is much more easier while many of people use sdl or sfml they re more flexible and feature-full than glut
ienumerable is less specific than ilist ilist implements ienumerable so unless you want something specific from ilist such as .count as you suggest or perhaps add delete etc i d use ienumerable
the result is okay but it is slow.is there any way that i can do this with loops instead of arrayfun because i check for-loop is faster than arrayfun
maven uses the classifier construct for artefacts build from the same pom.xml but differing in there content for example one for jdk1.6 or jdk1.7
it is scaling the image to it s width but since it s height is greater it is showing the rest of the uiimageview as transparent what you would expect from uiviewcontentmodescaleaspectfit which is what the uiimageview s contentmode is set to
so i switched to qgraphicsscene qgraphicsview that seems much simpler to use with animations
finally if soappy just isn t working for you try suds it s better documented than soappy
an ienumerable is less specific than an ilist
the result amazed me in the way that as loops goes over bigger range the performance of c# decreases as compared to c..for smaller range c# shown well performance over c....but as upper range of for-loop increases the c# performance degrades as compare to c..
putting it in the jar file among the classes or adding its jar-relative path to the class-path entry of the jar s manifest.mf file is more than sufficient
my team is more experienced with api.ai and only starting to learn luis
due to many improvements to couchdb and that cloudant has more features than vanilla couchdb my suggestion would be to use a c++ http library to communicate with cloudant
in the experiments and discussion below i find that cufft is slower than fftw for batched 2d ffts
so we can use pbkdf2 with sha512 to gain a very significant advantage over the phpass algorithm mainly because sha512 is a harder algorithm with more computation than md5
i believe lodash is a better choice over underscore.js more details in this blog post
the multiprocessed loops is slower than doing the for-loop
but tesseract based on leptonica uses older versions of these libraries which have incompatible parameters
ldpi assets will look bad on high density screens but are exponentially smaller than mdpi which is exponentially smaller than hdpi etc
python -m ensurepip --upgrade does indeed upgrade the pip versioning in the system if it is lower than the versioning in ensurepip
i am interested in this because the factor oracle is easy to construct with 30 lines of c++ suffix-array needs about 60 and suffix-tree needs 150 and it runs faster than suffix-array and suffix-tree
edit this is why autoresetevent does not have a slim version - basically it s because the wait times of autoresetevent are typically longer than manualresetevent so it isn t appropriate to use busy spinning
a more lightweight approach than pandas is to use the prettytable module
or is the do.call with by just typically much slower than tapply
qtoolbutton has smaller default internal margins than qpushbutton
answering your question a chars is an integer-type of lower rank than int meaning potentially and in practice nearly guaranteed smaller size and value-range and thus pointers to either are different types too
since the parent #wr has more children #con_bottom does not fit
you can also try sklearn.linear_model.logisticregression and sklearn.svm.linearsvc both implemented using liblinear that is more scalable than libsvm albeit less memory efficients than other linear models in scikit-learn
i have used restsharp before but refit is alot easier to get running
the later version of jmock makes things easier by integrating with the junit lifecycle as a runner
in dependently-typed languages like idris it s probably more useful than in haskell
i didn t try it because i m more familiar with kivy s internals and because my end goal was more of a kivy app containing vispy visualisations rather than the other way around
i can switching between these two screens easily.at the beginning first screens is fully displayed.when i click a button second screens will come from right and first screens goes to the left.but i want to keep the second screens and remember..second screens has less width a portion of the first screen.that means a half of the first screens disappear
sudo is better in most respects but still requires a passwd which asroot does not
fortunately the vbide for vb6 has more classes and methods for working with vb projects than the vba version of vbide
my problem is uitextview is more complicated than uilabel
now the speed of sql server interaction with r has affected because rjdbc is slower than rodbc but its not too bad
my personal preference is to call setcontentview immediately after super.oncreate so that i know the rest of the oncreate method is less likely to break
but the plugin gulp-ruby-sass slower than gulp-sass
however the method that returns iqueryable takes 15 seconds while the ienumerable takes less than a second
however lately i ve been using tooltipster instead because its integration with jquery validate is somewhat cleaner
this is pretty much the ifloop answer but isnull is slightly faster than coalesce
json jsonb fields support any json-encodable data type not just key value pairs but also tend to be faster and for jsonb more compact than hstore

quadtree indexes are created faster than r-tree
urbg max returns the largest urbg result_type that operator could return strictly greater than min
there is a very good linq video that i enjoy a lot- it hits more than just ienumerable v iqueryable but it really has some fantastic insight
layout-sw320dp-land will pick up drawable from hdpi folder whereas layout-sw720dp-land is mdpi device so it will pick up drawables from mdpi folder which will be smaller than hdpi
alarmmanager consumes lesser battery power than timertask or thread
the system will pick the closest match and mdpi is closer to hdpi than to xxhdpi
tensorflow has better computational graph visualizations than theano and torch
zend opcache appears to be more performant than apc more fully featured and more reliable
customization and variety of animations highcharts has more customizable animations when compared to fusioncharts javascript charts
the problem is that the canvas drawn by cairo is larger than the area of gtk s scrolled_window
coq is probably the most prominent language of the style but agda has a more haskell-y feel as well as being written in haskell itself
it would be somewhat easier with imagemagick than graphicsmagick as anthony thyssen has put together some excellent examples - but they rely on imagemagick capabilities such as aside-processing in parentheses which graphicsmagick lacks
you re better off with domdocument s loadhtml and domxpath
edit .net servicemodel.syndication - changing encoding on rss feed this is a better way
the reason why this doesn t work specifically is because ilist is more specialized than ienumerable
fortunately model-glue has tight integration with coldspring a popular bean container for cfml and model-glue 3 makes it easier than ever to use coldspring beans in your controllers
i know another plugin named jquery corner is available however it s file size being massively bigger than curvycorners i decided to with curvycorners
in arithmetic books and computer software and more-expensive calculators this means 12+ 34 56 not 12+34 56 because multiplication has higher precedence than addition
in simple words all operations on ienumerable causes simple iteratation over all elements well it s lazy ienumerable really slower than iqueryable
because copying text result from jtextfield is always easier than retyping it from jlabel note that jlabel is not focusable
in this case jackson performs better than nashorn which performs much better than org.json
some don t take too well to added components for example grouplayout while others do better such as boxlayout
fleet docs say fleet is no longer actively developed or maintained by coreos and link to container orchestration moving from fleet to kubernetes
sorteddictionary has faster insertion and removal operations for unsorted data o log n as opposed to o n for sortedlist
i have use height 100vh for .container and pulled .footer up by minus margin

have a look at sift and surf and at vlfeat which has a good sift implementation and also implements mser and hog and is much smaller than opencv
i m trying to push a view controller from a tableview displayed inside a uiviewcontroller that is included in a uitabbarcontroller it s more simple that it looks...
i heard geda was faster than both dozer and orika but my only concern is i am not sure if it can be abstracted like dozer and orika as shown in the pseudocode above
an activity that uses fragments is often little more than oncreate calling setcontentview
specifically nsurl nsurlrequest and either nsurlconnection or nsurlsession nsurlsession is a newer api and is suggested for use by apple
the main defference between these two is that awe6 is using openfl to target platforms such as ios and adnroid while flambe is focused more on html5 and flash games
the binary-min-heap you have implemented only guarantees that the parent of two children is smaller than both children as chtz has commented
update graphicsmagick is faster than imagick doesn t means gmagick is better than imagick
key derivation algorithms such as bcrypt and pbkdf2 aka rfc2898derivebytes are much slower than standard hash algorithms

the g++ version is a little larger than the gcc version but not 100x larger
it s no more multiplication than addition so is misleading syntax.
for reading large csv files you should either use readr read_csv or data.table fread as both are much faster than base read.table
codeigniter and kohana has more complex translators but basically are the same above..
rjdbc may also be a more stable option in the linux environment especially now that the fetch code has been re-written in java as of development release 0.2-0 on r-forge its performance is on par with if not better than rodbc
instead methods like .live or .on since the former is deprecated are more useful with mouse and keyboard events generally speaking
i chose to rely only on pycrypto and pyopenssl since m2crypto is less popular and not well-maintained which is a hazard from both compatibility pypy and security perspectives
.net makes this better by separating nullreferenceexception you dereferenced a null value from argumentnullexception you shouldn t have passed in null as an argument - and it was for this parameter
fastcgi++ is everything i could hope for for the ajax demands but it doesn t have websockets and i chose websocket++ over libwebsockets since websocket++ is more or less a simple #include so i assumed that i could incorporate it into fastcgi++
the for-loop is faster than the while loops when n 1000000 each takes roughly 0.105544 and 0.2389421
although madprogrammers comment to use a gridbaglayout is an easier solution but knowing about glue and struts can be helpful for customizing the layout of a boxlayout
you can do it with qtkit but works better in 32bit quicktime framework
by looking at the google groups for qjplot and flot the support for jqplot is better lot s of unanswered questions at the flot group
even though this is supported by c# via ienumerator ienumerable there is a better idiom foreach
how do i make apps smaller with qmake and macdeployqt
the difference between self and a smalltalk-80 such as squeak or visualworks is less than the differences between smalltalk-80 and smalltalk-72
since developing in ironruby ironpython is faster you can use it to write pocs and later implement the real application in c# or whatever you re using
you see there are many reasons why git-svn is worse and the kde svn2git is superior
i have been using asihttprequest but it seems to be deprecated and i read that restkit is the newer library
running with azure batch is also an option as the .net will work well and azure batch is cheaper if the custom activity is the only reason for having a hdinsight cluster
that s hard to say.the worst of mergesort is n log2n -n+1 which is accurate if n equals 2 k i have already proved this .and for any n it s between n lg n - n + 1 and n lg n + n + o lg n .but for quicksort its best is nlog2n also n equals 2 k .if you divide mergesort by quicksort it equals one when n is infinite.so it s as if the worst case of mergesort is better than the best case of quicksort why do we use quicksort
since bootstrap-datetimepicker use momentjs it is better to use localized formats from the official documentation
is there a more straightforward solution with scalaz maybe with an existing combinators
the difference between socket and tcplistener tcpclient is that tcplistener tcpclient is easier to use than socket
unlike the ng-view it s possible that there are more than one ng-controller in the same page
same effect but this approach is less verbose unlike in case of gridbaglayout and i personally think that miglayout is easier to use
besides the dbcontext api is easier to use than objectcontext
numbers less than zero however you might use the more descriptive negative-number tag
jasmine is clearly more bdd focused than qunit although i could see doing bdd with qunit by describing the tests in a behavior-oriented way
escaping the quotes with back-slashes works hi there you but embedding apostrophes single-quotes within double-quotes is often easier
edit 31 march 2014 for what it s worth i have found that pdfbox is much better at text extraction than itextsharp notwithstanding a bespoke strategy implementation and pdflib tet is slightly better than pdfbox but it s quite expensive
posting qevents to qobject is faster than using signal-slot invocations because there are no copy constructors called and there s no marshalling done except directly by you upon construction of a qevent
although jackson s nexttoken will work like skipvalue gson seems more flexible to me
if you want to bridge guice and hk2 it s little more complicated
also javassist is recognized to be slower than cglib
jqplot is free in my opinion has better chart than flot it doesnâ t have events
uiview animation is generally easier and more intuitive to use than caanimation
in portrait mode your phone screens is smaller than that so screen_is_narrow is true whereas in landscape mode and on tablet it is wider and thus screen_is_narrow becomes false
i know this does not answer your core question why avx is slower but since your ultimate goal is fast popcount the avx - sse comparison is irrelevant as both are inferior to the builtin popcount
is using onclicklistener in arrayadapter worse than onitemclicklistener
i have 2 more uiview as subviews in scrollcontainer view
as wuliwong said sinatra and padrino are way less complex than ruby-on-rails
g++ compiler is more strict then gcc compiler
from what i have read the dbcontext is a simplified version of the objectcontext and makes it easier to work with
subclassing collections is dangerous because for example you don t know whether or not addall delegates to add inside the superclass this is explained further in effective java p.71
what i know is using iqueryable is better than ienumerable if another query is going to be performed
since a war folder necessarily precedes the creation of a .war archive since a .war archive is simply a zipped up war directory obtaining the war directory is provably easier than obtaining a .war file
i can only find adaptivetriggers which take a static minwindowwidth or minwindowheight .but what i need is no matter how big or small the screen is if the height is bigger than the width go with the first design and if the width is bigger go with the second design
you can do it using rhino 1.6r6 or higher with javascript getter and setter
sortedlist is faster than sorteddictionary
