also google-chrome has a great tool that allows you to edit css on the fly which i find more useful and quicker than using firefox s extensions
i understand redmine is more of a trac clone but retrospectiva seem to support agile methodologies via a nice plugin
there is the mono project that aims to allow .net code to run on mac and linux but between the two delphi being pascal is somewhat more portable

with datamapper this is somewhat more work than with activerecord which provides it s own db tasks
or does this mean firefox is less secured on that point than google-chrome
you can also use scgi it is a lot simpler than fastcgi
if you have a secure ftp sftp server or secure http ssl https server then curl can accept ssh keys although using an ssl key is more commonly accepted on the internet. it can use those keys to authenticate and establish a secure connection to the directories which have been made public to your user through the server

different browsers do this in different ways f.ex ie has less slots than google-chrome firefox
using any kind of non-trivial maven pom.xml makes is more visible though

in outlook.com hotmail it looks closer to the results shown with gmail
there is almost always some driver issue between them but in general nvidia is better for opengl has bugs in directx implementation and ati amd versions only is better for directx has bugs in opengl implementation
for instance in some benchmarks lighttpd is even faster at serving static resources than apache
firefox just provides far more access to its own internals and system to the extensions so its technically possible to do more with them than with opera widgets or google-chrome extensions
you may also use handbrake which is a simpler encoder than ffmpeg
jruby support - unicorn s a better choice than thin but it doesn t support jruby
i haven t read anywhere that apple llvm clang compiler produces bigger executable so my guess is that i might not be using the optimization settings in xcode properly
i found simpletest was even easier than phpunit to set up

i guess google-chrome is a bit more forgiving than firefox
i have installed these two tools with the official package of ubuntu and also with the package of debian that seems more updated
directx has a wider scope than opengl in that directx is composed of directsound directplay and direct3d etc

now on windows if the ntfs filesystems has less than 5gb disk space it displays
several things i found in the cocos2d forums lead me to believe it s an issue with the zlib implementation on ios but i ve tried using both stb_image and lodepng to avoid zlib and those libraries actually performed even worse than libpng

or maybe that is one of the reasons why visual studio gives slower codes than gcc g++ compiler
if you re focussing on pure client code then i find webstorm to be an excellent javascript html ide - even better than aptana
some people were saying that postgresql is better for security purposes whereas mysql is becoming more feature rich.
use nio it is much easier than using inputstream outputstream
i am curious to know if detecting the visitor browser with client-side script is more reliable than server-side script
setting the xhtml namespace as the default namespace might be useful though sadly in xquery this also makes it the default namespace for the output - xslt does this better
