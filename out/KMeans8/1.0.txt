lodash is another faster implementation of underscore.js that will provide a lot of utility methods for working wit arrays objects functions etc
i found it fairly easy to generate addition subtraction and multiplication questions at random however division is more tricky
the more general issue of overshadowing a model field with a property setter getter is more difficult and prone to caveats ref
if you insist on having many nbs you should merge them through multiplication or addition of logarithms which is the same from mathematical perspective but multiplication is less stable in the numerical sense
tcp is slower assures data arrival udp is faster data corruption may be possible
and most importantly all decimals stored on a computer are terminating because in a computer a decimal fractions is not much more than a rational-numbers m n with n being a power of 2
callee is too large message is printed by c1 when the size in bytecodes of the method being inline is larger than maxinlinesize 35 multiplied by nestedinliningsizeratio 90 on each next level of inlining
also one benefit of declarative programming is that purpose is usually more easily understood from reading the code whereas imperative gives you finer control over execution
on the other hand if the number of range is smaller than log n it may be better to move elements of a given range to the beginning of the array and use a linear time selection algorithm to find the median
the for-loop is using i as a global variable so if your instance.set_marker function is also using i as a global variable and sets its value to something greater than 6 loops will exit
but there are many citations of real world tests which show that heapsort is significantly slower than quicksort on average
for suitably large examples of each dictionary overcomes the constant factor by which it s slower than std map and will actually do operations like lookup insertion etc
ideally your udp frames are smaller than the mtu for your architecture say 1500 bytes so the messages won t get chopped up in transit
the main difference between avro and thrift is that thrift is statically typed while avro uses a more dynamic approach
mysql s version is apparently marginally faster than postgresql but lacks some of the more advanced spatial features therefore it s pretty much limited to finding records that match a certain range of coordinates
you can use the accessor annotation to specify a method to be used when serializing a properties which is a cleaner way of doing it
you could also use nvl but that is a legacy function and coalesce is quicker since it stops at the first non-null
android-query is better than picasso because while in offline mode no internet connectivity picasso tries to fetch record form server whereas android-query maintains its cache form where it fetched the images
tcp is much better than udp in terms of reliability
i prefer the beautifulsoup syntax as i find it more natural but i find that lxml is better when i m trying to parse unknown quantities on the fly based on variables-- generating xpath strings that include variable values which i will then use to extract specific elements from varying pages
to be specific the quicksort runs faster than mergesort in the first test case and loses badly in the following 9 tests
in this case if any element in arrays is shorter than 11 symbols will become big and for-loop will stop executing
any execute statement becomes prepare sooner or later it need to be parsed optimized compiled and then execute
is it good idea to make serializer private static readonly to avoid spawning hundreds of temporary objects is it more faster than i did
i switched a thread from extends thread to implements runnable implements runnable is better practice right
however rather than extends actionlistener as in your second example you ll probably find that putting the listener implementation into a different class even an inner class which implements actionlistener provides better logical logical separation of your code
by default it compresses responses whose content-type belongs to default_compressables and whose content-length is greater than 200 characters
although i should warn you for anything more complicated than addition and subtraction and shifts you ll need to use non-trivial algorithms
if a browser s stylesheet does define a style for all types of element and this style has a higher precendence than inherited then inherited properties values should never be observed
however if you want to use the sha256 hash alogorithm which is better than the md5 then here s a code sample
tcp is very much analogous to a phone call whereas udp is more like mailboxes
but it doesn t seem possible to roundtrip the geometry as there are less setter than getter the geometry cannot be re-constructed from an empty object just by calling setter
its was said that awt is faster than swing as it uses the platform component but due the arrival of faster processor etc ..
quicksort is a partitioning sorting algorithm you might refer to mergesort which also is a partitioning sorting algorithm the biggest difference is probably the speed quicksort is faster even though both of them are o n log n
this means that memmove might be very slightly slower than memcpy as it cannot make the same assumptions
on modern processors floating point multiplication is generally slightly more expensive than addition which is one reason why compilers will typically replace by x+x
division is much harder to calculate with subtractions can t go too far find remainder - if a float then calculate fraction from remainder which in itself is oodles of add multiplying and subtract
the error is because the gridview is being applied to more than one listview
the reverse while loops is generally faster than a for-loop as well
in such a simple arrays you shouldn t be concerned about memory usage but the for-loop consumes less memory than foreach because foreach uses an internal copy of the arrays
rsa has much simpler math and can directly encrypt decrypt data you should never compare rsa and ecdsa
although both approaches are o n the for-loop has a larger constant because of loops overhead
for example when the setter or getter function is more complicated than just the trivial
i am using a sparse format but suggestions are welcome on other formats too i am able to use the data with weka in a dense format using the function names as variables and it works just muuch slower than with libsvm
the problem is that the server-side selectedindexchanged event triggers earlier than the client-side change event so the data never reaches the server-side
the other option is to use a foreach loops which is slightly slower than a for-loop but works almost equivalently for all practical purposes
a subclassing is more flexible and is treated as an entire object which responds to all superclass methods plus it s own
it possible to do this a bit better by using variadic macros to do the stringification
unfortunately g++ packed the structs significantly looser than gcc which caused significant problems sharing objects between c and c++ code
and has higher precedence than or just like multiplication has higher precedence than addition
why is implements runnable a better option than extends from thread class
since multiplication is of higher precedence than division
if one of the numbers is a constant your compiler might optimize by doing some combination of bit shifts and subtractions mostly for powers of two since hardware div mod is slower than addition or subtraction but on modern processors the latency already only a few nanoseconds is hidden by tons of other performance tricks so you needn t worry about it
the c function strtol is much better make it a habit to prefer that one to atoi
udp is not always faster than tcp
register spilling is pretty cheap on x86 cpus due to fast l1 caches and register shadowing and other tricks and the 64bit only registers are more costly to access in terms of larger instructions so it may just be that gcc s version is as fast or faster than the one you want
from reading this website it seems lxml is the most commonly used and fastest while beautifulsoup is slower but accounts for more errors and variation
therefore the only types that should have access to a constructor are its derived types and hence protected makes much more sense than public
the two vector graphic libraries you can focus are raphael and d3.js but d3.js is much more powerful with data binding
so far it has proven to be faster than smarty and it provides a compatibility layer to allow developers that have been using smarty for years to switch their application over to dwoo progressively
i would make the conditions easier by ignoring capitalization by converting to uppercase before comparison and leading trailing whitespace by using the strip method
if i do heapsort i can create the stack while i m sorting but would this be faster than a quicksort and then build the stack afterwords
reading a line of numbers spaced with white-space except n and then finally terminated with n is possible with scanf and ungetc but not worthy of coding except as an exercise as using fgets and sscanf strtod is far better
the draggable is covering more than one droppable element and at this point there are multiple event.target.id s being covered
x86 is considerably slower a few clocks plus a clock or so per function argument while 64bit is much less because most function arguments are passed in registers instead of on the stack
filtering before the grouping by is usually more efficient because it reduces the amount of data needed to process the aggregation
on the last iteration of the outer for-loop ndx is one less than array.length so when you call arrays ndx+1 that is equivalent to arrays array.length which out of bounds since arrays start indexing at 0
since the flow of logic is still basically a loop but the api boundaries of the presenter is a cleaner boundary than view in mvp which helps decouple v and m in mvp than is possible in mvc
1 tcp is connection oriented and reliable where as udp is connection less and unreliable
especially as vb6 is becoming more and more of a distant memory and the vb.net language takes on a life of its own in conjunction with the core .net framework advancing
personally i use sha-512 with a salt because a bigger number in the hash name means a better hash
but if you use public key encryption to encrypt messages you are a limited to small messages -- a 1024 bit rsa key encrypts less than 128 bytes and b going to pay in performance because public key encryption is much more costly than symmetric key encryption such as aes encryption
conceptually it seems like a type of central authentication system cas but is more similar to shibboleth also a federated identity management system
however with really very small parameter 2 in your case exponent is faster than multiplication
of course if appropriate you can use just static access syntax public variables or static setter and getter which is even more simple and clear than first method
is the performance of coalesce field constant better than isnull
i have not found a lot of times when implements an interface would be a better system than extends a superclass
calloc itself is slower than malloc because you have to spend some time to clear the contents of allocated memory
dealing with a stateless cluster is often simpler then dealing with a stateful cluster
can i safely assume that vb.net result is more precise than vb6 and discard the vb6 result completely
proto buffer and avro is better than than csv tsv file in terms of size but data is in non human readable format
what is the best algorithm to generate a random simple no parallel edges or self-loops undirected graph with a given number of nodes where each node has a number of edges that is no less than min and no greater than max
but i d think bignum subtraction is a little slower than bignum addition
the c format is the same as is used by ctime but strftime is more flexible
some fancy compilers understand the un interrelatedness of instructions to a limited extent and will automatically interleave instruction flows probably over a longer window than the cpu sees to better utilise the processors
most likely hashcode will be faster unless for whatever reason calling hashcode + equals once is much slower than calling compareto log n times
png images are always compressed lossless but their compression algorithm works better than competition gif
multiplication is faster than division
the scope of the variable in the test of the while loops is wider than the scope of variables declared in the header of the for-loop
they are easily generated for udp simply by making the datagram bigger than the mtu
if device screens destiny is more than mdpi - use default values folder
as i noted in comments however if you re willing to rely on posix s strdup then that s cleaner than strlen + malloc + and has the same semantics you take responsibility for freeing the memory allocated for the copy
generally speaking passes in higher-level shader material systems yes higher than glsl cg hlsl like this one are a way of setting up states necessary for multi-pass rendering
now you can walk your collection with a for-loop without fearing that one arrays is shorter than another one or even use a foreach loops to go through elements without using an index
but this operation inherently involves division which is expensive whereas computing an address from an array index involves a multiplication and is faster
division has higher precedence than addition
the reason i asking this is because i read tcp is slower than udp because tcp ensures order of packets
division and square roots for huge number of bits are not much more complex than multiplication
but there are some cases especially in iot domain udp is more popular than tcp for its bigger transport overheads
in the most simple way you can look at rsa one key of a keypair is nothing more than an exponent and a common modulo .
and i ve read that using liblinear is far faster more memory efficient for such tasks as such i ve ported my libsvm classifier to accord net like so
the workaround is usually using a for-loop and manipulating the loop-variable appropriately but in your case a while loops is simpler
in general you ll have more variation with multiplication and division than with addition and subtraction
basically ram is more expensive than the disk storage
subtraction is similar using subtraction of the base type and borrow instead of carry multiplication can be done with repeated additions very slow or cross-products faster and division is trickier but can be done by shifting and subtraction of the numbers involved the long division you would have learned as a kid
if you were attempting to beat the performance of tcp by shifting to udp keep in mind that part of the reason you get lower performance with tcp is because tcp tracks and redelivers the lost packets for you
also settimeout is a better approach than setinterval as you explicitly reset it on each round trip
i seem to remember reading that though infoset is great in many cases when you re dealing with larger datasets with sorting filtering it is more efficient to go direct to the table as using infoset requires each xml fragment to be parsed and elements extracted before you get to the data
extfs4 or xfs are between 25 and 40 faster than ntfs or refs depending on the optimization
oh and it can use cpython for its innermost loop or psyco - but pypy is faster than either especially on 32 bit systems
note using apply functions instead of a for-loop is better but it depends on the actual purpose of your loops
bit operations are usually faster than division or modulo calculations
but isn t setting index greater than the for-loop condition supposed to exit loops
communication via i2c is more complex that with uart or spi solution
one place where the enhanced for-loop is faster than a naively implemented traditional loops is something like this
a possible reason is that extends represents a a stronger relationship than implements although both represent is a or is a type of relationships
you can think of extends from a superclass if the derived class is of the same type.i mean that when a class extends an abstract-class they both should be of the same type the only difference being that the superclass has a more general behavior and the sub class has a more specific behavior
the multiplying operation uses more clock cycles than the add on many processors
the addition and subtraction are much more than multiplication and division
however you can t use a superclass value where a subclassing is expected because the subclassing is more specific
as multiplication of ints has more overhead than simple addition
in my experience udp based code is generally less complex than tcp based code
and using floating-point values is more realistic - you need fractions values because when you rotate something the new coordinates will nearly always be non integral
but that s not the case here since division and multiplication have higher precedence than addition and there are no parentheses involved
if you want to allow the integers to be delimiter by more than one spaces for indentation purposes or so and depending on the way you want to handle tabs and other non-newline whitespace you can use a more complex delimiter
coalesce case can add implicit data type conversions whereas isnull has simpler rules
while those queries look very similar i suspect orderdate includes time information so the sorting and grouping is much more expensive and lead to many more rows in the subquery for the second query
for or int which sounds a simpler case and chars could have been both implemented as member operators or as non-member free operators
but determining the digit and the carry by division is much more concise and for the larger factors also much more efficient when multiplying a digit by 100 the result is on average 450 requiring 45 subtractions but two divisions are sufficient for all factors
this may be optimal indeed if the table access to retrieve the values missing in the index is more expensive than filtering and sorting
if a user belongs to more than x grouping it may be more efficient to retrieve all results matching the keyword and then filtering them by group_id
according to moore s law computers are becoming exponentially faster hence computing hash functions becomes much cheaper in terms of time especially quick hash functions like md5 or sha1
foreach can simplify the code in a for-loop but it is a heavy object and is slower than a loops written using for.
the next solution is faster than using in and except clauses
this task can be easy done with getter setter method or with signal and slot but setter is more suitable here
they state that the binary multiplication operator has higher priority than the binary addition operator +
the misunderstanding is that incrementing the exponent is not faster than doing a multiplication
alternatively use a gridview though i find that repeater gives you more control over the emitted markup
memory optimizations - phusion passenger uses less memory than thin and unicorn
it is in fact considered to be much more dangerous than strcpy since the null termination mechanism of strncpy is not intuitive and therefore often misunderstood
if pypy succeeds to be better than cpython in general which is questionable the main weakness affecting its wider adoption will be its compatibility with cpython
as you run queries it has to fetch data from disk which is much slower than ram
this tiny overhead on add is vastly outweighed by the savings on lookups since all programmers should know and understand that case-insensitive compares are vastly slower than case-sensitive especially with unicode - the cpu can t just do a block compare of data but must check each pair of characters specially even using a table look-up this is vastly slower
or in short stateless is better than stateful
the decremented while loops is still faster than the for-loop or the incremented while loops with length upper limit comparison by a fair margin
so for scheduling purposes i suggest you to use the setinterval approach while the settimeout approach is better for delayed execution and asynchronous work
nserror is generally used to pass information between different code interfaces that are expecting a possible error where as nsexception is more so for errors that are unexpected or caused by the developer and thus should be handled during development
if you want to use a counter in a loops a for-loop is typically more appropriate
it will be good idea to put factorial as additional case into primary as parentheses have higher order of precedence called earlier than multiplication division etc in term
using two one-to-many associations is always better than relying on many-to-many relations
however in general one could expect that a division is a more expensive operation than a multiplication
does udp always perform better than tcp
then you ll notice that the dereference operator has higher priority than addition subtraction + - operators they are in group no
i am using groupby on tickets then filtering my dataframe to those records where the count in that ticket grouping is greater than 1 using filtering
i heard that in php there are some alternatives for the functions substr and strlen which handles safer bits
algorithms like rsa are much less user-friendly than aes
multiplication is faster than division see fog s tables
and division may be slower than multiplication or may still be fast
it is perfectly possible to use rsa with a modulus n that is composed of more than two primes factors p and q but two things have to be noted
if you have so many records in the table then the first thing is to change the table engine to innodb if its not innodb because for large number of records innodb is much faster as it caches the table data while on the contrary myisam engine only caches the indexes so each time it has to do a full table scan from disk if the data required cannot be fetched from index
immutable tree maps have o log n puts and gets which is asymptotically slower
we propose to use udp over tcp since udp is faster than tcp
memory is a bottleneck to performance ram runs slower than the cpu and if you re paging to disk than it s really slow
but sometimes memcpy performs faster than strcpy because it moves blocks of memory at a time which allows it to perform some optimization i will not go into details here
if the network between the two point have a very high quality udp is absolutely faster than tcp but in some other case such as the gprs network tcp may been faster and more reliability than udp
the question is a bit wider than serializable deserialization and applies to any situation where some object could be uniquely rebuild from jpa persistent data and vice versa
multiplication is faster division is more accurate
my another question is if i put the data size smaller than mtu into sendto then i can guarantee call sendto once socket only sends one tcp udp packet
note however that doing so means that each encrypted chunk has its own padding and that rsa is much more computationally expensive than aes
modulo can also cause a divide-by-zero and it has a higher precedence than addition
if the hash function is more complex and cryptographically strong md5 or sha1 then it is theoretically not possible
ssl the s in https has more states but since it follows a fairly linear progression does not really have any kind of complex diagram
without parentheses math.exp c b is executed first as division has higher precedence than subtraction -
trig functions should have precedence lower than multiplication and higher than addition
formally it means division cannot have a complexity worse than multiplication
the public properties accessor gives you more flexibility in the future
note that the test bean has a very special design as the getter returns a more general type number than the setter requests integer
the ipb one has less queries used only 14 on average but it runs slower than mybb with more queries used average on 20
now assuming that your inner loops is more complex and the simple for-loop is slower let s look at how much memory we save by avoiding broadcasted data in a parfor with 4 workers and a dataset with 50 million rows for about 760 mb in ram
for example for small amounts of data an memcpy optimised for large amounts of data may be significantly slower than a strcpy that wasn t optimised for large amounts of data
i noted that while in languages like c variable identifiers can only be alphanumberics and underscores common lisp allows many more characters to be used like and at least scheme does
loosely speaking ram is 1000 or more times faster than disk and cpu is faster still
in vb6 at least so i assume it s true in vba replace is faster than concatenation
specifically i m trying to store some information acquired in the for-loop in a different arrays i think there s a more efficient way to do this but we haven t covered more than single-dimensional arrays in class yet so no matter at a parallel index as the current interation
i was exploring around with c regarding strncpy since most people says that it is safer than strcpy additional parameter length to avoid buffer overflows
for this measure higher kurtosis means more of the variance is the result of infrequent extreme deviations as opposed to frequent modestly sized deviations
because disk access is orders of magnitude slower than ram access
however instead of using two nested for-loop you can use count arrays which is more efficient
udp uses datagrams chunks of data which are received whole on the other side unless the size is bigger than the mtu but that s a different story
this is to demonstrate that you can achieve this without for loops however a simple for-loop is much more readable
this redeclaration allows a cleaner way to access and mutate the property internally without resorting to fragile ivar synthesis which is becoming an antiquity now that the compiler does it for you
the difference you notice is very small but i think the multi-thread processors is spending more time because the concurrency for the cpu resources between the threads
for certain constellations switching from a 4-column to a three-column layout when screens size decreases more complex measure may be needed
even if you use a lowly for-loop it s much easier to loops over the elements of a list than it is to construct variable names with paste and access the objects with get
in this case instead of generating two large matrices with the row and column indices you can use a for-loop on the rows of your arrays it s slower but not as slow as a double for-loop
then the buffers won t need to be treated as arrays of pointers and passing arrays of say floats between objective-c ++ and swift is easier
calloc returns tha address of a block of memory initialized to all bits zero which has the same effect as calling memset but is potentially more efficient
a virtual memory is a concept to work for files bigger than ram by using the pages and swapping with disk and ram
implementing multiplication is easier if you remember an shl operation performs the same operation as multiplying the specified operand by two
2 second loops is and easier for-loop to read
since a 53-bit mantissa is too large to fit in less than four 16-bit registers or two 32-bit registers performing an addition with a 64bit mantissa isn t any slower than using a 53-bit mantissa so using extended-precision math offers faster computation with no downside in a language which supports a proper type to hold temporary results
a heartbeat is by nature a connectionless contrivance so it goes that udp connectionless is more relevant here than tcp connection-oriented
the net effect is that the backtracking implementations i like that name better than traditional nfa are slightly more expressive than dfa implementations because they can match regexes like which matches three or more word characters repeated twice something that can t be matched by a dfa
swift comparing to objective-c has it s own benefits like swift handles strings more easily swift tuples offer compound variables and also coders don t need to spend time annotating variables with type information and risk making mistakes
the multiplication should perform somewhat better than division
however if g is guaranteed to have only non-negative weights g is non-positive weights then dijkstra s algorithm could be better choice over bellman-ford
vcpu reg are virtual cpu registers that exist on many processors that have things like multiple cores hyperthreading or other features that enable higher layers to believe that there is more than one cpu present when there isn t -- such as today s x86s
division has higher precedence than subtraction
but for the example you give it doesn t matter - if it s going to fail it will be in the initial strlen so strncpy doesn t buy you anything in terms of safety and presumbly strncpy is slower as it has to both check bounds and for nul and any difference between memcpy and strcpy isn t worth changing code for speculatively
udp has a much lower overhead than tcp
also addition is faster than multiplication and multiplication is faster than division
consider a model with lots of factors or nonlinear terms like bs ns or poly the model frame is much smaller compared with model matrix
notice that memcpy is faster than strcpy unless the source string is much smaller than the buffer s size which is rarely the case with ip addesses.
s will match more than just spaces because it also matches vertical whitespaces like linefeed carriage returns.
the modulo has a higher operator precedence than the addition operator therefore it will happen before the addition
being queryable the data tables produce faster results with sorting and filtering with their defaultview dataview
when summing an arrays over a specific axis the dedicated arrays method array.sum ax may actually be slower than a for-loop
i used instead of to convert the string to a number since addition is usually a little faster than multiplication and it s the more common way of performing that action see to force a string to be converted to a number add zero to that string
at best it is a computationally expensive hash function like whirlpool that for example is five times slower than md5 and thus allows only a fifth of the number of hash operations in opposite to md5
in any case if addition is faster than multiplication a better solution might be to use a table and index by it
loops recur is faster - it s one of the most efficient constructs in clojure done correctly it should match the speed of an equivalent for-loop in java code
adding and subtract logarithms of factorials then taking the exponential at the end is more reliable than multiplying and dividing factorials directly
in its implementation foreach executes a closure over every element in the arrays this is typically more straightforward and transparent alternative to old-fashioned for-loop
there are libraries that allow on-disk data structures comes to mind and another one whose name i can t recall at the moment but disk accesses are orders of magnitude slower than ram
following the first answer it appears that postgresql is more compliant to sql standard than mysql so it needs a group by clause for each selected column you want to display with your aggregated function
inversion shouldn t be anything more than a multiplying add operation
for some requirements tcp is better for some udp
most attacks involve generating hash for common passwords so for reasonably complicated passwords it becomes harder especially with salt some people use usernames as salt others use randomly generated numbers
according to the answer of the foreach vs for-loop question assuming it s correct for loops on list are a bit more than 2 times cheaper than foreach loops on list and looping on arrays is around 2 times cheaper than looping on list
if i have a bunch of fields in a parent class that all need to be inherited by subclassing is it better to have the subclassing nested in the superclass make the fields protected rather than private or use protected accessor
in general the tcp protocol manages the available network bandwidth better than the udp protocol
but for the arrays it is better to use for-loop as shown by alnitak than for-in
the get method is useful for passing a reasonable amount of non sensitive data between pages while the post method has less limitations and is best for more sensitive data
there s not much to recommend one over the other except that the direct ivar access is slightly faster the properties version creates a temporary array and sends an accessor message to make the new condition create its copy of that array
speed-wise the above seem to be at least an order of magnitude slower than glibc malloc free on my machine
an expression like binds as not because of associativity but because 2 multiplication has higher precedence that + 2 addition
if this is an issue you could try sd stream diff which doesn t require sorting like comm does nor process substitution like the above examples is orders or magnitude faster than grep -f and supports infinite streams
on most processors division is slower than multiplication for the same data types
are there any studies on whether functional declarative or imperative programming is easier to learn as a first language
double has its ieee floating point definition which is also much more complex than decimal
also as an aside objective-c has a foreach loops that is more convenient than manually setting up a for-loop with a counter
alternatively it can be used over udp which is less hungry than tcp
which loops is a better fit do while or a for-loop
a udp stack is considerably simpler than a tcp stack
other hash functions such as sha-1 also have hash collisions although it is much less likely than md5
you could split with spaces as delimiter and you split one more time with as delimiter
so if you want a entire file of 93mb to be reassembled by transferring fragmented packets over the network such that no packets are dropped then tcp sctp is a better choice
your loops would be cleaner as a for-loop
if your function is quite short like getter setter it is more common to see the function directly defined in the class definition
instances are created on the stack which is a lot more performant than malloc free calls
this is actually simpler than using dill pickle as the autowrap module produces and compiles c code by default that can be imported as a c-extension module 1 2
i would like to change it so you can send files however udp does not support this and tcp is slower than tcp
is a leftover after the division which corresponds to result of the modulo
your getter or setter is more than just a trivial assignment
your desired output does not reflect what you have as input if you want to grouping common sublists you can use itertools.groupby considering you want sorted output using a dict and then sorting makes less sense than just creating the grouping from the sorted list using groupby
as to why multiplication is faster than division and when the divisor is fixed this is a faster route
declarative programming is not always simpler than imperative programming
phong is a more nuanced shading model albeit a more hacky one which says that light is composed of ambient + diffuse + specular components
this allows for perfect synchronization with the monitor update rate as well as being more efficient than settimeout setinterval you could throttle it so you only update per 1 30 frame to match video rate by using a simple boolean flag that alternates
repeater is more light than datalist as datalist creates the view by creating a table whereas repeater doesn t
a boolean would most likely not yield better performance than int since the excel formula engine is dynamically typed
query speed is mainly limited by disk i o speed which is at least 1000 times slower than cpu ram speed
then i tried the metaphone function and it worked far better than soundex
if making a tcp connection is analogous to making telephone call then sending a udp packet is more like mailing a letter
to my mind a for-loop is simpler to understand than traversing the list backwards with a while loops
one thing that is wrong is that you have maxstudents set to 200 you allocate the studentnames arrays with size 200 but that means that the valid subscripts are 0 through 199 but your for-loop uses a less than or equal test against 200
general consensus including the php docs is that metaphone is much more accurate than soundex when dealing with the english language
within your for-loop the statement command.parameters.addwithvalue is potentially adding to the command additional parameter but no two parameters can have the same value so if your loops is executed more than once you ll get the error you received
so when i see that the salt is stored in the hash password and that you use that hash password as salt i think crypt + salt is not more secure against a brute force on output hackers who managed to steal hash passwords
another reason is that mergesort needs more memory because it s hard to implement it as an in-place sort
still while it might be better than multiplying by say 17 16+1 or 12 8+4 as they only add in a couple bit-shifted copies of the original value instead of five it s a very weak hash compared to hash functions that do more than a single running multiplication and i ll illustrate that using some statistical analysis.
version 2 is safer as it subtract remainders before division
this interface defines the method compareto t which will return a negative number zero or a positive number if the first object is less than equals to or greater than the other one respectively
which one is faster is indeed a cpu-specific issue or at least how much faster is cpu specific yes division is typically seen as slower than multiplication
so if you working with only in-memory data collection ienumerable is a good choice but if you want to query data collection which is connected with database iqueryable is a better choice as it reduces network traffic and uses the power of sql language
it was introduced since the nat traversal for tcp is much more complicated than udp
i used multiplication for both operations because multiplication is typically faster than division
you may want to use the rabin hash which is faster and more collision resilient than cryptographic hash such as md5 sha1 et al
but with the udp protocol in particular this is easier than for tcp
shifting bits left and right is apparently faster than multiplication and division operations on most all
since loosing some packets doesn t matter but speed latency is crucial udp is much better than tcp
in addition the need for polyfills for mathml complicates matters further as they may handle the interaction differently as can be seen in the sample below when using the button to load mathjax
i have used it and the api is cumbersome and the performance is overall lower than eigen and armadillo
you can use array.prototype.find method to check if the element exists in arrays which is much better than perform a traditional for-loop
-- in which scenario configuration would i get udp to perform better than tcp
the underlying websocket technology is bidirectional more info here but pusher s pub sub model is unidirectional
note that there are exceptions to the above - for example tcp generally traverses firewalls better than udp which may be blocked due to security to traffic policy reasons so voip speech may sometimes be sent over tcp for part of its journey at least
division is much more expensive than multiplication
namedtuple have a lower overhead than dictionary since the duplicate keys don t have to be stored per item but have the convenience of named access
loops in c++ are most basic than python the for-loop is more simpler it is based on the three expression initializer expression loops test expression and the counting expression
generally i know it sounds banal xslt is better at transformation generating a new document from each source document while xquery is better at query extracting a small amount of information from each source document
this is analogous to the way you can compute exponent using successive squaring much faster than by repeated multiplication
in gaming especially fpss udp tends to be the chosen protocol because it s much less chatty than tcp
or if the arrays is a straight numerically indexed one you can use a for-loop which is more efficient
nsdecimalnumber and the floating-point types may be able to store bigger numbers than the integer types though with decreasing precision
a tooltip has more in common with a popover but they are generally regarded as a popup historically
udp has less overhead than tcp and is therefore faster
i believe the reasoning behind it is that it allows the parameters to be named nicer by preventing shadowing of member variables
fortunately ecto 2.1 has a better alternative since it s supports the built-in calendrical types from elixir 1.3
but as that reference points out murmurhash is way faster than md5 and sha functions although it doesn t do a direct comparison to the object.gethashcode method i mentioned above
chqrlie has pointed out in the comments that this method could also lead to erroneous comparisons for extremely close dates fractions of a second since if difftime mktime date_1 mktime date_2 is less than 1 in magnitude the value will be converted to 0 upon return thus comparing as equal
use hash and choose hashing algorithm that suits you well if possible something stronger than md5 but don t go all the way to sha512 either
this in turn means that a generic for-loop is worse than a range-based for-loop for auto i v for the compiler because in the latter case the compiler simply knows that you are going to iterate over the whole range and not go outside of it or break out of loops or something while in the generic for-loop case specially if your code is more complex the compiler cannot be sure of this and has to insert extra checks and tests to make sure the code executes as the c++ standard says it should
if we assume that you live in a poor coverage area and your phone and your tower are constantly dropping the signal then re-establishing a spdy connection is no worse off than re-establishing a tcp connection modulo ssl handshake
for floats and double it s more difficult as with plain int as these may or not may be in the host machines byte-order
the check for convex polygons your triangle is simpler than for concave ones see first linked article
ostream is more general subclasses support writing to different places ostringstream is a specific one writing to a string
after a lot of googling i ve found that most sources say that the dijkstra algorithm is more efficient than the bellman-ford algorithm
rythm is a high performance 2 to 3 times faster than velocity pure java template which use razor like syntax
note that this is one of those cases where matrix division of large arrays takes longer than a for-loop
the nltk library includes a confusion matrix that is simple to use and produces a nicer output than scikit-learn
i was just going to say radix sort however that could be a bit above what you were looking to implement introsort is generally the accepted sorting solution for data it s a variation of quicksort that switches to heapsort when it reaches smaller sets as it s faster on smaller sets than quicksort
in usual programming practice one wouldn t bother and simply multiplying by the floating-point representation of 180 ï because multiplication is so much faster than division
that s obviously quite a bit more than the 16-bit that s mandated for an int but equally obviously less than the 64bit mandated for a long long
similar to pmg s solution but still faster because multiplication is faster than division -
skip-lists isn t any more difficult to implement than a self-balancing binary tree and gives much better performance in some situations
the reason udp is faster than tcp is because there is no form of flow control or error correction
all of the object files are dumped into the output directory and the executable is placed in a different folder that is kept cleaner
using this hint we can try to guess that a fixmap must correspond to a dictionary data type in c# since a map is more or less like a dictionary of key-value pairs
make the excludes annotation more legibile by sorting the different parameters into different grouping
in general encapsulation of fields by getter and setter leaves more flexibility for changes
switching to 2.2 framework which has better compatability with screens resolutions and densities
i admit that gin index on hstore is much more expensive than its equivalent for jsonb but even then it is faster to just do seq scan on hstore than use index on jsonb
if you notice the 99th percentile is less than 40mb but the max sized partition is still reported to be 3.44gb
you can also look into strtol which is better than using atoi in terms of error checking
or it can be disambiguated by type inference unification is a more appropriate term or an explicit type signature like thilo said in their comment
rsa is not ment for bulk encryption as it s quit slow compared to symmetric algorithms like aes it s more than a factor of 1000 slower
the other way round returning a subclassing that is a more specific class does not break the contract because the subclassing has at least the same functionality as the superclass
as disk i o is orders of magnitude slower than ram i o this can cause a very significant difference in query execution times
i was going through internet and so and understood that web sockets are encapsulations to tcp which by itself is slower than udp ofcourse at the cost of reliability but i couldnt find much info if websockets or udp would be ideal to implement such a server
using a hash or similar to detect if the transmission was decrypted having a salt hash makes it harder not impossible to change or forge message contents
so both can use quic instead of tcp and it s usually faster than tcp hence the name which sounds like quick and is an acronym of quick udp internet connections
if you use linq using max min method is a better way than sorting
the specification of atom feed offers more value than the rss one with internationalization content types and other things and every modern feed reader supports it
the superclass has a more stringent constraint on a property content blank false than the subclassing content nullable true and i am using tableperhierarchy false
when the sampling rate becomes higher than the free malloc frequencies of a program spikes start to become visible on a graph where the cpu usage seemed smooth
i am working on udp socket programming and i have to stop the transmission in application if requested data is more than mtu value
i ve considered that udp is more suitable for sending a series of discrete data sets but i need the reliability of tcp
xcb is lower level than xlib and allows you to minimise the number of round-trips to the x server leading to lower latency
this garentees that while a can be issued to the pipeline every cycle it will have a higher latency than an add subtract circuit
see the referred post for an example that reads a single file in parallel with fileinputstream which should be significantly faster than using bufferedreader according to these benchmarks
the various alternatives calloc realloc work roughly the same way calloc is easier to use when dealing with arrays and zero-fills the data while realloc is useful when you need to resize a block of memory
spi is not less limited than i2c in this case
in terms of performance py4j has a bigger overhead than both of the previous solutions jython and jpype because it relies on sockets but if performance is critical to your application accessing java objects from python programs might not be the best idea
if you need more than integer accuracy but want to avoid floating-point consider using fixed-point arithmetic instead
i ve found that using a simple for-loop iterating over all elements in the string and comparing using charat performs faster than indexof or regex
something like textolution s proprietary add-on for firebird looks like it could accommodate constructing single complex nested query that would apply both regular and fulltext criteria but dbisam does it more elegantly
also the for-loop is more readable than the while loops because it puts all loops variable manipulation in one place
so what this says is that provided your subclassing doesn t have any more values than the superclass used to determine ordering implementing is reasonable
prepending a salt is also more powerful than directly setting the seed values because in addition to changing the internal state of the hash if the salt is not a multiple of the digest block size then it can also perturb the alignment with which the input is fed into the hash function
these formats allow various data compression codecs note that snappy is now much more popular than lzo and can also provide other benefits such as fast serializable deserialization column pruning and bundled metadata
sctp mapped over udp ipv4 allows more private hosts per public address but udp mappings in ipv4 nat gateways are notoriously tricky to establish and keep maintained due to the fact that udp is a connectionless transport without any explicit state for a nat to track
the genisoimage man page suggests using -r or -r which has better defaults for ownership in addition since the rock ridge standard supports 255 byte file names and folder depths greater than 8 directory and is a real standard unlike joliet
if you need to load from a well-defined filesystems fat or ntfs this is more tricky you have only 450 bytes of space because 60 of the 512 bytes are used by the filesystems internally for code that interprets the data of the filesystems finds the file containing the code and loads it into memory
as you can see from the above tests realloc is consistently faster compared to memalloc memcpy and free
as a general rule udp is faster than tcp due to less protocol overhead
mit scheme is known for strong interactivitiy support while plt racket feels much more static
either way applying gain and or attenuation to time-domain sample data as in a wav file is much easier than trying to apply these effects to frequency-domain data as in an mp3 file
notice also the the cpu cache is much more important than processors registers today
bitwise operations are usually significantly faster than multiplication and division operations
the advantage here is this membership provider uses pbkdf2 to derive the hash which is more resistant to brute force attacks given the number of rounds
moreover this even used to apply to all integral types larger than chars until one of the tcs for c99 standard finally required all-bits-zero pattern to be a valid object representation for int zeros of all types on all c platforms.
with current hardware at about twice the number of active threads as execution units cores ht logical processors however the architecture handles multithreaded execution your cpu starts spending more time scheduling thread execution and managing thread states than it is actually executing the threaded instructions
for-each loops is an iterable form of ordinary for-loop which is a better built data structure
but whether or not your use an anonymous class is orthogonal to the question of whether implements runnable or extends thread is the better mechanism to define your thread task
readability is a big reason for functions using recursion rather than loops makes them easier to follow and for using the iteration methods where possible map to transform an arrays values-by-value rather than a for-loop
google-chrome s parsing may be more strict than firefox is at having things like trailing commas as specified by the standard at as stated in danilo celic s answer
some elements require more than simple mouse keyboard interactions due to the complex rendering carried out by extjs
in this case a traversal-oriented approach is best maybe gremlin is better since cypher doesn t allow you to specify traversal order
the map set multimap and multiset are normally implemented as binary trees with red-black balancing rules for example and deque is possibly more impression than knowledge a circular queue in an array exploiting an array-doubling or similar growth pattern
edit 3des is better than des in the sense that it s significantly more secure but still less secure than aes but its performance is of necessity significantly worse than aes des or twofish because you re essentially applying des three times
udp lends itself to real-time less latency than tcp
most likely a trie is more efficient and you didn t sort your dictionary and it doesn t use a binary tree or ternary tree
the alternative is to write slightly more complex c code which can split on either spaces or tabs note that you can pass strtok more than one delimiter
which of these gecko or webkit uses less memory in general case
of course ordering could be forced obj.gettype .tostring and using lexical order but since a strict order is not necessary only grouping i was wondering if there s a more efficient way than sorting
mousemove is more intrusive than mouseenter but it tracks your mouse position all the time so that the tooltip moves accordingly
if a subclassing needs more information than the standard parameters which came up for us you have the option of a second parameters class type that you use as a second parameter but then you have two types of constructors in the tree or using inherited in the parameters class hierarchy
for example filtering and sorting takes longer in java
subclassing must allow more than the superclass not less and going from an argument being optional to not optional is allowing less
my view is that option 1 is clumsy code and involves unnecessary creation of an arrays even though the for-each loops is more efficient than the traditional for-loop in option 2
a side effect of many division routines is the modulo - so in few cases should division actually be faster than modulo
would an arrays be faster than a for-loop in this case
in a language like c a for-loop is more or less syntactic sugar for a while loops
for example since multiplication has a higher precedence than addition is read as not
even with md5 salt it is weaker besides them
if 50 is replaced by x a value known only at runtime there will be a multiplication before the add the multiplication canbe optimised into a faster operation if the multiplicand is simple enough as one instruction because there is support to multiplying by 1 2 4 8 and 16 - at least in some processors and even risc processors multiplication is often more complex than a few add and shift operations - small numbers are often very easy to deal with this way but 575 or 13412 may not be so easy to convert to a small number of simple operations so a proper multiplication will be needed
localization it s easier to translation text than images
but when looping through an arrays it s better to use a regular for-loop
note that division has a higher precedence than addition
accessing the main memory ram is much faster than reading values from the hard disk
looping with a for-loop is nothing more than a basic iteration of an arrays using a for-loop
in practice this means that tcp is better suited for continuous transmission of data whereas the more lightweight udp can be used when reliability isn t important
i understand the difference between these functions but my question is when checking for a single null value would isnull be any quicker than using coalesce
however heapsort is slower than quicksort in the average case in the sense that heapsort performs c n log n whereas quicksort has d n log n performance with d being significantly smaller than c the numbers c and d are constants
copying the description in both getter and setter is even worse
udp sockets have much lower overhead than tcp because packets are not acknowledged by the recipient
the typical implementation of merge sort uses a temp array of the same size as the original array or 1 2 the size sort 2nd half into second half sort first half into temp array merge temp array + 2nd half into original array so it needs more space than quicksort which optimally only needs log2 n levels of nesting and to avoid worst case nesting a nesting check may be used and quicksort changed to heapsort this is called introsort
always favor disk persistence disk storage is cheaper than ram
settimeout evaluates your function once setinterval is more suited to call your chrono at specified interval
none of this is intended to say that clojure is better than common lisp or scheme
is division more expensive than multiplication in c++
but native hibernate support regarding inherited mapping is more powerful than standard jpa and single table per class hierarchy or table per subclassing mapping strategies are more suitable for polymorphic queries and associations than table per concrete class strategy
the same speed as addition though still faster than multiplication
this assumes that the id of the parent is smaller than the id of the children as is the case with the sample data in the question.
note that this algorithm avoids any math more complicated than addition and multiplication so will likely have much better performance than something that requires trig functions
and because hex is much more readable and useful than binary - it s often used and shown
for input and output to complete gandalf the grey s answer if you like to use cin and cout it s better to use std ios sync_with_stdio false
does multiplication has higher precedence over division or it is other way round
i though that udp was faster than tcp but do you think that tcp will be faster due to the congestion
udp is less reliable on a wide area network but in a closed environment of a vm talking to its host you can safely skip all the tcp reliability stuff
is it a microoptimization or are there real significant examples when memcpy is faster so that we really need to use memcpy and not stick to memmove everywhere
additionally you may have to write nested try-catch blocks more frequently if you are using traditional try-catch . closing a resource also throws an exception-handling
the application has far fewer threads than the cpu has processors cores
quicksort is usually faster than mergesort just because it s easier to code a tight implementation and the operations it does can go faster
as seen in this comparison using for-loop with counter set to the size of the arrays is significantly faster than for each loops
i have an issue with serializable in c# .net where if i serializable in one stream multiple references to a same object these references are no longer equal after deserialization
knowing that a division is much more costly than a multiplication
the quicksort algorithm is faster than mergesort which is what sorted will get you when called on a sequence of objects via java.util.arrays.sort
also your comparison would be safer as a for-loop that ensures value is less than 100 rather than a while loops
for example mdpi is basically 72dpi as your computer monitor hdpi resources should be around 1.5 times larger than mdpi resources and so forth
scheme is older than common lisp
if you have the choice modulo is probably more convenient basically you take your matrix modulo a number m after each power or multiplying and the individual entries of the matrix will never grow beyond m - 1 2 but obviously the result will be an algorithm for modular exponentiation thus different from what you have now
rythm is a strong typed java template engine using razor like syntax with high performance 2 to 3 times faster than velocity and fm
yes pow is slower than multiplication multiplication is slower than addition
i changed out total for sum which is more consistent with other databases sqlite aggregate-functions
about the inexactness problem you should be aware that double can be more inexact than int
implements runnable is better because you can extends other classes
as written malloc would be better than calloc but the question used calloc and it would not be hard to make it sensible for use with this code too for example a conditional assignment in set_matrix such as
given that you re seeing extra tasks causing a slowdown you likely either have resource contention via locking or your tasks are cpu bound and having more tasks than processors cores will cause slowdowns
division typically uses more resources.â to avoid division we multiplying rather than divide
3 if i have a large object to cache i find serializable and deserialization takes a longer time in ignite and retrieving from distributed cache is slow
i m also looking for more examples and explanations of complex combinators more complex than fold in common programming languages
in addition seeing arp being slower than icmp doesn t necessarily mean icmp isn t deprioritized---it might mean bandwidth is insufficient to hit the limiting threshold
finally b+ tree is admittedly more difficult to implement than a trie it s more on a red-black tree level of complexity
a boilerplate setter getter is no better than a public member
splitting the min and max operations seems more simd friendly thus i suggest
bit shifts have lower precedence than addition subtraction see in docs
strcpy incoming connected will overwrite dataa and maybe datab if your first token pointed to by header is shorter than strlen connected
or use a single for-loop and there is no need for nested loops that makes it more complex
for use with types other than boolean and int this is more complex but still possible - but it would be easier to use an initializer
the division operator has a higher precedence than the addition operator + so you need to enclose the sum with brackets before dividing
just like it would be possible to come up with arithmetic expressions that could be written with less parentheses if addition had a higher precedence than multiplication
as such traversing a nat through udp is much easier than tcp
more mathematically you can think of a class a set of all objects with some similar characteristic and then the subclassing surrounds the superclass and has even more characteristics
the non-random random behaviour is more a reflection on the quality of the rand prng â it is often not very good
now imagine writing lots of small packets across a network udp may cause congestion whereas tcp is better controlled
tcp windowing is more expensive than raw udp but if you use udp to go faster and add a custom loss-recovery or seqno ack resend manager then that may slow you down again
and there are no handshakings required udp are pretty much faster but less reliable than tcp
your colleague may be right in the general sense using try-catch to test your exception-handling handling is less desirable than using the provided expectedexception utilities
as mysql_real_escape_string escapes characters according to default charset so it is better than addslashes function and it properly sanitizes sql injections arising out of abuse of multibyte character sets but in another article here a workaround-scenario is shown that explains that injection can still be done
dill has a better serializer that can pickle socket objects on any os and thus sending the socket object with multiprocess works in either case
if i have a class hierarchy in which subclassing require use of more specific types than those specified in the superclass ivars is it better to declare the superclass ivar as id or to type it and then cast where necessary in the subclassing
more than one spaces should be compressed to a delimiter pipe better
in general multiplication is more costlier than subtraction right
a third possibility would be to send out some form of discovery packets either by broadcast or better by multicast udp
i am trying to create a method that will step through an arrays with a for-loop and if they arrays subscript is greater than or equal to the minimum requirement a string arrays subscript will be added to a listbox
division has a higher precedence than addition or subtraction so it s really this
hex encoding is far more readable than binary that s why sublime uses it
now i went into this script there are for loops which are adding some values to the classpath for there are more than one for-loop
more ram means less disk access
also a while loops seems more appropriate and self-explanatory in this situation than a for-loop
then you run that string through a good hash algorithm--something like sha1 is fine even md5 is more than adequate despite reports to the contrary
is sending packets via an established tcp connection after all hand shaking has been done a method to be faster than udp
for me testing with a data set of 2508 records with dates evenly spread through a single year and joining the table to itself datepart performed significantly better than datediff the difference between datepart and month was negligable though datepart was typically 1ms faster
it is clear without any performance tests that native javascript for-loop is faster but there is no big difference for small arrays like 10-20 small items
which uses all integer arithmetic is usually faster than its floating-point equivalent likely significantly faster in the case of a floating-point type equivalent to t-sql s decimal type
the speed for tcp in comparison with udp is slower
here is a solution which encapsulates the call to malloc allocates a bigger buffer for alignment purpose and stores the original allocated address just before the aligned buffer for a later call to free
i m trying to create a program that outputs the highest primes than is a palindrome and is less than 1000
use rgba instead on the container div to set the opacity as the opacity properties is inherited by all children elements even text nodes meaning a descendant of any kind can t have a higher opacity than its parent
2 since superclass is smaller than subclassing one should use memory object carefully
the setter complexity can be higher than the getter and thus validate a unit-test
secondly you will find a for-loop is easier than a do loops for implementing the logic as you don t need to keep track of loops counter manually
both old and some modern systems implement a special vfork call which has somewhat strict limitations although less strict than the posix requireemnts for vfork but avoid this copy for performance reasons
btw i concur that udp is far more appropriate than tcp in this case
that continued usage of 1024-bit prime field elgamal or dsa keys is much riskier than it is for 1024-bit rsa all are still commonly used because once a successful attack has been conducted against a single well-chosen prime field all users of that prime field may be affected at little additional effort.
what makes quicksort faster than heapsort in practice is its constant that was ignored by big o analysis
finally note that by default ichol references the lower triangle of the input matrix and returns a lower triangular factors
i had an outlet of a viewgraph which was a subclass of uiview in which i drew some graphics.in landscape mode the size of the viewgraph is larger than in portrait mode
the above delta timer is better than setinterval method 1 makes use of settimeout method 2 but also corrects itself starts the timer using a function method 3 and doesn t pollute the scope with a special clockstart function method 4
note if we replace math.h by cmath the program does not compile with a warning of ambiguous call to pow seems a better condition
benchmarking the and versions against a for-loop with set is informative here and demonstrates that loops version is faster than either of the approaches
these relations naturally arise when you impose restrictions on what you can handle--then if a subclassing means that the method can handle less acts as a superclass of since can handle everything that the subclassing can handle and more
from what i heard quicksort should have better average case performance but from my tests it performs 4 times worse than heapsort for array of random integers
tostring itself uses an iterator just like equals but is a more inefficient approach
inverse modulo for 300 time take 1.422 seconde more than executing division sub and multiplication 10k time even the core of inverse modulo is build with same division and sub and multiplication functions and for this number it just do 150 time inside while help plz why
use a dawg which is more efficient than a trie in terms of space waste
then i think it would be the problem of precedence in most case they are left-to-right and i think multiplying would be calculated first because in c multiplying is more prior than add instruction by one level
because the unification performed as part of type inference transcends quantifier scope you can sometimes end up in a situation where ghc would have to unify a type variable in an outer scope with a quantified type from a nested scope which is how you get compiler errors about escaping types and skolems and whatnot the latter i assume being related to skolem normal form
after looking it s seems that hmac is much faster and better in term of security even if the underlying hash function sha1 is broken which is not the case when using rsa-sha1
when you call pandas.read_csv you can use a regular expression that matches zero or more spaces followed by a comma followed by zero or more spaces as the delimiter
instead of implementing all these over udp it is much better just to switch to tcp
i read that multiplication has has higher presedence than division
similarly as the subclassing gains more methods it inherited the list of superclass in the order in which they were named that precede it
this regex does replace by a single spaces all contiguous spaces 2 or more followed by a linefeed or individual tabs
the division operator has a higher order precedence as the addition operator
so i am using the music graph api to access and display artists similar to the current one in this case the who. however when i use a for-loop to go through the results .text artistnames only prints the last name in the arrays in this case it only prints pink floyd even though the arrays contains more artists. however console.log prints every name in the arrays
use dsa it tends to be more compact than rsa
further uppercase comparison is more optimized than tolower if that tiny degree of performance matters
a properties is nothing more than syntactic shorthand for a get set accessor
keep in mind that depending on the use and on the system using it while a boolean takes less space because it s just a single bit depending on the implementation an int is the native word size of the hardware
in general try-catch is more robust does not require you to define an exact position of where to test could be a block and provides info about the exception-handling
you can for example store a hash stored with something stronger than md5
you should know that strdup allocates more memory and returns its pointer which you then overwrite the original pointer returned by malloc so it will be impossible to free that memory since you no longer have the pointers
nsurlsession also provides nicer interfaces for requesting data using blocks in that it allows you to combine them with delegate methods for doing custom authentication handling redirect handling etc. whereas with nsurlconnection if you suddenly realized you needed to do those things you had to refactor your code to not use block-based callbacks
but using the prototype instances can inherited properties which means less memory and you gain a lot of flexibility
in this particular case you concluded that a bitwise-and operation of c++ language must be implemented by a bitwise-and machine operation while a modulo must somehow involve machine division which is allegedly slower
the reason being that sorting less elements which the grouping generally produces is going to be faster than sorting all input documents
sql server is probably smart enough to translate isnull into the equivalent sarg expression but if you are bent on using a function then coalesce is a better choice because it is part of the sql standard allows for multiple values instead of just two with isnull and avoids using quite possibly the most confusing function name microsoft ever devised in isnull
because the division operator has higher precedence than subtraction
however due to unpredictable floating-point precision issues it is sometimes little less than exact integer and in this case it is rounded down too much
also with the for-loop it s considered better to limit the scope of the iterating variable i and to use println you need system.out not just system and you need a string java arrays do not override tostring so something to output the numbers the user entered after loops like
actually we could say that tcp is a higher level protocol compared to udp because tcp includes some advanced features which might be useful .
also in this case keyboard input is essential and more important than mouse interaction
i have a validation on the droppable for not adding more than one draggable per droppable
hence your subclassing is accepting less classes than the superclass contract promises
more than this methodology i would suggest to you to do the training directly in keras as it claimed that keras optimizers are 5-10 times faster than tensorflow s optimizers
this platform is probably not representative of your microcontroller but the test shows that on this platform the subtraction is considerably slower than the division
the for-loop here is more efficient for 2 reasons a you don t have to construct a temporary arrays of tuples like with zip and b it returns false as soon as a non-match is found
division is about 10 times slower than multiplication
unless you re doing very heavy processing working with a single frame is probably faster than transferring it to the server as far as i know emgucv in c# isn t considerably slower than opencv in c c++
division is about 20 faster than multiplication
perhaps 128bit distributed-system internet-wide pointers but no more than 64bit in a system call or perhaps even a legacy 32-bit limit
i m well aware that inline is more of compiler decision than of user going so far as even to inlining non-specified inline-functions so the user control is almost negligible
it looks like the onload function is a more modern convenience method and the old way of checking the result is using onreadystatechange instead
i don t know what you anticipate your matrix band structure to look like but if it is symmetric and either diagonal dominant off diagonal bands along each row and column are opposite sign of diagonal and their sum is less than the diagonal entry or positive definite no eigenvectors with an eigenvalue of 0. then cg and iccg should be useful
i fixed this by adding after the for-loop and before the return statement which fixes the problem but if the for-loop is written to continue while i is less than the arrays length and when the arrays only contains a the length is one and i is 0 shouldn t it also pop a
the f indicates an rtp profile where the timing of rtcp feedback is more relaxed
with explicit superclass calling your subclassing can accept more or fewer arguments than its superclass and can decide itself what to pass when calling the superclass
the damerau-levenshtein algorithm includes many comparisons and int compare much faster than chars
there exist battery-backed packages of ram modules which can act as an ultra-fast hdd substitute but if they attach via sata scsi or other typical disk interface the still are slower than system ram
is there a simpler way than a for-loop to create this arrays or no
the conditional test and subtraction is typically less expensive than a modulo especially if the sum does not frequently exceed mod
normally a server wouldn t need to know the client s address beforehand but udp s knottier than tcp the more usual stream-oriented approach to socket communication in many ways
union all is generally faster than using distinct or grouping
on the other hand functions like printf or puts have more overhead per call than putc printf has to process the format string and puts has to call strlen or equivalent but that overhead only happens once no matter how many bytes you re writing
note that i m caching the length value as the array s length properties is actually an accessor which is marginally slower than an internal variable
so how is it possible for pypy to be faster than cpython also becomes fairly obvious
although because pbkdf2 applies your hash function a large number of times a long salt is less important than in traditional straight hashing applications. for my application i use a 32 byte random salt unique for each users account where i m hashing their password with pbkdf2
the bitwise operators are generally faster than modulo and division operators
the multiplication has higher precedence and therefore binds more tightly than addition
floating-point representation in memory can t add third link - because floating-point variables is much more strange than integer ones
i will assume that this data structure represents a tree and that nodes are numbered so that the parent always has a lower index than the children
technically accessing the ivar directly is faster than using accessor but there are very few situations in which it will make a significant performance difference and would probably be a case of premature optimization
the while loops with decrements was approximately 1.5 times slower than the for-loop
getimagedata has a for-loop i realised that each index in loops is called more than once
how can i change the handler so it only fires when the distance of mousemove between mousedown and mouseup is less than a fixed value
but if it works with large datasets the users will notice that using the malloc -only program slows down other programs much more than the realloc -using program with the same data
in addition to the previous answers the strncpy char pointer which seems unsafe for my opinion and the malloc which is safer but you need to remember to free it outside of the function and its inconsistent with the hierarchy of the program you can do the following
cannot sleep run atomically in soft irq context and are guaranteed to never run on more than one cpu of a given processors for a given tasklet
the reason to do this is because even though there is an integer division instruction div idiv in the instruction set it s typically very slow several times slower than multiplication
multiplication is less expensive than division so
the recursive cte is troublesome because it is limited to a max size of 32 767 much smaller than potential range sizes and has the very real possibility of being very slow
the rule of thumb is that if a cpu is given more than double the count of actively running threads as it has execution units these are the physical cores on a cpu chip and logical processors like hyperthreading technology that splits one core into two then the os will spend more time scheduling threads and switching between them cache-thrashing than it will spend actually running the threads
a typical implementation of rand is a linear congruential generator which is nothing more than a multiplying and add of some numbers with special properties relative primeness
bit shifting by a power of 2 is usually faster than multiplication or division
apparently transpose a matrix then multiplying it is faster than just multiplying the two matrices
either the tcp or udp protocols could be used to achieve this although tcp is probably easier
is the same as because division has higher priority than modulo
relatively speaking the string concatenation in your code is probably going to be slower than the int and boolean comparison operations you have here
although the calculation method that uses a prime a multiplication and an addition is slower than a single xor it gives you an overall better hash code in situations when you have multiple fields
this example is a bit looser than the inherited model provided by languages such as java -- an animal instance can have any behaviour at all rather than one of a specific set of behaviours depending on its subclassing
udp is actually expected to work better than tcp in lossy networks or congested networks
not only does postgresql have a far more flexible indexing than mysql but the table approaches are very different also meaning the appropriate indexing strategies are as different as the tactics are
i wrote this brute-force converter but your values don t seem to exactly match up with .net type precision - double 64bit is too low precision and decimal 128bit is more
you can use string.isnullorempty and toupper method is in general more accurate than tolower
as you can see the swift example is more complex and error prone than your objective-c code
having seen a question here on so about joining strings i have done some testing and came to knowledge that joining a string in a foreach is slower than with a for-loop and using the indexes in the arrays
note it is preferrable to use a series of if statements instead of a switch as long as the old versioning is smaller than the versioning for the n-th step upgrade that step
as far as tcp goes i think tcp is more generally used protocol for more data-centric requests like chat or things that require packet integrity udp tolerates packet loss to lower latency
some common examples are the crc checksums of which crc32 is very common but you can also relatively easily compute 64 or 128 bit or even larger crcs much much faster than an md5 hash
std map though is actually implemented in a way that many operations are slower than dictionary as its size gets large
while multiplication normally works subtraction fails for higher values
because of tcp requires connection and provides security it is slower than udp and therefore it should not be preffered during a video streaming
but even in that approach i always prefer to use the safer strncmp than strcmp
from what i understand octal was more popular than hex among users of 18-bit architectures since a word would be exactly 6 octal digits
although allocating with and freeing with is probably more c++ than malloc and free
this is valid under normal arithmetic operator precedence rules because multiplication has higher precedence than addition +
same functionality different machine code output bit shifting operations are almost always faster than multiplication division on most architectures
i would also suggest to replace terms like a l1 0.3e1 with as multiplication is faster then division
https can be quite slow over a 3g connection as the overhead in terms of number of packets to setup an ssl connection is higher than a plain tcp connection.
udp is way lighter and faster but somewhat less reliable than tcp
if the volume is larger than max range the formula will give error which is captured in the iferror part
all have more or less cumbersome and non-obvious error checking involving errno strtol is way much better than atoi in any case so avoid using atoi
filtering indexing sorting all is simpler that way
when writing your server bear in mind that the sequence of events for a tcp socket is much harder than for a udp socket since as well as the normal socket and bind calls you also have to listen and accept
you can use the javascriptconverter class when you need more control over the serializable and deserialization process
g_vertex_buffer_data and g_color_buffer_data are the arrays of data to use you will likely need to set up some shader code and the render code still has to be added but this is how to have more than one vbo texture coords colours normals etc
the memcpy version is not more complex or more dangerous than the strncpy version
since the buffer size of inputstream depends on the byte size i assigned when i use httpconnection the downloading speed is faster since it spends less time at writing the buffer data to file
and naturally a pragmatic design where you wrap the various records in a class the userprofile class with getter setter methods makes transitions simpler as you can easily hack in versioning at one place
mathematically left shifting is the same as multiplying a number by a power of 2 but as the operation is done only by shifting it is much faster than doing multiplication
so whether or not method 5 or 6 is faster depends on the cpu i can only surmise this is because the branch prediction in the command processors of the cpu is smarter on the new processors but i m not really sure
better than modifying superclass output would be to modify the superclass so that the subclassing can provide the appropriate shape name
when the data is on disk titan is faster than neo4j cause it has a better disk representation
if udp payload size is bigger than mtu size udp will silently segment the packet
in your check there is only one loops needed and a for-loop is much more conveniant
because sha256 hash are much longer than md5 hash you can detect the hash algorithm by looking at the length of the hash
jpql or hql is much more expressive and it s much easier to predict the associated generated sql query
for certain kinds of transactions a stateless session may perform slightly faster than a stateful session
the boilerplate code would multiplying rapidly when the express get more complex than addition of two terms
as far as easy goes they are both equivalent in terms of difficulty both provide assembly and c except that the gnu toolchain for avr is more complex than microchip because it requires use of unix command line etc
create new string which will collect edited versions of each word you can use stringbuilder or better stringjoiner with delimiter set as one spaces
the mouseover animation is 200ms longer than the mouseout so if you mouseover and mouseout in less than 200ms total the animations run in parallel and the mouseover one finishes last leaving the color red
you can override the setter s level to be lower than the getter s level with either private set or internal set
if you always keep track of the lengths of your strings you can compare lengths and use memcmp which is faster than strcmp
i think that functional declarative programming haskell scheme lisp etc is more powerful and more abstract than imperative programming and therefore is intrinsically harder to learn
out of experience i m involved to a project that uses huge amount of data using mysql and we mostly prefer myisam for data that can be generated it allows to achieve much higher performance losing transactions but generally speaking myisam is faster but innodb is more reliable
first sort the dataframe by time this should be more efficient than sorting each grouping by time
- coalesce should be more portable than isnull
this is because multiplication and division is faster in sse the 80-bit vs 64-bit issue again and that the sse registers are faster to manipulate in the fpu you can only access the top of the stack and rotating the fpu stack is often the slowest operation on a modern processor in fact some have an extra pipeline stage solely for this purpose
this gives you more flexibility than subclassing because with subclassing you are automatically inheriting all the methods in the superclass which is far more restricting than simply using some of the methods of another class
proposition when implemented in logic gates using the usual algorithms an integer multiplication circuit is o log n times slower than an addition circuit where n is the number of bits in a word
mips is much more orthogonal than x86 could ever dream of being
or will this result in an md5 hash that is more likely to collide than if i would concatenate the content of all dependent files together
hmac is better than a plain hash because it is not vulnerable to hash length extension attacks
however naive multiplication will get slower and slower as the exponent increases
using strncpy is considered safier than strcpy because the second one can easily cause buffer overrun
as a side-effect of implementing proper parent traversal lxml is a bit slower than celementtree for parsing
using a solution such as a prepare statement where it is not possible for a user to directly influence the actual sql query being execute is a safer alternative
in addition to the suppositions in question 4 supposing that my message is no bigger than the mtu - udp header - ip header size is the udp datagram that results guaranteed to fit into 1 ip packet on my local network at least
you can always develop an application without using getter and setter methods.as you have explained.but using getter and setter is better practice because access modifiers private public gives you encapsulation which is oops feature
this command uses key as is if its length smaller than md5 hash block length 64 bytes otherwise its uses md5 key as key and not key derived using cryptderivekey rc4 md5 key like in your implementation
if the matching element was found i set k and j greater than the for-loop conditions to quit the cycle but i get an exception at inner loops condition
any hash function like md5 sha1 sha256 etc obviously cannot be 100 unique - because they have a fixed length and due to the there must necessarily be non-unique results for input content that is larger than the hash
if your author field is selective and sorting is cheaper than filtering
if your compiler can do this then writing functions in a way that the compiler is able to inline is better than manually inlining the calls yourself
so in what platform and how memcpy can be significantly faster than memmove if there is none why providing two similiar functions instead of just memmove and lead to a lots of bug
since package protected is less accessible than public the code is reducing the accessibility of the foo method
i need to group the primes number partially to perform changes to frequency reducing the stages assuring the increment or numerator is greater than decrement or denominator to avoid the undersampling problem preferred small operands
the class of problems you can solve with while loops is strictly more powerful than those you could have solved with the strict for-loop found in pascal
multiplication is more expensive than addition subtraction and division is more expensive still
according to this analysis aes rijndael-128 is more than twice as fast as des 3des with a bigger key size more secure
it s even possible that you could implement pong using only integer arithmetic which is likely to be faster than floating-point -- but the difference is unlikely to be critical
using comparator instead of putting all the logic directly in the comparable gives you more flexibility in the order that things are compared in
but the the foreach loops takes more time than a the for-loop
on a cpu with a fast multiplier multiplying may only be on the order of 4 times slower than add but on normal hardware it s 16-32 times slower for a 32 bit operation
it has to do with the fact that multiplication is itself done by means of binary shifts and additions - far fewer than with division
i prefer using for-loop instead of foreach loops for-loop is preferably faster than foreach loops when you do not have to do something to each element and can solve your problem by just using the index as follows
tcp is subject to higher latencies than udp as it requires the client to send back packet confirmations
i have a file that i need to transmit through udp reliably i know tcp is the better option
this solution has the disadvantage that if the other factor is not constant the compiler and you can t reasonably avoid the division int_max n to be done at runtime and division is normally more expensive than multiplication
in all other cases division appears to be several times slower than multiplication
most lisp dialects have this concepts in scheme it is rarer since hygienic macros are supposed to reduce its usefulness
a for-loop is more adequate than a do while for simply iterating an arrays string
it would be better to use strtod for this purpose as it allows for error-checking but atof is simpler to use and so is used here
also this loops is better created as a for-loop
int is usually bigger than chars â more suitable for calculations but not so suitable for byte-level manipulation
i believe gridview allows much finer grained control of display than does listview
if you want the fastest encryption algorithm then there s no substitute for testing it yourself - somewhat strangely php s sha1 implementation is significantly faster than its md5 i know these are hash - this is to illustrate that performance depends on implementation as much as algorithm
this step works because all elements less than the median in a would intersect only with those elements before the insertion rank of a s median in b
inspecting the assembly shows that in the sequential access case eigen is faster because the sum becomes vectorized while it does not when using raw boost multi_array
i am wanting to sum the amt by year and grouping and then filtering where the summed amt for any given grouping is greater than 100
the tcmalloc library for example can be easily inserted into an application to evaluate performance gains in heavily threaded applications where tcmalloc tends to perform a lot better than libc s malloc implementation
generally speaking the inline keyword is used more now to allow you to violate the one definition rule when you define a function in a header than to give the compiler a hint about inlining
hex is somewhat more readable than binary if i happen to be loading a data dump in a text editor etc
clearly ruby considers the multiplication operator to be of a higher precedence than the addition + operator
of course you might still ask whether to use strncpy or strcpy in implementing that abstraction strncpy is safer there provided you fully grok what it does
memory use is a fractions of that used by the non-paged version at just under 600 kilobytes for a hundred million and just over 600 kilobytes for one billion which slight increase is just the extra space required for the base primes less than the square root of the range list
crypt with hash is simply more expensive than md5
while memmove will be only slightly slower than memcpy due to the assumptions it needs to make about the source and destination in memcpy they cannot overlap it should still be far superior to any standard loop
addition subtraction for the rectangular bound calculation is cheaper than multiplication
use socket for tcp and datagram for udp its a lot faster than tcp but less connection oriented
this may help in case you have a real nth root precision problem but my experiance is that the builtin math.pow double int is more precise
for this particular application sending simple data chunk to the client from an index given by the client tcp will not perform any better than udp
hence as compared to tcp udp is more attractive for delay-sensitive applications like audio video
most optimizing c compilers optimize it out to a multiplication operation which is much faster than division it can be done only if the divisor is constant though
the specific reason that you have to pay close attention to byte-order when handling ipv4 address and port numbers is that the structures sockaddr_in and in_addr have data members with int types larger than chars and whose contents are required to be in network byte order
the server-side way is more reliable and browser-independent while the client-side approach will decrease the amount of incoming traffic to server
also you can make your code simpler by using isnull or coalesce to handle columns which contain nulls
because hard disk have a much slower memory than ram virtual private server performance may slow down considerably
an individual floating-point division instruction will take longer than an integer one
when i want to write the full contents of a file into an outputstream i usually allocate a buffer as a then make a for-loop to read data from the file s inputstream into the buffer and write the buffer contents into the outputstream until the inputstream has no more bytes available
and the value of this expression evaluated according to the precedence rules is 62 because multiplication has higher precedence than addition
webclient is a shorter and more concise syntax but behind the scenes it uses a webrequest so in terms of performance it won t be faster it will be equivalent
converting between time zones runs in constant time as there is nothing more involved than simple addition subtraction
having data structures that start on 4 byte word alignment on cpus with 4 byte buses and processors is far more efficient when moving data around memory and between ram and the cpu
udp suits well for passing short messages but for transferring large amounts of data tcp is more preferable
integer math is often much faster than floating-point so such a function could be a major performance win
okay so after telling the user to enter the size of the arrays the arrays was assigned to lets say 5 therefore in the first for-loop the program is checking if i is less than the arrays size so it can only be entered 5 times as that is the size of the arrays
i thought about aborting the request if the interval between mouseenter and mouseleave is lower than a threshold but it does not help
the opengl sin cos implementation has probably higher precision but not by much
this will make your work easier as searching sorting filtering than handling 3 parallel arrays
each operation takes a specific length and typically multiplication will take more than addition
so assess the situation the development cost of a udp transport is higher to significantly higher than tcp and to some degree you are re-inventing tcp
i have no concrete figures on that but from my own experience i d estimate that instrumented tests are around 100-400 slower typemock seeming to be faster than ms moles
d3.js is not wrong the data is incorrect and leaflet is more lenient
no sw is running on responder side - allows much lower latency 10 times less than typical tcp udp latency
udp just has a smaller overhead than tcp but that comes at the cost of reliability
it doesn t sound as if you need anything more elaborate than a countif function and a sumifs function
if i set the cpu affinity to cpu0 the cpu usage is 5 but after setting affinity to other cpu the cpu usage increased to 9 12 especially set to cpu20 the cpu usage is more than 25
first option with var as local vaariable and two getter and setter defines better as property because it give option to control input validation and do custom code when setting value like raiseing event
furthermore since at least in java you can only have the access modifier for an overwritten method to allow more but not less access than the superclass method you are still gonna drag either protected member variables or protected getter and setter all the way up in your subclassing
i ve read that aes encryption is more secure than the triple des encryption ms is using in their example above
addition happens to be exact in fixed-point as long as it does not overflow but fixed-point multiplication is no more exact than floating-point multiplication
note that i ve incorporated dshin s comment that multiplying is faster than division however the performance improvement is about 90 removing the binary search 10 multiplication vs
this is happening because of speed of for-loop which is faster than your time .as loops iterates in time of less than miliseconds and generates values.you can only call it when you want to insert single value to database and don t iterate for values
udp gives smaller latency with many many issues to discuss here of course tcp gives bigger latency
as a side note using toupper is more efficient than using tolower so toupper would be the way to go
to prefer isnull over coalesce when given the choice is that isnull tends to produce query plans that are more efficient than coalesce
execution of aes is more faster than rsa for same key sizes
on modern processors float division is a good order of magnitude slower than float multiplication when measured by reciprocal throughput
for looping over lines in files you can use a for-loop which is more readable than while loops
multiplication is more complex and you can reference the solution in the question efficient 128-bit addition using carry flag
noexcept was added rather than just removing all throw specifiers other than throw because noexcept is more powerful
i am supposed to write and algorithm which uses recursion divide-and-conquer to multiply two arrays.these arrays hold big numbers that are greater than long int 64 or double capacity
it is well known that integer division is slow operation typically several times slower than integer multiplication
multiplication has higher precedence than division
most of the time reading the table from rom is still faster than multiplication division
4 fewer merge options than in git though the fossil workflow makes merging less likely to occur in the first place.
i found that orientdb is too slow at least much slower than neo4j even on relatively small 150k datasets when searching records by text pattern despite the presence of indices
but i guess multiplication is more computationally expensive than addition
so at this point in time pypy is just over 9 times faster than cpython in this micro benchmark
inlining inlining produces fatter code which is faster the inline functions will not appear in the call stack
so even ignoring practical considerations like disk is slower than ram it will be slower
window media player uses directshow which gives you better performance and greater flexibility than playsound under mci
from my experience collapse filtering is much faster than grouping
if you want to search a volume a quadtree or octree works better
i presume that you know that using a division is a lot slower than multiplying by decimal number 5 is always slower than 0.2
usually if you re going to consume all the elements of the iterator in a single loops it is better to use the for-loop approach and it will be better using the enhanced for-loop that already uses iterator behind the scenes
also depending on radix sort s radix size its constant factor may be larger than quicksort s mergesort s log factor
chunk features includes branching looping and macros and has a simpler syntax than velocity and freemarker
if aes is negotiated it s faster than des and 3des used by default by older applications
if so what is the nature of the output of lz77 that makes it more suitable for huffman compression than lzw or some other method entirely
this one s an overflow but i think it illustrates the unreliability of isnumeric in general especially for int - for double it s much more reliable
if you know buffers cannot overlap memcpy is fine and may in any given library use optimizations that allow it to be faster than memmove
you can also user a stemming which is a simpler version of lemmatization
noexcept allows for more efficient code generation in that it does not have to perform rtti on throw exceptions instead if an exception is throw from a call-frame underneath a noexcept-declared function std terminate is called short-circuiting the crazy std unexpected machinery specified by the 98 standard
client-side will also be more responsive than server-side because there s no request-response but that s really only a perceived performance issue for high-latency connections
while testing my implementation i discovered that although it generally performed better than regular quicksort heapsort consistently outperformed both
udp communication requires much less overhead than tcp due to the number of messages exchanged
in the above code #header seems to overflow out of #header_wrapper because of and which adds up to more than the height of #header_wrapper and even though box-sizing border-box has been applied its still overflowing
unwound before program execution is terminated. he said code using noexcept is more optimized than code using throw
that is essentially the one case in which repeated subtraction 0 or 1 times a special case of repeated subtraction can be and commonly is but not necessarily faster than division-based modulo
quicksort is not better it is well suited for a different kind of application than mergesort
basically collections are things that implement some kind of iterable interface and they internally use the same iteration method though lodash source is a bit more convoluted than underscore.js
from what i ve read i was expecting quicksort to be faster than mergesort but on my code it is not so i assume there must be a problem with my quicksort algorithm
if you need a surrogate primary key using an auto_increment field is better than an md5 hash because it is fewer bytes of data and database backends optimize for integer primary keys
write the application differently - create a matching interface and write the service provider implementation against it testing that and also write a minimal subclass of the abstract-class that does nothing more than forward calls to the interface
the resulting page identifiers will also be shorter than md5 hash and will only contain digits so they will be easy to include in url query strings etc
thus python should interpret this like 12 2 i.e 6 since precedence of multiplication is more than division
also throwing illegalargumentexception makes more sense instead of nullpointerexception when string has blank empty or null values
also note that in my code above manually calculating the euclidean distance is much faster then calling pdist
the invariant is that each parent is less than both its children
so a 128bit adder will be slower than a 64bit add
multiplication division and modulo have the same precedence and they all have higher precedence than addition and subtraction
i prefer user getter and setter because is less code and more legible
i changed the genrandom function to genrandomword length and instead of using a while loops i used a for-loop which is easier to see how long it will run for
in many processors integer multiplication is vastly faster than integer division
udp is also more work than tcp if you need reliability which is built in to tcp
you can t cast a superclass in a subclassing because the subclassing may have a bigger interface than the superclass means the subclassing can have functions like getunixtimestamp that the superclass doesn t have
because multiplication has a higher precedence than addition
for cases where each node in the trie has most of its children used the trie is substantially more space efficient and time efficient than th ternary search tree
i have coded a routine to compute the cartesian product of different tables as in a database with the only exception that the tables are stored as files in my case and for computing the cartesian product i am using file i o for reading files i am using filereader coupled with bufferedreader and for writing files i am using filewriter coupled with bufferedwriter now as i am performing every computation externally in files i.e i compute the product as follows i take a row from file-1 which is table-1 in my case and concatenate it with every other row in file-2 which is table-2 in my case and write it to an external file which holds the result
i came across a situation where i need to implement a for-loop with more than one loops control variable
avoid public attributes in class use getter and setter it s just shorter there
this is called a strength reduction operation because subtraction is a weaker and cheaper operation than division
you could for example generate a random aes key encrypt it using rsa and store it in the output file and then encrypt the file itself with aes which is much faster and doesn t have any problem with large inputs
in the end you have a scheme whose encoder is more complex but whose decoder couldn t be simpler
counter1 can be used with instanceof and inherited but is more verbose and doesn t have real private properties eg count properties is exposed
following the linux kernel coding gudelines i don t fancy typedef because they tend to make the data definitions opaque if something is declared elsewhere as the typedefined type understanding that is a struct is somewhat more complicated
i ve replaced settimeout with setinterval which is more appropriate for repeated tasks
most importantly you can easily supplement udp with some reliable delivery hand-shaking that s less overhead than tcp
keep in mind that implementing udp traversal is easier than tcp
i suppose the first option is good for small arrays but a for-loop is probably better practice as the amount of code would remain the same regardless of arrays size
the coalesce function is used here because it is more portable than nvl or ifnull
where exponentiation has a higher precedence than multiplication or division
the mtu is closer to 1500 and this applies to tcp not udp
a for-loop fits better to your requirements than a while loops
remember the tuples are saved into the disk which is vastly slower to access than things in ram
the code makes some reasonable assumptions but it may fail to detect an escaped field if its doublequote is followed or preceded by more than 3 spaces before after field delimiter
for example matlab multiplies two 1000x1000 matrices in 0.15 seconds on my computer r needs 1 second while c++ armadillo lapack blas needs more than 10 seconds for that
setting it on a many-to-one or many-to-many relationship is more awkward
it is suggested in this so post that c# is more efficient with toupper because microsoft optimized it that way. but i ve also read this argument that converting tolower vs
dr your heapsort is not faster because it isn t actually a heapsort it s a backwards insert sort followed by an in-place ordering reversal
this is why pypy may be slower than cpython sometimes it needs a warm-up phase in which it can actually optimize repeated operations
also for printing arrays i recomend to use the enhanced for-loop it is easier
the point of this cache is to store data that the cpu is using quite regularly to speed up transfer time since the cpu cache is physically closer to the processors then ram is
for example quicksort is faster than heapsort in general although their time complexity are the same
mercurial is significantly faster than bazaar it s slower than git though by a much smaller difference
if you include the explicit rbind version it is slightly faster than the do.call rbind rep list a n version but not by much and slower than either the apply or matrix versions
i can t use anything more than basic addition and subtraction and string parsing functions
yes but if you think of your diagram as a topographic map the subclassing have higher altitudes than the superclass
tcp streaming for audio can be less helpful than udp rtp as you d have to turn off nagling
if the above is true doesn t this mean that the foreach loops is much slower then the common for-loop since it involves making copies of each element of the arrays
no intel or amd x86 manuals ever guarantee atomicity of anything wider than 64bit except for lock cmpxchg16b so this talk of sse vector loads stores being atomic on some cpus isn t something that you can reliably take advantage of or detect when it s supported
note that in both cases you can take advantage of the fact that int also implements so you can use its compareto method to determine whether corresponding values in each instance of your class are less than equals to or greater than each other
this changes the variable curve so that it now points to the middle of the arrays that was previously initialized so that the follow-on for-loop indexing is likely easier for the programmer to think about and a bit cleaner to write debug etc
also if you have very limited memory processing resources it is worth bearing in mind that udp is a less costly protocol as it avoids a lot of the overheads tcp incurs due to its inbuilt connection management
my another question is if i put the data size smaller than mtu into sendto then i can gurantee call sendto once socket only sends one tcp udp packet
it feels like arangodb is focused on graph operations and neo4j fits more the needs of using graphs if you have more relations than rows the reason to use graphs instead of relations with joins
using webclient is potentially slightly on the order of a few milliseconds slower than using httpwebrequest directly
both operations are done down at the floating point unit fpu level and even in the world of integral alus the division circuit is a far busier place than a multiplication circuit
memcmp is simpler than strcmp and can be implemented even more efficiently in places where the strings are known to be properly aligned
since you re presenting multiple columns a gridview control is a better alternative to checkboxlist
nonatomic properties don t use locks but direct ivar is faster because it skips the accessor call
this breaks the inherited and the subclassing is no longer an instance of the superclass
but is there any specific situation when while loops is better than for-loop
for a counterexample i think scheme programs ran faster and used less memory than the lisp programs that preceded them mdash
as for me settimeout is simpler than setinterval in this case as you won t need to clearinterval in the end of the array
eugene s suggestion of using ecc is a good one - ecc keys are much shorter than rsa or dsa for a given security level
also the hash algorithm itself is much slower than sha1 md5 sha1 md5 are made for speed - not a useful property when storing passwords
r-tree are substantially faster than quadtree for window queries like inside contains covers etc
any sort of reverse proxing of tcp udp connections is more scalable at a lower osi level ie layer 3 or layer 2 instead of layer 6 7 as nginx is operating at
since ntile might put the same number in more than one percentile i use a query to calculate the percentile using rank
using fgets and fputs is faster than multiple calls to getc and putc all you need is a buffer a little buffer in this case to store the current line
according to agner s instruction tables a single fp division is slower than a single reciprocal op and a single multiplying op
on most processors a boolean operation has no reason to significantly be slower or faster than an addition both are basic instructions even though comparison may take two of them subtract then comparing to zero
i don t understand why the division multiplication in c++ is so much slower than addition subtraction where the managed c# version is more reasonable to my expectations
often running the equivalent commands in the terminal be they ant maven etc. is clearer when failures occur because you ll see the full error output
that s why realloc can temporarily require more memory than a malloc free pair
http is an application layer protocol which could be encapsulated with a protocol that uses udp providing arguably faster reliable communication than tcp
polar is well-suited to rotation operations and scaling i guess but sticking with cartesian where a rotation is four multiplies see below is probably going to be cheaper than using cos sin acos asin every time you want to do a vector addition
tcp as you know udp is faster than tcp even if udp may miss some
above is a simplified version of my actual code where the c arrays is much larger so i have to use a for-loop to get every index
1 i guess dask will be slower than pandas for smaller datasets
use a for-each loops to go through a range it s not as fast as using a variant arrays but keeps things simple and offers better speed than a for-loop
i am wondering if there is a cross-platform allocator that is one step lower than malloc free
from what i read on the net multiplication is usually easier to compute than division
longer answer 64bit x86 has more general purpose registers which gives the compiler more of an opportunity to optimize local variables into registers for faster access
running with debug option -x seems to imply that command substitution is similar to subshell since bash outputs a deeper nesting for it
this is the reason why working with the higher-dimensional arrays ends up being so much faster than the for-loop -based code
division is inherently a much slower operation than multiplication
adding a dynamic salt to each user would mean that you will have to hit a datastore to retrieve the dynamic salt and the hash version of the user s password then you will have to perform the cpu intensive hash function in your code twice -- you are hashing a hash which is less secure and more likely to have collisions
as for streaming it s better to use udp first because it lowers the load on servers but mostly because you can send packets with multicast it s simpler than sending it to each connected client
if a task is cpu bound calcuating something making it multi threaded will only improve performance if you have more than one processors to run the calculations
if you subclassing has less arguments than a superclass and you could make them optional in the superclass just add placeholders in the subclassing
edit double metaphone was specifically designed to be better than soundex and work in languages other than english
this is the proper solution don t ever rely on passing a string as a function when using settimeout or setinterval it s slower because it has to be evaluated and it just isn t right
iirc floating-point multiplication is much less expensive than division so this might be faster than both
oo class diagram is more abstract and has more features than entity-relationship diagram
145 the output is like â ºâ â â ºâ â it doesn t reverse when the range is higher than 145 it works fine in gcc for borland turboc the minimum range must be 65 otherwise the program prints strange values instead of reversing it
i ve been messing around with different ways of implementing this and would like a bit of advice on whether tcp or udp is a better protocol to implement the communication between client and server
however multiplying is a more complex operation than addition or shifting
if you re really concerned with portability i m not sure that there s any better option than using printf and strtod and assuming that you may not necessarily have any more accuracy than the absolute minimum required by he relevant specification section 5.2.4.2.2 of the c99 spec.
i ve made some programs and saw that scanf and printf are considerably faster than using cin and cout
pencil and paper division in base 2 32 or 2 64 would be a lot more efficient than division by subtraction and i believe that gmp employs a better algorithm than that
multiplication and division are higher precedence than addition so they get done first - before the implicit conversion to string for concatenation
for example locality of references has influence on cache hits or misses which is the reason why quicksort performs better than mergesort
the double_unit stuff is how random actually does it internally because multiplication is faster than division see floating point division vs floating point multiplication
i have an expensive for-loop that is taking more time than it should due to dynamic casting overhead inside loops
you re using des in your example which is a flawed and obsolete algorithm alternatively use 3des so i suggest moving to aes which provides better encryption
the structure of the hmac algorithm makes it less susceptible to attacks on properties of the underlying hash algorithm
grouping that by acct to do the count by acct and when the result is greater than 1 filtering it using a having clause
the same result can be obtained also by comparing tostring of each map as you suggested but using equals is a more intuitive approach
if the query itself and the response are small a few bytes consider using udp instead of tcp it s faster and you can use lower values of sendinterval
what would happen if my udp package is larger than mtu
on the other hand passing an element and its attributes like maps to a call to document.createdocumentfragment which is slower than createelement followed by a write to the classname property
the longer the arrays gets the more iterations your for-loop will need
in my test keyup gives a smoother transition as compared to keydown
in some cases hand-writing a for-loop is much faster than the equivalent accelerate functions because the compiler can optimize your loops better than the function
one cannot assume that more than one spaces is delimiter
or use the length of the data in the arrays which may be smaller than the arrays size and use a simple for-loop
in this case i would use coalesce which provides more levels than isnull rather than the case stement
similarly if you skip the five first elements your loop takes o n-5 time but that too is the same as o n because adding or subtract a constant is even weaker than multiplying by a constant
this is happening because the concatenation operator has a higher precedence than the addition or subtraction operators but multiplication and division have a higher precedence then concatenation
des turned out to be even slower than aes but for my current requirements a much simpler algorythm rc4 is sufficient
percentile rank is much more complicated than simply dividing it up by n
overall common lisp is much more uniform than scheme and more radical language experiments if done at all are usually embedded as a portable library rather than defining a whole new language dialect
2 however coalesce requires all arguments to be of the same data type thus being stricter than nvl which will first attempt an implicit conversion
this way is better than having getter and setter in base of performance not to have reduntant code of two methods getter and setter
using multiprocessing is probably not going to speed up reading data from disk since disk access is much slower than ram access or calculations
which is more efficient is up for debate but based on cpu bulk instructions which can copy an entire block of memory in one instruction memcpy is probably faster as strncpy would check each copied byte for a nul character
division of quaternion a by quaternion b is nothing more than multiplying a by the multiplicative inverse of b
you might replace the max subquery with a rank max is usually slower only when cus_id is the pi rank might be worse
each line can do one of three things it can call a function which modifies it s argument start a while loops which is really more of a for-loop or assign a variable
while 256-bit aes might sound less secure than 4096-bit rsa they might actually be quite similar from the offered protection
the compiler or the jit is likely to convert the first case to the second anyway since multiplication is typically faster than division
the fact is not all routers support this scenario and always require port forwarding for udp traffic tcp traffic is easier because there is an on-going connection the router can maintain with the client
udp is simpler protocol than tcp and you can still simulate features of tcp using udp
i have no problem with methods declared inline in a header in some cases - a struct s constructor a simple method where inlining measurably makes it faster we have some math functions like this etc
for example on ati cards you ll want to manually vectorize code using float4 int4 data types or accept a nearly 4x performance penalty while nvidia works better with scalar data types
it might be that latency of various instructions is much better covered by the processors thanks to hyperthreading or cache behavior as sizes differ
for the sake of completeness i would like to mention another less powerful algorithm with addition subtraction
what i have thought of so far is that tcp is going to be more reliable than udp and in rmi corba we want network reliability
the latter doesn t do any dynamic memory allocator and is more than 10 times faster than std to_string on boost karma benchmarks
use a radix tree wiki or trie wiki if you are concerned about performance.the radix tree is more memory efficient compared to a trie
while udp has less network overhead than tcp it generally relies on you the developer to come up with your own mechanisms for flow control fragmentation handling lost packets etc.
asymptotic analysis reveals order of growth of heapsort in the worst case is big-o n logn which is better than quicksort s big-o n 2 as a worst case
considering most rsa moduli are at least 1024 bit this will be much larger than an aes key
what you try to achieve is certainly possible with xquery or with xslt which is more convenient for transforming xml trees especially for multiple transform passes
i assume that is parsed correctly because the two operators have different precedences meaning that associativity does not come into play and that your grammar correctly implements precedence although you should note that is a more standard example for showing that multiplication has higher precedence than addition since simple left-to-right parsing of gives the same result as your parser
multiplying first is probably simpler than using floating point if you only want an integer result and if you know that the multiplication will never overflow
for that purpose i want to transform the simulink model into a c version and launch it from a matlab script so that the process would be much faster than opening simulink environment
firstly multiplication and division is actually quicker in some circumstances
here the for-loop header takes actually more time than loops body thus profiling results could be distorted.
these are situations where udp is good but in most other situations tcp is better
filtering is a lot less expensive than sorting
a for-loop would be more compact but a while loops is perhaps simpler if you aren t used to python s loops
for example the patricia trie or the radix tree that is far more space efficient than an hash table for strings but of course being a tree lookup computational complexity is o log n and building it is o n log n
the difference between disk speed and ram speed is more or less an arithmetic factor
tcp is certainly going to be more reliable than udp since udp doesn t guarantee packet delivery which is probably why you application is hanging on the receive
and the results is that foreach loops is 5-6 times faster than the for-loop
modulo is more mathematical if you like while the remainder in the c-family is consistent with the common integer division satisfying and this is adopted from old fortran
using getter or setter function is better
many current processors chips incorporate more than one cpu and a cpu may itself be able to interleave a couple of threads
while function calls can be a little worse than inline code for very simple operations repeated inlining of non-trivial functions can create arbitrarily worse code bloat
icomparable is an interface that defines that two instances of the implementing class can be seen as greater than less than or equals to one another
the -match operation removes those lines that don t start with an sha1 hash and the -replace operation collapses adjacent spaces into a single delimiter so that convertfrom-csv won t create empty fields when there is more than 1 spaces in a row
a property is nothing more than a getter and setter function
the first possible issue i can think of is that because udp doesn t have the overhead inherent in the transmission control that tcp does udp has higher data bandwidth and lower latency
i was going to use reliable udp but tcp seems more appropriate
it s not necessarily true that the matlab fixed-point arithmetic provides less precision it can be used to provide more precision than ieee floating-point types
fakeiteasy seems to have an overall nicer syntax than moq like the strongly-typed way the former deals with passing parameters to a constructor of a faked class
re-order your script so the subtraction test is timed first then the addition and suddenly addition becomes the faster operation again
as you see md2 is also much much shower than the other hash â the same outcome as with the php code but md5 is much faster than sha-1 and overall it took less time in delphi to do the same on the same machine as php
yes division is usually much slower than multiplication
data is not an accessor for properties it s both more and less than that
the latter where is called without arguments does indeed have a lesser precedence than the properties accessor - so that your expression evaluates as new number.tostring
also sml has stricter precedence rules than haskell
the difference between the two boils down to the syntax with which objects are instantiated - classical inherited uses the more familiar constructor functions and new operator which hide the inherent prototypal nature of javascript s object creation and inherited properties
the pypy jit for python is also much more complex than cpython but also typically much faster â increased complexity is a fairly typical cost for speed. the four levels of disassembly for julia code give you access to the representation of a julia method implementation for particular argument types at different stages of the transformation from source code to machine code
still you cannot inherited from a as superclass cannot have a lower visibility than subclassing
data structure to implement reverse functionality of a dictionary that is more than one key map to a common value using python
i am guessing this is because modifying a double is a more complex operation than modifying an int
integer division is about an order of magnitude slower than multiplication on current cpus.
a for-loop is usually faster than a while loops and it is more difficult to build an endless loops than it is by using a while loops
udp packets greater than the mtu size of the network that carries them will be automatically split up into multiple packets and then reassembled by the recipient
union forces a distinct to occur and there s little slower than distinct
tsv tab separated values so the built-in csv module is more than enough to export your data
as far as efficiency rsa is going to be orders of magnitudes slower than aes so the trade-off you make is that you give up simplicity you give up the simplicity of using aes in favor of some rsa chunking in return for poor performance you get the slower performance of rsa.
why the access modifiers for the getter setter is more restrictive has in my opinion something to do with easier implements interfaces which always have implicitly public properties
i would like to add the pow in my evaluator with an higher precedence than multiplying and divide
division is one of a number of operations which as far as computational complexity theory is concerned are no more expensive than multiplication
you can verify with a simple objdump symbols objfile.obj that the length of decorated symbols by using typedef s is incredibly longer than their similar counterparts split into struct s microsoft compilers have historically used a proprietary name mangling scheme
in practical programming languages the distinction between the two is a bit blurred but is important to know that the c java for-loop is closer to a theoretical while loops while the pascal for behaves more like the theoretical for-loop
as for the last question floating point arithmetic particularly double precision is much more complex than int arithmetic so on a reasonably modern pipelined processor each instruction will take longer to execute
i am using a for-loop which iterates i time and every time it is checked whether the ith number of the arrays is greater than 1 or not
liblinear is considered faster than linear libsvm and often used for large scale data set
the decision on yours the tcp protocol used for connection oriented network that is more secure than udp
it might seem unintuitive but it has a lower precedence than multiplication addition and modulo operations
why with this grammar multiplication have higher precedence than addition

in ... for-loop it s consider better practice to loops trough it with a regular for
just to goof off a version using boost string_ref is much faster still due the reduced allocator
i did test it a while ago with the result that a for-loop is much faster than a foreach loops
a much better solution is to be sure that the code that needs a reference to the active and displayed itemsform instance has one either directly through constructor or setter getter method calls or better indirectly through a m-v-c program structure
say your first versioning of application had the databasehelper extending sqliteopenhelper with constructor passing versioning as 1 and then you provided an upgrade application with the new source code having versioning passed as 2 then automatically when the databasehelper is constructed platform triggers onupgrade by seeing the file already exists but the versioning is lower than the current versioning which you have passed
the while loops runs 3000 times faster than the for-loop
icomparable declares the compareto method which returns an integer that specifies a less than equals to or greater than relationship between two objects of the same type
if it s a very deep inner loops however and you need to squeak out every last nanosecond my experience has been that with release build code a for-loop indexing over an arrays is measurably faster than a foreach loops with a slightly smaller performance loss for using delegates with linq vs
allow for the possibility that there may be any number of whitespace characters one or more between cin and and between cout and
division has higher precedence than subtraction so in the first two examples only the second number is being divided
the for-loop question is more of someone building a loops with exit criterion inside the actual loops
pbkdf2 also uses a more complex construction in particular hmac over direct digest to make recovering the input password from an output value more difficult
i think udp will perform better than tcp gcdasyncsocket in your case video transfer
it is likely that you could do an sha hash of 100kb in well less than 10 second though and though sha-1 is still theoretically flawed it is of higher strength than md5
png achieves better compression than gif because it applies a pre-filtering step before the lossless compression deflate roughly equivalent to lzw. see wikipedia s explanation of png filtering
this formula fails for integers whose sum is an odd -ve number as their floor is one less than their average
having said that web2py has a lower initial learning curve than django as it was specifically designed as a learning tool
to explain why a for-loop is faster than a for in loops is basically understand the underlying data structures used to store the data in memory
in practice the fifo queue approach is often faster than using a priority queue dijkstra as mentioned in this answer are there faster algorithms than dijkstra
a key-stretching algorithm like pbkdf2 applies a quicker hash like sha512 thousands of times typically causing the hash generation to take 1 5 of a second or so

it uses swap space on disk to allow for processes much larger than ram
edit using an enhanced for-loop is a lot better than using arrays
puremvc is more invasive than cairngorm meaning that your code is heavily dependent on the framework you have to subclass implement the framework classes interfaces but that doesn t mean that cairngorm isn t
if not multiple fgets calls will still be faster than multiple fgetc calls because the overhead of the latter will be greater
integer multiplication is much faster than division
this is slightly better than the minimum allowed for mediump as it can represent all of the ints in the range -2048 to 2048 source not the -1024 to 1024 that you re worrying about
usually i find swift s method naming to be cleaner than objective-c s but init methods can be an exception
ultimately if the structure of a loops is more expensive than the operations within loops and the tiny performance overhead from loops is actually significant then you might have a case for-loop unrolling
now how can we predict in advance if there are more than one int whose logarithm is 123456.78 up to the precision of system.double or if there is in fact no int whose logarithm hits that specific double the precise result of an ideal pow function being an irrational number
as others have stated the python for-loop is more like a a traditional foreach loops in the sense that it iterates over a collection of items without checking a condition
scenario where udp is better than tcp
tcp - more reliable than udp but this comes with some overhead there is a distinct connection a better match for games which require less frequent data transmission such as turn based games as is your game
the libsvm results seems much more stable but scikit-learn results have some drastic fluctuation
this overlap is somewhat forced when the draggable is bigger than the droppable
the idea here is threefold readability using operator functions with compatible left and right arguments as well as return value and the use of integer multiplying operators being faster than unsigned operators
when i generate rsa key pairs by openssl it seems like private key private exponent is always less than public key modulo
while ruby and python are both interpreted-language and operation-for-operation slower than compiled-language the reality is in executing an application only a small portion of cpu time is spent in your code and the majority is spent into the built-in libraries you call into which are often native implementations and thus are as fast as compiled code
moreover tcp has more processing overhead than udp
the reason heapsort is slower in practice than quicksort is due to the better locality of reference in quicksort where data elements are within relatively close storage locations
protected functions maintain a weaker invariant than the public one before and after each call
networkx is much easier to deal with and usually performance is good enough but for large brute force algorithms like this igraph will probably be at least an order of magnitude faster
a taylor series expansion is a good starting point for the coefficients but you usually want to minimize the max-absolute-error or relative error over that specific range and taylor series coefficients likely leave have a lower or higher outlier over that range rather than having the max positive error nearly matching the max negative error
in this default implementation the jks format is better suited for a single keystore that is to handle both trusted entries and key entries in the same container
i did this very successfully with scipy.ndimage in the floating-point domain way better results than integer image processing like this
that suggests another aspect where a declared properties is more than a pair of accessor methods that is more static type checking although it is undesirable here
btw when you use settimeout or setinterval it is better to pass it an actual function instead of a string with the source code for a function
for multiplication division it s harder ie more instructions
the difference is large enough that the constant factor in front of the n log n term in quicksort is lower than the constant factor in front of the n log n term in heapsort which is one reason why quicksort is much faster than heapsort
there exist processors on which using an integer vector load movdqa to load data that is consumed by a floating-point operation requires more time than using a floating-point load to get data for a floating-point operation and vice-versa
im going to have a second for-loop that makes more arrays and names these arrays as the strings from my previous arrays
if you re interesting in reducing the size of the resulting cookies you should consider using ecdsa rather than rsa to produce the signatures - ecdsa signatures are considerably smaller than rsa signatures of an equivalent security factor
alternatively you could initialize i outside of the for-loop but then it s scoped larger than loops itself
so intutively it appears that to explain the variance we should go for mixture of more than two poisson distribution
using declarative effects is better than thunks for testability but the saga pattern can be implemented on top of imperative or declarative code
lemmatization implies a broader scope of fuzzy word matching that is
to save both subprocess s stdout and stderr is more complex because you should consume both streams concurrently to avoid a deadlock
short answer if you can tolerance with any packet loss udp is better otherwise tcp
xrange will give you an iterable object that won t use memory as you iterate a for-loop is cleaner than a while loops + counter if you ask me
usually division is a lot more expensive than multiplication but a smart compiler will often convert division by a compile-time constant to a multiplication anyway
note that udp packets bigger than the mtu s at every hope between your hosts will be split by ip
a stateful service is typically harder to develop and scale than stateless services
that among other things is why tcp is considered more reliable but slower than udp
jemalloc and tcmalloc with some setting changes can be more aggressive than glibc to release memory to the os - but again it depends on the allocation patterns
as hroptatyr mentioned the multiplication is quite fast and it s much faster than division
the strange thing is that when streaming is done via rtsp unicast rtcp generates both sender reports and receiver reports but when streaming is done via rtp multicast only sender reports are generated
don t use a for-loop when a while loops is more appropriate
division and multiplication have higher precedence than addition so what this is actually doing is
the ansi standard function coalesce is simpler than using nvl and decode which should be obsoleted anyway
the only problem is that when the mcu is transmitting data uart transmission interrupt has higher priority than the adc reading interrupt the adc is not sampling data hence there will be data loss sample rate is around 500 samples sec
but unless you re using such excellent testing practices and patterns i d be suspicious of abstractions that have a single concrete example -- interfaces with just one implementation no less than abstract-class with just one concrete subclass
this is one of the few cases where a while loops can be clearer and simpler than a for-loop
and that is for performance reasons assuming that a gethashcode implementation should always be much faster than an equals implementation
i require a c c++ macro to trace the for-loop iterations in the existing source code and to print some message if loops is running more that 50 iterations
new delete operator are usually invokes constructors destructors and they are a little bit slower than malloc free
since bit-shifting operation is typically less costly than multiplication to speed things up you will see in some program people use left bit-shift operation as a replacement of multiplication when they mean to multiplying it by an integer number of power of 2 that is 2 4 8 16 etc
to me the path without x86 is also more visually appealing and indicates that it s a modern application - adapted for 64bit operation where necessary
maybe an interface that isolates the properties accessor is better
frankly if you need to increment decrement a for-loop makes sense if you don t know the bounds and there is no real increment decrement a while loops makes more sense
murmurhash has 64 and 128-bit versions so you can experiment between the two and it s faster than md5 largely owing to md5 being a cryptographic hash function whereas murmur doesn t have the added expense complexity of being cryptographically secure i m assuming that you re not concerned about anybody attempting to intentionally generate hash collisions or anything like that
however the isolation part of acid sounds more like consistency model in particular the sequential consistency model
prefer map filter and reduce to for loops in general but donâ t obsess over it sometimes a for-loop is better
while loops aren t normally used to iterate over arrays as for-loop syntax is less verbose and allows the sentinel variable i to fall out of scope while the for-loop syntax does not
certainly tcp has more overhead than udp
to my knowledge and research so far - javascript s native for-loop is quicker than arrays map for iterating through the arrays
i m binding a grid view inside a for-loop which executes more than once.now when loops ends the data in grid view is the data binded at the last run of for-loop i.e all previous binds in the for-loop over overwritten.i dont want this .i want new rows to be inserted at each run of the for-loop ..plz help somebody
instead of in count aggregate use distinct column_name in count aggregate to filtering the grouping which is having more than one distinct values
iterate over the primes already found which are less than the square-root of p
xquery is more amenable to static analysis than xslt because it lacks the very dynamic template despatch mechanism
doesn t get evaluated the way you are expecting the division operator has higher precedence than the subtraction operator
i use tcpreplay to replay it on an interface but the problem is that the number of attempted packets in tcpreplay is different less with number of packets showing in wireshark
multiplication has higher operator priority than addition in java
in the above example the instance of exprbinopadd is a child of the instance of exprbinopmul although precedence of multiplying is higher than precedence of add which results from the proper consideration of the parentheses
as we can see copying manually with memcpy is always slower than realloc because in this scenario malloc is guaranteed to allocate new memory and you re forced to copy the data in every allocation which shows us that realloc is indeed reusing the same address and enlarging the block size in some cases
performance swing components are generally slower and buggier than awt due to both the fact that they are pure java and to video issues on various platforms
however my tests have shown that on a 64bit system an anycpu prefer 32-bit application which i confirm runs 32-bit can allocate more memory than an x86 one
i want to design a screen which contains some ten identical components each component contains textview and imageview .what s the better way to design it
well swing is richer in terms of out-of-the-box components than awt
add is faster than mul but if you want to multiplying two general values mul is far faster than any loop iterating add operations
the reflective approach using an existing class like beanutils is less coding but probably an order of magnitude slower than calling getter and setter in a simple way
division has worse latency than multiplication or addition by a factor of 2 to 4 on modern x86 cpus and worse throughput by a factor of 6 to 40
in general it is nicer in c to have the caller allocate memory not the callee - hence why strcpy is a nicer function in my opinion than strdup
if you re dividing or multiplying by a variable then it s likely that multiplication is slightly faster because the logic is generally more simple
git-rebase creates a tidier history while git-merge back and forth may create a complex commit graph in the end
it s worth pointing out that in general the foreach loops is more expensive memory-wise compared to the for-loop see here for details
on some hardware platforms it might turn out that int types work faster than chars types so the selection of the specific type becomes a speed-vs-memory trade-off but once again in many cases when the range of chars is naturally sufficient it might make more sense to use chars instead of int
in essence an object inherited all properties of its prototype but an object s own properties has higher precedence than those of its prototype
they say that implements runnable is more preferrable than extends thread
in that case the answer is basically both. normally int won t be bigger than a processor register unless that s smaller than 16-bit but it could be smaller a 32-bit compiler running on a 64bit processor
tcp is a slower more reliable protocol than udp is
gyroscope consumes more power than accelerometer based on my analysis its 4-6 times higher
property declarations are nothing more than compiler-generated getter and setter methods
because the string formatting operator shares precedence with the remainder or modulo which binds more tightly than the + addition operator
the problem with using tcp is obviously that it is a lot slower than udp

udp scales better than tcp because of reduced states that need to be maintained in the operating system
secondly the current version of pypy consumes much more memory than cpython in a rather large set of cases
and as tom karzes mentioned sqrt is also better than using pow for calculating square roots
this line works because of operator precedence multiplication has a higher precedence than addition + so it will be done first
http streaming servers will in most cases use tcp as their network transport rtsp servers usually offer rtp over udp which is more suited to multimedia streaming where some errors packet loss can be tolerated with the benefit of lower latency and less network overheads
multiplication is generally slower than addition
according to the postgresql which i gather greenplum is based on documentation for sequence manipulation functions it should return the value most recently returned by nextval in the current session.
getter and setter gives you more flexibility in general than properties
alternatively assuming your metric is the set with higher unsigned integer representation is bigger you can use xoring or loop through the bits or any other construct that goes through all the bits -
i have studied the x86 assembly and architecture and it appears to be a lot more complicated than mips
the most straight-forward c implementation is 100 times faster than cpython pypy is 10-30 times faster and passes the challenge

is there any reason mousedown should be inherently faster better than mouseup
in other words if a subclassing is more accessible than its superclass then the access modifier of the superclass loses effect
there are various object systems you can load as libraries when you want to do oop but integration with existing code heavily depends on the scheme dialect and its surrounding culture chicken scheme seems to be more object-oriented than racket for instance
to be able to calculate very big numbers bigger than 64bit 128bit
since emacs is much older than the extensible vim as opposed to the relatively non-extensible vi it has a much larger collection of extension modes covering almost any purpose you can imagine
if i is less than j loops doesn t get executed first time and loops executes 1 step more than each previous iteration of outer for-loop
the reason is that the modulo is slower than subtraction
if you compute modulo a power of two using bitwise and is simpler and generally faster than performing division
mergesort is more difficult to implement in-place but the out-of-place version is very cache-friendly - i suspect real-world implementations accept the o n space overhead - ram is cheap but memory bandwidth is a major bottleneck so trading memory for cache-efficiency and speed is often a good deal
when send a udp datagram larger than the mtu size only the last fragment of the udp datagram is putted out to the destination
as already pointed out in other answers memmove is more sophisticated than memcpy such that it accounts for memory overlaps
i would not test that compressing a particular input produces a particular output because that might break if you upgrade the compression library to a versioning that does a better job of compressing
if the parent has lower z-index than the modal everything in it will be behind the modal regardless of the children s z-index
why the header size of udp is less than tcp
but if some of the 14 parameters are optional it becomes a bit hard to read then i think either the use of separate getter setter is more readable or a paramater object mimicking named parameters
note that you should check if index is within arrays bounds in such cases and that system.arraycopy is more efficient and arguably simpler than a for-loop for copying arrays
it is a structure similar to but twice as space-efficient as the dawg that is more efficient than the trie which only compresses prefixes
using for-loop is much simpler if you use condition as limit for breaking loops
is it possible however to implement common lisp s macro system in scheme which is more powerful than syntax-rules using syntax-case
why is using spatial index and stdistance slower then the more complicated query with sin cos and acos
rest assured though that strcmp is better equipped in the general case for string comparisons than memcmp is
the underlying reason for this and various other avx limitations is that architecturally avx is little more than two sse execution units side by side - you will notice that virtually no avx instructions operate horizontally across the boundary between the two 128 bit halves of a vector which is particularly annoying in the case of vpalignr
division is always much more expensive than multiplication
the cpu is indeed slower on sparc 1.2ghz and as answered by one of the sun s engineers t2 is usualy 3 times slower for single-threaded application than modern intel processors
memcache data lives in memory and isn t persistent so is for more transient data
i picked c 1 1 8 for this example simply because it is exact in ieee-754 floating-point representation and typically multiplication is much faster than division
rickshaw is a graph library focused on time series whereas d3.js is more of a framework so it gives you much more functionality
when i try to access it with a for-loop where its index is less than the arrays length i get the following error message typeerror function object is unsubscriptable
how you handle things server-side is far more critical than client-side validation which can and will be ignored by malicious users
so if i want to split the dataset into a train set and a test set with 87.5 of the instances in the train set and 12.5 in the test set then all i need to do is to compute the md5 hash of some unchanging features of the instances and put the instances whose md5 hash is smaller than 2 125 into the test set
an addition is faster than a division and a multiplication
the time profiling instrumentation is more efficient at gathering data
tcp ip is supposed to be more reliable than udp ip see this comparison
in enhanced er modelling subclassing inheriting from more than 1 superclass is called multiple inherited
but keep in mind that in many cases being stateful or not stateless is no problem and not all stateless applications are by definition better than stateful ones
if multiplication is slower than addition instead of doing
pypy is faster than cpython s sum intrinsic because it can figure out that all the elements of the array are numeric and slice out a bunch of per-element overhead
edit basile starynkevitch mentions that strtod is better than atof for this job as it gives the ending character
this is called a strength reduction optimization because division is stronger slower more expensive than subtraction
the way i like to see more than one for-loop in list comprehension is like the nested loops
if you have dynamic element sizes you can t write out child pointers in preorder so postorder traversal is more appropriate
that s because removeclass is executed faster than fadein method you can remove the class when animation is complete
1 okay so it is technically possible to allocate it as one big blob and then wire up the 20-element array to point into the desired offsets into the blob.â â this convolutes free ing though and usually isn t necessaryâ for most use-cases the performance gains would be negligible and you d still need to malloc a separate array of pointers that address into the 2d blob .â â you typically only see 2d-blob allocation when data is massively 2d â such as image data â and access syntax is eschewed in favor of syntax because it s no less efficient than what the compiler would do and doesn t require more than one malloc free pair per blob of data
it requests memory from the os kernel but the request is not satisfied until the memory is written to with memset . this allows for greater efficiency in the system s memory management but it can result in misleading malloc behaviour
udp packets smaller than the mtu will not be fragmented but the mtu depends on more factors such as ip options and vlan headers so it may not be greater than 1500
put each token +- of final command string in a list maybe a binary tree works and sort that list to tell the calculator that division and multiplication has the highest priority in the mean time addition and subtraction has lower priority
oddly enough new array size is almost 2x faster than in google-chrome and about the same in firefox and ie measured by creating and filling an array
using a separate icomparaer comparator approach is a more generic form of using a sortkey field with the additional ordering mixed into the comparator because such a field could be used by such a icomparer implementation
the direction of evaluation does not affect the results of expressions that include more than one multiplication addition + or binary-bitwise | operator at the same level.
multiplication is not more difficult than repeated addition
i think your code has no problem except that angular has deprecated legacy promise methods success and error of http after version 1.4.4 you should use standard then method instead if your ionic depends on higher angular version
tunnel udp packets is somewhat more difficult
write right pattern with more than one spaces delimiter and parse your line
it combines efficiency of a trie trie can be seen as a special case of dawg but is much more space efficient
hex is easier for most people to convert to and from binary in their heads since binary numbers are usually expressed in blocks of eight because that s the size of a byte and eight is exactly two hex digits but hex notation would have been clunky and misleading in dennis time implying the ability to address 16 bits
on modern hardware floating point multiplications may run way faster than int ones so you might want to change the entire algorithm and start using double instead of int
but still labwindows cvi is more targeted for a test environments where e.g temperature controller measurement equipment needs to be controlled
clang llvm has much better separation between the parser and the other parts of the compiler chain
quadtree is better for big open spaces and octree is better for in-door spaces with many levels
but goto is rarely used in modern coding it is not likely to perform any better than a do-while loop after compiler optimizations are applied and it has limitations on how it can be used
keyup is more preferable than keydown because keydown may occur multiple times if user keeps it pressed
the autojit compiler realizes you re multiplying by all 0s and removes the matrix multiplication completely and simply returns a matrix of all 0s in the 1s it skips the actual multiplication part and just does the summation part of a matrix multiplication which is slightly slower than just returning all 0s finally the final one actually forces the compiler to have to do a matrix multiplication since it can t assume the answer
but for 32-bit and 64-bit microprocessors data alignment and bulk data access is key int accesses are frequently much faster than chars accesses and long long 64 bit may be faster still for some systems
match using two or more spaces as a delimiter
multicore refers to a computer or processors that has more than one logical cpu core and that can execute multiple instructions at the same time.
and the whole purpose of maglev is to have a ruby implementation which can deal with heaps that are orders of magnitude larger than ram by storing them in a distributed cluster on disk
this generally uses a hash algorithm that is much faster than md5
higher kurtosis means more of the variance in the image is the result of infrequent extreme deviations as opposed to frequent modestly sized deviations
this is still slower than for-loop mostly due to intermediate arrays creation but much faster than stream version
not only is it more expensive in terms of developer costs designing a cpu is vastly more difficult than writing user-space assembly code but it would increase the transistor count of the processors
multiplication has a higher operator precedence than addition so it s done before the two additions when calculating the value for a
i use a for-loop and a boolean with an if clause to detect whether the arrays element is larger or smaller than the input and then add it all together and display it
because is singular t can be constructed such that the last element on the diagonal or even more diagonal elements if the multiplicity of the eigenvalue is larger than one is zero
the real dataframe has more columns in the multi-index
heapsort can sort in-place and doesn t have the worst case quadratic behavior but on average is slower than quicksort in most cases
i have a draggable parent element ice cream wrapper which is bigger than the droppable one teeth
this is much faster than the division by repeated subtraction method since it converges to the result quadratically instead of linearly
i am working on a code which needs to be time efficient and thus using cufft for this purpose but when i try to compute fft of a very large data in parallel it is slower than cpu fftw and the reason i find after finding the time for every line of code using high precision timing code is that cudamalloc taking around 0.983 sec while the time for rest of the lines of code is around 0.00xx sec which is expected ..
if you won t be changing the string in loops it is better faster to store the value in and then include it in the for-loop
i think using for-loop is much more easier than using foreach loops to do this
if the file is huge and computation takes longer than the timeout the worker thread is terminate an error message is shown and no intraline difference is displayed for the file pair
if all the values vary each time then it seems unlikely that the floating-point division to compute the 1.25 followed by floating-point multiplication is going to be any faster than the integer multiplication followed by integer division
for the merge layer i prefer using other merge layers that are more intuitive such as add multiplying and concatenate for instance
finally we all know that multiplication and division have higher precedence than addition and subtraction so we can remove the extraneous parentheses so this turns into
a single for-loop is generally faster than using 2 nested for loops to traverse the image with x y counters
i don t consider it smoother as cin cout dialogue is not smooth imho
edit #2 but this was faster than a for-loop for a test i ran on an arrays of a million points
templating rows like this is possible in a gridview but the listview control is much better suited to this type of data
in the remote case those operations are not simplified assuming that there is a jit that maps the multiplication and add opcodes in a 1 1 relationship to their cpu instruction counterparts in most modern architectures all integer arithmetic operations usually take the same number of cycles so it will be faster multiplying once than add four times just checked it addition is still slightly faster than multiplication 1 clock vs 3 clocks so it still pays using a multiplication here
add sub are cheaper than multiplying better throughput and lower latency
logic to handle enter + mouse click is placed on keydown and mousedown it could be moved to keyup and mouseup if makes more sense
the only way it would be broken up differently would be if addition had a higher precedence than subtraction like multiplication does
the and operator has higher precedence than or just like multiplication has higher precedence than addition
if you are storing varchar type data you should really be using one of the latter two types clob if you are storing various varchar data and xmltype which is a more specific type of clob anyway if you are storing strictly xml data
decoding nullpointerexception is going to take a bit longer than illegalargumentexception filepath must be supplied or whatever
this works just fine but i ve read native javascript sort performing slower than implemented mergesort and quicksort that there are faster options especially if your requirements meet certain conditions
like matzi suggested udp gives you lower latency and lower packet overhead as the header is smaller than tcp but on the downside the delivery of the packet to the destination is never guaranteed ie
for example an addition is typically much faster than a division
xcb presents a more direct view of the protocol than xlib does so you often have to look at either the protocol specs or xlib source code to find out what the underlying protocol request is to find an equivalent
what s currently baffling me is in my results tcp finishes almost 2x faster than udp
this is the reason why udp is much faster than tcp
i have to develop a better queue that works more efficiently than the fifo queue
the problem using a linear model like lm is that predictions can be greater than the max of the observed cases and less than the min of the observed cases
all the .net methods i tried were slower than vba and vb6 but the best ones were able to use the xll interface which gave better results than the automation interface
icollection adds counting and ilist then gives richer functionality including find add and remove elements by index or via lambda expressions
about tcp udp tcp is typically slower but more reliable so by default go for tcp but there might be reasons for choosing udp like streaming multicast broadcast .
also see this other so answer about the misconception that udp is always faster than tcp
i am adding views dynamically to linear layout in a for-loop of more than 100 loops
should be as fast as 3des aes turned out to be much faster than 3des in software typically 5 to 10 times faster
so in your case an expression like 3+2 5 would yield 25 instead of 13 because addition is of higher precedence than multiplication
i m trying to avoid tcpclient because udp is faster but would this work in tcp since it s streamed
and lastly the properties makes refactoring easier for example when the value later is no longer stored in a variable but is calculated inside the properties accessor or comes from some other source variable
multiplication is usually significantly faster than division
multiplication and division have a higher precedence than addition and subtraction
another possibility would be to multiplying the values and check if the result is equal to 0 but this approach is probably a lot slower since multiplication takes usually more processor cycles than comparing values and or ing them
i would expect a while loops to be slower than a for-loop since it needs to test a condition before each iteration
it uses settimeout however settimeout is a better solution than setinterval because it will only queue a new one if the previous one is complete
bitshifts just go easier with hexadecimal than decimal and is often more convenient to read than octal
mergesort is more natural to implement for linked lists but you can do quicksort very nicely
an example of why coalesce is better than isnull

for instance to achieve addition you would scale the larger value to have the same exponent as the smaller one by multiplying it by 10 largerexp-smallerexp then adding the two values and rescaling
for those answers which use a method isprime int boolean there is a faster algorithm than the one previously implemented which is something like
in fact for x86 64 processors performing 32-bit or 16-bit operations are less efficient than 64bit or 8-bit operations due to the operand prefix byte that has to be decoded
any byte other than 0xff will introduce a start bit into a serial channel and a missing byte in the tcp udp implementations is even less likely
there are some instances of implementations that i have seen for some methods that throw nullpointerexception if argument is null but that is wrong implementation in those cases illegalargumentexception makes much more sense
a for-loop is more natural than a while loops but you requested no for
multiplication is slower than subtraction
but i have a problem dragging to a droppable that is smaller than the draggable
the foreach loops is slower than the for-loop yet most people don t rewrite all of their code to use the for
sorting all the objects before filtering is sure to take longer than filtering and then sorting a smaller data set
the md5 hash is no smaller than the uuid so it doesn t help with storage
but loops doesn t work like an old c-style for-loop where is checked on each iteration which is part of why this loops is faster
in c memory most other things are managed by the programmer so strdup is no worse than forgetting to free malloc ed memory failing to null terminate a string using incorrect format string in scanf and invoking undefined behaviour accessing dangling pointer etc
4 tcp is a slower than udp
the official tutorial on bitwise and bit-shift operators has more information about other related operators and xor left shift right shift
multiplication is far easier and faster for a cpu to do than division
armv7 is usually better but for arm fixed-point arithmetic is usually a lot faster than floating-point implementations
not necessarily better than the repeater suggestion but another option is to use a gridview control and a datatable data structure
addition and subtraction is worse as these have to be done in sequence of two operations and the second operation requires the first to have completed - this is not the case if the compiler is just producing two add operations on independent data
here for what it s worth is a pipes-csv variant which just compresses each parsed row into an unboxed vector of int s by hand this easier than finding double which is what this csv is really storing using readint from the bytestring package.
ram is 100 thousand times faster than disk for database access from
in the compareto method you can decide which fields are used for the comparison greater less than or equals
i personally think the while loops looks less clean than the nested for-loop
i m currently coding a upgrade system which will do best to avoid more than one upgrade path for a specific higher versioning but it may exist due to versioning branching
using mef for the add-in architecture over prism can be cleaner because the reasons for each project are vastly different and mef has a cleaner model i think it can also act as a basic ioc container
in the case of cryptographic hash functions like md5 it is even worse
in this particular case it would just copy the 3 bytes as expected but why use strncpy when memcpy is a simpler solution
the standard doesn t specify anything deeper than malloc and free which leaves c libraries free to implement them to work in their target environments
owl and rdfs are more expressive than rdf which means here that you can capture more complex relations for instance you can also represent the link between sets of things rdfs subclassof or use transitive properties hasancestor
erlang has a steeper learning curve compared to elixir
if loops body can throw a checked exception a for-loop is clearly better
this has some advantages over the original method when n is larger than the modulo divided by 2 since we can reduce the number of multiplication by solving for the modular inverse
mutation is typically easier to do this with than crossover
because division is often much slower than multiplication if performance is critical you might keep a table with powers of ten and their reciprocals
performance difference memcpy is usually more efficient than strcpy which must scan the data it copies
after a few test hashmap linkedhashmap and treemap are way slower than arraylist and i wanted to use them just for the ability to create submaps
if the calculation is expensive or the getter is executed more often than the setter for the changeable properties playername by far it can be an optimization to change the property inside the class into a read-write property and set the value every time the changeable properties are changed
the for-loop is faster than the foreach-loop if the arrays must only be accessed once per iteration
if the database is sophisticated enough adding an explicit order by clause will hint that sorting is more optimal for the grouping operation as well as the sorting can then be re-used in the query execution pipeline
real life often involves more than merely spaces delimiter words
direction of evaluation does not affect the results of expressions that include more than one multiplication addition + or binary-bitwise | operator at the same level
a for-loop should be used don t you think what loops makes is more clearly stated in the for-loop
superclass defines more general features of the objects of its subclassing
remember that multiplication even with strings binds tighter than addition so we must use brackets
multiplication is much harder than addition
hashing with sha md5 or any other algorithm solves the problem of key protection because you don t need to keep any secret value other than salt but salt is significantly less sensitive than encryption key
at the same time the compilation phase for a dfa is typically more complex than for an nfa and dfas don t have all the capabilities of nfas
vhdl is more popular in europe and verilog is dominating in the us
another reason to consider this route is if parsing xml files is more complex than filtering off node values grouping elements assigning new ids filtering by attributes
that said using a standard sort with either comparable rows or a comparator is much better than mixing up the sort logic and the comparison logic
the reason for doing so is to reduce hardware cost as division is more expensive than multiplication
isn t there an easier way than the for-loop to build this arrays
this question is not to discuss if using copy constructor is better than serializable deserialization or not
imagine your superclass has an object member but in your subclassing this is now more defined to be an integer
yes udp is much much lighter than tcp
mathematics clearly defines the order of operations as giving multiplication higher precedence than addition
the subclassing overridden method cannot have weaker access than superclass method
if you need a globally accessible variable or properties that s more suited to a base class that your classes inherited from
division and modulo are indeed costly hardware operations whatever you do this is more related to hardware architecture than to languages or compilers perhaps ten times slower than addition
it takes a page off of the free_page_list updates mem_map zeroes the page and returns the physical address of the page. here s another post that explains it well and also explains why using calloc is better than malloc + memset
a comparator class is better since use of comparable would mean using
saving information to a variable and therefore to ram is always faster than direct to disk
so you can t reject the null hypothesis that tolower is as faster as toupper and thus your experiment has got errors
i had mentioned that in our rails application all select queries dropped below 100ms after switching to postgresql whereas some of the complex joins generated by activerecord would occasionally take as much as 15s or more with mysql 5.1 because of nested loops with inner table scans even when indices were available
or has a lower precedence than just as addition in mathematics has a lower precedence than multiplication
the lack of salt is harder to expoit here than with password hash since the hash is not directly known
strncpy is more recommended that strcpy because protect your code against buffer overflow
p.s. my recommendation would be to remove jsonobject conversion and instead return an object of actual class as internally spring uses jackson which is more powerful json framework then org.json
the pattern above is very likely recognised by your compiler and replaced by highly optimised code which will be as fast if not faster as memset but not calloc
in addition using crypt to hash password is better
in a congested network yes udp will send its packets faster than tcp this is because tcp takes then congestion into account using a mechanism called congestion control
since a proper implementation of dijkstra is faster than bellman-ford use dijkstra unless there are negative weight edges in the graph
if you compute the length of the string for unrelated reasons or have the length of the string from other resources it s unclear to me whether memcpy is better or worse than strncpy
by something fancier i m referring to more delimiter than spaces grammar punctuation etc
templates will be inline in the standard meaning of inline which is more related to the one definition rule than to actual code inlining
ps radix tree is usually faster and more compact then trie but suffers from the same side effects of trie comparing to hash tables though less significant of course
in a single thread world is different you can use a sorted set a binary tree or your custom data structure that would perform better than concurrent skip-lists
the initial read has to access the disk which is a lot slower than accessing ram
one can implement a version of quicksort for a single-linked list but normally this is only interesting as a puzzle since mergesort is much easier to implement and works equally well or better for sorting linked lists
side note check-out the json.net serializable which gives more options and better control over the deserialization process
the reason for this intuitively is that the last multiplication does dramatically more work than any of the previous multiplication so much so in fact that summing up the work of all the preceding multiplies gives something asymptotically dominated by the last multiplying
plus the overhead of doing it is extremely costly- hive queries against hbase are on my cluster at least an order of magnitude slower than against plain hdfs files
udp is really faster than tcp and the simple reason is because it s non-existent acknowledge packet ack that permits a continuous packet stream instead of tcp that acknowledges a set of packets calculatd by using the tcp window size and round-trip time rtt .
in my experience hashing is always faster than sorting for joining and for grouping
where multiplying binds more tightly than add
for the vm layer i like the containment pattern more than inherited and at this layer i also implement inotifypropertychanged which is also a properties of the vm and not the data model
in addition to the other answers usually simple multiplication is way more efficient than using pow
i don t need more than atomic read operation and atomic write operations i have no use for fetch-and-add compare-and-swap etc.
in your case for-loop is better as changed in loops value is numeric
division is slower than multiplication due to some reasons
if the latter yes floating point multiplication is generally faster than division
while working with integer division it s better to multiplying first and divide later to minimize the rounding error
just because multiplication has a higher precedence than addition doesn t mean we need to perform all multiplication in the expression before doing any addition

that will make it easier to do operations with this value equality greater than less than addition subtraction etc...
all of rsfalcon7 s suggestions can be combined into a super rule do as much as possible in unshared resources l1 l2 caches - implying economizing on code and data requirements - and if you need to go to shared resources do as much as possible in l3 before going to ram before using synchronization the cpu cycles required to synchronize is variable but is slower - or much slower - than accessing ram before going to disk
in my regex replace modifier with public private protected replace returntype with the return type and replace methodname with the method name.
mouseover events can occur multiple times so mouseenter is a better option for this
which product mallet or weka is better for text classification task
the cpu operation for float division is much more complicated than multiplication
if there is a long execution time the execution time is greater than settimeout or setinterval to set the time
please note however that this architecture implements tcp which is much slower than udp and will not work for any type of fast-paced data intensive games but should accomplish your goals given your description above
i generally use interfaces are too enforce a common behavior that a group of classes share whereas subclassing is more appropriately used in cases where you can achieve serious code re-use through inherited functions properties
in term of speed square rooting is easy a few arithmetical operations for some newton-like method but it is not clear what asin does probably quite costly cos is likely to be one order of magnitude slower than sqrt and thus one square root is likely to be quickier than those two transcendental function calls
if you measure properly you ll see there s essentially no difference enumerate is microscopically faster than xrange in this example but well within noise
solr - the collapsingqparser is really a post filtering that provides more performant field collapsing than solr s standard approach when the number of distinct grouping in the result set is high
a for-loop is nothing more than a glorified while loops
haskell has fewer industrial users than ocaml and although it does have multicore support it is still being developed in a very unproductive direction
the objective function is guaranteed to be finite and contionuous in the interpolation range along with its first and second derivatives and has no more than one minimum in this range if it has no minimum it is monotonic
it returns a byte arrays of all the pixels which can be iterated much faster than a for-loop with a call to getpixel inside nested inside another for-loop
this is one of the trickier differences between tcp and udp
when you move from float to float4 the vector operation add multiplying ... is more efficient thanks to the ability of the gpu to operate with vectors
nonetheless i tried to compare the sum of all test speeds and in some cases nunit is faster and in other cases mstest is faster
also i ve used a for-loop and not jquery each loops on the sections elements because a for-loop is much faster due to the lack of function callback an each function has
onâ running the application in single step mode also into the standard library functions strcmp and strtol it is even clearer that the processor has to do many more instructions to run an integer comparison in batch file than a string comparison
the octal encoding mechanism is less error-prone than hex so i ll demonstrate using octal
it s because multiplication has higher precedence than addition
regardless the irc protocol is more simplistic in nature can handle orders of magnitude more client connections than xmpp for the same memory utilization uses less bandwidth on the wire doesn t require authentication although you can add this feature etc
compilers are getting better with inlining the use of function pointers where the function is actually known but contemporary compilers certainly don t always inline-functions calls through function pointers even if all the context would be there
stephen string search or a compiled dfa you can construct them from an nfa which is easier to make
if we use hex because it s a simplification of binary that makes things easier on the programmer is easier to read than binary and carries more data etc. why do we not jump to the next logical step base64
basically while sending udp packets larger than mtu ip fragmentation can occur if it s supported on your platform but not all platforms support it
generally speaking udp has less overhead than tcp allowing you to receive more data but this is not a strict rule and is almost negligible in this context
the addition and subtraction is okay because the types of a and b force them to be performed using floating point arithmetic - but because division binds more tightly than addition and subtraction it s like using the brackets above only the immediate operands are considered
in the case of core data running with a local sqlite store your predicates and sort descriptors get turned into a sql query so there s no need to instantiate and work with objects â the sorting and filtering happens much more efficiently on the backend and constructing objects is necessary only for the results
isnull will be faster i think because it has lesser function code implementation for itself making it faster than coalesce
splines interpolation is probably more useful for you than polynomial interpolation if you fit a polynomial it must inevitably head off to + - infinity outside your data range
i m working in matlab in which nested for-loop is used to collect data and store in cell arrays however i want to collect data and the inner loops is collect further in the same cell arrays according to its position
to send large blocks of data via udp you need to chop them up into pieces smaller than the mtu for the network segment across which you re transmitting them
remember multiplication division and remainder operators are all higher precedence than subtraction
other options to check are relaxng which is more flexible and powerful than xml schema or schematron which allows for exactly this sort of validation that needs to go deeper than structure and simple type-checks
if you insist on having the data in 2 arrays it is easier to iterate the arrays using a for-loop with an index instead of a foreach loops
union all is faster than union distinct
if your array s retaincount is greater than 1 at the start of dealloc some other object is retaining it at least temporarily
my lwip can send udp packets to pc but my pc would fail to reassemble when the udp packets are larger than mtu
though similar in ui and ux sublimetext performs significantly better than atom-editor especially in heavy lifting like working with large files complex snr or plugins that do heavy processing on files buffers
in reality the inline keyword has less to do with inlining code and more to do with allowing legal violation of the one definition rule
if the subclassing is more specific then it might fill in all by 2 of the arguments to its superclass __init__ method
rewriting the while loops as a for-loop is nicer and makes it less likely to get an infinite loops
which of the two consumes more memory is not defined and depends on the input sequence to be sorted as well as on algorithm tuning parameters see the comments to one of the answers to why quicksort is more popular than radix-sort
in some applications tcp is faster better throughput than udp
also remember that dns requests can use tcp if the request or response would need more than 1 udp packet
both comparable and comparator work for you but i suggest comparator because it doesn t require you modify person class you only need the write an implementation class based on the sorting attribute therefore comparator is much more flexiable
transcendental functions are always much more slower than addition or multiplication and a well-known bottleneck
i ve been using images to store data since editing binary data through paint.net is much friendlier than most hex editors
be aware that there is more than just powerpc and i386 although these are the safest architectures to choose for a universal binary
strncmp is a little bit safer than strcmp because you specify how many comparisons will be made at most
swift s compiler is also doing a lot more than objective-c s compiler considering swift is more strongly typed and does not required specifying imports among other things
there is a certain irony here given that within xslt push stylesheets are generally more idiomatic than pull stylesheets
running the same test on linux with gcc similarly pegs int and long as similar and both faster than chars although the difference is less pronounced
ping is just low level icmp protocol defined in internet layer whereas tcp is more complex protocol defined in transport layer
if the length of the arrays is less than 8 a regular for-loop summation is performed
you need to error check strtol and ensure there are as many passed before using them -- strtol is better than atoi as helps detect errors
then you use it as seed in random which is less good that one is a non-cryptographic prng and its output may exhibit some structure which will not register in a statistical measurement tool but might be exploited by an intelligent attacker
it turns out that if comparisons are cheap mergesort tends to run a little faster because quicksort spends more time fiddling with pointers
web2py has more focus on simple is better than complex but django has more focus on explicit is better than implicit
imho loops looks better with a for-loop iterating in the right direction
getline is far more flexible handling the allocation of space for you with fgets it is up to you
firstly while a for-loop is not wrong here a for each loops is more appropriate
the good thing about this macro is that it should work with c89 and c99 compilers 1ll can be replaced with 1l and long long can be replaced with just long and ll with l of course if your c89 compiler does not have the extended long long type from c99 and it also correctly supports types smaller than int chars and short
probably using a jlist or a jtable is a better choice than display records using text fields
ass supports more formatting options but srt is a simpler format and can be modified with the force_style option in the subtitle filter
basically the methods will range from a base of ienumerable all the way up to ilist which has a larger selection available
coalesce is the more standard alternative of isnull
the question is avx scalar is 2.7x faster than sse when i vectorized it the speed up is 3x matrix size is 128x128 for this question
in the actual data-processing code one would not normally use any types smaller than int or double with few exceptions
list comprehensions are preferred over for loops but they essentially do the same thing if a for-loop is more understandable you can break the expression above to a for-loop it looks like this
i read about python following pemdas that is precedence of multiplying is more than division
nevertheless i need a dynamic list for my loops with nested loops which is processed more than 500 times and multiple if-statement therefore the arraylist
is it possible that the division is six times slower than multiplication and
this code is more for an example and in this example below it is checking to see if the versioning of notepad.exe needs to be upgrade that means the versioning stored in the property table value notepad_verson is greater than the versioning of notepad.exe on the system
we then filtering all words from the given string if the length of any of the grouping is more than two
calling suppressfinalize on an object implementing a finalizer does nothing more than set a bit in the objects header which the runtime checks when calling finalizer which will suppress your finalizer from running
the style was common in vb6 with optional parameters but imho and according to microsoft in vb.net overloading is usually more elegant than optional parameters
t s purpose is to test the thesis developed by steele and sussman in their series of papers about scheme that scheme may be used as the basis for a practical programming language of exceptional expressive power and that implementations of scheme could perform better than other lisp systems and competitively with implementations of programming languages such as c and bliss which are usually considered to be inherently more efficient than lisp on conventional machine architectures
the normal for-loop is useful when you don t want to visit every element in the arrays or if you have more than one loops variable
as in title why is multiplication much faster than subtraction in this example
it seems that settimeout has bigger priority than setinterval which could be delayed
properties specially automatic properties in .net 3.5 are more concise than setter getter and less lines of code less code to maintain less bugs
python respects this definition whereas in most other programming language the modulo is really more like a reaminder after division operator
then the multiplication happens before the addition because multiplication is higher precedence
this approach will radically reduce heap space usage - disk space is cheaper then ram too
occasionally the stdout needs more than a write method fflush is another common one which stringio will handle
i suspect your curly braces aren t in the correct place as per scheff s comment the scope of the page variable is contained within the for-loop and you are attempting to do more operations after loops is over
since bit wise operations can be done very fast and division operations are relatively slow this type of modulo is much faster than doing a division
either way your example with the numeric expression would multiplying by 3 first because multiplication has higher precedence than addition or subtraction
in addition jemalloc tries to optimise for cache locality since the act of fetching data from ram is much slower than using data already in the cpu caches no different in concept to the difference between fast fetching from ram versus slow fetching from disk
i know udp is faster than tcp for various reason
edit based on the tests done by multiple people and by theory isnull seems to be a better option over coalesce
it is entirely possible that in most implementations the cost of a memmove function call will not be significantly greater than memcpy in any scenario in which the behavior of both is defined
in fact i think it is fair to say that bellman-ford is more similar to dijkstra because of its use of iterative relaxation
ironpython has had more time to focus on performance improvements but ironruby has made significant performance improvements as of late
since the author of the specialized memory allocator has more knowledge on the size of the objects allocated from the pool and how those allocator occur the allocator can use the memory more efficiently than a general purpose allocator such as the one provided by the stl
in that sense reliable udp cannot be faster than tcp
if you used aes then you might see a better speedup over the des 3des observations
it turns out i had a hard coded maximum index in my for-loop which was bigger than the arrays i was trying to assign to

for example sometimes a for-loop is faster than the built-in arrays methods in some browsers
you could use rsa but a symmetric algorithm like aes is faster if you can find a way to exchange keys in a secure way
for example you know foreach loops is heavy and if we use for-loop is better
this is a use case where a for-loop is cleaner to use than a while loops
when you know both objects are arrays method is a faster way to check equality than for-loop
udp is generally faster than tcp as it does not have to do the overhead checking of consistency that tcp must deal with
however it still performs worse by initially a factors of 3 but as the matrix size increases asymptotically worse by a factors of exactly 2
i wonder if there are any optimizations something more efficient than memcmp memcpy maybe just using a for-loop or breaking it down to fast assembly instructions that can be done to this subroutine
angular is built around the belief that declarative code is better than imperative when it comes to building uis and wiring software components together.
each individual iteration of the code in the foreach loops takes less than a second per worker and looking at the outfile it s clear that processing stops within a minute of turning the monitors off no matter how many times it s been through either the foreach loops or the parent for-loop

udp is more of a fire and forget whereas tcp maintains a connection state
pros of objects faster disk read is slower than ram lesser dependencies of the system s state

i am pretty sure it is not possible to compute polynomial division more efficient than multiplication and as you can see in the following table this algorithm is only 3 times slower than a single multiplication
if that is the case using periodic spline from mgcv gam is much better
the intuition is that division is a more costly affair than multiplication

getting and setting is probably 2 orders of magnitude slower than normal getter or setter methods
multiplication has a higher precedence than addition so it is evaluated first
precedence rules specify priority of operators which operators will be evaluated first multiplication has higher precedence than addition pemdas
the idea is to work through the nodes in the tree from the leaves upward checking whether each node s value is greater than the max of its left subtree and less than the min of its right subtree then checking whether its left and right subtrees are bsts
then when testing the password for correctness you hash it the same way and then compare the results -- sha1 is a common hash for this md5 is better than nothing
a requirement that the constructor in the superclass runs before any code in the constructor of the subclassing keeps things simpler
so you can access the arrays at any index between the range of 0 and array.length - 1 alas if you wanted to use a for in loops to iterate over an arrays you certainly can however a regular for-loop is more appropriate

during the playback of the file audio is monitored in the receive direction and if a period of non-silence which is greater than min ms yet less than max ms is followed by silence for at least sil ms which occurs during the first analysistime ms then the audio playback is aborted and processing jumps to the talk extension if available
it s the only conceptual modeling tool available for relational data the others - erwin and its ilk - being at best logical modeling tools with nothing much better than entity-relationship diagram and ddl synchrnoization which are also provided by object role modeling tools
and regarding your first question it is definitely possible to encrypt decrypt messages directly using rsa there are only technical and performance reasons aes is much faster than rsa why rsa is used only to encrypt a session key and aes is used to encrypt decrypt the messages themselves
folder objects undoubtedly give the fullest access to file information but the older dir function is easier to use and allows specification of a filename template so i have used that
because that transfers the computation into the int domain instead of chars which is more natural for computers
then for reading i find textscan to be more powerful than fread fscanf the differences between them all are summarized here
for example on most 32 bit systems 64-bit addition is faster than 32-bit division modulo
problably the problem is that mousemove event may fire earlier than mouseenter in some cases
i was able to remove the unwanted behavior described above by turning the droppable into the parent of the element and added a margin padding that is slightly larger than the draggable snaptolerance
while boost is more modern c++ it also harder to use for non trivial tasks - and without a modern c++ experience and deep stl knowledge it is difficult to use correctly
but the for-loop is not reading writing the last part of the parent file which is less than the arrays size
sha1 is better than md5 because it is a longer hash so can accept more values without collisions although collisions are still possible
stringr provides more human-readable wrappers around the base r functions though as of dec 2014 the development version has a branch built on top of stringi mentioned below
you can simulate an anchor using css cursor pointer and events like mouseenter and mouseleave which is more work but does not break the expected behavior of an anchor tag
more generally sml tends to be rather more elegant while ocaml has some more advanced features quirks and users
settimeout is used in lieu of setinterval which is more cumbersome when it comes to killing the cycle
although an enhanced for-loop on a string arrays is much faster than it is on an more on that below the .tostring .split overhead would appear to still dominate and make that version slower than the arraylist version
elapsed time is generally higher than cpu time with the exception of a multi processors environment
in my understanding repeater is most suitable since it faster than gridview
the package is bigger than udp s package but smaller than tcp s package
look-up in the case of failure should be constant time if the current element is less than the minimum element of the heap containing the max m elements we can reject it outright
note that udp is more difficult to work with than tcp because packets are not always guaranteed to be delivered
i know i2c is more complex slow than spi uart etc. but it s a constrain
the only way to copy arrays that is more efficient than for-loop coding is system.arraycopy
i know that addition operation is more trivial than multiplication operation
we could check that void mymethod int i is more specific than void mymethod double a if any invocation handled by the first method can be passed on to the other one without a compile-time type error
by using a salt value typically you want this to be a random number the hash won t match the dictionary the chance of them pre-calculating all passwords with all possible salt values is exponentially more difficult
less is a css extension that enables reuse and encapsulation of values color values for instance improves inherited allows a better nesting of related properties and operations also
if the message you re encrypting is large enough not only will it take more time to process but the rsa encrypted message might be larger than an rsa encrypted aes key plus an aes encrypted message
those hex values seem a bit odd they re powers of two in decimal but in any case 0x128 the 0x is a standard prefix for hex numbers is the larger of the numbers in magnitude and its binary representation is 100101000
the extends keyword is more general in this sense since it s used to mean that the generic type could either extends another class or implements an interface
hardware integer division is always slower than multiplication and the gap in the relative latencies of these instructions continues to widen
the features stemming from those discussions permit less extreme fork than processes which is symmetrically like the provision of more extensive independence between pthreads
common lisp is an image base language although usually to a lesser extent than smalltalk
if the only purpose is improved testability then exposing methods as protected or public is an easier option

other cpus take three or four cycles to do a multiplication which is a bit slower than addition
implements gives larger errors because i tried with extends
scheme is perhaps more approachable than haskell however
you iterating i in for-loop so after first loops i is higher then rows
i am currently using union all and a distinct in the outer query as this proved much faster than using union s for the uniqueness of data
or is there something about multiplication that is more convenient than division in programming

using just the keyfn return a comparable value that matches your requirements is much easier than implementing comparator
in t-sql unary minus is made to be the same priority as subtraction which is lower than multiplication
well we know it is the first one because of precedence - the binary multiplication operator has higher precedence than the binary + addition operator and is resolved first
the private exponent is always smaller than the modulo so you should be able to encrypt it using the raw rsa operation if you make sure to remove the prepended zero
since multiplication has a higher precedence than addition the same convention is used
division algorithms are slower than multiplication algorithms in most cases
is there any way in haskell to get the constant that is the largest and smallest possible positive rational-numbers greater than zero that can be represented by doubles
since it s an arrays it s better to use a for-loop with a counter variable i which starts from 1
garbage-collection may be slower than malloc and free for programs that allocate at once all the memory they need and work with that
it may be that the kernel heuristics for servering tcp connections is more aggressive than for udp sockets since tcp connections require more state and more continuous processing than do udp sockets
for the purposes of reading the user s input i would recommend using std cin which uses a similar syntax to std cout and is really more convenient
this allows you to use the assignment operator instead of memcpy and requires 1 less call to malloc - the one you make
use httpwebrequest instead of webclient it s slightly less convenient but not by very much and set the keepalive property to false
floating point multiplication is faster than division so if speed is relevant
but integer arithmetic arguably is inherently simpler than floating-point
it doesn t even matter much what algorithm is used - one could even use md5 or md4 and the passwords would be just as safe there is a slight difference because computing a sha-1 hash is slower
calculating primes takes more iteration than checking for a palindrome
i don t think they have a natural precedence unlike say multiplication and division being of greater precedence than subtraction and addition because they can be built from subtraction and addition
it s conceptually more sound as subclassing a thread suggests specializing its behaviour while runnable s are more like task containers - favor composition over inherited
as the alignment for a chars might be different from an int that is probably less restrictive assigning a to an might lead to pi being misaligned
std memmove may be very slightly slower than std memcpy emphasis added because it has to first check whether the source and target ranges overlap
a set or bag is easier to map in hibernate and requires fewer database columns
where instead of expected many-to-one is much more complex and partially expressed many-to-many
multiplication and division operators have higher precedence than addition and subtraction in c++ same as in scientific notation
the reason is encapsulation is far more than getter and setter

also for tcp udp portability is much better
if the constructors and destructors are empty like for built-ins new and delete shouldn t be slower than malloc and free are

however if the subclassing returns a narrower subtype of the superclass method return this is called a covariant return type and is allowed in java since jdk 1.5
the restful services are rather thin and completely stateless whereas the admin console is stateful and has more interactive functionality and therefore more memory and processing required
it s going to be a performance memory trade-off anyway because writing one int is generally faster than three chars separately
but according to this answer a for-loop is executed faster than the equivalent while loops
which should at least perform better than explode str_replace and substr solutions
even simpler and probably even faster because multiplication is faster than division is dav s answer which is the most natural algorithm.
in general floating point types are stronger than integer ones and unsigned are stronger than signed.
for lists containing 1000 elements the dictionary zip version is the fastest the generator and the list comprehension versions are virtually identical and they are 1.5 times slower and the functional map reversed is considerably slower
here it is conceivable that subtraction is slower than addition

so bandwidth was probably viewed as cheaper than server ram and disk storage
defining getter setter makes more sense when you prefix the variable to get set
each execution of the inner loop body takes constant bounded time assuming we re dealing with fixed-width integer types otherwise it would depend on the multiplication algorithm used and addition but that s hard to implement in a way that multiplication is faster so the execution of the body of the outer loop is o d î d even where
in arithmetic multiplication has higher precedence than addition
if i remember correctly lodash argued they were faster than underscore.js because the use non-native functions for key operations
it means a declared properties is more than a pair of accessor methods getter setter
multiplication is even easier as you dont have to line up the decimal points you just do the math on the significant digits and simply add the exponent
your problem is that your procedure has more parameters then you pass to it on mybatis call so at any point after the missing parameter you should have your ora-06502 pl sql numeric or value error error since the following paramters doesn t have the same type on the order you are passing it
sorting criteria function simply checks if the count field of the first grouping is greater than the other
to start with i need multiplication and division to take higher precedence than addition and subtraction
aes will indeed yield a considerably faster result than des
perhaps it s the case that division is much more accurate than reciprocal plus multiplying
as an example of the second option i ll use imshow here because it makes more sense than contourf for random data but contourf would have identical usage other than the interpolation option.
even though aurora has better capabilities i prefer marathon due to auroras complexity overhead and lack of ui for control api
you can use either to create a new memory block which is separate from the original but naturally strdup is simpler since it doesn t require a separate malloc strlen call
using a while loops we can control the flow of i better than a for-loop
first amdahl s law is older than hyperthreading so the law itself assumes you have physical processors
since the files are all bigger than ram this translates to actual disk usage
a dsa signature generation could be somewhat faster than a rsa signature generation maybe up to twice faster
don t think of it as udp is faster and tcp is slower because that s just wrong
if you don t need the cryptographic properties then a non-cryptographic hash or a hash that is less cryptographically secure md5 being broken doesn t prevent it being a good hash nor still strong enough for some uses is likely to be more performant
hex is just less verbose and can express anything a binary number can
based on this not created by me the while loops is 22 slower than a for-loop in general

my personal opinion is that it is vastly more useful than strncpy and strcpy
it is common knowledge that division takes many more clock cycles to compute than multiplication
as i understand websockets are on top of tcp and have higher latency than sctp that underlies webrtc when for example sending binary data between server and browser that also could be 2 peers in webrtc
as a practical matter a cons is simpler than a list so you can get the value with a straight cdr rather than the conceptually more complex cadr the car of the cdr
on some arm platform im working on memmove was 3 times faster than memcpy for short unalligned load
for example tcp has much more flags window-length syn ack etc - and also starts and ends a connection in a very stable way - the three way handshake - while all udp has is source ip dest ip length source port dest port and checksum
apc is more an opcode caching system than a key value memory database like memcached altough it can be greatly used for both purposes
instead of the above for-loop you can also use the following loops which is even more efficient as this removes the need to find the square-root of the number

anthony williams fixed-point maths library provides a complete analogue of the standard maths library for a fixed data type that is typically around 5 times faster than software floating-point on the same target
that being said i understand that it might be for your assignment but converting boolean into multiple unsigned int is more like useless c optimization to me
a clob is a safer way to handle the soap request than an xmltype because the data returned may be longer than 32767 bytes
a loops using a callback function like the standard foreach was approximately 10 times slower than the for-loop
i suspect that the reason people write scheme style macro systems in common lisp is more for the pattern matching than for the hygiene
i ve figure out that even though myisam has locking contention it s still faster than innodb in most scenarios because of the rapid lock acquisition scheme it uses
your spf record requires more than 10 dns lookups to process
enumerate is also more appropriate than xrange
yes vhdl was once much more feature-rich than verilog but later revisions of the language verilog 2001 verilog 2005 systemverilog etc.. have cherry-picked most of the interesting features and there is far more robust toolchain support for verilog and its variant these days in addition to it being the dominant language in use in the us in my experience vhdl is only used here when dealing with extreme legacy blocks and in academic contexts partially due to the tools support mentioned previously
according to stephen canon modern implementations favor taylor expansion over rational function approximation where division is much slower than multiplication
like the fadein and fadeout is faster than the actual changing the picture
anything sent larger than the mtu with df set will result in an icmp error message being generated
a while loops is imo more complicated to read than a for-loop
tcp is much slower than udp but when the two machines are not on the same lan udp is not reliable
one can say udp has a lower overhead than tcp because its packets have a smaller header and therefore take less bandwidth to send the payload the data
bufferedreader is useful when is used with large streams such as a file fileinputstream and in all cases the read method returns one character while behind the scene bufferedreader reads more data depends on buffer size from related inputstream and caches it to improve performance
the incrementor in the for-loop is more of a while 1 endless loops
using getter and setter is more expensive because first the vm will lookup the method from a virtual method table and then make the call
i think this is better done with a metaclass in order to handle both runtime and subclassing method decoration
multiplication is slightly harder just multiplying two scaled numbers and then divide by your scale factor
division is a lot more expensive than multiplication
unfortunately the trackpad s scrolling deltas are orders of magnitude higher than a mouse s so the scroll speed is psychotically high
multiplication and division have higher priority than addition and subtraction
strlen is fast alloca is fast copying the string up to the first n is fast puts is faster than printf but is is most likely far slower than all three operations mentioned before together
i personally think combining prism with mef makes this type of situation easier though since mef allows for easier dynamic extensibility for roles
the addition is much cheaper than other operations like modulo and division and array access
subtraction operations and usually significantly faster than multiplication and division
in theory the while loops is quicker because the for-loop looks up the length attribute of foo every time though loops but in real-world use it s going to make an immeasurably small difference
also the onfocus event would be more appropriate than onclick because it handles other scenarios such as pressing the tab key to change the active input
biggest int that can be stored in a double this makes exponentiation easier use the pow method
considering sorting is more complicated than summation median filtering will cost longer time
at my company we have found memory mapped files to be much faster than loopback tcp ip for communication on the same box so i m assuming it would be faster than udp too
udp is much faster then tcp but tcp has flow control and guaranteed delivery
if however you do need something quicker than division and modulo then bitwise operations come to help
udp port scanning is possible but it is harder than tcp scanning
i find using tcp to be very reliable and it can also be very fast if the traffic is stream like meaning mostly unidirectional additionally building a message framer on top of tcp is much easier than building tcp on top of udp

a basic for-loop is slower than a for - loops with simplified test condition
regex is a nfa and is as such in most cases slower than a dfa or hand-written parser
but a large period prng takes up more memory for maintaining the internal state and also takes more time for generating a random number due to complex transitions and post processing
the overheads are typically smaller than malloc free in c or new dispose in c++
hashing is one way you can prove this to yourself by taking an md5 or shasum of a large file since the file s size is larger than the hash output by pigeonhole principle hash can t be restored.
well setinterval and settimeout essentially try to do the same thing but for your case setinterval method will be more accurate than settimeout
if you know the lengths of the strings memmove is a sensible choice - and nominally faster than strncpy because it does not have to check for nulls as it goes
it is worth nothing that in a link where udp and tcp are sharing the bandwidth tcp is better behaved than udp in that it will try to limit itself to avoid congestion
the general problem is that the subclassing is more specific than the superclass
so that your rtp over udp becomes more resistant towards packets losses
this seems too deep in the original code so i won t touch it but if there s any possibility of flattening the stored array it will be a speed boost even if you can t transpose it multiplying add dereference is faster than dereference add dereference
in my tests i found that one of the loops i tested titled for-loop is astronomically slower than the other loops
it looked weired to me that you are trying to return a subclassing s instance from a superclass s method since superclass usually means a more general concept
i have read that quicksort is much faster than mergesort in practise and the reason for this is the hidden constant
note that there several advantages to leaving the lua code duplication generated by moonscript in your lua files at least for oft-used operations class definition is probably not one of them but moonscript does way more than that
bcrypt is considered the most secure way to implement password hashing with salt because it is slow - much slower than an md5
a for-loop is more appropriate than a while loops in your code
note that memmove has more overhead than memcpy because it has to determine which direction of copying is safe
quicksort time complexity is typically o n log n but it s worst case is o n 2 which is avoided with the switch to heapsort since heapsort is always o n log n but slower than quicksort so it s only used to avoid o n 2
this method can handle more delimiter than spaces by the regex being used
on many machines particularly those without hardware support for division division is a slower operation than multiplication so this approach can yield a considerable speedup
for the 10 tests on the same list the results should be quite the same at least all showing that quicksort is faster than mergesort or vice vesa
owl has more structure than rdf
as you have already seen when you eliminate memset datasrc 0 n the first memcpy is even slower because the pages for the source must be allocated as well
the for-loop just initializes the arrays which that each slot in the arrays is .211 higher than the one before it
furthermore it is handier than google n-gram as for a given phrase it does not simply output its absolute frequency but it can output its joint probability conditional probability and even the most likely words that follow
i m aware of the differences in general the facts like tcp is more accurate while udp is more fast
note also that using nsmutablestring is more efficient than creating a new nsstring each time a letter is added
i suppose this is one of the reasons for the misconception that udp is slower than tcp
the tostring should be slower than parse since division is generally slower than multiplication
but the outer for-loop still runs 9 more times pushing temp which is already a set number onto the numbers arrays
a suffix tree has less dummy nodes than the suffix trie
please note this approach is much less efficient than grouping and filtering in a dataset query if it is based on a database
multiplication is faster than division so the second method is faster
for instance strncpy is mostly useless it gives you nothing more than strcpy
if max and min are independent variables the extra subtraction for max-min will waste time but if that expression can be precomputed at compile time or if it can be computed once at run-time to test many numbers against the same range the above expression may be computed efficiently even in the case where the value is within range if a large fraction of values will be below the valid range it may be faster to use because it will exit early if value is less than min
is the modulo really weaker than the addition
of course multiplication has higher precedence binds more tightly than addition
if a key is longer than the hmac supports it ll usually be hash to the proper size
one thing to note is that std istream getline is more secure than std getline so should be preferred in some situations
the problem is that memcpy is only slighly slower than memset when i expect it to be about two times slower since it operations on twice the memory
only when packets can be discarded unordered can udp be faster than tcp
somehow the layout algorithms in prefuse seem to display a better layout than in jung rendering is also better i think though most of the layout algorithms in prefuse are based on jung implementation
we ve seen that swift uses a more static method dispatch than objective-c which unless a class dervices from foundation nsobject prevents the style of swizzling based on remapping method implementations at runtime
udp is unreliable and tcp is more than adequate in sending 1000 s per second
on the foundation you have either udp which is unreliable but incurs almost no overhead but very well suited for broadcasts and tcp which is more reliable therefore has more overhead but is easier to use
the difference is that in the second pattern the concatenation x followed by y in xy has higher precedence than the choice either x or y in x|y like multiplication has higher precedence than addition so the pattern is equivalent to
using the properties and the accessor allows for more flexibility for example key-value-observing is only possible using the accessor
while a lot of development has been done with stateless connections to solve most problems sometimes it s just simpler with stateful connections
as harypyon suggests storing the children is a more efficient way of viewing this problem than storing the parent and then computing the children
the multiplication are the bottleneck of the calculation even though they may be one instruction a multiplication takes longer than an addition
allocating more memory with malloc does not prevent the memory error if the free call inside the dosomething method is incommented
binding threads to cores prevents the operating system from moving around threads between different processors cores which speeds up the executing especially on numa systems machines with more than one cpu sockets and separate memory controller in each socket where data locality is very important
you should use a for-loop which is more convenient to loops in an arrays
multiplication and division is even more complicated but it s possible to do using a similar system
the conversion from hex to binary is even simpler since you can simply expand each hex digit into the corresponding binary for example 0xa4 - 1010 0100
this is due to the fact that profiling need to instrumentation the code to keep track of invocations - this can interfere with the jit s ability to inline those methods and the instrumentation overhead becomes significantly larger than the time spent actually executing the methods body
the ienumerable side of linq which works on in-memory objects that are already in the heap will almost certainly perform better than the iqueryable side which exists to be translated into a native query language like sql
using a database system such as sqlite or mysql that follows the acid principles is much more easy as the database system guarantees consistency atomicity of the transactions isolation and durability
firefox is more technically correct in this case as it outputs the state of the object at each point in the loop whereas google-chrome is apparently waiting until the end of the loop to output each console.log but i m not aware of a standards specification that covers the console host object
some newer with backbone only and older with marionette since marionette uses backbone both uses underscore.js
this is better than normal findviewbyid because the views are create on compilation and are injected automatically inside the activity at oncreate being way more efficient than your standard initialization
it seems like udp will more efficient than tcp
with a lower order splines that works better but then you lose the advantage of cubic interpolation
the operations are always algebraically simple never involving anything more than addition multiplication subtraction division and taking powers
for instance in arithmetic multiplication has higher precedence than addition
this requires computing cos theta and sin theta just once and then each update is given by a matrix multiplication of a 2x2 matrix with a 2-d vector and then a simple addition which is faster than computing sin using the power series expansion
based on the order of operations e.g where multiplication is evaluated with higher priority than addition push the operators and operands onto a stack
the reason for not having strcpy i m guessing is that strcpy can be replaced more efficiently with memcpy for constant strings and if the string is not constant strcpy is a bit more complicated than memcpy anyway so not as beneficial to make inline optimisations for
1 in-place merge sort is used when you want to sort a list in o nlogn time while using less space than standard mergesort
you could use the tga format which is more common than ppm and allows true grayscale images
a trie is better than a binary search tree for searching elements
udp is a connectionless protocol which has zero error-checking it is that is the trade-off with tcp it is faster than tcp
recursive is usually used for traversal and binary search tree but this tree is more similar to trie of only 2 character in alphabet
by these numbers and only these numbers vhdl seems to be more widely-used than verilog
i don t think you should make the assumption that udp is faster than tcp
it can be used for speed being significantly faster than division multiplication when dealing with operands that are powers of two but clarity of code is usually preferred over raw speed
while shifting the types are automatically promoted to int which is wider than chars most often
there is a big discussing between object-oriented and procedural approaches and more generally between declarative and imperative ones and each approach has its upsides and downsides
but in many cases addition is faster than multiplication
also this example uses a for each loops but a for-loop is probably better requires you to count the rows in the first column
generally speaking dfa is faster but nfa is more compact
when you have multiple extents you can figure out on which extent the cluster is by multiplying the lcn with the size of a cluster and then subtract the size of each extent returned by the ioctl in the order they are returned if the next number to subtract is greater than your current number that particular lcn is on that extent
udp is extremely faster than tcp which is suitable to stream a user s voice input
they are slower less efficient than addition subtraction but they are much faster than looping and doing repeated additions
according to some benchmark tests lxml is nearly 100 times faster than beautifulsoup
in a for-loop of more than 100 loops
if size is known normally a non-naive implementation of memcpy is faster than strcpy since it takes profit of the cpu s data bus size
x86 doesn t support higher precision than 80 bits but if you really need more than 64bit for a fp algorithm most likely you should check your numerics instead of solving the problem with brute force
the third line displays the data with the maximum useful precision - an ieee 754 64bit floating-point number has slightly less than 16 decimal digits of precision so all those digits of the literal in math.h are pointless perhaps they can be seen as future-proofing against a possible future redefinition in a format with more precision
there is a difference between the different storage engines though myisam is faster for a lot of select innodb is faster for a lot of insert update because it uses row locking instead of table locking and the way it handles indexes
i think fasta might be better at finding alignments between dissimilar sequences than blast but blast is better at aligning similar sequences
btw i believe that in some weird cases you might get 0 as the number of bytes returned by write a non-blocking pipe or socket - but that is generally the eagain error - or some weird socket there are more than tcp or udp sockets
and i want to do this for-loop faster fill up the output arrays which has a higher 2nd dimension in a cumulative fashion from its previous value .
i looked it up and the logical-or operator has a higher precedence than the conditional operator and the conditional operator has right-to-left associativity
wondering if there is an easier way with a for-loop - looping through an arrays or similar
generator expressions are generally preferred to map and using the dictionary constructor is more canonical than dict.fromkeys
if there is network congestion rate limiting or traffic profiling or if the udp message size is larger than the mtu
a for-loop is more natural for this than a while loops
for what it s worth the while loops is a safer and more idiomatic way to loops over a file s lines in a shell script than the for-loop with backticks even though you see that a lot
also calculating md5 hash is significantly faster than sha-256 and should be favored for performance reasons for any application that doesn t rely on the hash for security purposes
because it appears that your filtering are not mutually exclusive that is a data point can be in more than one filtering grouping i think that your best bet is likely to make a vector of your filtering then loops through that vector though i would use lapply instead of a for-loop
is there a way to load it in node.js or is there another proxy that can be used to monitor changes in array for server-side code that will work far greater than client-side code as it will be receiving yuge requests
coalesce is the standard ansi way isnull gives slightly better performance although the difference is probably insignificant in most cases
the aes key is encrypting much more data but is much faster than rsa encryption
it s said to be better than udp or tcp for communicating by processes in the same os windows xp here
to use this in a loops you can write a simple for-loop which always checks if the index stil is smaller than the arrays length
storing that info on the server-side is probably more common with the client-side only given his the session cookie
theoretically udp should be be 30-50 faster than tcp because it s missing the extra trip for the ack and has a smaller header overhead however in reality there are many cases where tcp would outperform udp just because of congestion control
with typical libraries on common modern hardware sqrt is faster than atan2
in java you can call option s isempty isdefined and get without any special hassle the really useful option methods such as getorelse are another matter. checking the result of the isdefined method in an if-clause should be faster than checking exception-handling in a try-catch block
strict addition is rare but subtraction is more common like when you subtract one image from its filtered one
but my guess would be that in this particular chunk of code multiplying divide and modulo all take roughly the same amount of time and that time is greater than add or subtract
multiplication has higher precedence than addition + which is why 2+3 4 is interpreted as 2+ 3 4 both in c and normal math
the data type text requires more space in ram and on disk is slower to process and more error prone
udp is connection less but at the same level as tcp
secondly if you want the superclass variables to be accessible by your subclassing it s better to use protected than public
the setinterval and settimeout ways you have shown are identical except that setinterval is more clear
by splitting mousedown and mouseup there is less runtime parsing no checking events less code per run of each etc
if you use a where clause though it changes the execution pattern to use indexes so in general innodb will be slower than myisam on full unrestricted counts where as the performance matches up on restricted counts
first if you generically want to apply the same function to each element of an arrays and there isn t already a built in vectorized way to do it you could use arrayfun although often a simple for-loop is faster and more readable
while other algorithms like merge sort and heapsort have a better worst case complexity o nlogn usually quicksort is faster - this is why it s the most common used sorting algorithm
if your sorting needs are more complex than asort or ksort as previously suggested then write a function to plug into uasort
use router-outlet in the parent component and make more than one children route in the routing file
alternatively you can use an ssd with file storage in varnish to reduce disk io bottlenecks when using an object cache larger than available ram
using coalesce is better option than isnull or case..when for this problem since the input values for the coalesce expression can be evaluated multiple times
it states that the unary negation operator has a higher precedence than multiplication and division
its the multiplying that historically was slower than the add
to be honest i prefer to use tcp but if udp works better then i have to use udp
either way my observation is that reordered stdout stderr output is more prevalent with an eclipse console than when you are using a native console
tcp has to do a lot of error checking to ensure that your packets don t get dropped and so tcp is much slower than udp
the only difference in the two loops is the one if statement in the second double for-loop and loops is slightly longer but in the game the second for-loop is only rendering 3 things as there are only 3 platforms being rendered at this point int time
i am wondering why brisk detector detects much less keypoint than the orb detector
on the subject of performance on sql server isnull often performs better than coalesce but the latter is ansi compliant if that is important to you
in theory encoding client-side is no more dangerous than encoding server-side
but swift is less dynamically typed than objective-c and has less support for reflection
parallel processing is by far a more strict mode of execution of the code-units tasks threads... than just a concurrent run of code-execution simultaneously just by coincidence using more than one cpu or processors core and other shared resources to execute a program or multiple but mutually absolutely independent computational units
note that capturing stdout and stderr combined is actually easier
i was expecting that udp would be faster but tcp is on average two times faster than udp
either use less ram by either reducing the scope of your project or finding a way to encode your data more densely or use a avr microcontroller that has more ram in the first place such as the atmega1284p
vector instructions may use array operands that require a higher alignment than any scalar
compared to callgrind kcachegrind the profiler runs much faster having max 5 slowdown typically and it s much deeper as to why the code runs slow as it understands vectorization and running in real time means i o profiling is accurate
the reductive point here is the expression can actually be simplified to just the range that has the greater minimum value and the lesser maximum value
therefore the parfor loops simply must be slower than the for-loop because it has to transmit data to the workers for them to operate on
after determining the location of our element we move our element up in case it has a greater priority than its parent in a similar manner to insertion or down if it has a lower priority than one of its children in a similar manner to deletion and update the modified elements locations in the hash map
and if you have to convert to the same case to make comparisons toupper is better than tolower
because the parent has lower z-index than the .modal-backdrop everything in it will be behind the modal irrespective of any z-index given to the children
a dictionary map makes more sense here not an array of arrays
tcp socket is even more likely than udp socket but both work
try to increase timeout value tcp is slower than udp
with subclassing is trickier because any private members of a class are not inherited by the subclassing but protected and public are
addition is cheaper than multiplication
after that we make sure that the arrays contains at least two value to compare by starting the for-loop from 1 and make sure the size of the arrays is greater than 1 .if not we return the arrays as it is
so ideally i want to have approximate relative times of elementary operations execution like multiplication typically takes 5 times more time than addition exponent is about 100 multiplication
pbkdf2 is more secure than a simple hash or even a salt hash
filtering on the grouping data is more processing-intensive because the grouping must be completed first
you didn t elaborate on that point but if you were simply looking for a more secure algorithm than md5 take a look at hash coupled with an algorithm like sha512
equals on the other hand can test accross a larger number of fields - ie its test is more specific than gethashcode comparisons
as a rule of thumb multiplication is faster than division on all cpus
you can use udp as well but if you are dealing with firewalls it is probably going to be simpler with tcp
hex or maybe octal depending on the machine being emulated will be clearer than using decimal since similar opcodes tend to vary in bits not digits
if your objects are sparse then a quadtree or related data structure r-tree etc. is probably better
some protocols are more complex because what s needed are some but not all of the features of tcp but more than what udp provides
also note that it is easy to implement your own stack on top of udp that performs worse than tcp
the draft c++11 standard tells us that unless stated otherwise the order of evaluations of operands are unsequenced and if the same scalar object is modified more that once by unseqeucend side effects than we have undefined behavior
with one arrays one can do which is easier than a for-loop
as disk is 1000s of times slower than ram as the memory usage increases your machine grinds more and more closer to a halt
i find using system monitor that consistently 100 of one cpu is used when i run the program directly in terminal whereas when i run it in bash in a loop a maximum of 60 of cpu usage is recorded and seems to be linked to the longer completion time although the average cpu usage is higher over the 4 processors
a table is generated using nested while loops and i do understand that a for-loop is more suited for this and got it working using one
an unsigned 64-bit integer type requires compiler support which your compiler lacks so you cannot create it sorry
the second quote suggests that without jit using a trivial getter setter is slower than direct field access eg
adfs has more powerful claims transformation capabilities than acs
udp communication is connection less as compared to tcp which need a connection
it seems the from a readability and usability standpoint the hex representation is a better way of defining binary numbers
indeed floyd-warshall s algorithm is better than dijkstra s in this case the complexity for dijkstra is o m n 2 and in this problem m is much much higher than n so the o n 3 time complexity of floyd-warshall is better
concerning the problem your printpiglatin could use the existing function strcpy or better strncpy which is safer in regards to buffer overflows
i want to write a server tcp or udp which performs more than one task while listening to more than one port
the division has higher precedence than the addition so what you re calculating is sumaverage1+ sumaverage2 5 which is integer division which is probably not what you want
it is because multiplication operator has higher precedence over the addition + operator
ntfs is much more complex and time consuming due to the more complex nature of this filesystems
+ consider that the implementation of tcp stack is much more complicated than udp more instructions are executed there
asymmetric encryption ex rsa is no more secure than symmetric encryption ex aes
the code is riddled with classes which contain nothing more than public shared attributes variables and methods functions the result of which restrict the application from opening more than one project at a time
my data is in tabular format spaces delimiter and looks more or less like
so the 115 seconds will be reduced to 3-4 secs plus the encryption decryption time used for aes which is much faster than rsa
in my tests snappy performs better than lzo by the way
now i can understand that a ghash takes a bit longer than hmac because of the galios field and such but beeing 2 times slower compared to the slowest hash algorithm i know is insane
anyway transmit a salt and hash password is always better than transmit the plain password
scheme is also a good language for that purpose and it is simpler smaller than lisp
push models have higher throughput than pull models
for complicated reasons having to do with the internal electronics of the cpu for most modern processors it is faster to perform a direct branch where the destination address is encoded in the instruction than an indirect branch where the address is computed at runtime
yes storing the password even reversibly encrypted is worse than a salt hash of some sort due to password reuse
at first glance it must be significantly faster because strcpy must be significantly faster than printf
and it will prevent overlapping cron jobs if the cron interval is shorter than the job duration
the c++-way is more readable in my opinion and new and delete are safer than malloc and free
just for the record the tipc addressing scheme is several years older than distributed erlang
this kind of processing is most easily done with xslt which is more expressive than xquery
so i am trying to figure out a situation where i would populate an array with the index numbers from another array whose elements meet a certain criteria array b would be index numbers based on array a which is an array of images and would populate b when width is greater than height
udp will almost always provide better performance than tcp at the cost of reliability
any device in the path of communication between the sender and receiver whose mtu is smaller than the packet will drop such packets and reply the sender with icmp destination unreachable datagram too big message containing the device s mtu
in that case some hash functions are somewhat faster than other md5 being one of the fast functions but md4 is faster and it is simple enough that its code can be included in any application without much hassle
the precedence relationship is the same multiplication is higher then addition
this happens because the division operator has higher precedence than the + addition operator
this is because quicksort is generally faster than heapsort unless the call depth becomes to deep
of course you could do the same with octal but hex is even more compact than octal.
i performed survey on torque slurm loadleveler slurm is better than torque in handling large nodes but in a single cluster
since parentheses were used around the addition but not the multiplication we can infer that probably in this language addition has lower precedence than multiplication
but ram is volatile the data in ram is erased when the computer loses power and ram is far more expensive than disk per unit of storage
you can use a while loops to achieve the desired results but a for-loop is much easier to implement in this situation
the reason for using this vs .nets jpeg encoder decoder is vastly greater quality and speed is essential and other libraries such as bitmiracles .net jpeg library is tremendously slow even after i added some unsafe code to speed up sections of the library such as reading in the bitmap data
it used to be that multiplication was slower than addition and programers used several tricks to avoid multiplication but with haswell it seems that it s the other way around
note that the png format is much more complex than bmp since it allows compression etc
i used iperf on two linux machines to send data using both udp and tcp i found that tcp performs better than udp average 65 better
if the numbers are huge dividing x by b might be betterâ division is usually slower than multiplication but getting out of the huge-number domain early might help more than avoiding division
awt is a thin layer of code on top of the os whereas swing is much larger
the above grammar will make function calls a direct part of the expression with higher precedence than multiplication and division
and you can iterate through different bases which is super useful if you re doing hex or binary which preserves more of the numbery essence of them
first of all wouldn t that relate to it returning an object that is a superclass which contains less data than requested because a superclass is not a subclassing but a subclassing is a superclass
so for example if you send a 63k udp packet and it goes over ethernet it will get broken up into 47+ smaller fragment packets because ethernet s mtu is 1500 bytes but some of those are used for udp headers etc so the amount of user-data-space available in a udp packet is smaller than that
instead you can use udp and implement your own scheme for verification of data that is less stringent than tcp
given that it is possible to vastly reduce the likelihood of the worst case of quicksort s time complexity via random selection of the pivot for example i think one could argue that mergesort is worse in all but the pathological case of quicksort
but another added benefit of this approach is that it could make your program run faster since fixed-point integer arithmetic is much faster than floating-point arithmetic
the resulting file from this png approach is smaller in size than a tiff file and i guess may rescale better
you re performing integer division which is coarser than floating-point division
udp protocol is unreliable but much much faster than tcp which is most commonly used for communication
you should be using compareto method for less than or equals or greater than
there s no point in using a for-loop a while loops is more readable
usually onkeydown is more preferable then onkeyup for such combo
the modulo has a higher precedence than addition
nltk is shy of stanford-nlp in terms of quality of output and for everything other than statistical collocation analysis as far as i can tell stanford-nlp has a broader range of practical algorithms
i noticed some time ago that a for-loop typically generates several more machine instructions than a while loops
in example sendp method included in for-loop which is slower than making other loops to send packets
however because of additional checks that memmove performs when the buffers are small and surely does not overlap memcpy is better
if we look at the speed of operations multiplication is not drastically slower than addition
unfortunately this not possible using openldap because your filtering is returning more than 1 object multiple grouping each with a unique dn
the idea is that equal responses will have equal md5 hash and storing hash is a more lightweight process
lastly whenever you want to iterate x amount of times a for-loop is always more readable than a while loops that uses a counter variable
the third operation is made much faster is the client uses a rsa key pair rsa signature verification is very fast whereas dsa signature verification is expensive actually somewhat more expensive than dsa signature generation
the hash cake generates are more complex than md5
compared with quicksort mergesort has less number of comparisons but larger number of moving elements
this is a scenario where a traditional for-loop is more handy than just iterating over the arrays
multicore refers to a computer or processors that has more than one logical cpu core and that can physically execute multiple instructions at the same time
i have the impression that the implementantion has something to do with a for-loop and some kind of adaptive delay that gets bigger as loops count increases
the communication between the android app and the pc can rely on a simple tcp socket udp is also a valid option but if you begin in network programming tcp is probably easier to handle and more widely used
2 tcp needs more processing at network interface level where as in udp itâ s not
i want to know if there is way in matlab so that i can find number of points in each grid so that i can classify it as a dense cell or sparse cell.if the number of points in a grid is more than a threshold it can be said to be dense .i need to find distance between each point in a sparse grid and centroid of each cluster to find which point is the outlier.if min distances between a test object o in a sparse grid and cenroid of each cluster threshold value it is outlier.can you suggest a method to implement this in matlab
they also tend to be smaller than their xlsx or xlsm counterparts
early inlining is the compiler s ability to inline a function early on when it sees the call costs more than the inline
no java prevents a class from directly extends more than one super class
if you re interested there is another data structure called a dawg directed acyclic word graph that is similar to the trie but uses substantially less memory
this feature allows the processor to execute several arithmetic operations simultaneously often four 32-bit integer operations or four 32-bit floating-point operations sometimes more operations with narrower integers sometimes fewer operations with 64-bit floating-point
tcp is way better then udp for that
on simple low-cost processors typically bitwise operations are substantially faster than division several times faster than multiplication and sometimes significantly faster than addition
it might be better than a for-loop in the terms of readability maintainability but keep in mind that linq usually slower than plain loops tl
my sense is that encode and decode are probably good solutions when you want the data to be recoverable but that unrecoverable hash using crypt md5 is a better approach for stored passwords
if you want to do more columns as a loops you need to increment this value in the same maner you are incrementing r in your for-loop
and has higher precedence than or so the brackets are optional - in the same way as multiplication has higher precedence than addition so
the division operation binds tighter than i.e is evaluated ahead of the subtraction so you are taking a square root of a negative number
common lisp is a weakly functional mixed-paradigm language and scheme is more strongly functional but still not pure
the versions using diff are especially impacted ave_diff with int constants is about 2.5 times faster than the double contants version
root punto is a valid geojson point i checked it with the st_isvalid function and also if i use the function st_distance checking if the distance between the point and the polygons is greater than zero the data retrieved is correct but i don t know if this approach is correct
division is slower than multiplication is generally - and definitely using regular expression matching is going to be slower than multiplication is..
as others have pointed out ocaml s learning curve will be lower than haskell s
now i am using a for-loop to iterate over these frames and add 10 frames in prior and after the erroneous frames in order to get a sequence so that in the end the arrays is more populated
note that while a trie works for the specific case of keys which are strings a binary search tree is much more general and only requires that the keys can be ordered
one often finds the argument that udp is faster then tcp
udp should be much faster than tcp because there are no acknowledge and congestion detection
using the powerpivot excel 2010 addin i believe its possible to effectively create this kind of function using dax and mdx has more built-in functions such as median
the key is to track how many rounds of division the for-loop goes through until the quotient of the current time minus the input time divided by th value of the arrays item is less than the th value of this arrays
one of the reasons to do so is that rsa is much slower than for example aes
swift will incur this penalty in fewer situations than objective-c will for instance method calls to swift-only protocol methods do not hit objc_msgsend but if the protocol is declared in objective-c or if the swift protocol is decorated with objective-c such that it can be adopted by objective-c objects as well then method calls to methods in that protocol adopted by swift objects appear to be dispatched via objc_msgsend
it s not a question of is map reduce better than mergesort or quicksort because map reduce is just a tool for implementing a sorting algorithm like mergesort or quicksort in a parallel way
i d say that the array must first be built into a heap using a typical buildheap function which starts at half the length of the array and calls a minheapify function to ensure each parent is at least less than its children
once you get more familiar with haskell you will be able to rewrite standard recursion scheme such as the one above in a more compact form exploiting a few higher order library functions
the reason to go with logarithm instead of repeated division is performance while log is slower than division it is slower by a small fixed multiple
the key to it all is that box-sizing border-box is less susceptible to browser differences in padding and border calculations on form inputs
while alloca gives you automatic de-allocation on function exit the stack is usually a smaller resource than the malloc heap and if you exhaust the heap it gives you back null
but you are stopping your singlton to have more than one instance during serializable and deserialization which is of more importance in the context of singleton
you can also use javascriptconverter when you need more control over the serializable and deserialization process
note that swift s arrays are much more sensible than objective-c s
so division is always a bit worse than multiplication
tldr tcp ip is more reliable than udp but not a 100 iron-clad guarantee that nothing will ever go wrong
like you heard asymmetric cryptography like rsa is much slower than symmetric cryptography aes but it does have it s advantages simpler key management a single private key to protect
he cried. will save the string on the static storage and you will not be able to do most of the function on them you better work with strdup in your function or malloc and calloc to be able to use all the function
you can also use coalesce which is the more general form of isnull and is actually part of the sql standard
as python integer is less limited than the float you may get bigger results with the fractions if it makes sense at all
a while loops is better thought of as a looping version of an if statement than akin to a for-loop
floating point multiplication usually takes fewer cycles than floating point division
postorder is trickier because the stack has to store nodes to visit and nodes to process and they aren t always simply related like they are in the inorder case
that said it is a scheme which has fewer batteries included as compared to common lisp
on the side of using macros racket has always been more advanced than other scheme and lisp implementations
in this case division has higher precedence than subtraction parenthesis around the division or not
to achieve the actual goal you maybe able to use plain for-loop which provides more flexibility in controlling loops instead of using while
so the difference between the two is that if you assign affinity at the thread level you can assign them to more than one processors and spread the load more than with all threads assigned to one processors
i.e strncpy is actually better than the simpler strcpy if you are willing to improve the code
the whole purpose of using aes to secure the communication or any symmetric key encryption is that it s a lot faster than rsa or any public key encryption
however they are not the same because the subclassing has more specific functions and data members that accomplish a more specific task that the superclass
depending on where i look people say quicksort is faster than mergesort due to its locality of reference cache hits etc
they are of lower priority than explicit height and width constraints that you provide but if you don t provide any then the intrinsic constraints take effect
knuth writes that fibonacci search is preferable on some computers because it involves only addition and subtraction not division by 2. but almost all computers use binary arithmetic in which division by 2 is simpler than addition and subtraction
the use of one settimeout timer is more preferably than several setinterval timers
on some real-world architectures double has stricter alignment requirements than int
answering your question a chars is an integer-type of lower rank than int meaning potentially and in practice nearly guaranteed smaller size and value-range and thus pointers to either are different types too
of course any hash algorithm is going to have some chance of collision but you have better options than md5 that would still satisfy the 1024-byte limit
a slightly more sophisticated approach with add subtract multiplying divide
if new member fields are declared in the subclassing then yes a subclassing presumably uses more memory since it has all the fields declared in the superclass plus all the fields declared in the subclassing
term hide is more appropriate for run-time dynamic show hide
in some of the academic literature implied multiplication is interpreted as having higher precedence than division
words grouping filtering has higher
as pointed out you cannot inline which is another speed trick but inlining on the if-then-else tree doesnt necessarily make it faster than without inlining and is generall not as fast as the function pointer
from what i ve learned so far metaclass and inheritance from superclass in python serve a very similar purpose but superclass inheritance is more powerful
edit just realized a while-loop may well be a lot cleaner than a for-loop for this
protected is more restrictive than public
i ve used it for convenience a for-loop is much more reliable for converting an htmlcollection to an arrays
now for sse is clearly faster and for the smaller values it s nearlly as fast as avx
by decoupling simulation from rendering you can render at a higher frequency than your simulation does for sampling
all hash functions have that problem but some are more robust than md5
you need here while loops better than for-loop
that s because the division operator has a higher precedence than the subtraction operator -
it checks for one or more spaces as field delimiter and also tabs
trying to ensure bounds with min max combinations is slower than this try assert approach
also change your logic in the for-loop to be not since i will not ever be greater than the arrays length
the other advice i have is that a for-each loops is faster than a for-loop
for-loop is more suitable for any countable loops
udp is more popular in nat punching because provides much better results than tcp
a straightforward solution is to iteratively create each of the arrays using a for-loop or list comprehension or use a higher dimensional arrays where each of these 1d arrays is a row in your 2d arrays which is generally faster
sha-256 uses 64 characters in the database but with an index on the column that isn t a problem and it is a proven hash and more reliable than md5 and sha-1
run the following to sort the data on disk this is slower than pulling it into ram sorting and then writing to disk
the difference is in the first number which shows the rounding of the intermediate calculation so the problem happens because x86 has a higher internal precision 80 bit than the arm 64bit
removing division operations by passing through the inverse into the shader is another useful tip as division is typically slower than multiplication
double md5 hashing is actually less secure than a single hash with some attack vectors
from a performance and design perspective using annotations on getter is a better idea than member variables because the getter setter are called using reflection if placed on the field than a method
this was finally slightly faster than std ostringstream but it has few downsides
since it s an exported method clients should get an exception on their abstraction level so illegalargumentexception is better than nullpointerexception
i also changed the for-loop that you had there to foreach loops which makes more sense when working with arrays
if the orb implements local object optimization sometimes collocated objects then it will not open any sockets but it will perform serializable deserialization which is typically faster than marshalling
1 is comparison via gethashcode check if the hashcode of both objects are the same faster than equals
use daemons mode and then simply touching the wsgi script file when an atomic set of changes have been completed isn t that hard and certainly safer than a systemd which restarts arbitrarily when it detects any single change
and division has larger complexity than addition
or is there any other better method than using wakeup interrupt to count seconds since power on
however the while loops remains a little slower than the for-loop
foreach or for-loop is somewhat slower than an equivalent while loops or tail recursion the benchmark i linked to above shows a 15x performance difference with 1000+ iterations though it will likely depend on the version of scala and the version of the jre...
p is sometimes chosen to be 31 because not only is it prime but a compiler resolves it to a bitshift and a subtract which is much faster than a multiplying
for-loop is easier to read than a while loops
settimeout is more relevant than setinterval since the first method just waits for a delay and executes a logic whereas the second function is meant for repeating a logic on periodic intervals
then for-loop the rest arrays start from the second arrays to the last and if the size of the current arrays is smaller than the value of minsize then set both minsize to the size of the current arrays in the for-loop and shortestpath to the reference of the current arrays in the for-loop
division multiplication has higher precedence than addition subtraction and parentheses is required to do addition subtraction before multiplication division
this answer covers the more difficult case with mouseenter and mouseleave
why initial render time for component with both onblur and onfocus is much bigger than others
on contrary jscript is more c-like do not require explicit enabling of script running accepts relative paths case sensitive and loosely typed both are imho advantages for scripting language compared to vbscript
it is nothing more than a getter setter for an object
the only browser where the while loops was slower than the for-loop was in opera
salu is used for-loop counter so when you nest them more salu pressure is done and becomes a bottleneck when there are more than 9-10 loops nested maybe some intelligent algorithm using same counter for all loops should do the trick so not doing only salu in loops body but adding some valu instructions is a plus
an entity-relationship diagram is more abstract
gson is faster with smaller documents and jackson is faster with large documents
udp packets are easier structured than tcp packets but sacrifice security for their size
i found a simple condition where using while loops is better than for-loop
isnull can only have one input however it s been shown to be slightly faster than coalesce
the conclusion of the article is that using for-loop is generally better and faster than the foreach loops
boost intrusive_ptr performs better than shared_ptr because it doesn t need a second allocator to hold the reference count
thus your for-loop is probably better expressed as following while loops
the issue is that the execution time of a benchmarking is much higher about 3 times in case i do not invoke the profiling along with it than the case when the benchmarking is executing with the profiling
the class uses scheme a dialect of lisp which is significantly cleaner and easier to use than common lisp yes this is an opinion deal with it
telnet is more general than ftp and is generally used for command and control
also after the first coercion from a side effect of a benchmark as noted above r will operate on double s and that contains slower manipulations than on int s
i find lapply loops easier than a for-loop in your case as initializing the list and using the counter can be avoided
first step would be to investigate why a processors with hyperthreading simultaneous multithreading could lead to poorer performances than a processors without this technology
mergesort may use more space than quicksort i m not entirely sure and merge may be better for linkedlists
the rsa private exponent may actually be shorter than the modulo
the nested loops version is the slower of the two due to the extra the interpreter overhead of the for-loop
-in the same laptop but using the hpc cluster of my department with 30 workers the parfor loops is much much slower than the for-loop and than the parfor loops using the local cluster with 12 workers
performance will depends on your application use cases basically orika perform better than dozer or other mapping reflection based frameworks because it use bytecode generation behind the scenes
asymmetric key encryption ex rsa is no more secure than symmetric key encryption ex aes
udp is quicker than tcp but if you re using quickfix you ll be using tcp
the suffix tree is lighter and faster than the trie and is used to index dna or optimize some large web search engines
this avoids malloc free but is less extensible and more prone to buffer overflow issues so i rarely ever use it
you can even shorten the for-loop by directly pushing the objects into the arrays which is a better way -
udp is faster than tcp and the simple reason is because its nonexistent acknowledge packet ack that permits a continuous packet stream instead of tcp that acknowledges a set of packets calculated by using the tcp window size and round-trip time rtt
if this is not the case a standard comparison-based sort algorithm or even an integer sorting algorithm like radix sort is asymptotically better
for any particular set of hyperparameters this range is much closer to the minimum response than to the maximum
in arithmetic books and computer software and more-expensive calculators this means 12+ 34 56 not 12+34 56 because multiplication has higher precedence than addition
instead of using a while loops it is easier to use a for-loop
note parentheses are redundant as division and multiplication have the same priority and modulo has higher precedence over addition
for my understanding the superclass is always smaller less complex then the subclassing
the keyword inline is more about telling the compiler that the symbol will be present in more than one object file without violating the one definition rule than about actual inlining which the compiler can decide to do or not to do
smalltalk methods tend to be more fine-grained than lisp functions so that may be a good place to begin
you can use a for-loop in this case extending one of the arrays elements is better than creating another arrays

first of all multiplication is faster than division
addition subtraction assignment has lower procedure than simply add operation
if a remains the same and b is changing say if your code is in a loop and it s clear that a does not change between two iterations for instance because it s a const variable then the original version can execute faster because multiplication is cheaper than division assuming the compiler moves the computation of 1 .
it can get a bit more complex with multiplication division but the main downside is performance
but it sounds like you want to do nat traversal over tcp which is a harder problem than udp
also note that quicksort is generally more optimal than mergesort see this as well which explains why it s taken advantage of when sorting primitives

you should be generating a random string longer than an md5 hash not shorter
if they are connected over the internet you could try to use the examples for tcp but tcp has more overhead than udp
the events seem to not follow strict sequential rules second keydown comes earlier than first keyup so the timer gets initialized multiple times
using default no protected private public is even worse as it allows classes in the same package or subclasses to access the logger
as you can see modulo is about an order of magnitude slower than subtraction
the fact that udp s header size is less than tcp s is because is a simpler protocol that needs less header space that s all there is to it

compared to sleep 3 and usleep 3 nanosleep has the advantage of not affecting any signals it is standardized by pthreads it provides higher timing resolution and it allows to continue a sleep that has been interrupted by a signal more easily
with regard to implementation it also takes advantage of a bit of a non-obvious property of r precedence rules actually this is true of other languages as well such as c c++ and java namely that unary negative is higher than modulo which is higher than binary subtraction thus the calculation for is equivalent to

in storing hash passwords is a common practice to add a nonce or a salt and is marginally true that this salt is better kept secret
it will be much slower i don t have benchmarks but i would guess at least an order of magnitude maybe more decimal will not benefit from any hardware acceleration and arithmetic on it will require relatively expensive multiplication division by powers of 10 which is far more expensive than multiplication and dividion by powers of 2 to match the exponent before addition subtraction and to bring the exponent back into range after multiplication division

writing to a local database or handling a data structure larger than ram will impact the disk making network calls will impact the network hardware cpu bound calculations will impact there
the inline keyword makes it easier for the compiler to apply this optimization by allowing the function definition to be visible in multiple translation units but using the keyword doesn t mean the compiler has to inline the function and not using the keyword doesn t forbid the compiler from inlining the function
the proper way to copy strings is using strcpy or strcpy_s on windows the difference is memcpy is faster and used in other situations such as pointers buffer management
putting the whole thing in a for-loop makes it neater and ensures that the iterating isread is called each loops
since these are typically orders of magnitude slower than the processors from the cpu s perspective this takes forever
override both methods but make gethashcode more tolerant than equals that means make unequal objects have the same hash code and not the opposite

your intial hypothesis of toupper being faster than tolower has a logical fallacy
division by 5.0 is more accurate than multiplication by an approximate 0.2

multiplication has higher precedence than addition subtraction
it breaks srp principles and makes code more complicated
division has a higher precedence than addition ergo

here s one idea which uses one multiplication and one shift so it ll be faster than a division on most systems
also ram bandwidth is much higher than disk or ssd or network bandwidth and the ram latency is much lower too
it makes minimal change to the text in particular it never splits a word doesn t change wc -w and for text with no more than single spaces in a row and no cr it doesn t change wc -c because it replaces spaces with linefeed rather than inserting linefeed
produce temporary variable first then filtering grouping with productname a further filtering rank is greater than rank where productname a is located

this is similar to operator precedence in mathematics where for example multiplication has a higher priority than addition
for if your solving algorithm size is greater than the processors cache size the cpu must retrieve pieces of code from main memory or l2 cache which is a slower operation
what is that key feature in tcp that makes it have much much higher throughput than udp
you are seeing a noticeable jump in interface response because subviews do in fact consume quite a bit of memory uiview are very expensive compared to their underlying calayers and as such calling -removesubview not only unloads stress from the gpu but also frees up more memory as the subviews is usually released afterwards
moreover because read is built into bash and this usage requires no subshell it s significantly more efficient than approaches involving subprocesses such as head or awk
it replaces all tags with spaces and str.split splits resulted text by one or more spaces as delimiter
this is why a regular for-loop is better to use for this scenario rather than a foreach loops
adding setter and getter is better
in this context free store is different and incompatible with heap because the new delete free store library is simpler and quicker than the malloc free realloc calloc heap library and thus provides huge memory usage gains to the c++ embedded programmer in a context where you have only 512 bytes of ram
in practice each payloaded buffer will represent 1 udp packet unless your network mtu is smaller then what you have configured on the payload see mtu property
package-private is stricter than protected and public scopes but more permissive than private scope
when typing in the text box the autocomplete pop-up but is bigger than the remaining space in the modal dialog
if we are creating an object of a subclassing and invoking the method of superclass and if subclassing extends more than one class which superclass method should be called
this subtraction operator occurs within the second brackets and so has a higher precedence than the multiplication
because representation of a given problem with a nfa is far easier than the equivalent dfa

tcp mounts are more reliable and you know you have a network problem much faster than with udp
if your goal is education and not ease of implementation you would probably be better served by extends the uicomponent class and using the treeitemrenderer code as a reference to create a class that implements the same interfaces
in high-level programming languages the choice between a boolean and an int is really more of code readability supportability than one of efficiency
but then normal for-loop is far better for arrays than using for-in which is actually for object
so i guess it s the md5 in the dump output cause the conflicts and the hash value is longer than md5 outputs
hash ids are usually shorter than typical hash created by cryptographic hashing algorithms such as md5 or sha-256 and unlike these hash ids are usually reversible meaning we can decode the original value
the wrapper uses these in such a way that even the md5 implementation is significantly more secure than a simple hash
multiplication is nearly always a lot slower than addition
using a higher key size results in larger primes and modulus which makes it harder to factorize the modulus to get the primes out of it to then reveal the private key
tastypie is more tightly coupled to the orm than piston but there are methods that you can define in a tastypie resource to specify how to handle create read update delete
also note that using keyup or input makes far more sense than keydown otherwise the previous value will only be evaluated on the next event occurrence
this is way more efficient than sorting and filtering in php
you don t usually get such errors because there is a defaulting mechanism for polymorphic numbers that in ambiguous cases picks whichever of int or double is more appropriate see the haskell report for details
this was surprising for me as it is well known fact that udp performs better than tcp
shouldn t a subclassing interfaced be able to take in more than the superclass interfacec and use the same method
because addition is faster than multiplication and can be faster than shift
multiple inherited makes it easier to compose classes from small mixin base classes that implement functionality and have properties to remember state
if there is lot of data exchange then a binary format like protobuf or thrift or avro is better
you may find that hyperthreading helps more on code that is using large amounts of memory so that the processors is regularly blocked on fetching from memory
with tcp its slightly slower than udp and has more features
you can take a look at timsort which for non completely random data performs better than quicksort they have the same asymptotic complexity but timsort has lower constants
on the other hand the wikipedia article on r-tree seems more specifically targeted towards mapping than the k-d tree or quadtree
in your code on line in the for-loop does no more point to an arrays --the compiler has no information about the length of the variable that it s pointing at whether it is an arrays a single chars or an int or something else-- but it is just a plain pointer presumably a pointer pointing to a default int
apart from that tcp packets by themselves are not slower than udp packets and data transfer with a simple tcp connection can be faster than with a simple udp connection because flow control and reliable transfer is already integrated and you don t have to reinvent everything again and often worse
tcp is faster for when using a few connections the important difference is that modern nics perform significant amounts of acceleration on tcp and not really that much for udp
so we can see that an optimised while loops is faster than a for-loop by 2 operations however it uses more stack space
floating-point calculations are more expensive time-wise than fixed-point which is why fixed-point remains popular in microcontrollers and embedded systems
the reason for the second case much slower on sorted data is that a while-loop is cheaper than the equivalent for-loop when there are zero iterations
however when i switch to swift 4.0 the methods declared in swift is no longer visible in objective-c
however dsa verification expect verification calls to be 100x issue is about 10x slower than rsa verification
notice that besides using the filter method or not even with a plain for-loop is much better for performance create a new arrays from scratch instead of mutate the current one multiple times
i thought of using before and after pseudos to display top-to-bottom and bottom shadows on the containing element but these pseudos display within their parent element and positioning parent z-index higher than these children has no effect
use one of the image loading libraries glide square picasso universal-image-loader or ion ion is actually more of a general purpose async loading tool to do the dirty work for you
edit keydown is a little better than keyup for the element bind now enter key fails silently-ish
dfa is a better choice over nfa because it has only one transition for an input while nfa can have many
generally swing is more efficient and advanced than awt
now a routine to initiate once per second - settimeout is usually more useful than setinterval
in computer 1 the eigen3 performance is worse because the number of total processors virtual + physical - â due to hyperthreading is greater than the number of physical processors
i am a bit suspicious of the performance because modulo tends to use division which is slower than your subtraction operations
since you re resizing the window make sure to assign the w and h values not as numbers but as products or dynamic numbers multiplication is faster than division but you can also use division
tcp is far better at transferring large quantities of data but when the network fails it s more likely that udp will get through
those approach that you are using trys to make a number integer if a fractions part is less than 1e-6 0.000001
by comparison des see section 3.2 and other block ciphers are much faster than the rsa algorithm
the rest of the complexity is reduced to the operation mod that is the division that is hardly more expensive than table look up and division by constant can be optimized to multiplication
from experience i can tell you udp is about 10-15 faster than tcp on dedicated and udp-tuned networks
i just want to learn why fast inversion algorithm is slower than math.h sqrt function
the problem is that tcp creates bigger packages of data while udp uses 8 kb of data blocks
easiest way is to simply recognize that division is nothing more than the multiplication of the dividend y and the inverse of the divisor x
floating-point division is typically faster than integer division on the cpu
using a non-reversible hash such as md5 is much more secure and you can store the hash value as clear text
ironically ancient x86 instruction rep stosq performs much better than sse and avx in terms of memory copy
therefore i conclude that division is faster than multiplication
because sml is eagerly evaluated the execution model is far easier to comprehend and debugging via printf works a lot better than in haskell
and keep in mind that the modulo has a higher precedence than addition and subtraction
because there is no confirmation on udp packets it s slightly faster than tcp
i definitely wouldn t try introducing a new general-purpose type for use in python based on std map which has worse algorithmic complexity in time for many important operations andâ in at least some implementationsâ leaves some optimisations to the user that dictionary already has
for some problems character level n-gram do better than words level and logistic regression parameters
purely in terms of the number of comparisons performed is mergesort always more efficient than quicksort
ever since i did sockets programming on a pdp 11 it s been the case that ip fragmentation will take care of the case where an ip datagram such as a udp datagram is larger than the mtu for the segment allows
these can be compared to multiplying by 2 x left-shift or divinding by 2 x right-shift but it should be noted that a binary shift is much faster than a division operation
that tree is a binary tree in the sense that each node has only two children but the child nodes aren t less or greater than their parent node
can you explain me why in this case the parfor loops is slower than the for-loop
this means that while the two underlying sorts it uses mergesort and insertion sort are both worse than quicksort for many kinds of data timsort only uses them when it is advantageous to do so
i m writing a c# class to perform 2d separable convolution using int to obtain better performance than double counterpart
also sending receiving data over udp is much simpler than over tcp and it does not require any connections
in some cases on embedded platforms where a fast hash function may not be available these may be more efficient than hmac
then c which is one those languages closer to the processor level is very performant and generally speaking compiled-language because they turn your code into assembly language are more performant than interpreted-language
so here the unchecked exception-handling is better to use in order not to copy and paste all that ugly try-catch block rethrowing an exception-handling and add the throws clause to the method
so it looks like the simd implementations give a 2x or more improvement over 64bit scalar code although 256 bit simd doesn t seem to give any improvement over 128bit simd and that typical throughput should be a lot faster than 5 gb s
nsstring has a higher level it also inherited form nsobject const on it should have no effect in fact not the same meaning about the no effect on immutable object
multiplication is much faster than division
since i am using double nested loops i think for-loop is more suitable than while in this case
i am confused why tcp throughput is bigger than udp
so if we have a vector and want to calculate a component-wise function over it say sin and cos it is faster to use vvsincos from accelerate because it will pipeline the calculations of sin and cos for all the entries in the vector which is faster than using a for-loop over the vector
your while loops would be better written as a for-loop
it is true that division and modulo a division operation is slower than addition
the calculation language is dax which is an improvement on the horrible mdx - dax reads more like excel functions
for formatting a single numeric value tostring is marginally more efficient than string.format because string.format has a bunch of overhead to parse the format string out of the curly braces and then pass it to tostring
first of udp s datagram is simpler than tcp s one
it appears that you consider modulo to have lower precedence than multiplication and division when in fact it does not
if i d directly say that udp is faster comparatively than tcp that it is used for such applications
my question is why do both integer and floating-point multiplication execute faster than their addition counterparts
es2015 module is more efficient than the other formats and can facilitate the creation of smaller bundle size through tree-shaking technique importing just the bits you need instead of importing the whole thing
if you send a udp datagram larger than the mtu it will be fragmented
if the dominant memory usage is program data structures then i wouldn t be at all surprised to find pypy using significantly less memory than cpython whether or not the jit was enabled
multiplication is a relatively complex operation and is likely to be slower than say addition or comparison
floating-point may be somewhat slower than integer but it s generally
it wouldn t be especially likely that they d occur an exact multiple of 257 bytes apart but it s a risk which can be avoided by using a primes modulus provided at least that the number of bytes in the file is smaller than the modulus
note that the exponent operator has a higher precedence than multiplication and division just like in mathematics
choice is not easy sometimes we use rule of thumb impala is good for queries without joins if all your data stored in hdfs hive spark has bigger latency but joins are reliable it supports more data sources and has rich non-sql processing capabilities like mllib and graphx
i think the performance depends a lot on the data provider paging and sorting and filtering the data are easily the most expensive tasks when dealing with databases - so picking a renderer gridview listview repeater is more dependent on your comfort with that particular control
scheme has fewer libraries than common lisp
lemmatization should lead to better results than stemming source
use having clause to filtering the grouping which is having more than fkey
wifi and bluetooth aren t fast enough for a smooth framerate but the data transfer speed across the usb connector is more than enough up to 480 megabytes second
