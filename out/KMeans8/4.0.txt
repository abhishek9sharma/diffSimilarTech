ram is much faster then disk io
hence memcpy and strncpy work almost the same here and memcpy is more efficient and less prone to error
you can also use strtol which is obviously better than atoi
i have also found that a while-loop is faster than a for-loop
velocity is simpler than freemarker
besides strtol is a better option than atoi as strtol can handle failures better
innodb is affected by the primary key much more than myisam and it could make a noticeable difference
ok there are some cases where myisam is faster than innodb but rarely enough that it s worth putting up with the lack of acid-compliance
edit memmove is 2x faster than memcpy on the server
heapsort tends to be slower than mergesort for the same reason.
and is as far as i know faster than the combination of malloc and memset on the other hand malloc alone is faster than calloc
but heapsort is assumed to be on average somewhat slower than standard in-place quicksort
pypy which in general is much faster than cpython is considerably slower for this use case
there are some situations when myisam is infinitely more efficient than innodb when manipulating large data dumps offline because of table lock
edit for the read-performance this link shows that innodb often is actually not slower than myisam
while myisam can be faster for some queries innodb is usually quicker if properly tuned
myisam is often faster than innodb in terms of raw performance mostly because it is not acid
not sure why people think myisam is more performant than innodb - it s a conundrum wrapped in an enigma
why new delete is slower than malloc free
fgetc is a function to read a single char simpler than using fgets
innodb is often slower than myisam being a transactional db engine with acid properties
malloc is faster since calloc initializes the allocated memory to contain all zeros
malloc free is harder because there√¢ s also calloc and realloc
tcmalloc is faster than the glibc 2.3 malloc available as a separate library called ptmalloc2 and other malloc s that i have tested
myisam has proved to be faster than innodb for me
as for reliability i think that postgresql is more reliable especially when compared to mysql using myisam - innodb is a lot better here
doing a single printf and strdup is faster and simpler than doing 2-3 printf calls
innodb is more reliable than myisam
innodb consumes more disk space than myisam -- typically 2x-3x
innodb is transactional so inserts will generally be slower than myisam
then i thought about innodb but then i read that myisam is better with many write operations
i did a search online comparing myisam and innodb but all of the articles i read judged myisam being faster than innodb on select queries
interestingly quicksort performs more comparisons on average than mergesort - 1.44 n lg n expected for quicksort versus n lg n for mergesort
much nicer than strtotime mktime etc
so i feel that on x86 memcpy is faster than strcpy
it is possible that the config of your innodb engine is more efficient for your searches than the way you have myisam set up
because heapsort is actually slower than quicksort for each n
heapsort has a better big-o than say quicksort yet quicksort performs much better in practice
innodb has better performance than myisam though innodb needs more attention to tuning the configuration innodb supports atomic changes transactions foreign keys and innodb is much more resistant to corrupting data in a crash
mergesort - in general mergesort is consistently faster than quicksort however quicksort is done in place and doesn t require allocating memory unlike mergesort
also have a look at strncmp which is safer version of strcmp
but when myisam is really better than innodb
in my opinion myisam use to be faster than innodb now they are pretty much the same in speed
instead of the conventional read.table i feel fread is a faster function
ntfs filesystems actually supports longer names 32k
put another way let s say i start with a new innodb table and insert 20 gb of data assuming that 20 gb incorporates all the excess innodb stuff i realize data stored in innodb is larger than myisam then i delete all data then i insert 10 gb of data
also it seems like a for-loop is of greater cost to the compiler than a while-loop
any decent libc will have an efficient strlen that s much faster than looping a byte at a time so separate vectorized strlen and toupper loops are faster
innodb would be a better choice than myisam for a high-write table
innodb is much much stricter than myisam
that way quicksort can reach recursive base case more quicker than mergesort
innodb uses row level locking while myisam can only use table level locking that is why innodb has crash revovery is better than myisam
another side note single-quotes inside xpath string looks a bit tidier than escaped double-quotes imo
also innodb is slower than myisam unless myisam is blocking for a huge select
marcus yes memmove is faster than strcpy and faster than python but why
mysql mariadb is slightly worse than postgresql
fgets or fgetc is a better approach
parallelizing mergesort is simpler than quicksort in-place
indexing on int datatype gives you more performance than indexing on chars or varchar datatypes
for example quicksort average cost t n.log n and heapsort average cost t n.log n are both sorting algorithms with the same average cost - yet quicksort is typically much faster than heapsort
i can t say whether toupper or tolower is faster though
in other words calloc is no more type-wise than memset
is the foreach loops slower than the for-loop
avoids n calls to malloc free it s faster and simpler to allocate deallocate
your macro with memset and memcpy was not any safer than strcpy
oracle has kept improving innodb by so much that they declare that it is better than myisam in virtually all situations
the justification of realloc is that it s faster than 2nd malloc manual copy free
also calloc is slower than malloc from operating system memory allocation perspective
an alternative approach with getc fgets or fread seems better suited to you needs
obviously dynamic allocation with malloc or calloc is more flexible
the other ram disk questions like ramdisk slower than disk

myisam supports longer rows than innodb does
myisam is more space friendly than innodb you can start with that one
why is enumerate slower than xrange + lst i
you are right because myisam is really faster than innodb
actually calling memset after malloc is closer to calling calloc than the option you suggest
heapsort has higher overhead than quicksort but its worst case is o n log n vs
disk even ssd are orders of magnitude slower than ram
also note that some mysql engines are faster than others for example myisam may run faster than innodb at expense of the lack of real foreign keys
i have heard that myisam performs better than innodb on read-oriented tables
there may be some exotic corner cases where myisam performs marginally better for certain workloads table-scans or high-volume insert-only work but the default choice should be innodb unless you can prove you have a case that myisam does better
nunit is faster as compared to mstest
a better solution is not to use myisam for tables where the data is constantly changing - innodb is much more bulletproof and as paul correctly points out you can use transactions on innodb tables but not on myisam
and normal for-loop is faster than for-in loops
according to the performance results at for serialization with databind with strings gson.tojson myobject gson is over 10x slower than jackson

innodb not only has the advantages you list but it is also faster than myisam in many benchmarks
myisam is better for high read volumes innodb for high update volumes due to table vs row locking
if you are not using transactions while storing or updating tables switch table type to myisam its quite faster than innodb with much less overhead
it also caused a bigger problem with serializable and deserialization
historically floating-point could be much slower than integer
you could use memcpy memset for strings too but strcpy is simpler
innodb is more strict in data integrity while myisam is not as
fread performs faster and more efficiently than read.table but read.table produces less no errors on the same data set
replaced strcpy with strncpy which is much safer apparently and that removed the segmentation fault

myisam is not faster than innodb anymore for most types of queries
i would say that the quicksort is simpler for parallelizing than the mergesort
innodb has better crash recovery while myisam is poor at recovering
a fairer comparison would be comparing stringstream to the printf sscanf line of functions which would be slower than strtod but still faster than stringstream
there are lots of cpu gpu combinations where a 32b integer multiply is faster than a 32b floating-point multiply on cpu and vice-versa on gpu
you should use strncmp to compare your strings it s safer than strcmp
previously discussed on so why is quicksort better than mergesort
often myisam is fine in certain other cases innodb is better
in the case of overflow a free malloc pair costs less than realloc because of its internal hidden memcpy
innodb tables are about 4x bigger than their myisam counterparts

myth 3 strncpy is a safer version of strcpy
edited to add myisam is faster than innodb because it is simpler
myisam is the perfect choice since the database is almost only used for reading and myisam is significantly faster that innodb
firstly i switched from innodb to myisam which is better designed for mysql spatial extensions
the lone exception is myisam which is an older mysql storage engine which does not support transactions is more prone to corruption and generally tends to perform worse than innodb
innodb has better crash recovery while myisam is poor at recovering data integrity at system crashes
in some benchmarks i see that myisam is faster than innodb but seems i have a little improvement
binary tree sort in particular is likely to be slower than mergesort or quicksort because of the tree-balancing overhead as well as cache access patterns.
therefore accessing myisam consumes less resources than innodb
innodb is usually much better than myisam at tables being available while insert update and delete are happening because innodb uses row level locking for updates whereas myisam uses table level locking
c++ std map behaves more like a python defaultdict than dictionary
innodb is slower for read only databases because it has features acid compliant row level locking that myisam leaves out
basically imagemagick was only slightly slower than libjpeg
this i suspect serializable takes more time to process serializable and deserialization
innodb performance has been improved to the point where it is hard to come up with a benchmark that says myisam is faster
scenarios when quicksort is worse than mergesort
however innodb tends to be slower as myisam
as you are no doubt aware from your searches innodb is primarily better than myisam for high volume inserts not counting non-comparable features like foreign keys or full text searches which are exclusive to innodb and myisam respectively while myisam is primarily useful for tables which are read more often than they are written to
quicksort usually is better than mergesort for two reasons
anyone who thinks myisam is faster is either not tuning innodb correctly or has such small data that who cares
in the first example sqldf is 3x slower than data.table and in the second its 200x faster than plyr and 100 times faster than data.table
i am not sure if this is no longer true myisam is faster than innodb for reads

in few words strncmp is safer then strcmp but it is slower too
myisam is faster than innodb for reads myth
in innodb the count s when where group by or join is not used execute slower than in myisam because the row count is not stored internally
also i can t see your table engine but myisam is better for full text searching rather than innodb
it is understandable that memset is faster than memcpy
since myisam is better on selecting while innodb is better on writing
typically mergesort is slower than heapsort and quicksort but that s usually under the assumption that comparisons are fast
yes it is an old wives tale that myisam is faster than innodb
one thing is that if your inserts are not in the order of increasing primary keys innodb can take a bit longer than myisam
quicksort also has a better cache access behavior than heapsort
i read that settimeout is less cpu resources intensive than setinterval
memcpy is usually faster than strcpy for longer strings
2 - i have read about myisam vs innodb the conclusion for me was that myisam is faster when it comes to read-only whereas innodb is designed for tables that get updated or inserts more frequently

when comparison function is a callback function like in quicksort libc implementation quicksort is slower than mergesort by 15 on random input and 30 for already sorted array for 64 bit integers
i considered changing them to innodb to make the database 100 the same but then read the myisam is faster
can be that the memory operations calloc memcpy is slower in one system
oh and just incase you were thinking innodb is slower than myisam - the myisam implementation i tested was twice as slow in all counts
calloc is faster than malloc + memset because calloc knows that the mmap d pages are pre-zeroed and memset forces the allocation of physical ram
since you don t do updates i think myisam would be better than innodb in this scenario
quicksort is not better than mergesort

innodb was faster when data was present already and generally performed better except for hdd-space - myisam is smaller on disk
quicksort is more sensitive to input sortedness in a positive way than mergesort
this is an enormous amount of extra work and explains why calloc is faster than malloc and memset
but innodb has improved dramatically in the past few years and in most cases today innodb performs faster than myisam
a realloc can occur significantly faster than a malloc memcpy and free
you can use isnull also in place of coalesce as isnull is comparatively faster than coalesce
have you considered changing to innodb - it has much better concurrency support and in some contexts will run faster than myisam
however quicksort s worst-case performance is significantly worse than heapsort s is
for-loop is faster then foreach and foreach is faster then for in loops
memset behaves like strcpy but the difference is that memcpy copied the data as it is byte but strcpy copies the formatted string as well so takes more time than memcpy to execute
myisam is more prone to locking problems than innodb i believe
myisam generally performs faster because it lacks certain functions innodb has such as rollback... but it has only table locking

memcpy is more efficient than memmove. in general use memmove only if you have to
myisam is still widely used in web applications as it has traditionally been perceived as faster than innodb in situations where most db access is reads
memcpy is still a little bit slower than memmove

finally even if somehow you could manage myisam to perform better than innodb that doesn t mean innodb is inadecuate at all
quicksort consistently has less recursive calls than mergesort
buf1 buf2 and buf3 is small enough to located in l1 cache and l2 cache l2 cache 1mb .both of sse and avx is band width limited but with the datalen increase why do the avx need more time than sse

so yes - toupper is more reliable than tolower
profiling is known to slow pypy a lot more than cpython
those answers was that calloc can allocate larger blocks than malloc can and etc
generally you can have as good performance for reading as in myisam in innodb tables - you just can use count without where clause and you always should have a suitable index for where clauses as in innodb table scan will be slower than in myisam
but in c++ std ostringstream is better and typesafe as joachim explained in his answer

it would be better to use malloc over calloc unless we want the zero-initialization because malloc is faster than calloc
you might have even noticed the fgetc version is simpler than the fread version
because i heard that for-loop is much faster than foreach loops
also i d use fgets rather than scanf as it is inherently safer for the same reason that printf is safer than printf

you can also try using innodb since it s said is better than myisam handling bulk inserts with data already on it
innodb is also being developed more than myisam
while on antiquated hardware myisam was a necessity on modern hardware innodb actually performs better
quicksort generally runs faster than mergesort but under some circumstances it can degrade to quadratic running time
while the myisam type takes around 10mb average of 15b for each row the innodb type takes more than 30mb average of 44b
quicksort is implemented well it is typically 2-3 times faster than mergesort or
most of the literature that says myisam is better faster whatever then innodb is old literature
so that means that in practice an innodb write will take 3 times longer than a myisam write
under cpython tests run 4 times faster than under pypy
arraylist - for-loop is about more than 2 times faster speed than foreach loops
in this area i think innodb s change buffer does a better job than myisam s do it now
is quicksort always better than mergesort
toupper is better to use than tolower but i forget why
in a thread i came to know that myisam is faster for reads innodb is faster for writes
i know innodb tends to be a bit slower than myisam on counting but this is far too long
it is also non-standard unsafe and non-portable basically worse than using malloc and free in c++
myisam inserts are going to be faster than innodb so if you re logging data and retrieving it later that will be a win
innodb is more resistant to table corruption than myisam
deserialization performance is similar with gson over 9x slower than jackson and fastjson about 0.5 faster than jackson
i do know though that quicksort has more compares but less swaps than mergesort which i learned from another stackoverflow discussion quicksort vs merge sort
scanf is faster than cin printf is faster than cout etc
because of the above replace strdup with strlen malloc memcpy memcpy is slightly faster than strcpy
is memcpy usually faster than strcpy on most real platforms
3 mysqlhotcopy inly works on myisam tables and in most applications you are better off with innodb
i m not saying that realloc is worse than implementing realloc using a malloc free
caching and buffering are quite important since disk are just so much slower than ram and ram is much slower than the cpu
enumerate is more pythonic but xrange is fine here too
the for-loop is slightly slower than the foreach loops
memcpy is not really any slower than strcpy
newer versions of mysql 5.5+ have extended innodb to support all the features that were previously only available on myisam such as fulltext and geospatial indexing and innodb performance is usually considerably better than myisam when configured properly
you can probs achieve this better by using strftime and setlocale
i understand that strtol and strtof are preferred to atoi atof since the former detect errors and also strtol is much more flexible than atoi when it comes to non-base-10
memcpy is faster than strcpy and also enforces you to specify a buffer size
in fact oracle is so sure that innodb is better that they removed myisam from 8.0
myisam also tends to store data in less space than innodb
database performance of the innodb is not necessary faster than the myisam engine
mri is faster than jruby
tuning innodb which is the better engine requires adjusting different values than myisam which is often the fast-but-unsafe default
if there are many modifications of the data it s said that innodb works faster because it uses row locking instead of table locking like myisam
memcpy is rarely slower than strcpy or strncpy and often significantly faster
in their respective worst cases heapsort is faster than quicksort
or indeed if your system has strdup or you re willing to write an implementation then strdup is much cleaner than malloc + strcpy
myisam for reads may well be faster than innodb
what baffles me is that my mergesort seems to be slower than heapsort in both of the languages
this means calloc can potentially be faster than calling malloc followed by memset since it can skip the memset if it knows it will already by zeroed
use hashmap that it has o 1 speed also iterate the arrays of integers in enhanced for-loop because it is slightly faster than ordinary for-loop
iterating pair-wise you d normally do something like but iterating over an arrays is faster than using a c-style for-loop
myisam is faster when the query is simple but it s much slower in a high concurrent environment as its table level lock comparing to innodb s row level lock
the first calloc subsequently malloc has a longer execution time then
memcached is in-memory too and a bit slower than apc
in practice however quicksort is usually faster then heapsort
here is a recent benchmark of jython 2.5.2 running on jvm 7 where jython is slower than pypy but faster than cpython
nvl versus coalesce oracle is much pickier about reserved words
snappy is also significantly faster than lzo for decompression
although 4m isn t that many rows with contention and depending on your structure and database engine it may take a while i think myisam alters take longer than innodb because myisam requires whole table locks and handles concurrency less well
in general it seems as though the concensus is to primarily use innodb but there are still some areas in which myisam is much faster than innodb
someone just told me that innodb is much better than myisam
myisam is faster but does not support the use of transactions like innodb does
as you know myisam table sizes are about three or more times smaller than same innodb tables
using fgets strtol offers better error handling than sscanf
i have written a memory allocator that is supposedly faster than using malloc free
of course calculating a md5 or sha hash is much slower than calculating a crc32
has nicer behavior than either strcpy or strncpy
so i guess fseek should be much faster than fread
and it s rarely faster than innodb since innodb uses row locks and mvcc as opposed to myisam s full-table locks
disk io will be slower than ram
thing is i believe that cin and cout is faster than scanf anf printf.c++
use strtol it does better error reporting than atoi
i saw that pypy is generally faster than cpython
malloc is far more common in c code than calloc
faster than on x86 32bits but slower than x64 64bit
lxml is also much much faster than beautifulsoup
the trope about myisam being faster than innodb is a holdover from code that was current in the mid-2000 s
it will be presumably more efficient than malloc + memset for large allocations
native javascript sort performing slower than implemented mergesort and quicksort
memcpy can be more efficient than strcpy since rep movs is highly optimized on intel cpus esp
innodb doesnt read number of rows from stored cached value like myisam does if column is not null cause innodb is more optimized for writing than reading opposing to myisam
if you use insert and update high performance uses innodb over myisam is better
switch from using strcpy to strncpy or strncat which i think is better than strncpy
why is memcpy so much slower than memmove or hand rolled copy on the server
if end up using the memory anyway calloc is still faster than malloc and memset but the difference is not quite so ridiculous
you should use strcpy or strncpy safer than strcpy to copy the string stored in the array between arrays
strncpy is safer than strcpy
does tinyint in mysql take up more space than boolean
innodb is slower than myisam for most uses but can perform faster in certain conditions due to a better locking mechanism
innodb is more scalable and myisam doesn t support any of the properties of acid
ram is much faster than disk
i am trying to compare the myisam and innodb write read performance but i am suprised that the myisam s read is much more slower than innodb while its write is much more faster this is totally opposite compared to what i have learned
there are other optimizations available but general rule is that innodb will be quicker than myisam is even with table growth
mostly innodb is better choice than a myisam
innodb is more concurrent than myisam since it provides row-level locking
innodb -- more effecient than myisam because of the way the primary key is clustered with the data in innodb
you can indeed show that on average quicksort will do more comparisons than heapsort roughly 1.44 n log 2 n for quicksort versus n log 2 n versus heapsort
innodb has more overhead but uses row-level locking so that reads and writes can happen concurrently without the problems that myisam s table locking incurs
rsa is much slower than aes
however heapsort is somewhat slower in practice on most machines than a well-implemented quicksort
am i right that innodb is better for frequent concurrent updates and inserts than myisam
are writers and readers faster than outputstream and inputstream
innodb shouldn t be much slower than myisam
strcpy is notoriously unsafe as are it s cousins strcpy_s and strncpy although they are mildly safer than strcpy
at the beginning the insert performance of innodb is almost 50 times slower than myisam and tokudb is 40 times slower than myisam
1 in mysql engines myisam is better or innodb
their conclusion innodb has 30 higher performance than myisam on average
