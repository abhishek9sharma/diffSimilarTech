1002700
finalize	finalizer
Pattern(s): 5	
if you absolutely must resurrect objects this javaworld article suggests creating a fresh instance rather than resurrecting the instance being finalized because if the instance being finalized becomes eligible for collection again it will simply be collected the finalize won t be run again

1009410
updates	updating
Pattern(s): 0	
so you may need to do a loop that takes only part of the batch at a time but pretty much any number greater than one row at time will be faster than one row at a time this is slower than updating or inserting or deleting the whole batch but faster than row-by row operations and may be needed in a production environment with many users and little available downtime when users are not trying to see and updates other records in the same table


1009863
web-applications	web-services
Pattern(s): 1	
i am inclined to conclude that web-services are very different than web-applications and accept option 1 always stateless but it would be nice to hear other opinions based on real project experience

1018127
http-post	post
Pattern(s): 4	
if this is all just for personal use - then just do what works - but for an application you want others to use i can only recommend http-post and in small batches 2k say

Pattern(s): 5	
instead they should be assigned a default-value just before their use


1018142
vim	emacs

multiplication	exponent
Pattern(s): 7	0	
as int exponent gets larger taking powers might be faster than multiplication


1020038

Pattern(s): 5	
for small bits of code like inner loops it would usually be done with inline-assembly


1020330
order	add
Pattern(s): 5	
order-based lazy declaration works just like functions in c you don t have to declare a method prototype unless you have a dependency that can t be resolved by order but you can add method prototypes inside the implementation if needed


1020708
common-lisp	scheme
Pattern(s): 5	
scheme has continuations for example and it s good to learn about those in scheme even though they can be implemented in common-lisp

Pattern(s): 10	
ie8 on windows-server 2008 is much more stringent with its default security settings


1022029
pointers	stack
Pattern(s): 7	
note that stack grows downwards so stack pointers address gets lower when stack grows.


1022051
backwards-compatibility	compatibility
Pattern(s): 5	
the fact that java method names are inconstant regarding this can be explained by the fact that in earlier versions of java this naming conventions were not yet followed and they cannot be changed for backwards-compatibility reasons


1022814
firebird	mysql
Pattern(s): 8	
and firebird could be embedded in you application and the licensing model is less restrictive than mysql one

1024216
tar	cat
Pattern(s): 7	
many linux commands such as cat cp ls more and tar are locate in bin


1024263
value	field
Pattern(s): 7	
the article you link to points this out as a solution to the seq scan problem if you add range constraints to the date field of each partition this query can be optimized into a loop where you query the latest partition first and work backwards until you find a single value that is higher than the range of all the remaining partitions. --but doesn t show the improved plan you d see after that change


1024827
pointers	stack
Pattern(s): 7	
usually recording the state on a stack takes less space that the call stack as you re selecting only the essential local state to record and are not recording return addresses or any caller-save registers if you used a functor rather than a function pointers then it s more likely that the compiler might be able to inline routine and so not save the caller save registers in the simple recursive case so reducing the amount of stack required for each recursion


1024985
photoshop	fireworks
Pattern(s): 4	
i don t know either of them but i have always worked with fireworks for things as web design as seemingly opposed to a lot of people who prefer photoshop

Pattern(s): 0	
even the embedded text editor i still shiver calling it that was unable to create texts with more than 250 line of text


1026764
words	punctuation
Pattern(s): 1	
there are also potential issues with punctuation or other characters which are neither words nor whitespace characters


1026788
pointers	stack
Pattern(s): 4	
i think you just need to watch your heap and stack usage you can grab pointers to local variables to get an idea of where stack is at the moment and if it s too high reduce it


1026810
argumentexception	argumentnullexception
Pattern(s): 7	
an argumentnullexception would be misleading so argumentexception is a better fit


1027366
braces	curly-braces
Pattern(s): 5	
just because an if statement is normally constructed with curly-braces doesn t mean it must be constructed with curly-braces


1027557
c++	python
Pattern(s): 0	
i realise python is so much more dynamic than c++ it s taken me a while to see how little code you actually need to write


1027808
multiplication	division
Pattern(s): 7	0	
t is not very important as long as alpha is small otherwise you will run into some rather weird nyquist issues aliasing etc. and if you are working on a processor where multiplication is cheaper than division or fixed-point issues are important precalculate omega


1027850
pylons	django
Pattern(s): 0	
i m trying to play devil s advocate since everybody else s recommending django but for a beginner django may in fact be better than pylons still spending a day or so lightly researching each main alternative before you commit to one is a good investment of your time


1028273
contains	elements
Pattern(s): 0	
note that i ve also added a root elements in case your dictionary contains more than one elements and i m guessing that none of the dictionary key values is root


1028518

for more complicated numbers generation needs a sequence object offers more flexibility


1028931
gpl	lgpl

since i want to call the library from within another open-source software with a bsd-ish license i would prefer lgpl over gpl


1029632
ienumerator	ienumerable
Pattern(s): 5	
the basic reason you can t go that direction ienumerator t to a ienumerable t is that ienumerable t represents a set that can be enumerated but ienumerator t is a specific enumeratation over a set of items -- you can t turn the specific instance back into the thing that created it


1030625
var	this
Pattern(s): 5	
your getinstance method could maybe be written like this as well to avoid having the s_instance var


1031629

Pattern(s): 7	
texture width or height is larger than the device supports


1032530
packets	packet
Pattern(s): 1	
the automation part usually involves reading the screen and writing heuristics or algorithms for determining the state but can also be as nice as packets sniffing a lot of information there in poor poker implementations or as hacky as reading memory locations directly


1032563

Pattern(s): 0	
i have worked pretty heavily with both flavors of the gwt extjs libraries though i ve spent more time with gxt recently


1034652
gprof	shark
Pattern(s): 3	
regardless i d strongly recommend using shark instead of gprof - it s very easy to use and superior in pretty much every way to gprof - and doesn t require you to recompile your program


1034902
php	ruby
Pattern(s): 4	
you can still use other ruby-based frameworks if you just like ruby but rails would not be the right choice - and i d probably recommend php since it does well at simple scripts


1035179
scons	cross-compiling
Pattern(s): 10	
scons is better but cross-compiling is not its strong point


1035179
cmake	toolchain
Pattern(s): 0	
cmake s approach is a little more heavywieght with the toolchain file but it means you don t have to specify all of you tools and libraries cc cxx ranlib --with-ibfoo etc as they are figured out from a standard convention


1035457
category	categories
Pattern(s): 0	
adding the methods in same place as the rest of the standard class implementation is easier to understand no hunting to find where the magical code came from and less fragile than using category adding the same method via different category can result in undefined behavior


1035492
libs	subproject
Pattern(s): 0	
depending on the size of the libs you may want to set it up as a distinct target in your project or for even more flexibility as a subproject of your main project


1035642
asp.net-mvc	webforms
Pattern(s): 1	
basically he was saying that asp.net-mvc is not for large-scale enterprise applications that it is not as flexible as webforms and that an mvc app will be slower than a web forms app


1035854
asp.net-mvc	webforms
Pattern(s): 7	
performance - since both asp.net-mvc and webforms use the same asp.net as the core framework and asp.net-mvc is lighter and http compliant it gives you better performance


1036526
focus	virtual-keyboard
Pattern(s): 4	
i want to develop a system virtual-keyboard with swt technology on the platform of powerpc under ubuntu and what the problem i meet is that how to make the shell lose focus when initializing the shell window


1036699
arrays	loops
Pattern(s): 10	
the variant with 0-sized arrays is better because your caller doesn t need to check for null and can process the arrays in a consistent way - say in a loops which would be empty in this case


1037076
operators	conditional
Pattern(s): 0	
i avoid nesting ternary operators or check more than one conditional with them as that makes the code obscure really fast


1037080
swing	swt
Pattern(s): 2	
what criteria should i use to choose between swt and swing


1037130
swing	swt
Pattern(s): 7	
it can be hard to get the layuots exact the way you want in swt it s usually easier in swing


1037134
reflection	runtime
Pattern(s): 5	
when reflection was added to c++ known as runtime type identification or rtti it was hotly debated


1037507
cmake	build-system

1037514
swing	swt
Pattern(s): 2	
my criteria to choose between swt and swing


1037514
swing	swt
Pattern(s): 1	
notice i have only commercial experience with swt on small project and my swing experience is so small that can t be taken seriously - my knowledge is rather theoretical than practical


1037514
swing	swt
Pattern(s): 4	
briefly after my swt eclipse rcp experience - on next project i would choose swing


1037514
swing	swt
Pattern(s): 0	
it api seems for me easier than swt you haven t got to manage disposing components by hand to prevent memory leaks you adding component to panel instead of constructing components with parent panel information former is closer to my previous experience...etc. native look and feel you can get in swing too overall performance is enough good swt should be faster because it s using native components of backed os - but is the performance gain really big pro


1038139
private	instances
Pattern(s): 5	
to add to the kevin s answer your constructor for your class resources should really be made private for it to be a true singleton otherwise nothing is stopping someone from creating a new instances of the resources class through the constructor

Pattern(s): 0	
shorter than margins 0 auto


1038413
space	input
Pattern(s): 0

asp.net	asp.net-mvc
Pattern(s): 1	
i have a really odd issue with asp.net-mvc


1039181
key	key-value
Pattern(s): 5	
the latter is just a bunch of key and values and can be parsed the same way whether for get or post whereas the former requires full mime support and is thus more useful when you have data that can t simply be represented as key-value pairs


1039218
perl	python
Pattern(s): 0	
for something that involves parsing multiple log files formatting the output to a summary status file and sending you an email notification if it notices certain types of events you might be better off with perl or python


1039840

as jeff mentions if you are compiling to any cpu managed code this code can be run on 32-bit or 64bit frameworks


1039840
32-bit	64bit

1044621
loops	nested-loops
Pattern(s): 4	
as a rule predicate pushing makes the optimizer to choose nested-loops instead of hash join


1044884
pylons	django
Pattern(s): 4	0	
i actually prefer pylons because it is much leaner than django but considering you specify enterprise ready i think you might want to hedge toward the larger framework and carry the kitchen sink around with you


1044912
controllers	controller
Pattern(s): 0	
think about it like this if you have more than one controllers accessing a single model then shouldn t common things between them be in a common place as long as that common thing actually has something to do with the model


1044979
order	join
Pattern(s): 5	5	
the first index will be used for order by the second one will be used for join

and i used windows-xp for development and the target os without any isseus


1047997
toupper	tolower

value	field
Pattern(s): 7	7	
see custom field value classes for more details


1049679
getter	setter
Pattern(s): 10

Pattern(s): 5	
if your map is used only on one thread it will make no difference and you should have been using hashmap instead of hashtable anyway


1050080
png	bmp
Pattern(s): 4	
textures use apple s own texture2d class from the samples bmp will work but i recommend png because of the platform optimizations


1050150

Pattern(s): 1	
insert dbi with your appropriate db driver though there are higher level wrappers too such as dbix-class


1050501

we found redmine to be a better than trac simply because it is easier to use


1050665
arrays	map
Pattern(s): 5	
if you stored the results in an arrays it might be called map


1050939
braces	curly-braces
Pattern(s): 1	
oddly msvs has these alternate groups i m not really sure why... with curly-braces


1052188
dictionary	map

it is fine for short-lived messages where you know the same version will be used for serialization and deserialization


1052726
set	any
Pattern(s): 5	
if you just have a stories array controller whose content set isn t bound to anything you ll be creating stories effectively in a vacuum - they won t be linked to any feeds or tags which might be why you re getting these errors

Pattern(s): 4	
before you tell me that i want to do it in python or the like i just want to reiterate why i would choose java


1057958
line	lines
Pattern(s): 10	
if you know that all recurrent entries start at 0 and are contiguous then you joining adjacent line is even more trivial


1059039
height	font-size
Pattern(s): 5	
edit given you want it to change based on font-size this would become necessary you can not explicitly set the height and also want it to auto size the height at the same time edit


1059847
ftp	telnet
Pattern(s): 0	
it is optimized for downloading larger files where the setup overhead is amortized over the size and number of downloads http is very light-weight you can communicate to an http server using telnet much easier than ftp especially before passive ftp and is designed around html -- the concept that in the course of your navigation you will be visiting many different servers and grabbing only a couple of files at a time from each


1060279
loops	nested-loops
Pattern(s): 0	
right now i think it s better than nested-loops but it starts to get perl-one-linerish when you have a generator in a list comprehension


1060568
malloc	free
Pattern(s): 5	
pressing pause while in the vs ide shows that the additional time appears to be spent in malloc free


1060993
nested	order
Pattern(s): 7	
if the tree aspects of this hierarchical data are very important and you have a choice of how to store data consider the nested set model which can maintain order and is much easier to reconstruct a tree


1061205
encoding	encode
Pattern(s): 5	
with that encoding 2 characters will be used to encode each byte from the hash using the symbols 0 through 9 and a through f


1061405
seam	grails
Pattern(s): 1	
anyone who suggests something as heavy as seam or jsf isn t realizing that gwt clients are stateful and you don t need anything outside of the easiest action-request framework you can find which grails currently is


1062178
grouping	aggregate
Pattern(s): 4	
yes in most databases when you have a grouping by clause you can only select aggregate of columns or columns that appear in the grouping by clause

1069300
xsd	xml
Pattern(s): 7	
without going into too much detail we are looking to use xml as meta-data to describe constraints on properties this is a cutdown example and xsd did not support our proposed complex model there are two options being considered which of the following xml strucutures makes better sense

asp.net	asp.net-mvc
Pattern(s): 1	
i m not yet familiar with asp.net-mvc in particular but i have a good knowledge of the mvc pattern


1070079
json	xml
Pattern(s): 0	
json will produce a light-weight file much smaller than xml and should be a bit faster when processing


1070135

testing for equality to true can lead to a bug at least in c in c if can be used on int types not just on boolean types and accept any non-zero value


1070451
having	select
Pattern(s): 4	
i favor having the select being left-most that i will break the justification inner join order by


1070770
elevated-privileges	privileges
Pattern(s): 5	
means that process will be started with elevated-privileges


1071726
arrays	loops
Pattern(s): 10	
the reason that your arrays iterating is faster is that the the number of iteration is constant and compiler is able to unroll loops


1071736
encoding	encode
Pattern(s): 5	
obtain the maximum number of bytes which would be used to encode a character in the given encoding


1071833
json	xml
Pattern(s): 0	
json takes a lot less space than xml although xml compress very well


1071887

1071974
32-bit	64bit
Pattern(s): 5	
does a application in .net need to be built in 64bit to take full advantage of a machine with a 64bit os on it or will it take advantage of it just as a 32-bit build

Pattern(s): 4	
if you choose linux then i suggest going with ubuntu as that has one of the best automatic hardware configuration i have seen


1072922
linux	unix
Pattern(s): 5	10	
to be called unix you have to pass a certification that it conforms to the specification so linux is more precisely called a unix-like operating system


1073467

Pattern(s): 5	
4 if the release works and you would usually perform some testing to check all of your components it s ready to be run in live


1074017
arrays	loops
Pattern(s): 0	
if you already have the arrays of ints there is not quick way to convert you re better off with loops


1074018
checkbox	button
Pattern(s): 10	
for example tri-state checkbox aren t particularly intuitive and providing a drop-down or set of three radio button is more approchable for those less technically inclined


1074061
controllers	controller
Pattern(s): 1	
there seems to be very close coupling between controllers context views view data routing data and the html render methods


1074230

Pattern(s): 3	
i would recommend using argumentexception or argumentnullexception for parameters passed to routines rather then local variables


1075277
png	bmp
Pattern(s): 4	
also note that without compression also image size is just 30kb for rgb image and if you reduce size to 60x60 pixels image size would be only 10kb without any compression i.e you can use bmp images and if you want lesses sizer but lossless compression you can choose png


1077047
pre-increment	post-increment
Pattern(s): 10	8	
as gotw #2 put it pre-increment is more efficient than post-increment because for post-increment the object must increment itself and then return a temporary containing its old value


1077242
perl	awk
Pattern(s): 0	
perl probably would have been a better choice than awk but here goes first we sort the two city names and put the id at the end of the string which i did in the first section


1077411
synchronous	.when
Pattern(s): 5	
my problem is that .when i bind to text and id on this control i want their data to be populated synchronous so that .when a propertychanged event fires on either property both of them have updated data


1077436
boost-python	ctypes
Pattern(s): 0	
in my experience it is much better than boost-python swig or ctypes


1077627
ant	maven

1079613
fadein	show
Pattern(s): 1	
the code i m using to cause the fadein is quite simple as show below


1079716

1079983
java	python
Pattern(s): 7	0	
i know that python is older than java but i can t figure out where does this come from


1080535
nant	msbuild
Pattern(s): 4	
if you prefer nant msbuild or powershell you can use those too.


1080696
multiplication	mod
Pattern(s): 0	
instead of using to do your powers i would do a for loop using multiplication and then taking the mod of the number as you go along by using a conditional to check if the number calculated is greater than the mod


1080708
progress-bar	progress
Pattern(s): 5	
i want to have xhtml+css progress-bar with contrast colors between filled and empty background areas


1080868
version-control	git
Pattern(s): 7	
if you would like to see how git compares to other version-control systems there is no better suited site than this one why git is better than x coincidentally that site s source is on github


1081125
minimized	minimize
Pattern(s): 5	
note that even in this scenario duplication can be removed or minimize by careful care and refactoring of the controllers and models and views of course


1081125
base-class	inherited
Pattern(s): 4	
for instance all the different type of models could inherit a common base-class or implement a common interface the latter might be the better of the two solutions - but it s difficult to say if you should prefer inherited or composition in this case


1081218
cocoa	carbon
Pattern(s): 7	
is there something built into cocoa carbon that s easier than the options above


1082128
cassini	iis

1082145
oracle	mysql
Pattern(s): 4	
i recommend mysql or oracle


1082453
subclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 5	
at any event the above does not give a compilation but rather a runtime error - so a class can be casted to subclassing in some instances otherwise the code would not compile


1083288
asp.net	asp.net-mvc
Pattern(s): 5	
it has a very clean mvc implementation -- playing around with it made it pretty easy to get started with asp.net-mvc when it came along


1083304
double	int
Pattern(s): 5	
it can be stored freely int double etc


1083584
substr	substring

1083597
listener	listeners
Pattern(s): 10	
however the total work listener do is more important


1083610
vba	vb6
Pattern(s): 5

webrequest	webclient
Pattern(s): 8	2	
or if you feel more comfortable with webclient i personnally prefer it over webrequest


1084290
division	exponent
Pattern(s): 5	
it might be more efficient to do repeated integral division than to cast to a float perform an exponent then floor and cast back to an integer but the basic idea remains the same


1084725
.net	wcf
Pattern(s): 10	
given that wcf and .net remoting are not very easily interchangable .net remoting is based on remote objects while wcf is more about document-oriented messaging i wouldn t go to the trouble of rewriting the code to wcf just because .net remoting is no longer considered hot


1084958
c++	python
Pattern(s): 10	
being an expert in both c++ and python my mantra has long been python where i can c++ where i must python is faster in term of programmer productivity and development cycle and easier c++ can give that extra bit of power when i have to get close to the hardware or be extremely careful about every byte or machine cycle i spend


1085114
atomicity	atomic
Pattern(s): 5	
as the msdn article you found indicates read operations when properly aligned can be considered atomicity at all times without further precautions


1085340
perl	php
Pattern(s): 5	5	
i would take the user requests and queue them then have a separate process could be shell php perl anything running as root by cron check this queue check to see if the request fit the allowed parameters and make the changes


1085388

1087549
erlang	ada
Pattern(s): 0	
would erlang compiled using ada be noticably better or worse than the erlang made with c


1087878
java	python
Pattern(s): 4	4	
vice versa if you loathe javascript but must execute some code in the user s browser java s gwt generating the javascript for you from your java-level coding is far richer and more advanced than python-side alternatives in practice if you choose python you ll be writing some js yourself for this purpose while if you choose java gwt is a usable alternative if you loathe writing js


1087878
java	python
Pattern(s): 0	
in terms of libraries it s pretty much a wash -- the jvm is restricted enough no threads no custom class loaders no jni no relational db to hamper the simple reuse of existing java libraries as much or more than existing python libraries are similarly hampered by the similar restrictions on the python runtime


1089090
jlabel	jtree
Pattern(s): 8	
i want to use jtree with more complex elements than jlabel such as


1089158
key	key-value
Pattern(s): 7	
for clustered key this is far worse because the clustered key-value is used as the lookup value on all other non-clustered indexes so it increases the size of all indexes


1089649
.war	war
Pattern(s): 7	
i simply want to keep my content in a separate directory so that my packaged .war is easier to disassemble and diagnose when something doesn t work


1089651
processor	processors
Pattern(s): 0	
i ve used the fftw a fair amount and have found that unless you re going to more than two processor it s almost always a cleaner solution to just use the single threaded version


1090054
32-bit	64bit
Pattern(s): 5	
of course the c version is limited to 32-bit integers which can trivially be changed to 64bit integers if you so desire

if what you re trying to do is to have more than one grid on the page at some point you just need to instantiate a new gridview set the properties including the datasource and databind it


1090393
controllers	controller
Pattern(s): 5	
best practice in mvc is to have your models be stateless the controllers gets to handle state


1090638

1091816
java	python
Pattern(s): 10	
python is much more expressive that java and if you restrict yourself to one class per file which python does not prevent you from doing you will end up with lots of very small files - more to keep track of with very little benefit


1091837
attributes	properties
Pattern(s): 0	
i hope there is an easy way to do it - preferably without decorating the properties with an attributes but if the setup is easier with the attributes i guess that s cool


1091905
value	field
Pattern(s): 7	
to toggle between positive and negative i created an if function so if the float value of my textfield is greater or equal to 0 then an - is inserted but if the float value of my text field is less than zero the - is removed using deletecharactersinrange


1092020
serialization	deserialization
Pattern(s): 7	
the serialization seems quicker but deserialization much slower and the app is doing more deserializing than serializing


1092176
packets	packet
Pattern(s): 5	
if you do it s possible that some of the udp packets will be lost dropped by the network so your code will need a method sequence number in the packet headers to detect lost packets


1092467
linq	linq-to-sql
Pattern(s): 5	
then you can query your repository generate and group your orders determine the best bids and asks and fill out your ordersbycontractids this could be done using linq-to-sql but its a tad bit complicated for this answer

mouse	keyboard
Pattern(s): 4	
the entire taskpane loses keyboard focus to word s main window but retains mouse capture


1095371
model	datamodel
Pattern(s): 7

btw on my simulator setting index greater than 3 throw an error for iphone os 2.x - so i have wrapped this in a try .. catch id .. block - hope this technique helps someone


1096160
contains	any
Pattern(s): 5	
i suspect that you should be fine with alignment issues since your struct contains unsigned chars which can be aligned at any byte so the compiler won t insert any packing between the members but strictly speaking this is implementation dependent so use caution


1096703
internet-explorer	firefox
Pattern(s): 7	0	
because firefox is better than internet-explorer


1096800
php	python
Pattern(s): 5

1099454
ruby	python
Pattern(s): 0	
so i think we can conclude that ruby are not better and likely neither worse than python in this respect


1099593
.when	ready
Pattern(s): 5	
if the data is external such as on a socket or other input device then the handle can generally be set to allow waiting for data to become available - no need to poll in that case since the event will always be signaled .when data is ready for consumption


1099669
swing	awt
Pattern(s): 7	
imho the main reason that they didn t catch on is that they require tended to require too much skill and used awt swing which produces worse uis than what a designer with little programming skills could achieve with flash


1099695
udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 0	
most importantly you can easily supplement udp with some reliable delivery hand-shaking that s less overhead than tcp


1099712
udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 5	
since udp does not involve connection establishment there fore applications like dns where connection establishment delays needs to be avoided udp is preferred over tcp

that line would basically create a 100x100 thumbnail the zc specifies a zoom crop crop to match aspects ratio and the thumbnail library does some pretty nifty caching to reduce server load


1159133
var	this
Pattern(s): 5	
i probably would have found this to be a bigger problem if hadn t had ctrl-shift-v as a shortcut to the var section


1159503

the api will be used in web-services and a client application


1159797
set	any
Pattern(s): 5	
following the pattern set forth by library types such as arraylist which can be initialised from any collection but not an iterable would lead me to use

i m looking for answers or reasons why ado.net is better than ado with regards to data-access when it comes to windows forms applications


1160732
ado	ado.net
Pattern(s): 0	
one of the biggest issues that was able to get people to switch to ado.net at my day job was the fact that ado vb6 flavor is all com you get better performance with ado.net

firefox	safari
Pattern(s): 5	
have tried in safari a couple versions of firefox and ie7 and all look just the way that they are supposed to


1161747
arrays	loops
Pattern(s): 0	
i found that builtin functions are much faster than loops when processing large arrays


1161907
delphi	pascal
Pattern(s): 0	
you probably don t want to go back to anything earlier than delphi 3 but some pascal programming books can be helpful


1162378
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 7	0	
postgresql requires more tuning than mysql to achieve optimal performance


1162395
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 7	0	
postgresql is already slower than mysql up to a certain point it is actually faster when you have a ridiculously large database


1163358
png	gif
Pattern(s): 4	2	
and unless you require animation i d always recommend png over gif


1163376
sublimetext	webstorm

uri	endpoint
Pattern(s): 0	
when you specify more than one endpoint uri any types that share a common schema will be generated once and reused amongst all service contracts


1163578
multiplication	division

i would have expected the division of two long values to result in a long thus removing the decimal part but it resolves it as a double leaving the exact same value after the multiplication


1164146
controllers	controller
Pattern(s): 5	
validator should be decoupled from controllers into separate service layer like for instance showed in this tutorial


1164154

i recommend creating java interfaces to represent the operations that you plan to use along with separately-packaged implementation classes that wrap the python code


1164902
minimized	minimize
Pattern(s): 5	
additionally the number of vms that need to be updated is minimize by virtue of the fact that they re shared


1164906
windows-server	windows
Pattern(s): 3	
i don t know of an automated solution for all of your vms but i would recommend using windows-server update services to keep track of the update status of every vm and provide a local windows update repository to speed up the updating process


1165046
updates	updating
Pattern(s): 4	
i would recommend updating slightly differently as your tblmailinglist user will not be valid to be updates in your repository


1165085
java	python
Pattern(s): 0	
these benchmarks also report the source code size and python was significantly more concise than java and c#


1165762
radio-button	textbox
Pattern(s): 5	
my second problem is when i am selecting particular radio-button that details should be displayed in textbox


1166013
factors	digits
Pattern(s): 7	
the most important factors is that double being implemented as a binary fraction cannot accurately represent many decimal fractions like 0.1 at all and its overall number of digits is smaller since it is 64-bit wide vs


1166365
linq	linq-to-sql
Pattern(s): 5	
local sequence cannot be used in linq-to-sql implementation of query operators except the contains operator


1166746

i would recommend reading datamodel patterns by david c


1166817
login	authentication
Pattern(s): 5	
if they are not authentication they will be redirected to login


1167890
controllers	controller
Pattern(s): 4	
please note that the outputcache is varybyparam and testing out a hardcoded path controllers action does not actually clear the outputcache so it looks like it has to match controllers action param1 param2


1167997
arrays	map
Pattern(s): 0	
also if your enum has a huge number of values jon skeet s map alternative is likely to perform better than any arrays iteration


1168616
multiplication	division
Pattern(s): 0	
this can be a major clock-cycle saver since multiplication is often much faster than a division operation


1168626
windows-xp	windows
Pattern(s): 1	
this behavior isn t new to windows 7 - it s been this way at least as early as windows-xp possibly earlier i don t have access to anything earlier to test


1168889
equals	compareto
Pattern(s): 2	0	
compareto compares values and returns an int which tells if the values compare less than equals or greater than


1168957
ironpython	cpython
Pattern(s): 7	
cpython probably has better ide support at present than ironpython - so this may be a factor in the choosing of one over the other


1169402
glibc	glib
Pattern(s): 0	
when properly engineered these sorts should provide better performance than glib qsort


1169717

for a programming exercise i designed for myself and for use in a pretty non-secure system later on i m trying to compare md5 hash


1170685
visual-studio	sharpdevelop
Pattern(s): 1	
also i d recommend you check out sharpdevelop it is mostly compatible with visual-studio solutions and project files and has built-in support for ironpython projects


1171155
function-pointers	virtual-functions
Pattern(s): 10	8	
impossible to override functions properly so calling them on the base class invokes the one in the container of the base without using function-pointers which is possibly more overhead than virtual-functions


1171541
windows-vista	windows
Pattern(s): 7	
windows-vista has more extended options on the context menu


1172149
packets	packet
Pattern(s): 0

1172381
sorting	filtering
Pattern(s): 7	0	
if your author field is selective and sorting is cheaper than filtering

windows-server	windows
Pattern(s): 4	
i d recommend windows-server 2003 2008 or windows 7


1173674
attributes	properties
Pattern(s): 5	
i would probably stick with a custom attributes but the other potential option would be to do something like hold a static dictionary that had string and properties info or properties name so you could get set the properties directly via this


1174408
input-field	textarea
Pattern(s): 5	
this is true for any webform if you press enter while an input-field has focus the form will be submitted except textarea


1174643
forwarding	port
Pattern(s): 5	
assuming you are accessing the remote machine over the internet the router will need to be configured to forwarding port 8080 to the server


1175041
32-bit	64bit
Pattern(s): 5	
all integer floating point ops will be treated as 64bit values so if your end result relies on 32-bit chunks you will have to compensate for such


1175483
internet-explorer	firefox
Pattern(s): 4	
a 50-line form could kill internet-explorer and at the same time be very usable with opera or firefox


1175946
radio-button	button
Pattern(s): 5	
how do i get selected radio-button in radiogroup


1176300
line	lines
Pattern(s): 0	
keep it simple ideally a unit test should be less than 10 line of code


1176300
line	lines
Pattern(s): 0	
if it grows to much more than 20 line of code you should seriously consider refactoring either the test code or the api you are testing


1176311
.net	wcf
Pattern(s): 5	
we are creating some wcf services that will initially be consumed by .net clients but in the future will be consumed to java clients


1176407
tex	latex
Pattern(s): 1	
i think that maybe i am missing latex but i am not very familliar with tex and latex


1176414
height	width
Pattern(s): 5	
of course this demo is somewhat contrived as we could have animated both height and width in the one animate command


1176580
stdio	fputs
Pattern(s): 5	
is it possible in c c++ to create my own custom stream of type file stdio that can be used with fputs for example


1176623
grid	itemscontrol
Pattern(s): 10	
several other questions on so have come to the same conclusion i have -- using an itemscontrol with a datatemplate for each item constructed to position items such that they resemble a grid is much simpler especially to format than using a listview


1176875
perl	python
Pattern(s): 5	
grass can be customised in python perl ruby.


1177246
height	width
Pattern(s): 7	
the fact that you have height length and width makes it harder than a simple knapsack problem


1177422
stateless	stateful
Pattern(s): 10	8	
do you have any situation where stateful is more appropriate than stateless


1177553
java	python
Pattern(s): 0	
so the standard c python is not necessarily slower than java or c#


1177930
cassini	iis
Pattern(s): 7	
cassini is not actually iis it is more of an emulation


1178602
copy-paste	paste
Pattern(s): 5	
in ie 6 - 8 running on windows xp when you select the non-breaking spaces and copy-paste them they will be copied paste as normal spaces u+0020


1179563
fdt	swc
Pattern(s): 4	
we build the majority of our flash projects in this manner or sort of in reverse where we build the assets in flash professional output a swc of the graphics and use that swc in a better development environment we prefer fdt


1179888
32-bit	64bit
Pattern(s): 0	
i have found that 64bit jvms have been slower than 32-bit versions


1180186

the browser might be mozilla ie opera google-chrome or any other mobiles device such as sonyericssonk610i samsung-sgh-e370 sonyericssont700 or nokian73-1


1180420
keyword	parentheses
Pattern(s): 5	
another difference between functions and language constructs is that some of those can be called without parentheses like a keyword


1180441
java	groovy
Pattern(s): 7	
groovy has slower run-time performance to java in most areas since it is a dynamic language


1180648
icollection	ienumerable
Pattern(s): 7	
the second way i thought is testing for icollection instead of ienumerable since ienumerable is more of a potential collection than an actual one


1180679
api	account
Pattern(s): 5	
for instance the application in this case had a user account tied to a web application so on load the application would initialize the singleton object and when the user signed in it would keep a reference to the user object in the singleton so that user info could be referenced for api calls


1180732
gridview	datalist
Pattern(s): 7	
from what you re describing perhaps a gridview or datalist is a better option


1181468
c++	python
Pattern(s): 10	7	0	
it s likely the c++ code is faster smaller than equivalent python


1181475
c++	python
Pattern(s): 5	
features of c++ such as manual memory management allows for the development of very fast libraries which can then be called from python in order to gain performance


1181505
value	field
Pattern(s): 5	
because a boolean is a value type you cannot set it to null but there are some cases where you d want to like in a data access class because database field can have null value


1181839
height	width
Pattern(s): 0	
you re probably being hit by the borders or margins on the body element -- you re asking for document.width height effectively but putting it in an element with a border so the total width of the page canvas.width+ left right borders is then bigger than the width height you originally asked for


1182321
asp.net	asp.net-mvc
Pattern(s): 7	0	
problem is asp.net-mvc is much younger product than asp.net


1182382
line	lines
Pattern(s): 0	
this will of course change when you draw more than 400 line


1182763
compile-time	hardcode
Pattern(s): 5	1	
the trick about template metaprogramming or generic programming in general is that it allows a lot of computation to be moved to compile-time and it enables flexible parametrized code that is just as efficient as hardcode values


1184093
encoding	decode
Pattern(s): 7	
now there is a png encoder in as3 in the as3corelib and i guess there are even others but probably most people considered it pointless to write a decode since flash does this in its own and also encoding is easier than decoding because decoding means you have to implement the whole format .


1184187
dedicated	dedicated-server
Pattern(s): 7	
for a dedicated-server is it better to store the connection string in web.config or machine.config


1184209
json	xml
Pattern(s): 7	
xml is simply a poor fit for its most common application representing object hierarchies and json is a better fit


1184342
calendar	calendarview
Pattern(s): 1	
it is not as fancy as calendarview but i think i would be great for your scenario


1184933
line	lines
Pattern(s): 5	
if a word must be broken across line a hypen should be inserted prior to the break


1185123
haskell	sml
Pattern(s): 4	2	
i would probably recommend sml over haskell if you feel like trying on a functional language for the first time


1185134
java	python
Pattern(s): 5	
examples of that would be rmi in java python s pyro module etc which will provide some functional parity with dcom


1186109
arrays	dictionary
Pattern(s): 0	
update i understand that programmatically one could put more than one item in the pasteboard using additems as kevin ballard points out or by setting the items property to an arrays containing more than one dictionary


1186146
commit	rollback
Pattern(s): 10	
if your connection stays open after your transaction you might want to issue a rollback or a commit but generally a rollback is less costly in order for your next transaction to execute in a clean state


1186552
lighting	shading
Pattern(s): 5	
would anyone know where i should go for a good introductory tutorial with code on how to have deffered shading with lighting


1186555
blacklist	whitelist
Pattern(s): 5	
if it s easier to blacklist actions by attributing actions for which this logic shouldn t be performed than whitelist actions you could create a suppresswhateverlogic attribute and apply it to the methods you want to be blacklisted


1186560
set	any
Pattern(s): 5	
not sure how popular that is with other windows users but the following set of utilities come in handy and can be used by any editor capable of binding keys functions to commands


1186937
json	xml
Pattern(s): 10	
json is much more faster than xml


1187058
adapter	adaptor
Pattern(s): 0	
even though its not recommended approach still i feel its better than custom adaptor approach


1187807
operators	conditional
Pattern(s): 10	
i ve got what s effectively your makedeepcopy in the copy constructor but without any of the necessary conditional on the calling code because it is a copy constructor and a simple two line assignment operators that is imho more obviously exception safe


1188256
zend-framework	codeigniter
Pattern(s): 5	
update also zend-auth courtesy of the zend-framework is supposed to be very good and can be integrated into codeigniter


1188320
triggers	insert
Pattern(s): 7	
add an on insert triggers which sets sort_order to md5 url


1188845
aspect	aspects
Pattern(s): 5	
this kind of thing could also be handled by aspects oriented programming


1188910
bugzilla	mantis
Pattern(s): 8	
since mantis is a bit more complete than bugzilla when it comes to features you could define separate issues with custom field for your tasks


1189236
controllers	controller
Pattern(s): 5	
the input will be translated into messages and each message will be given to controllers by a method call which can then interpret the message to modify model data or send data over the network as i am hoping to have a networking option


1189635
.war	war
Pattern(s): 0	
i want to do this in one step and be able to deploy more than one .war in a single maven project


1189998
key	key-value
Pattern(s): 7	
one key-value is much easier to understand than one row from a table


1190551
ant	maven
Pattern(s): 7	0	
while i personally think maven is a better tool than ant in the long run our experience will make maven3 a better tool than maven2


1191042
message-passing	transactional-memory
Pattern(s): 5	
obviously not every piece of code can be written as message-passing and shared style which is why kamaelia also has a simple software transactional-memory stm which is a really neat idea with a nasty name - it s more like version control for variables - ie check out some variables update them and commit back


1191410
directory	folder
Pattern(s): 0	
if you think your users technical users will be happier with directory use that but otherwise i would go with folder


1191420
java	python
Pattern(s): 0	
i would like to use this one because it is a python framework i like python more than java but i don t know if they have implemented the advanced features of a web crawler


1191553
linux	unix
Pattern(s): 5	
note as i am not familiar with threads on windows i hope the discussion will be limited to linux unix threads


1191556
getter	setter
Pattern(s): 1	
and it s not possible with setter getter function you have to call setlabel bla from the script


1191603
line	lines
Pattern(s): 0	
now there are at least three serious threading issues in less than 10 line of code here


1191616
order	join
Pattern(s): 10	
at devconnections a few years ago a session on sql server performance stated that a order of outer join does matter and b when a query has a lot of join it will not look at all of them before making a determination on a plan


1191655
process	interprocess
Pattern(s): 7	
also interprocess communications is more work than simple threads


1191798
instances	destroy
Pattern(s): 4	
wmd provides options to create and destroy instances of itself but i have had no luck creating an instance and assigning it to a specific textarea by id or class


1191953
lan	ethernet
Pattern(s): 0	
another interesting variation what if you have 64-bit numbers 8 terabytes worth of data overall say on a bigtable or clone thereof and as many machines as you want each with about 4gb of ram on a pretty fast lan say one that s substantially better than gb ethernet -- how do you shard the problem under those conditions


1192000
subclass	instance-variables
Pattern(s): 7	
say all instance-variables are 32-bit ints for simplicity if the superclass has 3 and the subclass adds 2 more then each instance of the subclass will allocate 5 x 4 20 bytes -- 8 for its own instance-variables plus 12 for the instance-variables of the superclass


1192380
controllers	controller
Pattern(s): 5	
that will be passed to controllers action


1192825
inner-join	join
Pattern(s): 1	
indexes are defiened to the all columns used in the where clause as wll as inner-join


1192983
javascript	dom
Pattern(s): 10	
generally javascript is faster when you search or alter the dom as little as possible


1193641
textbox	listbox
Pattern(s): 5	
the textbox is like a searching textbox where i search for folder s in a particular folder the list of searched folders will be displayed in listbox


1194271
linux	unix
Pattern(s): 5	
my experience is with windows but the same or similar can be done on unix linux


1194708
set	any
Pattern(s): 4	
what you could also do is first see if the file is there and then if it is delete it of course this destroys any special file permissions you had set on it


1194866
opensolaris	freebsd
Pattern(s): 0	
it s easy much easier than installing freebsd or god forbid opensolaris pretty straightforward and the perl and python will be 64 bits out of the box and part of default installation


1194937
maya	3ds
Pattern(s): 8	
i m less familiar with maya but take a look at the 3ds max sdk id 7481355 to see what you can do


1195715
url-encoding	url
Pattern(s): 1	
after base64 encoding the compressed data yes it will expand a bit but not as much as url-encoding expands it


1196834
asp.net	.net
Pattern(s): 5	
wcf or asp.net web api are the only technologies that should be used for .net web services going forward


1197021
json	xml
Pattern(s): 3	0	
if you re storing the points in just an external javascript file then i would recommend using json format over xml as the xml parser that google maps uses is much slower than json


1197021
json	xml
Pattern(s): 0	
i believe it should return a json as i ve discovered it is much quicker than xml parsing


1197085
substr	substring
Pattern(s): 4	
assuming maximum performance is the goal i would ideally choose substring my_field 1 6 and create a function-based index to support the query

paypal	shopping-cart
Pattern(s): 5	
i haven t done any shopping-cart stuff but there are gems out there for integration with paypal and activemerchant


1197324
perl	tcl
Pattern(s): 0	
it is written in tcl which is a language somewhat simpler than perl but broadly in the same family and not difficult to learn


1197869
jogl	lwjgl
Pattern(s): 7	
you are mixing libraries and levels of libraries jogl and lwjgl are both pretty thin wrappers around opengl iirc lwjgl has more wrappers for openal audio


1198115
controllers	controller
Pattern(s): 10	
perhaps it might help if you posted a situation where you were unsure whether or not it was a good idea to split your controllers that is more specific and less cruddy because crud is fairly straight forward


1198169
yourkit	profiler
Pattern(s): 4	
i personally would recommend yourkit java profiler i ve found it much more user-friendly than tptp and while i haven t tested it it should work on os x


1198408
controllers	controller
Pattern(s): 0	
so in mvc the valid email validation from above wouldn t go into a controllers or view because input into that piece of business logic is likely to happen in more than one controllers view and this would require the duplication of the validation logic


1198807
asp.net	asp.net-mvc
Pattern(s): 5	
they will probably be done in asp.net-mvc


1198823
model	datamodel
Pattern(s): 3	
i would highly recommend reading datamodel patterns - conventions of thought by david c


1198872
swing	swt
Pattern(s): 5	
the problem is that jfx script can t be embedded into swing nor eclipse swt


1199916
value	field
Pattern(s): 0	
one problem is general is that field sometimes use delta if there are more than one value for the same field


1200000
asp.net-mvc	webforms
Pattern(s): 5	
side note this has to be done in webforms not asp.net-mvc


1200120
web	web-deployment
Pattern(s): 3	
i also recommend using web-deployment projects


1200232
png	gif
Pattern(s): 0	10	
png compresses much better than gif and allows more colors at the same time


1201136
functional-programming	imperative-programming
Pattern(s): 10	
functional-programming is not more intuitive or easier to learn than imperative-programming


1201337
memmove	memcpy
Pattern(s): 0	
this means that memmove might be very slightly slower than memcpy as it cannot make the same assumptions


1201628
perl	python
Pattern(s): 5	
i have to deploy some web services on a server that only supports the java ones but some of them will be done using perl or python


1201839
value	field
Pattern(s): 5	
so my second option is to make a hierarchy with interfaces and abstract classes meaning that the value will not be stored in field but rather just returned by methods when needed


1201878
builder-pattern	builder
Pattern(s): 3	
i recommend using builder-pattern


1202058
perl	python
Pattern(s): 0	
even more lightweight than the python solution is a perl


1202150
authorization	authentication
Pattern(s): 1	
protocol is usually not as important as authentication authorization and other application-level concerns when talking about application updating


1202227
polymorphism	parametric-polymorphism
Pattern(s): 3	
i would recommend using parametric-polymorphism with one card behaving according to how it has been configured


1202378
x86	32-bit
Pattern(s): 5	
a program must be built with x86 mode if it has unmanaged 32-bit dependencies or if it has managed libraries that are buit in x86


1202603
x86	64bit
Pattern(s): 5	
also note that x86 dlls cannot be loaded on 64bit process


1202758
controllers	controller
Pattern(s): 5	
it may be a better idea to follow mvc model-view-controllers principles where you have one class that knows something about your model database another that knows how to transform the model into objects that will be presented controllers and the third that actually shows the data with all of its css goodness view frequently just a php template file


1204011
http	https
Pattern(s): 5	
however we have a few webservices published that need to be accessed over http - there s some systems in place out in the wild that are using


1204472
feed	feeds
Pattern(s): 5	
i apologize i think we never ever considered that somebody might want to put carriage returns there -- but then it doesn t make any more sense to have form feed there and we do accept that .


1204476
serialization	serializable
Pattern(s): 5	
it must be marked serialization as shown for drag and drop between applications


1204503
swt	look-and-feel
Pattern(s): 10	
of particular interest is swt which has a more platform-native look-and-feel


1204646
show	next
Pattern(s): 5	
i have also noticed that if i manually show it and exit ie the next time it will have remembered its show status


1204830
atomicity	atomic
Pattern(s): 0	
there will be window of vulnerability when updating more than one atomicity variables even though each call to is atomicity


1205110
submission	submit
Pattern(s): 5	
when submission an upload form an alert shows up error form elements must not be named submit


1205428
subquery	in-subquery
Pattern(s): 7	
if the subquery returns more than one row you probably want to use sum in-subquery


1206752
set	any
Pattern(s): 5	
each datagridviewcolumn as a displayindex property which can be applied at any time and even works with autogeneratecolumns set to true


1206871
row	populate
Pattern(s): 5	
in terms then of creating a new row in the database i suppose a new instance of the model would be created populate with data and effectively a save method called


1206950
processor	processors
Pattern(s): 0	
if you look at the fanfare surrounding mysql 5.4 it says now supports more than 4 processor


1207290
http	https
Pattern(s): 0	
you can add basic authentication htaccess to avoid unauthorized people to trigger your script and stronger security by using http


1207519
emma	cobertura
Pattern(s): 7	7	
i find cobertura and emma to be largely interchangeable in terms of coverage checking just that cobertura has a better maven plugin and emma has a better eclipse plugin in my opinion


1207764
grid	itemscontrol
Pattern(s): 5	
is there way for the grid panel to be used with itemscontrol so that there is a single grid to contain all the items


1207858
duplicates	contains
Pattern(s): 5	
i have a subversion repo with directories that contains the usual source-controlled files but in addition to that contains files that are a dependency for execution but not checked into source control and instead added as svn ignore since they would be kept in duplicates all around the repo if they were checked in into all folders


1207955
controllers	controller
Pattern(s): 7	
that separates the user interaction from the controllers and provides for better decoupling between the ui layer and the business layer


1207958
32-bit	16-bit
Pattern(s): 0	
assuming the 16-bit architecture could address sufficient amounts of memory to hold the runtimes either in flash memory or ram. 32-bit values could still be calculated albeit slower than 16-bit and requiring more operations using library code


1208107
javascript	dom
Pattern(s): 7	
this could potentially be a viable option - i still think the dom is the better way but this looks far superior to the standard javascript implementation of regex


1208256
vim	emacs
Pattern(s): 3	
for someone just starting to program would you recommend using vim emacs or should you use some ide


1208693
line	lines
Pattern(s): 0	
the first possibility should be no more than 10-20 line of actionscript code .


1208745
linq	linq-to-sql
Pattern(s): 7	
however i find that linq-to-sql is easier to maintain especially since the dal classes can be regenerated if the database changes


1208808
insertion-sort	bubble-sort
Pattern(s): 0	
even other n sorting algorithms such as insertion-sort tend to have better performance than bubble-sort


1210398
tex	latex
Pattern(s): 0	
i find context approach to tex cleaner than latex but that might just be me


1211119
average	median
Pattern(s): 7	
this is much like removing outliers based on the median ie you re going to need two passes over the data one to find the median - which is almost as slow as sorting for floating point data the other to calculate the average but requires less overhead at the time of working out the average at the cost of maintaining a sorted list


1211981
selection	selected
Pattern(s): 4	
the code below works in safari 4 and will return the node the selection is anchored in where the user started to select selected backwards will return the end instead of the start if you want the element type as a string just get the nodename property of the returned node


1211988
onchange	onload
Pattern(s): 5	
you could also have added onchange code from the onload event


1212460
set	any
Pattern(s): 7	0	
having something which can switch modes at any time is considerably worse as your application now has to deal with more than one set of behaviour too


1213385
category	categories
Pattern(s): 5	
for example in thinqlinq.com site i have posts that can be assigned to category


1213461
subclassing	inherited
Pattern(s): 10	
if this is the only dimension of variation between your subclassing there s no longer a need for inherited here


1213669
asp.net	webforms
Pattern(s): 1	
i ve was always so spoiled with asp.net controls in webforms that i don t know any good practices for this sort of thing


1214032
upgrade	versioning
Pattern(s): 7	
does anyone know if the upcoming v8 versioning is easier to upgrade or if its easier to upgrade from a certain previous versioning compared to earlier versioning


1214058
debian	rpm
Pattern(s): 5	
i m not knowledgeable enough about redhat to know how to install them probably an rpm command and where they will be installed with debian and derivatives put them you have to use -i usr src linux- kernel-version include


1214645
.net	wcf
Pattern(s): 5	
wcf v4 - to be released with .net 4.0 later this year 2009 will include a routingservice class which can be used in scenarios like this


1215229
message	messagebox
Pattern(s): 10	
the way you re using it all it is doing is popping up a confirm messagebox which is much more easily done manually


1215256
asp.net	asp.net-mvc
Pattern(s): 5	
it should be noted that asp.net-mvc is configured out of the box to ignore url requests for files that physically exist on the disk although scott s ignoreroute technique is apparently more efficient


1215669
line	lines
Pattern(s): 4	
i m trying to match line such as and match title and blah in two groups


1216530
linq	linq-to-sql
Pattern(s): 8	
linq to entities is more complicated than linq-to-sql and is designed to make the database tier transparent


1216653
line	lines
Pattern(s): 0	
all of which are less than 20 line and i have a very sparse coding style


1217184
vim	emacs
Pattern(s): 10	
available on almost every platform true of vi vim too of course - whether gui- or text-based java ides are available on most platforms too but only in gui mode and are significantly larger and need to be installed separately whereas emacs is generally more widely available - bsd nix linux mac systems


1217263
dfa	nfa
Pattern(s): 0	
in fact because you are eliminating the redundancy of epsilon transitions many simple dfa s actually get smaller than the nfa they represent but there is simply no way to guarantee that


1217263
space	input
Pattern(s): 0	
your position pointers have to grow with the length of the input and now your algorithm now requires more than constant space to execute


1217441
shell	subshell
Pattern(s): 5	
shells as your default shell and it will be used as subshell in gnu


1217990
tcl	python
Pattern(s): 4	
personally i d recommend tcl since it does regex very well and it s handling of unicode is for all intents and purposes completely transparent -- much better unicode support than python for example


1218115
line	lines
Pattern(s): 4	
here s one that matches line with 8 or fewer pairs of # characters or with an odd number of them


1218116
set	any
Pattern(s): 7	
in perl if you want to remove occurrences of any pattern of your above set that has less than 9 # d# s you can use the following


1218185
subtraction	division
Pattern(s): 7	
subtraction is similar using subtraction of the base type and borrow instead of carry multiplication can be done with repeated additions very slow or cross-products faster and division is trickier but can be done by shifting and subtraction of the numbers involved the long division you would have learned as a kid


1218657
version-control	git
Pattern(s): 5	
git stores ignore patterns using in-tree .gitignore file which can be put under version-control and distributed


1219034
http	https
Pattern(s): 5	
be limited to http using the


1219223
value	field
Pattern(s): 5	
i relise that normally for a from to get and appending querystring params it needs to have hidden form field so i could write a utility function that automatically adds a bunch of hidden form field for any querystring value but i wanted to check that there s wasn t an easier approach or maybe i m going about it the wrong way


1219718
line	lines
Pattern(s): 0	
your methods are less than 50 line and


1219815
line	lines
Pattern(s): 0	
my thoughts are that having separate modules helps with code clarity and later on if by some chance these modules grow to more than 10 line i won t feel so bad about having them separated


1219844
line	lines
Pattern(s): 0	
modules grow to more than 10 line i


1219884
class-members	local-variables
Pattern(s): 4	
another thing that may help is to prefer local-variables over globals or class-members


1221169
set	any
Pattern(s): 5	
your images will be loaded by the browser when the src-attribute is set and can be appended to any html container per normal dom-operations


1221912
g++	gcc
Pattern(s): 5	
your code is c++ so it must be compiled with g++ the c++ compiler not gcc the c compiler

1222388
linq	linq-to-sql
Pattern(s): 5	
can anyone tell me how this would be achieved in linq-to-sql


1222389
platform	target-platform
Pattern(s): 5	
i haven t tried it and it might not work given your target-platform since jmagick uses jni


1222618
erlang	scala
Pattern(s): 1	
i m not familiar with scala but it uses similar principles to erlang s and i feel somewhat comfortable there


1223015
emacs	aquamacs
Pattern(s): 4	
if you have a mac i would recommend aquamacs which is a beginner-friendly version of gnu-emacs and therefore has all the power of emacs while still offering standard copy-paste save and other features including normal file dialogs and windows


1223031
beautifulsoup	lxml
Pattern(s): 1	0	
it s much much faster than beautifulsoup and it even handles broken html better than beautifulsoup their claim to fame - lxml just isn t as vocal about it


1224767
min	max
Pattern(s): 1	
coords within the boxes are defined using a variable number of bits that are are just linear between min and max values depending on the precision needed


1224811
line	lines
Pattern(s): 4	
...do you spot the flaw hint compare line 2 and 4 of that snippet


1224946
marshalling	unmarshalling
Pattern(s): 5	
the documents will then be checked on marshalling and unmarshalling and you won t have to rely on the annotations for validation


1224984
json	xml
Pattern(s): 3	
i also use simplejson quite often because i prefer using json rather than xml


1225655
asp.net	asp.net-mvc
Pattern(s): 5	
there is nothing that can be reused in asp.net-mvc based web site


1226021
alert	message
Pattern(s): 5	
for example p o 1234 should be validated and alert error message


1226840
line	lines
Pattern(s): 3	
i d recommend removing line 17-23 and replacing them with a simple statement


1227399
tree	children
Pattern(s): 5	
i m creating a tree of categories with parentid s which can be called from children in such a way


1227660
inner-join	join
Pattern(s): 10	
for example your complete solution may be as follows i m using left outer join because you did so i m not sure it s the right way maybe inner-join is more suitable


1227817
sorting	filtering
Pattern(s): 0	
so it needs more functionality than filtering and sorting


1228038
put	get
Pattern(s): 5	
if you ve never used xaml and you ve got a sort timeline to get this thing done you best be prepared to put in some extra time or be okay with a less than stellar look and feel


1229412
height	frame
Pattern(s): 0	
the contentsize height seems to be always equal or greater than the height of the scrollview frame but never smaller


1230116
asp.net-mvc	webforms
Pattern(s): 7	
basically webforms give you less control more overhead and rapid development time while asp.net-mvc gives you more control less overhead and takes more time to develop


1230132
enumerator	any
Pattern(s): 5	
this could be implemented by any container that supports efficient reverse enumerator


1230528
height	width
Pattern(s): 0	
so how can i determine a smaller width and height to which i will resize the watermark image something much less than 150 width 20 height so that it will appear still as a watermark and wont mask the image completely


1230787
sql-server	mysql
Pattern(s): 10	
or maybe the use of udf s on sql-server is more prevalent and the mysql engine s optimizer simply hasn t evolved as far yet


1230839
synchronous	.when
Pattern(s): 5	
it needs to be done synchronous because the case is opened immediately .when it s created from an activity


1231147
8bit	16-bit
Pattern(s): 1	
ignore dinosaur platforms with 8bit or 16-bit architectures


1231309
alert	message
Pattern(s): 5	
for example p o 1234 should be validated and alert error message


1231384
web-applications	gwt
Pattern(s): 7	
gwt makes it easier for gmail-type applications eg web-applications which mimic desktop application functionality


1231384
asp.net	asp.net-mvc
Pattern(s): 7	
on the other side asp.net-mvc is easier for dynamic sites


1231670
line	lines
Pattern(s): 0	
judging from the technical debt as seen on the nemo sonar instance spring batch has the lowest debt line ratio for projects larger than 10k lines of code


1232018
line	lines
Pattern(s): 0	
this whole thing should be less than 100 line of code aside from communications with the c program


1232044
trace	profiling
Pattern(s): 10	
as you say the answer depends on what are your needs but if you need to use only one or two features only there is not point paying for all.for example if you are going to use only profiling it is less expensive to buy a tool that like red gate s dot trace


1232371
.net	asp.net-mvc
Pattern(s): 10	10	
.net asp.net-mvc is really more like the ruby on rails framework than struts but you should find it pretty easy to pick up if you know struts as well


1232578
asp.net	asp.net-mvc
Pattern(s): 5	
disclaimer i haven t done much asp.net-mvc programming


1233149
alert	message
Pattern(s): 5	
for example p o 1234 should be validated and alert error message


1233153
line	lines
Pattern(s): 4	
i need to compare line in a file


1233327
loops	nested-loops
Pattern(s): 5	
if the answer to this is that it could be written without nested-loops what is it in the model or the linq query that is causing it


1233467
svn	revision
Pattern(s): 0	
if you have it already setup and you are a primarily ms based network sharepoint makes a lot of sense and can handle revision control for the ms based documentation much better than svn


1233693
internet-explorer	firefox
Pattern(s): 0	
internet-explorer doesn t use the mozilla engine so it is considerably slower than firefox


1233693
google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 7	0	
firefox is slower than google-chrome which boats one of the highest javascript engines a modified version of webkit


1234322
line	lines
Pattern(s): 8	
that s much more important than line of code per catch block


1234566
line	lines
Pattern(s): 0	
it is more than 100 line but not by much


1234863
core-animation	uikit
Pattern(s): 0	
does opengl es have a better performance than core-animation and uikit when it comes to highly animated user interfaces


1235077
extends	implements
Pattern(s): 1	
by the way extends thread is not generally as good as implements runnable for quite a few reasons


1235147
getter	setter
Pattern(s): 5	
not all languages have properties java only has fields that must be accessed by getter and setter


1235266
ant	maven
Pattern(s): 1	
an additional path for those not so keen on maven unable to port or perfectly happy with ant ivy


1235385
ruby	python
Pattern(s): 0	
python - good language strategically a better choice than ruby although there are other aspects of ruby that can be argued to be superior


1236402
throw	throws
Pattern(s): 5	
but it won t be compiled and throw an error


1236405
cell	cells
Pattern(s): 0	
if you add dynamic entities and have the temporary entity i mentioned above you can actually discard invisible dynamic entities automatically once you have a method to figure out which cells are visible and which not if a cell is invisible its associated dynamic entity will also be invisible but beware an entity can touch more than one cell


1236405
cell	cells
Pattern(s): 0	
just make sure your maps will never have an area with empty space that can see more than 16 cell or whatever you decide


1236458
mouse	click
Pattern(s): 10	10	
maybe the hoverintent plugin can be made to work but i think just using the mouse click is a more elegant solution


1236714
callable-statement	jdbc
Pattern(s): 3	
update if you do decide to go forward with calling stored procedure via jdbc i would strongly recommend using callable-statement to invoke it


1236798
packets	packet
Pattern(s): 4	
in your post you mentioned that it use libpcap to grab packets but as i know libpcap will just get a copy of the incoming packet and then that packet will still pass into the normal kernel stack path and that may be not what you want


1236826
subtract	multiplying
Pattern(s): 0	
if the parameter is greater than 0.5 multiplying lambda by two and subtract one this maps onto and return the interpolated color between color b and color c


1238339
login	access-token
Pattern(s): 5	
in which case your application would be a consumer - in short the user would need to login and agree to authorizing your application to have access to the their data on the provider and you would be given an access-token which can be used to gain access to those protected resources


1238679
listbox	selected
Pattern(s): 5	
in this case i need product.id 1 to be shown selected in the listbox


1238849
google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 1	0	7	
the trouble is choosing a good value for x since for this particular page google-chrome is so very much faster than firefox which is faster than ie


1239435
line	lines
Pattern(s): 4	
best way to achieve it is to use log_min_duration_statement with value of 0 and using log_line_prefix such that is it will include information required to match line coming form the same backend


1239437
linq	linq-to-sql
Pattern(s): 5	
yes it can be done with linq-to-sql as bdukes and pcampbell has shown but it can be done with nhibernate as well


1239656
linq	linq-to-sql
Pattern(s): 7	
linq-to-sql is a smaller and simpler framework than entity framework but it has some nice features and is quite easy to get started with


1240253
set	any
Pattern(s): 0	
you set a z-index that is higher than any other div in that spot


1240515
line	lines
Pattern(s): 4	
if you wish to match line beginning with the word stop followed by a space


1240515
line	lines
Pattern(s): 4	
or if you wish to match line beginning with the word stop but followed by either a space or any other non word character you can use your regex flavor permitting


1240875
output	spaces
Pattern(s): 7	
however if you restrict the search spaces to for example common passwords with length under n you might no longer have the irreversibility property because the number of md5 output is much greater than the number of strings in the domain of interest


1240910
line	lines
Pattern(s): 7	
if that line ends up more than a couple of lines away from the top of the function it ll be confusing


1241726
var	this
Pattern(s): 5	
i ve just decided to venture off into php land for fun and to learn reading that php is loosely typed and that var s can be reused is this true that the code below will pose no problem


1242041
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 1	
if you are worried about the cost of purchasing a database there are very good proven open source databases out there such as mysql and postgresql that won t cost you anything


1242395
nant	continuous-integration
Pattern(s): 5	
while i am not sure about tfs i do know that it supports nant and msbuild scripts which can be utilized for continuous-integration


1242684
nhibernate	entity-framework
Pattern(s): 8	
is the entity-framework more efficient than nhibernate when used with visual studio


1242771
arrays	loops
Pattern(s): 5	
this new style for loops can be used with arrays as well


1243066
request	http-request
Pattern(s): 5	
i appreciate the app could be pull based http-request response style but ideally i don t want to be polling that heavily just to check for notification


1243200
derived-class	base-class
Pattern(s): 10	
it seems to me that implementing the interface on the base-class makes it less obvious that the derived-class implements the interface but then again requires the interface to be specified for each derived-class


1243231
selection	selected
Pattern(s): 5	
this is done in eclipse by creating a project for abstracttablemodel and selected it in the select types for which javadoc will be generated selection during javadoc generation


1243415
json	xml
Pattern(s): 7	
json is much easier to work with than xml in my opinion and json_encode decode is very fast so there s little overhead


1243427
backwards-compatibility	compatibility
Pattern(s): 4	
however you will lose backwards-compatibility with python json requires version 2.6+


1243852
sorted	lookup
Pattern(s): 5	
that way you could have the data sorted with a tree traversal and you could have fast lookup too


1244064
sql-server	mysql
Pattern(s): 1	
i m not familiar with mysql but the above would work in sql-server


1244354
element	document
Pattern(s): 0	
xsd s allow you much tighter control over document content and i m pretty sure that restricting the number of occurrences of a particular child element in a mixed type complex element is possible even easy using an xsd


1245244
asp.net	asp.net-mvc
Pattern(s): 0	
i think you should start with an architecture similar to nerddinner and refactor after you become more familiar with how asp.net-mvc works


1245675
asp.net	asp.net-mvc
Pattern(s): 1	
but until you re well familiar with asp.net-mvc i would recommend sticking with the basic view engine - it s easiest to find help and samples for that


1246904
firefox	safari
Pattern(s): 5	
support for older versions of firefox is a lot trickier since any workaround you created would need to be hidden from safari


1247150
key	key-value
Pattern(s): 5	
in your example i think you try to do an associative array and you should use object array is not meant to be used for key-value pairs


1247476
average	median
Pattern(s): 4	
i want to compare median to average for each group city


1247563
keyword	operators
Pattern(s): 0	
the reason for this is that without the template keyword the compiler assumes that bar is a value and you wish to invoke the less than operators on it


1247937
asp.net-mvc	webforms
Pattern(s): 7	0	
i can t feel that how asp.net-mvc is better than webforms


1248100
keydown	keyup
Pattern(s): 0	
i finally figured out that keypress has a better compatibility than keydown or keyup on linux platform


1248671
value	field
Pattern(s): 0	
when you store more than one value in a field it s almost always some problems accessing the data


1248799
set	any
Pattern(s): 5	
some styles are inherited so if you for example apply a font-size to the body element that would be inherited by any elements that doesn t already have a specific font-size set


1249393
unmanaged	c++-cli
Pattern(s): 1	
c++-cli is a bit clunky because it contains language constructs for managed and for unmanaged programming but if you re already familiar with unmanaged c++ and c# you probably won t have any problems understanding it.


1249425
cell	cells
Pattern(s): 0	
twice as wide twice as long four times the memory excepting smaller distances between the cell


1249443
show	next
Pattern(s): 5	
the div .showarea is the div which needs to be rotated next prev but i want to keep only one div show at a time.


1249750
iostream	boost
Pattern(s): 5	
could this be done with boost iostream combination or boost iostream copy perhaps


1250133
set	any
Pattern(s): 5

1250391
asp.net	.net
Pattern(s): 5	
this site is will be hosted on server which has .net 3.0 installed and in iis asp.net 2.0 would be selected under asp.net tab


1250522
stl	boost
Pattern(s): 1	
qt does have a good collection of containers but i am greatly familiar with stl boost stuff


1250795
c++	python
Pattern(s): 1	
c++ is as slow as python and 6 times slower than java


1250937
ruby-on-rails	django

and web2py is more lightweight than django ruby-on-rails whatever on pretty much all counts


1252126
jsf	seam
Pattern(s): 10	
jsf is a web ui framework whereas seam is a more general web application framework that integrates not just jsf but conversational contexts workflow jbpm and object persistance preferably ejb3


1253013
haskell	scala
Pattern(s): 10	
i think the reason scala requires the type annotation on the parameters of a newly defined function comes from the fact that scala uses a more local type inference analysis than that used in haskell


1253269
json	xml
Pattern(s): 5	
the dashboard will just display charts and tables which can be fed by json xml etc


1253366
jsf	seam
Pattern(s): 7	
seam certainly is far better than using plain jsf refer the link posted by damo a couple of answers above


1253813
serialization	marshalling
Pattern(s): 5	
the marshalling module can be used to serialization code objects which can then be reassembled into a function


1253898
asp.net-mvc	webforms
Pattern(s): 5	
asp.net-mvc and webforms can live side-by-side in the same app so could new pages sections simply be developed using asp.net-mvc if that s the route you want


1254117
value	field
Pattern(s): 7	
will select all field from tablex where somevariable x and the weekdifference variable value is greater than or equal to the recurrencetemp variable value


1254130
packets	packet
Pattern(s): 7	
it s nice in that the overall data packets size is smaller but it makes it interesting when working with frameworks that all expect the same format


1254650
32-bit	64bit
Pattern(s): 0	
why would 32-bit be faster than the 64bit for a development box and vice versa for servers


1254667
32-bit	64bit
Pattern(s): 4	
however if you are using your main os to host vms then you can probably benefit from a ton of memory for your various virtuals - and then you can choose 32-bit and 64bit vms to suit your needs it is harder to have a 64bit guest vm in a 32-bit host


1254692
32-bit	64bit
Pattern(s): 4	
the only reason i can think of to choose 32-bit os is that you know that what you develop will work on 32-bit and 64bit machines


1254726
zsh	bash
Pattern(s): 0	
how can you get similar highlightings to zsh s less than bash s less in ubuntu


1255104
asp.net-mvc	webforms
Pattern(s): 10	
there are some things that asp.net-mvc does better and some things that webforms do better but if you don t know both technologies you can t choose the best one for the current project you are doing so please don t do yourself a disservice - go and learn asp.net-mvc


1255747
project	project-management
Pattern(s): 10	
i think the real problem with traditional project-management is that more often than not it doesn t really exist


1256300
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 5	
where of course a for-loops can be substituted to loops over a b c ... and a small part can be memoized


1256393
json	xml
Pattern(s): 5	
all you have to document is the data types that will be used xml formats json etc.


1256757
contains	elements
Pattern(s): 0

1257020
json	xml
Pattern(s): 2	
i prefer amf over xml or json


1257311
http	https
Pattern(s): 10	
basic auth over http is more secure and it should work with your hashed password


1257952
dictionary	map
Pattern(s): 10	
though if you are going to eventually fill a substantial portion of the map the dictionary method is much less efficient


1258131
ado	ado.net
Pattern(s): 5	1	
on the other hand oledb can be used via ado from c++ and that you might find very comfortable coming from ado.net although there serious differences between ado and ado.net


1258708
strcpy	strncpy
Pattern(s): 7	0	
strncpy is not safer than strcpy it just trades one type of bugs with another


1258971
strcpy	strncpy
Pattern(s): 8	
my personal opinion is that it is vastly more useful than strncpy and strcpy


1258982
cucumber	webrat

if you need this path in external programs for build eclipse has internal variables that can be used for ant maven etc.


1260442
linq	linq-to-sql
Pattern(s): 8	
therefore book writers were more familiar with linq-to-sql and or felt it was more stable


1260512
sorted	lookup
Pattern(s): 10	
a balanced binary tree also has o log n lookup performance however it is much faster to update also around o log n while a sorted list is more like o n for updates o log n to find the position for insert or the element to delete but then up to n elements must be moved within the list and this is o n


1261275
required	checked
Pattern(s): 0	
mac os x comes with one out of the box which required nothing more than checked a box in system preferences. setting up such a server for development would let you view the site at and might resolve this relative links problem


1261355
derived-class	base-class
Pattern(s): 10	
the behaviour of a derived-class is more specific than that of a base-class and covariance expresses one aspect of the difference


1261364
feed	feeds
Pattern(s): 0	
i am scraping a list of rss feeds by using curl - look at the xml from the rss feed that s giving the problem there s more than one feed so it s possible for some feeds to be right and for the feeds that are wrong to be wrong in different ways


1261449
cross-join	join
Pattern(s): 5	
i am not shure why si that but from peopletable p jobtable j can be replaced with cross-join


1261500
serialization	deserialization
Pattern(s): 0	
you can use the javascriptconverter class when you need more control over the serialization and deserialization process


1261695
selection	cells
Pattern(s): 4	
have the users select cells and then click the button to change the .colorindex property of the selection to the button s .colorindex


1262196
order	join
Pattern(s): 5	
often times the order you list tables is dictated to you you start from tablea and you need to list tableb first in order to have access to columns required to join in tablec


1262378
derived-class	base-class
Pattern(s): 0	
still not pretty but might appeal to you a little more than putting derived-class names in the base-class


1263668
version-control	git
Pattern(s): 4	
as others have mentioned a version-control system i prefer git but subversion will also work and some form of communication


1263822
asp.net	asp.net-mvc
Pattern(s): 5	
if you decide to take the json.net plunge you ll also want to grab jsonnetresult as it returns an actionresult that can be used in asp.net-mvc application


1264385
32-bit	64bit
Pattern(s): 5	
since that code is and ing the 64-bit variable j with the 32-bit result of a bit-shift the result will be expanded to 64bit by the compiler


1264429
cell	cells
Pattern(s): 0	
i have built an app which has the ability to delete cell from a table but only if there are more than two cell


1264750
cross-site	whitelist
Pattern(s): 1	
the issue of cross-site scripting can be mitigated quite good with whitelist


1265217
fluid	960.gs
Pattern(s): 4	
i prefer fluid version of 960.gs fluid 960 grid system


1265428
set	any
Pattern(s): 5	
the configuration can be defined in a parent project and will be inherited by all the child projects if you do this avoid declaring any files as they won t be discovered only set the filepaths property


1266067
perl	php
Pattern(s): 4	
however what you could do is learn ajax - if you don t know it yet - and create a script php asp perl ssi etc. that counts the files in the directory and prints the number - i recommend perl -


1266609
arrays	dictionary
Pattern(s): 5	
it must have the overall general behaviour of a cocoa object when using cocoa so that it can be added to arrays used as keys to a dictionary etc except in regards to its memory management since it was allocated differently


1267481
java	scala
Pattern(s): 1	
scala is a functional programming language that is fully compatible with java runs through the jvm


1267852
thin	webrick
Pattern(s): 7	0	
from my experience webrick is slower than mongrel is slower than thin


1268518
icollection	ienumerable
Pattern(s): 8	
secondly i did not use ienumerable because it is more generic than icollection and does not even have simple properties like count


1268983
abstract	sealed
Pattern(s): 5	
this msdn article states that static classes should be declared as sealed and abstract


1269365
zero	digits
Pattern(s): 4	
note that the regular expression d will match zero or more digits - this includes the empty string since this is exactly zero digits

c++	python
Pattern(s): 7	0	
surprisingly the c++ version runs significantly slower than the python version


1270393
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 10	
postgresql supports some more security features than mysql for example integration with gssapi or kerberos for logins last i checked mysql didn t have these


1270393
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 7	
traditionally postgresql has had fewer security issues than mysql but they are both doing very well on that


1271920
line	lines
Pattern(s): 0	
shouldn t be more than 5-6 line


1272372
asp.net	.net
Pattern(s): 4	
if you choose asp.net defently go for the new mvc framework and you will also learn about the .net framework and c# unless you choose another language of course


1272372
asp.net	asp.net-mvc
Pattern(s): 4	
so i would recommend asp.net-mvc


1272381
asp.net	asp.net-mvc
Pattern(s): 4	
i prefer asp.net-mvc but have found that it s so loosely coupled that you need to really learn a bunch of stuff to build something using a proper stack with best practices


1272382
32-bit	64bit
Pattern(s): 5	
when performing pointer arithmetic these types should also be used in 32-bit code that needs to be compatible with 64bit


1272492
java	scala
Pattern(s): 0	
scala collections are far richer than their java counterparts but most java frameworks are unable to use them


1272572
yii	codeigniter
Pattern(s): 4	
for php i would recommend yii cakephp or codeigniter .


1272575
serialization	serializable
Pattern(s): 5	
all classes that inherit from the base class will also be marked as serialization


1272691
ruby-on-rails	grails
Pattern(s): 2	
in terms of development speed i would say that there is not much to choose between ruby-on-rails and grails as both allow similarly rapid development


1273001
iteration	elements
Pattern(s): 7	
with java iterator s i have used the hasnext method to determine whether an iteration has more elements without consuming an element -- thus hasnext is like a peek method


1273702
twitter	gmail
Pattern(s): 5	
i can be reached on twitter via or email via rory nothinggoeshere becker gmail . com


1273746
var	this
Pattern(s): 10	
this is less common for me because i only use var to shorten very long declarations and ulong is the opposite


1273837
version-control	git
Pattern(s): 5	
it could be combined with git version-control for better interaction


1274226
development-environment	continuous-integration
Pattern(s): 0	
continuous-integration is extremely helpful when you have to integrate changes into a codebase from more than one development-environment and it s pretty tough to automate builds when you re tied to a gui


1274226
myeclipse	maven
Pattern(s): 7	
from my initial research it looks like maven myeclipse integration is even worse


1274732
silverlight	wpf

1277773
oracle	mysql
Pattern(s): 10	
third oracle s version of sql is much differnt from mysql and the administration of oracle databases is much more complex

opera	firefox
Pattern(s): 0	
for example i ve read that opera and ie will fix framerates slower than firefox


1278516
ado.net	entity-framework
Pattern(s): 0	
the learning curve for linq to sql may be slightly less steep than for ado.net entity-framework


1278693
linq	linq-to-sql
Pattern(s): 8	
another interesting point i have found is that linq-to-sql tends to write much more efficient sql than linq to entities just something to keep in mind


1278923
configuration-files	config
Pattern(s): 4	
if you want to select configuration-files based on the url i would just identify the call stack that leads to this function and pass in either an enum value or the config file s name directly


1279818
ruby	python
Pattern(s): 10	
he also points out that python is faster than ruby


1279846
java	scala
Pattern(s): 0	
scala uses jvm as a backend and thus is not going to be any faster than java - and if you use higher-level abstractions it will most likely be slower somewhat but probably in the same ballpark


1281097
reverse-engineering	obfuscation
Pattern(s): 10	
running your application through an obfuscation makes reverse-engineering more difficult and costly


1281309
extend	methods
Pattern(s): 5	
i might be inclined to extend or otherwise wrap contentvalue with a class that offers that methods hence making the code reusable


1281883
c++	python
Pattern(s): 5	
it can be integrated to c++ also very easily and conveniently using the boost python c++ binding for the python c api


1282051
braces	curly-braces
Pattern(s): 5	
declarations which contains a single expression are expected not to be enclosed inside curly-braces unless other syntactic considerations make that impossible

line	lines
Pattern(s): 4	
you will match line containing one and only one among that list


1282215
32-bit	64bit
Pattern(s): 1	
64bit systems can process data in chunks twice as large as 32-bit which helps some operations go more quickly


1282403
c++	lua
Pattern(s): 5	
i like to use languages that are specifically made to be embedded in c++ or c like lua falcon or chaiscript


1282528
var	this
Pattern(s): 4	
the code beneath works great but the problem is that the code is designed to compare var a with var b this is a bottleneck because it s a 1 on 1 action


1283195
xdebug	xhprof
Pattern(s): 0	
thanks mikushi for the comment another possibility that i haven t used much is the the xhprof extension it also helps with profiling can generate callgraphs -- but is lighter than xdebug which mean you should be able to install it on a production server


1283603
http	https
Pattern(s): 5	
if it is an option make it only be transmitted with http data


1283886
32-bit	64bit
Pattern(s): 0	
the drawback is that a 64bit cpu with everything equal would consume more power than a 32-bit cpu just due to roughly twice the amount of circuitry needed


1284456
private-members	object
Pattern(s): 5	
for example the results could be assigned to private-members of the thread object and guarded with a flag that is atomically by the thread to say it is done


1284770
controllers	controller
Pattern(s): 5	
normally in the mvc pattern when a user clicks on a page the request would be sent then controllers would handle the request then process it using the model and route it to the appropriate view


1284781
haskell	scala
Pattern(s): 7	
scala unfortunately has neither of these properties and so cannot provide a full equivalent to haskell s where clause


1285253
constructor	object
Pattern(s): 10	
the downside with constructor injection is that the configuration of your object graph is more complicated


1285323
sql-server	mysql
Pattern(s): 0	
you will likely get a lot more assistance with sql-server and access in the newsgroups and such than you would with mysql


1285341
isapi-rewrite	isapi
Pattern(s): 4	
i personally prefer isapi-rewrite as it is much better simpler to write rules and has more features


1285733
lossless-compression	lossless
Pattern(s): 7	
however you are probably wasting your time since you will hardly find any lossless-compression that does more than a 1-10 size reduction


1285935
vba	vb6
Pattern(s): 5	
and can someone please provide some resources or sample codes that i can learn on how to properly write a .net dll which has functions with parameters that can be called from vb6 vba app


1285946
viewwillappear	viewdidload
Pattern(s): 5	
one case for doing this in init is that viewdidload can be called after viewwillappear


1285977
subclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 5	
i also can t have entrydailyavg subclassing entry as django will save a new entry base every time i save a new entrydailyavg


1287931
forward-compatibility	compatibility
Pattern(s): 7	
perhaps the subject was forward-compatibility which makes things easier if you have it but require forethought and some luck vs


1287964
lighting	shading

this is just an overview of the most simple way to do this there are many more details that will make this look much better such as shading with a lighting source to get the bump appearance


1289276
ruby	python
Pattern(s): 5	
besides the cocoa frameworks--which can be used from python via the built-in pyobjc bridge ruby via macruby or rubycocoa -there are a number of other options


1289978
c++	python
Pattern(s): 4	
regarding the language if given the choice between c++ and python i would pick python 100 of the time


1289978
c++	python
Pattern(s): 7	
even ignoring the obvious difference in abstraction between those languages python simply has more useful libraries than c++


1290888
gas	intel-syntax
Pattern(s): 1	
you can have gas work perfectly fine with intel-syntax by putting the following line at the top of your source file

set	hashtable
Pattern(s): 0	
word existence could be done with a trie or more simply with a set a hashtable


1293433

Pattern(s): 0	
the single-threaded application model requires that no single object live in more than one sta thread at a time verses the mta thread model


1293440
delphi	c++
Pattern(s): 10	
doesn t mean that delphi or c++ is more powerful than .net since .net is gaining quickly on the gui application level


1293769
md5	hash
Pattern(s): 7	7	
the md5 hash is no smaller than the uuid so it doesn t help with storage


1293893
delphi	basic
Pattern(s): 8	
i also made it clear that visual basic would be less powerful than delphi since delphi had much better database-aware components


1293916
jsf	stripes
Pattern(s): 4	
but if you do decide on using a framework from my experience of having used stripes struts1 and jsf myfaces recommend stripes without hesitation


1295083
asp.net	asp.net-mvc
Pattern(s): 5	
asp.net controls cannot be used in asp.net-mvc


1295425
mouse	keyboard
Pattern(s): 10	
i prefer the command line because i have a shell window open in the source anyway to run builds and tests and along with file name completion using the keyboard is faster than using the mouse for me


1295440
upgrade	versioning
Pattern(s): 5	
can be called to upgrade your settings from the previous versioning


1295693
height	width
Pattern(s): 5

net.tcp	nettcpbinding
Pattern(s): 4	
in that case i would recommend net.tcp binding with on both ends


1296552
oracle	postgresql
Pattern(s): 1	
i have too little experience with postgresql or oracle to judge so i will just stick with not recommending mysql


1296846
entity	poco
Pattern(s): 5	
i personally prefer to write classes that can themselves be persisted poco rather than deal with a separate data entity model


1298285
width	display
Pattern(s): 5	
i suspect this is due to the display block in the li elements but they need to have fixed width height is there a way around this


1299025
linq	linq-to-sql
Pattern(s): 1	
i am usually using linq to entities and have not much experience with linq-to-sql


1300367
atomicity	atomic
Pattern(s): 5	
basically all types that the database system itself offers like numeric varchar etc. or that the programming language of choice offers int string etc. would be considered atomicity data base types


1300479
php	python
Pattern(s): 1	
i d like to try and do this in python even though i could it in php in half the time this is because i dont know anywhere near as much python as php


1300489
blackberry	blackberry-simulator
Pattern(s): 2	
when i select run as blackberry-simulator it works as expected


1300518
php	ruby
Pattern(s): 4	
i happen to know all three php java and ruby and have written many applications in all of them plus others but i drastically prefer ruby


1300633
ruby	python

Pattern(s): 0	
this will force the browser to display a scrollbar when the contents of the inner table are larger than the height of the surrounding


1301089
scrollbars	scrollbar
Pattern(s): 5	
this may be difficult to get exactly right because some users may have set their scrollbar to be wider or smaller than the default


1301132
account	credentials
Pattern(s): 7	
the built-in network service user account has fewer access privileges on the system than the localsystem user account but the network service user account is still able to interact throughout the network with the credentials of the computer account


1301557
base-class	subclassing
Pattern(s): 5	
the leading-underscore convention is widely used not just for private names but also for what c++ would call protected ones -- for example names of methods that are fully intended to be overridden by subclassing even ones that have to be overridden since in the base-class they raise notimplementederror


1301588
int	primitive
Pattern(s): 5	
is there an expandable array class in the java api equivalent to the vector or arraylist class that can be used with primitive int char double etc

i think this type of thing could be achieved on linux unix using the setfacl getfacl commands but i m unsure on how to do this with os x


1303019
controllers	controller
Pattern(s): 0	
the truth is you never actually need more than one controllers


1303151
language-features	operators
Pattern(s): 5	
operators should be considered language-features and not expected to translate well between different languages


1303244
32-bit	64bit
Pattern(s): 0	
what all this means is that a 64bit computer can store and retrieve much more information than a 32-bit computer


1303437
mousedown	mouseup
Pattern(s): 1	
i ve read in some other places that using a different mouse event can work as well such as mouseup or mousedown


1303827

my workmate claims that for object types pre-increment is more efficient than post-increment


1303958
serialization	serializable
Pattern(s): 0	
i guess the word serialization is throwing me off more than serialization object


1304309
stax	sax
Pattern(s): 0	
if so you just need a streaming api such as stax or sax - stax will probably make this significantly easier than sax but it isn t built into java 1.4 so you d need an extra dependency


1306118
execution	jobs
Pattern(s): 0	
my problem is that using the thread pool and 4 threads is much slower than doing the jobs sequentially having one loop executed by a separate thread is much slower than execution it directly in the main thread sequentially


1306488
report	subreport
Pattern(s): 4	
to add the subreport you simply choose subreport from the insert menu and go through the steps of creating the new subreport or pointing to an existing report to be used for the subreport


1306488
report	subreport
Pattern(s): 4	
if you choose to do a new report you give it a name and choose report wizard to create the subreport


1306753
asp.net-mvc	webforms
Pattern(s): 1	
asp.net-mvc is a vastly superior framework over webforms it just requires a bit more upfront work and has a learning curve


1306796

1308259
zero	digits
Pattern(s): 7	
using which sql operator can i check that residue of division in decimal digits is greater then zero


1308725
zero	digits
Pattern(s): 7	
digits is greater then zero


1309206

Pattern(s): 8	
i ve also evaluated hudson it seems to be somewhat more flexible than cruisecontrol.net but i dont personally like the configuration interface of it


1310559
controllers	controller
Pattern(s): 10	
generally a view controllers is more in charge and tells the view what data to display or where to position itself etc


1310736
svn2git	git-svn
Pattern(s): 3	
a simple git-svn will reproduce the svn branches actually simple directory with copies in it so i would recommend using svn2git and git2svn


1311306
http	https
Pattern(s): 4	
this will match https as well as http links


1311384
iteration	elements
Pattern(s): 5	
secondly iterators don t allow the source collection to be modified during iteration so there isn t any opportunity to remove elements during the select anyway


1311500
sequences	unique
Pattern(s): 5	
you haven t told us anything about your database structure but since you are successfully allowing people to add links you must have a sequences defined somewhere which keeps track of an integer id for the link so that every link can be given a unique id in the database


1311516
udp	tcp-ip
Pattern(s): 4	
network cards and routers have a tendency to prefer tcp-ip packages above udp


1311580
elementtree	lxml
Pattern(s): 10	
elementtree is included in the standard library but lxml is faster


1311603
lan	packets
Pattern(s): 4	
you ve already said the network is private lan which eliminates one of my suggestions the other is to make sure the network is switched - a hub could easily lose packets


1311675
ref	out
Pattern(s): 5	
the getpositionlist may be badly designed and simply create a new array for you essentially meaning that the library author should have used out instead of ref


1311750
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 10	
mysql is more widely supported and a little easier to use but postgresql has some very cool features and functionality that s worth taking a gander at


1311789
php	python
Pattern(s): 0	
edit i guess to help clear up some of the confusion in the comments below i get the intuition that php would be better than python at organizing the front-end presentation part of a website while python would excel at the back-end part the actual programming...


1311789
php	python
Pattern(s): 1	
the question is - am i wrong and is python just as good as php for front-end


1311828
php	python
Pattern(s): 7	0	
that said python is much easier than php


1311828
php	python

if you want php nothing is more php than php itself and python takes different approaches so maybe you re going to be frustrated because things are not like you re used to


1311935
line	lines
Pattern(s): 0	
so basically for 3.0 and 3.1 the exact same thing is happening but when running the app in 3.0 simulator the last line seems to get cut off if the cell.detailtextlabel.numberoflines has more than three lines of text


1311980
php	python
Pattern(s): 4	
you can t easily compare php and python


1312360

1312826
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 7	
getimagedata has a for-loop i realised that each index in loops is called more than once


1312982
json	xml
Pattern(s): 4	
then you can do a simple json post i would recommend json for this because it s a very simple post requesting very simple data so xml would be overkill


1313099
share	sharing
Pattern(s): 8	
the difference between a thread and a process is that different processes usually cannot directly share memory and data structures although various mechanisms to share information between processes exist they are usually more costly than sharing information between threads


1313843
unmanaged	c++-cli
Pattern(s): 8	5	
also c++-cli allows you a much more clean interop with unmanaged code actually allowing you to mix managed unmanaged code which is a performance crucial environment may be of benifit


1314182
windows-xp	windows
Pattern(s): 1	
not much experience with windows 7 but i can tell you that it took some time to get the installation procedures for windows-xp and the associated development tools documented on our team


1314282
.when	ready
Pattern(s): 5	
passing a function to lets you supply code to be run .when the document is ready meaning .when the page itself has loaded without necessarily having loaded external resources like images stylesheets et cetera for which you wouldn t want to have to wait


1314463
line	lines
Pattern(s): 5	
optimization affects the debugabbility of your code - some line of code may be removed some line of code from different parts of a function or from different functions may be merged together local variables may be folded together and so on


1314971
java	scala
Pattern(s): 2	
scala can compete directly with java and give it a run for its money on almost all aspects


1315040
message	messagebox
Pattern(s): 7	
dont pop a messagebox which requires user input to clear on a hidden desktop instance


1315741
java	python
Pattern(s): 1	
i am not very familiar with java but i can say python is very well suited for the job


1316308

Pattern(s): 4	
the user will select checkbox from a datagrid of rss feeds on my site and when pressing a button the heavy lifting will happen


1316464
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 3	
otherwise i recommend using postgresql over mysql since it is more standards compliant and has a nicer license


1316538
set	any
Pattern(s): 0	
these two steps together are likely to take less work than any solution that relies on the nested set representation


1316580

all of the default string functions strlen strpos etc. should be replaced with multibyte string functions that look at the character instead of the byte


1317220
version-control	git
Pattern(s): 5	
it sounds like you just want to have stuff under version-control this way you won t have to worry about the learning curve associated with git

3 mysqlhotcopy inly works on myisam tables and in most applications you are better off with innodb


1318527
ubuntu	ubuntu-server
Pattern(s): 4	
for a virtual machine i d recommend ubuntu-server edition jeos as that won t have any un-needed software on it


1318751
lisp	common-lisp
Pattern(s): 7	
implementing common-lisp is a larger task since the language is larger


1319035
recording	playing
Pattern(s): 5	
for disk space you can just zip it and that can be done while recording so while playing that memory is not being hogged


1319157
linq	linq-to-sql
Pattern(s): 1	
i m not super familiar with linq-to-sql yet but something that strikes me is that this


1320138
linq	linq-to-sql
Pattern(s): 4	
i d recommend linq-to-sql for just getting started and you can use a lot of that in linq to entities going forward


1320188
ubuntu	ubuntu-server
Pattern(s): 3	
i recommend using ubuntu-server and deprec as it provides a ton of sysadmin recipes that make things even easier


1320805
controllers	controller
Pattern(s): 10	
you can use a base controllers class and override the onactionexecuting method directly on the controllers which is probably more appropriate than using a filter if your intent is to apply your filter code on all actions across the board


1320978
erlang	ocaml
Pattern(s): 2	
ocaml is a great language -- one of my favorites -- but if your interest is distributed systems than i d recommend going with erlang which is head and shoulders ahead of the other fp languages with regards to distributed systems although there s an offshoot of ocaml called jocaml which has some interesting aspects


1322036
c++	python
Pattern(s): 1	
so i m only useful with c++ java python and the web design languages html css javascript jquery


1322085
encoding	encode
Pattern(s): 5

elevated-privileges	privileges
Pattern(s): 5	
understand why your managed code such as .net clr should not be granted elevated-privileges


1322391
c++	python

since you re familiar with c++ java and python i would recommend using c++ java or python


1322624

update given that syntax-error in the question has been corrected see for a description of what values are acceptable


1322771

google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 5	
but the function vad does not get called in firefox nor in google-chrome


1324200
.net	asp.net-mvc
Pattern(s): 4	
i would choose asp.net-mvc because it s widely used in web development these days rails .net asp.net-mvc which is used for so so my application will be more easily maintainable by someone else


1324674
md5	hash
Pattern(s): 0	
if you need a surrogate primary key using an auto_increment field is better than an md5 hash because it is fewer bytes of data and database backends optimize for integer primary keys


1324815
spring	guice
Pattern(s): 4	
i m assuming you re doing eclipse rcp because otherwise i d recommend spring dm or ipojo google guice with peaberry or declarative services ...


1325007
line	lines
Pattern(s): 0	
it s cross platform and you can literally code this effect in less than 30 line of code


1325095
cell	cells
Pattern(s): 7	
so far i am just binding two separate cells but then when i m expanding the tree the icon cell grows larger and a gap appears between the icon and its accompanying label


1325364
updates	updating
Pattern(s): 8	
i wouldn t be worried about the perf overhead of keeping a separate record of this - it only has to be updates when users are printing and printing will definitely be more expensive than updating a file


1325420
unsigned	short
Pattern(s): 0	
if you really want all 8 bytes in a single number then you need to read more than the unsigned short


1326590
javascript	dom
Pattern(s): 5	
use the html interoperability features to get set call javascript and the serving web page s dom


1327124
line	lines
Pattern(s): 10	
i wonder because there seems to be a view that the least amount of line used is better however i would like to understand if this is because there is a tangible technical benefit or if there was at some point a tangible benefit or if it is indeed for a reason that is quantifiable


1327145
line	lines
Pattern(s): 10	
in your example everything on one line is actually more readable than separate lines


1328392
line	lines
Pattern(s): 0	
to do this so that it works over a range that is less than one line is a little more complicated this allows either sorting multiple lines individually or sorting part of one line depending on the visual selection


1328679
operators	bitwise-operators
Pattern(s): 5	
this is the sort of thing that used to be handled by bitwise-operators


1329425
low-level	hardware
Pattern(s): 5	
com has been replaced by .net in many projects but com still can be written in low-level mfc atl c++ and people only use com for writing high performance application where every cpu cycle counts probably directx game apps hardware interfacing etc


1329454
line	lines
Pattern(s): 0	
if your rich text box was going to have more than 10 line or so it would be a good idea to use a stringbuilder instead of a string to compose the new text with


1329529
sniffing	traffic
Pattern(s): 7	
crackers will crack by sniffing the traffic between your app and the dongle and either disabling any code that tests for dongle presence or writing code to emulate the dongle by replaying recorded traffic whichever looks easier

qwidget	qmenu
Pattern(s): 5	
please note that the actions of qwidget and qmenu are stored as a qlist which can be read using qwidget actions


1330112
arrays	map
Pattern(s): 10	
the php arrays type is actually more akin to an an ordered map than a traditional c arrays


1330221
category	categories
Pattern(s): 4	
for example if a user selects category apple and banana projects foo and qux show up


1330555
having	select
Pattern(s): 0	
oh and poll is generally better than select in terms of not having to copy as much data around


1330650
atomicity	atomic
Pattern(s): 5	
be aware that even if you lock inside each method in your type calling more than one method in a sequence can not be considered atomicity


1330771
subclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 5	
a class that doesn t need to inherit any special behavior from another class should nevertheless be made a subclassing of the nsobject class


1330951
json	xml
Pattern(s): 7	0	
also json has a smaller footprint than xml and is also usually better human parseable


1331150
base-class	subclassing
Pattern(s): 10	
since ireadwrite implements ireadonly ireadwrite is said to be a subclassing of ireadonly although subclassing is more accurately used to describe a class which inherits a base-class rather then implements an interface--for the sake of simplicity they are very nearly the same concept


1331473
set	any
Pattern(s): 5	
the abstract class urlconnection provides set getusecaches methods which can be used by any subclasses


1331796
arrays	loops
Pattern(s): 5	
it has a helper function that can be used with arrays and can be a shortcut for simple for each loops


1331920
tcl	python
Pattern(s): 4	
for the latter approach i suggest using expect if you are proficient with tcl or pyexpect if you prefer python


1331946
postgresql	firebird
Pattern(s): 2	
i am trying to choose between postgresql and firebird databasses


1332089
tcp	telnet
Pattern(s): 5	
to confirm that a tcp socket can be opened try telnet on the listening port from the new machine


1333680

if you want to avoid javascript reading your cookies and man in the middle attacks you need to use a server with http and set the session cookie to only be transported over http


1335666
serialization	serializable
Pattern(s): 7	
having something implement a serialization interface makes more sense as saying this is something the class can do not what the class is


1335774
postgresql	firebird
Pattern(s): 10	8	
but in stored procedures firebird is much more powerful than postgresql


1335774

pointers	stack
Pattern(s): 5	
in reality under the hood a pointers may be passed on stack to facilitate this


1337394
lostfocus	lost-focus

element	document
Pattern(s): 0	
also although you re adding a document it doesn t seem to work if you specify more than one element


1338515
sorted	hashtable
Pattern(s): 5	
better average time complexity than with a sorted list can be obtained using hashtable


1338597
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 7	
postgresql is much more complete and solid and will much better support complex queries and their optimization while mysql may shine in terms of retrieval speed for extremely simple queries


1338980
php	ruby
Pattern(s): 3	
for starters i usually recommend trying ruby or php


1339080
subtract	add
Pattern(s): 5

1340207
nunit	mstest
Pattern(s): 0	
if you have a full version of visual studio 2008 rather than the express edition it integrates the inbuilt mstest much better than nunit does and cruise control also supports mstest


1340735
line	lines
Pattern(s): 0	
this is more than 5000 line of serious spaghetti code


1340937
line	lines
Pattern(s): 10	
there is also no way to determine a line number because again by the time of execution the notion of code lines is no longer meaningful in javascript


1341537
postgresql	firebird
Pattern(s): 7	0	
firebird is smaller and easer than postgresql but it s also very good in performance stability and low mantenaince


1341679
.when	ready
Pattern(s): 5	
i should imagine that it will be released .when it s ready


1342373
generator	generator-expression
Pattern(s): 7	
edit my first impulse is always to use a filter but the generator-expression is more memory efficient and shorter .


1342390
32-bit	64bit
Pattern(s): 5	
a dump from 32-bit process can be analyzed on 32-bit and 64bit machine


1342521
ado	ado.net

i prefer ado.net myself but just for balance there is one advantage of classic ado over ado.net it is arguably more usable


1344271
authorization	authentication
Pattern(s): 5	5	
openid and its extensions could be used for authorization and oauth can be used for authentication which can be thought of as a no-op authorization

64bit apps will not always run faster than 32-bit


1345810

vim	emacs
Pattern(s): 4	
a number of people at the company i currently intern at prefer emacs or vim


1346820
editor	text-editor
Pattern(s): 10	
i can t see how a basic text-editor is faster or easier than an ide in general although i appreciate some things like building tend to be faster from the command line


1346897
javascript	dom
Pattern(s): 10	
in the name of good housekeeping i remove script blocks from the dom that apply to old content blocks since that javascript is no longer needed


1347625
cvs	perforce
Pattern(s): 4	
it s probably easier to learn from scratch than cvs but i don t have experience that way. if someone needed a centralized source-control system i would recommend perforce as long as they had the resources to license it


1347777
selection	selected
Pattern(s): 7	
if the specified selection position is less than 0 then the item at position 0 will be selected


1347793

Pattern(s): 7	0	
this question is similar in nature to whether ant is better than maven or c# better than java


1348077
addition	division
Pattern(s): 0	
performing addition on this slightly larger type will pretty much always be faster than doing division or modulus on the type itself


1348077
addition	division
Pattern(s): 7	0	
for example on most 32 bit systems 64-bit addition is faster than 32-bit division modulus


1348108
java	groovy

show	next
Pattern(s): 7	
now the problem that i am facing is that the processing of the data which is to be show is taking more than 3 seconds so what i have done is that before the app starts to process data for the next update the refresh qtimer is stopped and after the data is processed i again restart the qtimer.the app should work in such a way that after an update refresh during this refresh the app goes unresponsive the user should get ample time to continue to work on the app apart from seeing the data being updated.i am able to get acceptable pauses for the user to work-- in one scenario

1431444
sorted	set
Pattern(s): 0	
hash tables do have an even larger advantage over sorted trees when the key comparison is expensive as with strings because for large sets fewer items will have a hash collision than a search tree is deep and because it s possible to cache the hash code for keys already in the set skipping the expensive comparison for probably all but the matching result

1437384
c++	python

the binary serialization protocol is much stricter than any xml json or other text format meaning it is easier and faster to parse


1452180
loops	nested-loops
Pattern(s): 5	
if you have a tougher product or equate operator let s say taking a product of two terms means summing the strings and finding the sha-1 hash you may be stuck doing nested-loops which would be o n x where x is the number of terms variables


1452459
java	groovy
Pattern(s): 10	
groovy just makes java easer with list manipulation apis closures xml parsing etc


1452971
triggers	insert
Pattern(s): 5	
the triggers could be made after insert instead and this would avoid the possibility of deleting some record unnecessarily if the new record was a duplicate


1453063
vim	emacs
Pattern(s): 1	
i can totally understand why someone not already familiar with emacs wouldn t want to use viper-mode but as someone coming from vim you really have the opportunity to get the best of both worlds


1453066
java	scala
Pattern(s): 5	
99 of java code can be expressed in scala


1453066
java	scala
Pattern(s): 10	
the only difference is that scala is more productive it produces more bytecode per line of code than java does


1454113
java	groovy
Pattern(s): 7	
i have a co-worker that started grails withouth groovy knowledge and learnt his way into the language but he still wrote far less efficient and bloated grails code just by falling back to java since learning groovy is more than learning syntax


1454199
value	field
Pattern(s): 7	
long time back in past i had read somewhere that if we want to enter data in image typed field of table whose value is more then 8kb then we must explicitly specify parameter type to sqlimage


1454489
line	lines
Pattern(s): 0	
in many text editors that are aimed at programmers if the user has a selection that spans more than 1 line and presses the tab key those lines are indented by 1 tab or a number of spaces depending on how the editor is configured


1454529
asp.net	asp.net-mvc
Pattern(s): 5	
i would have thought that asp.net-mvc would have figured it out where if i pass in a parameter in the querystring it would go to the index string tag method and if i didn t pass in a parameter it would go to index


1456421
contains	any
Pattern(s): 4	
alternatively you could write an implementation to compare any two nodes and return whether or not they re the same - and then pass that into the call to the appropriate overload of the contains extension method defined in enumerable assuming you re using .net 3.5


1457268
line	lines
Pattern(s): 4	
or if you prefer line


1457518
base	zero
Pattern(s): 0	
zero crossing won t work because a typical sound has harmonics and zero-crossings much more than the base frequency


1457747
value	field
Pattern(s): 5	
your ccc label field must be assigned a value before you try to modify the .text property


1458277
reset	default
Pattern(s): 5	
in such a case converting to the other class and then converting back would likely cause those properties to be lost reset to their default values


1458417
base	digits
Pattern(s): 0	
that this can validly be done and that it always works is probably due to the fact that the digits base 100 in this case aren t real digits and can legitimately assume values both greater than their base over 100 and even less than zero


1458479
.net	wcf
Pattern(s): 8	
adding soap headers is one of those things that got more convoluted with wcf compared to the previous add web service reference in visual studio .net 2003 2005 and creating a soap extension


1458750
jstat	jvisualvm
Pattern(s): 10	
the tooling provided with the jdk jstat jconsole jvisualvm is much more reliable


1459307
controllers	controller
Pattern(s): 7	
for example setting a delegate on a subview controllers is fine because the subview controllers has a shorter lifespan than the caller


1459902
md5	hash
Pattern(s): 5	
i should have salted the md5 hash - because it s currently possible to decode unsalted md5 hash using rainbow tables


1459923
md5	salt
Pattern(s): 8	
decode the passwords yourself and re-encode them with a salt i recommend something a little more fancy than md5


1460085
google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 5	
when i click on the file to be downloaded in firefox or google-chrome it works fine and saves the file on to disk


1460239
scale	pixel
Pattern(s): 5	
the images may have been scale cropped etc so a simple pixel comparison won t work


1460620
processor	processors
Pattern(s): 0	
if its linux solaris and has more than 2gb memory and more than 2 processor


1460820
listener	listeners
Pattern(s): 5	
do you have texas event listener on all your sprite objects


1460842
moq	rhino-mocks
Pattern(s): 1	
although i currently use moq i used to use rhino-mocks before and it certainly has some features that i occasionally miss with moq - ordered expectations being one of them


1461316
entity	one-to-many
Pattern(s): 0	
if you properties are really properties that is they have the lifecycle of owner entity and can t belong to more than one entity at once consider splitting them into two tables one for images and one for collections and using one-to-many associations


1461340
height	width
Pattern(s): 4	
i m required to write a function to overload the operator to compare width height and colour


1461509
width	display
Pattern(s): 0	
is there a similar property with which we could specify whether horizontal scroll bars should be provided when the width of an element is greater than the width of a viewport ie display area


1462884
visitor	visitor-pattern
Pattern(s): 10	
if you have only a few double dispatch or the visitor-pattern is probably more appropriate


1462936
serialization	serializable
Pattern(s): 1	
update although frederik gheysels s answer is not completely correct decorating with serialization is pre-requisite for both onserializing ondeserializing attributes and iserialization interface he did however points out that onserializing ondeserializing attributes are meant to be supplement of iserialization so i am accepting his answer on this point


1463257
line	lines
Pattern(s): 10	
in this illusion the bottom line looks longer because the angled lines connecting it make it appear to be off in the distance


1463594
set	any
Pattern(s): 5	
so i set the class to be configured for any data from the slingbox s ip address instead of a specific port


1463637
stateless	stateful
Pattern(s): 5	
anything that s possible in a stateful application could also be implemented as stateless - you simply have to store the state on the client and submit all relevant state information on every request


1464028
.war	war
Pattern(s): 5	
i seem to have started a .war of words down below by not giving enough info


1464230
32-bit	64bit
Pattern(s): 0	
perhaps 128-bit distributed-system internet-wide pointers but no more than 64bit in a system call or perhaps even a legacy 32-bit limit


1464476
malloc	free
Pattern(s): 7	5	
most likely malloc allocates more memory and puts so-called guard values that happen to contain null bytes or it puts some metadata to be used by free later and this metadata happens to contain a null byte right at that position


1465066
richfaces	icefaces
Pattern(s): 7	
richfaces looks more good option to work than icefaces bcoz it has inbuilt support its easy to learn its long time support guarantee for seam+richfaces combination


1465200
hide	show
Pattern(s): 5	
i fire off a displaymodule event that should be received and hide an existing module and show a new one but my question is where is the place i should receive this event and display the module


1465356
set	any
Pattern(s): 5	
the script can be included in any web page with any character set


1465797
throw	throws
Pattern(s): 0	
i have committed three times now it is not allowing any more as it throw that error


1466039
contains	elements
Pattern(s): 0	
there could be more than one elements contains directly withing a single e.g


1466132
http	https
Pattern(s): 5	
transport can and should be encrypted using https - http is not any good


1466151
git-branch	git-rebase
Pattern(s): 5	
if you want every step of yours reserved you have to create another branch on your hacking branch before doing the git-rebase this can be done with git-branch small-dirty-changes-i-don t-want-anybody-to-see


1467029
sorting	filtering
Pattern(s): 8	
this may be optimal indeed if the table access to retrieve the values missing in the index is more expensive than filtering and sorting


1467079
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 7	0	
if you need spatial data capabilities postgis with postgresql is better than mysql


1467159
model	datamodel
Pattern(s): 7	
is it the generated files from the datamodel that matters more or is the actual xcdatamodel file


1467948
expression	evaluation
Pattern(s): 7	7	
the basic principle is that expression evaluation is easier for a computer using a stack and reverse polish notation so the algorithm converts a in-fix notation expression with associated order of precedence and parentheses to rpn and then evaluates it by popping operands performing operations and pushing results until there are no operations left and one value left on the stack


1468648
http	https
Pattern(s): 10	
http is faster overall by a significant amount 10


1468648
http	https
Pattern(s): 10	
http is still faster


1468648
http	https
Pattern(s): 7	0	0	
so on godaddy shared hosting at around 6 00pm on my specific server content served over https is faster than over http


1468705
contains	any
Pattern(s): 4	
i need to read data from a csv file display it as a data grid.the csv file contains name value pair column a will contain name column b will contain its value.also the user can add a blank row to the end of it insert data manually by clicking on an add button.the user can select any row delete the row completely by pressing on the delete button


1468708
http	https
Pattern(s): 0	
once accepted the requests is transferred faster than http


1468754
show	next
Pattern(s): 10	
timing tests show this runs 5-20x faster than the original script and the time is more predictable from one run to the next


1468983
cxxtest	cppunit
Pattern(s): 4	
i prefer cxxtest as i find it easier not to have to register my test cases explicitly as you have to do with cppunit


1469173
line	lines
Pattern(s): 7	
so something along these line is easier to follow


1469685
listview	listviewitem
Pattern(s): 0	
a listviewitem can t belong to more than one listview at the same time so this condition


1469813
apache	lighttpd
Pattern(s): 4	
i don t have thorough benchmarks but i m personally convinced that just like lighttpd can outperform apache on simpler tasks mod_wsgi gives apache the laurel when it comes to serving python web apps


1470067
ckeditor	fckeditor
Pattern(s): 7	
is there something that i am missing when i conclude fckeditor is better by going through them because it is not as widely used


1470646
var	out
Pattern(s): 5	
here s quite a good example of how you can get caught out from not declaring local variables with var


1470787
duplicates	contains
Pattern(s): 5	
this must be a faq so i expect it to be closed as duplicates however i can not find a question that contains a good overview of the issues etc.


1470829
line	lines
Pattern(s): 7	
of course - your method across multiple line gives you more places to insert debugging code if need be i usually compress this sort of thing manually after i verify it works


1470836
firefox	safari
Pattern(s): 4	
unfortunately unless you re happy with supporting only specific browsers ie7 win safari firefox 3.5 there s no pure css solution to your problem


1471102
php	ruby
Pattern(s): 4	
another blog here compares ruby and php


1473284
java	scala
Pattern(s): 1	8	
i don t think it is quite as functional as scala clojure but it s certainly a lot more functional than java


1473612
lisp	common-lisp
Pattern(s): 7	
the common-lisp loop is much easier to read although very difficult to write but that s a different story


1473782
java	scala
Pattern(s): 1	
and you can write scala code with functional features almost as fast as java code


1474413
shell	bash
Pattern(s): 4	
i wouldn t worry too much about the shell since operating as root isn t usual behavior for most administrators - so you can pick bash or ksh


1474826
sftp	ftp
Pattern(s): 4	
i prefer sftp to ftp


1474938
http	https
Pattern(s): 7	
https is a lower level protocol than http and will protect both sharepoint http and webdav traffic


1475067
asp.net	asp.net-mvc
Pattern(s): 5	
you ll also want to grab jsonnetresult as it returns an actionresult that can be used in asp.net-mvc application


1475458
uri	endpoint
Pattern(s): 0	
to my knowledge and i have been doing extensive work with wcf in the last month you can not share the same exact uri for more than one endpoint


1476093
inner-join	join
Pattern(s): 5	
i would have preferred an inner-join but i guess this will do for now


1476398
login	logout
Pattern(s): 0	
my functionality is proper because if i click on page after logout it will again redirect me at login page but my problem is i should not land on userpage using browser back after logout


1476724
controllers	controller
Pattern(s): 5	
the above code should have included the controllers as well as the action


1477008
delphi	pascal
Pattern(s): 10	
while the delphi pascal syntax is more text oriented begin end or and so the underscores look a bit strange as you don t expect them there


1477152
asp.net-mvc	webforms
Pattern(s): 8	0	
about writing more maintainable software with webforms from my experience implementing a presentation pattern like mvp in webforms to respect srp increase maintainability enable unit testing etc is a lot more work than using asp.net-mvc out of the box and you get the same results


1477733
c++	python
Pattern(s): 7	
python is much easier to use than c++ for something like this


1477841
web2py	django
Pattern(s): 7	
to answer klochner both seems quite popular but ruby is not a language that i am familiar with and django seems more heavy and complex to me than web2py


1478081
perl	python
Pattern(s): 0	0	
easier with perl python or powershell


1478368
perl	awk
Pattern(s): 7	0	
i m going to argue perl is a better choice than awk here


1478626
line	lines
Pattern(s): 0	
with asp.net the best part is that i can do this with linq to xml in less than 100 line of code


1478633
dir	folder
Pattern(s): 4	
iterate over every file in the client javascript folder that match dir command and for f are totally unneeded here though and only complicate things especially when file names contain spaces commas and the like


1479411
perl	python
Pattern(s): 2	
i would recommend going with python or perl if you swing that way


1479511
value	field
Pattern(s): 5	
the contents of profileinfo are not updated i would have assumed field like .lpprofilepath should have good value and getuserprofiledirectory fails to find the path obviously - it doesn t exist - i also check manually and there is nothing under documents settings for the new account


1479968
32-bit	64bit
Pattern(s): 0	
i closed out that post saying that a 64bit computer can store and retrieve much more information than a 32-bit computer


1479986
32-bit	64bit
Pattern(s): 0	
64bit allows you to use more memory than a 32-bit app


1480214
declarative	imperative
Pattern(s): 7	
while neither the declarative nor imperative approach is really better than the other both have their merits


1480570
contains	any
Pattern(s): 4	
in java s regular expression i want to match any sentence that contains the word mary and the word are in that order but does not contain bob in between mary and are


1481059
testng	junit
Pattern(s): 5	
it is composed of various modules which can be used with testng or junit .


1481062
svn	revision
Pattern(s): 5	
of course revision and pages needs to be stored in svn


1481174
double	int
Pattern(s): 2	
because 1.0 has type double and compiler really doesn t know what type to choose between int and float so it asks you to give it a hint


1481232
int	primitive
Pattern(s): 5	
because this is such a specific corner case which has to be supported for primitive types such as int - bool and reference type conversions otherwise you d get a very pedantic language this is handled but not as a case of method overloading


1481723
midp	cldc
Pattern(s): 5	
and as well i would think they would be included in cldc 1.1 midp 2.0 so if you find them there we can conclude that their footprint is negligible plus probably implemented in an optimized built-in thus being of virtually no cost to use them


1481835
contains	any
Pattern(s): 4	
that will match any two letter sequence in parenthesis that my contains more two letter sequences separeted by hypens


1482207
touchesmoved	gestures
Pattern(s): 5	
based on the code you ve shared it looks like your touchesmoved method will only be called for gestures within the tile


1482207
touchesmoved	gestures
Pattern(s): 10	
when a gestures is faster however the x y touchesmoved events will be farther apart and you ll lose the gestures when one x y point is far enough away from the last one that it is outside of the tile already


1482294
java	python
Pattern(s): 10	8	
java is less dynamic than python and more effort has been put into its vm making it a faster language


1482440
java	python
Pattern(s): 0	
in reply to comment how can java be faster than python


1482440
java	python
Pattern(s): 0	
python is one of the faster ones after java


1482440
java	python
Pattern(s): 0	4	
so the speeds range from python being 2x slower than java to 174x slower python generally beats java in code size and memory usage though


1484705
abstract	implements
Pattern(s): 0	
but if it s really a simulation and what you want are the analysis results implements an actual distributed model would be a horribly complex approach that is likely to yield far less data than an abstract simulation would that is the simulation itself doesn t have to be a network of asynchronous actors communicating


1484733
atomicity	atomic
Pattern(s): 7	
all this is just the same set of issues that you must deal with for stdin - the only possible difference being that stdin coming from a terminal will give you short reads for each line of input whereas each read from a pipe will give you a short read for the size of the pipe buffer or the atomicity writes smaller than the buffer size and a plain disk file will only usually give you a short read on the last block of a file


1485049
osx	linux
Pattern(s): 0	
however i don t find windows development on mono so much better than linux and or osx


1485091
cart	shopping-cart
Pattern(s): 5	
i have a client that i m doing this with who has an asp not asp.net based shopping-cart


1485181
itextsharp	pdfsharp
Pattern(s): 7	
i have tried using certain libraries like pdfsharp itextsharp even acrobat reader ocx control


1486456
line	lines
Pattern(s): 4	
i know that i can match lines containing a specific pattern using grep or other tools but once i have such lines how can i extract a portion of the line


1486780
ado.net	entity-framework
Pattern(s): 10	8	
i don t know why you think ado.net is more consistent than entity-framework


1487060
set	any
Pattern(s): 8	
in the long run that will be the cheapest because paying someone to learn a new set of tools will be much more expensive than any other costs that might be associated wit ha particular set of software


1487175
firefox	safari
Pattern(s): 5	5	
at least these common applications must be supported safari firefox no applescript


1487194
subclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 5	
the more general issue is methods in an opaque superclass that rely on the behaviour of other methods that could be changed by subclassing and what to do in the case that you want to subclass an object to change behaviour like this


1487380
sequence	numbers
Pattern(s): 5	
the numbers do not have to be used in sequence


1487528
shell	bash
Pattern(s): 0	
you have several options read the manpage for ksh and configure it or install another shell you re more familiar with like bash


1487724
reflection	runtime
Pattern(s): 5	
however i still think there s scope for a complete replacement for built-in serialization without having to write and maintain any custom code - this can t be done at runtime because reflection is needed to query objects and access private data


1487773
nunit	mstest
Pattern(s): 4	
mstest comparisons and the developer community seems to pretty much overwhelmingly choose nunit


1488685
set	any
Pattern(s): 4	
at the end of the markup select and focus are called to select any text in the field and to set focus so all the user has to do is scan the value


1488697
subclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 5	
basically make every visible object that can be skinned subclassing a movieclip


1489101
set	any
Pattern(s): 4	
just be careful of the settings you use and how you set up your data because it is very easy to lose any benefits of parallelization by the intermediate loads and saves the package makes


1489249
qdialog	qgraphicsview
Pattern(s): 10	
the widget layout is set to grid the qgraphicsview size policy is set to fixed on the 2 axes and it the qgraphicsview is center in the empty zone of the qdialog


1489646
execute	prepare
Pattern(s): 5	
the query only needs to be parsed or prepare once but can be execute multiple times with the same or different parameters


1489773
line	lines
Pattern(s): 0	
and it seems to me that a simple no matching operator could be clearer than 50 line of gibberish concluding in obscure wording that function requires less-than-comparable concept


1490046
line	lines
Pattern(s): 0	
you should be able to find plenty of papers on this problem and a dynamic programming solution would take no more than 20 line of code


1490225
getter	setter
Pattern(s): 3	
do you recommend using getter and setter or accessing the member variables directly


1490553
line	lines
Pattern(s): 5	
items to be classified line from the requirement document are made of a relatively small number of attributes values for effectively a single dimension keyword


1490648
javascript	dom
Pattern(s): 5	
is there something similar in jquery where you can add javascript objects to jquery selected dom objects without using ad hoc html text


1490850
xml-serialization	xml
Pattern(s): 10	
in the case of xml-serialization it gets more interesting


1491004
perl	python
Pattern(s): 0	
the percentage of people using perl who do quick and dirty hacks with bad style and worse code quality is probably higher than say python


1491585
height	width
Pattern(s): 5	
then set the image to be fixed in height and auto for width


1492048
cell	cells
Pattern(s): 4	
the countif function probably compares cell as numbers


1492048
cell	cells
Pattern(s): 4	
does anyone know how to force vba countif function to compare cell as strings or other way to check for duplicates in vba


1492251
asp.net	asp.net-mvc
Pattern(s): 7	
luckily the asp.net-mvc framework gives us more integration points specifically the modelbinder


1493449
line	lines
Pattern(s): 0	
i m logging every request parameters and how long did it take so single log isn t very large not bigger than 4 line but since there are pretty high number of requests it grows instanely fast


1493669
vbscript	jscript
Pattern(s): 1	
if you are already familiar with vbscript or jscript note that you do not use the scripting language s function for creating a new object instance createobject in vbscript or new in jscript


1494802
nhibernate	s#arp-architecture
Pattern(s): 4	
i haven t read it fully but i prefer s#arp-architecture idea of saveorupdate mapped from nhibernate for entities it s more convenient thant add remove


1495025
serialization	serializable
Pattern(s): 5	
why would mainform need to be marked as serialization


1495338
request	http-request
Pattern(s): 7	
if the http-request is slower than the time i would need to download the extra non cached parts on every page then i would put everything in 1 big file on every page 1 different big file on every page


1495663
asp.net	.net
Pattern(s): 4	
fit within a technology stack sql win .net asp.net vs


1497705
getter	setter
Pattern(s): 8	
what you ll need to do than is to complete the javadoc comments for the classes and methods that are more sophisticated than getter setter or default constructors


1498176
c++	python
Pattern(s): 0	
for some operations you may see that it is 1000 times slower than c++ so yes you should investigate into this and do necessary benchmarks before you make time-critical algorithms in python


1499365
php	python
Pattern(s): 4	
i d prefer python don t know java or php use macosx and firefox


1499590
height	width
Pattern(s): 7	7	
edit actually you resize the one that is the biggest if width is bigger you resize that and if height is bigger then you resize that


1499903
value	field
Pattern(s): 4	
the problem is that the end user can t set a blank value for the field - they can only select value from the lookup table


1500250
perl	php
Pattern(s): 0	
i am a perl newbie but i like it better than php


1500447
generics	reference-type
Pattern(s): 5	
it may be related to generics only being implemented for reference-type


1500769
functional-programming	imperative-programming
Pattern(s): 5	
and just for good measure i have read should functional-programming be taught before imperative-programming


1500999
security	credentials
Pattern(s): 0	
as a note for all readers informed or otherwise i just bought an 800 page 2008 copyright book on the subject from a major - in the preface the author does a hey wait a minute .. in which it is noted in detail that more than one security professional with heavy credentials and field experience had been ahem rendered moot .


1501213
contains	elements
Pattern(s): 4	
jquery doesn t really give you much help here since selectors can only select elements and the contains selector is recursive so not too useful to us


1501872
line	lines
Pattern(s): 4	
note that this will not now match line with a single vowel if you need that too then we need to get a bit cleverer and use some or s


1502603
line	lines
Pattern(s): 4	
this matches line that consist only of one or more capital vowels does not match blank line


1503738
set	any
Pattern(s): 5	
but there is a nant task called xmlpoke that can be used to set values in any xml file at build time


1504310
listener	listeners

calling responsepanel.removeall will remove the components but the components may still be registered as listener on the responsepanel or other objects causing them to be retained in memory


1506597
.net	wcf
Pattern(s): 5	
will this service only ever be called by .net wcf clients


1506844
java	scala
Pattern(s): 10	10	
regarding interop w java scala is closer to java but i m sure both languages interoperate well


1506844
java	scala
Pattern(s): 10	
scala is more likely to be the next java while it s hard to imagine that lisp will finally take off after not doing so for over 50 years


1507242
ant	build-process
Pattern(s): 0	
i am not sure what the eclipse export utility does but you might try looking at ant as it may give you more control over the build-process


1507704
json	xml
Pattern(s): 0	
xml which can be done simply with xmlserializer or datacontractserializer but that offers much less control over the xml or json json.net etc


1508840
width	display
Pattern(s): 5	
if you want the area to have height and width but still flow inline you can use display inline-block


1508865
http	https
Pattern(s): 3	
if you really need to improve password security i would recommend using http and hashing it at server side


1509480
serialization	serializable
Pattern(s): 5	
does that type have to be marketed serialization


1509804
asp.net	asp.net-mvc
Pattern(s): 5	
also coming from the php world i think it s easier to get started with asp.net-mvc because there s less magic going on under the hood in that flavour


1510186
time-complexity	sieve-of-eratosthenes
Pattern(s): 7	
note that the sieve-of-eratosthenes has much better run time-complexity than trial division should run much faster for bigger num values when properly implemented


1510226
messages	communication
Pattern(s): 10	
some kind of http communication is more likely to work out and if you have structured or complex data to send over xml would make sense as a messages format


1510284
32-bit	64bit
Pattern(s): 0	
much longer than 32-bit or 64bit can hold


1511146
pre-increment	post-increment
Pattern(s): 0	
additionally the post-increment expression i++ would be evaluated first because it has a higher precedence than the pre-increment ++i operator


1511920
32-bit	64bit
Pattern(s): 0	
the non-parallel version speeds up a tiny bit because i m running in 64bit mode and it likes 64bit registers slightly better than 32-bit registers


1513003
api	account
Pattern(s): 5	
beyond the api level behavioral changes should also be taken into account


1513137
command-line	cmd
Pattern(s): 5	
adjusting the time intervals in which watch runs cmd can be adjusted using command-line parameters


1513533
reflection	runtime

note that i select cells by dragging cursor from top-left-most cell with value 1 to the bottom-right-most cell with value 4


1513868
extend	methods
Pattern(s): 5	
have mytestableclass extend myclass and then provide public methods in mytestableclass that expose the protected methods of myclass that you need


1514244
udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 0	4	
theoretically udp should be be 30-50 faster than tcp because it s missing the extra trip for the ack and has a smaller header overhead however in reality there are many cases where tcp would outperform udp just because of congestion control


1514785
cherrypy	django
Pattern(s): 10	8	
i would use django because of its large user base and existing modules including the built-in admin interface but i would imaging that cherrypy is more flexible than django


1514982
multiplication	bit-shift
Pattern(s): 7	0	
long answer it won t because it can t know if a bit-shift is faster than a multiplication on the platform the code eventually will be running


1515040
constructor	private
Pattern(s): 5	
in my experience the only thing that nhibernate requires of a domain is virtual properties and methods and a default no-argument constructor which as jeff mentioned can be marked private or protected if need be


1515187
controllers	controller
Pattern(s): 7	
my controllers action is even simpler


1515559
key	key-value
Pattern(s): 5	
takes a list of values that will be mapped as key-value key-value .


1516146
line	lines
Pattern(s): 0	
the full source for python-crontab is less than 500 line anyway and is very readable


1516255
derived-class	base-class
Pattern(s): 7	0	
in other words if you use a pointer to the base-class to iterate over an array of the derived-class you ll get wrong results if the derived-class has a bigger size than the base-class because it will iterate in steps of sizeof baseclass bytes


1516459
yacc	bison
Pattern(s): 0	0	
this is sometimes easier than yacc bison and usually more intuitive


1516876
ref	out
Pattern(s): 10	
since ref is more general why do you ever want to use out


1516885
ref	out
Pattern(s): 7	
out is more constraint version of ref


1517440
asp.net	asp.net-mvc
Pattern(s): 7	
on the other hand if you like applications that are highly performant and cleanly architected need precise control over your markup and would like your application to be testable then asp.net-mvc is a better choice


1517450
jquery	jquery-dialog
Pattern(s): 7	
data-wise a jquery-dialog recommended is nothing more than another div tag in your form


1517564
http	ssl
Pattern(s): 5	
the transport security can be enabled using ssl if you are using http for your services


1517564
json	xml
Pattern(s): 10	8	
xml is arguably more flexible than json to represent your data


1517591
ant	maven
Pattern(s): 4	
instead you should use an external dependency management system such as maven or ivy ivy works if you use ant but maven is both a build tool and a dependency management system so i would recommend maven if you can


1518826
php	python
Pattern(s): 0	
more providers will allow you to run php and you can generally find php hosters a bit more cheaper than python hosters


1518826
php	python
Pattern(s): 0	
generally it s easier to code with python in many regards but this is something that can be overcome simply by using more time with php


1519112
commit	rollback
Pattern(s): 5	
if an exception occurs between line 05 and 16 the transaction will never be marked with commit and thus rollback as soon as the transaction and connetion is finalized at line 18

adapter	adaptor
Pattern(s): 0	
i have a project in which i use more than one adaptor


1520565
amfphp	zend-amf

zend-amf and amfphp both by the same guy zend-amf is newer but a little more complex to set up are both great


1520645
php	python
Pattern(s): 4	
the clients prefer php but shell scripts perl python and plpgsql are all used on the system in one form or another


1521013
constructor	object
Pattern(s): 4	
generally i prefer constructor which guarantee the object is in a good state or if that cannot be done perhaps because some of the arguments to the constructor were invalid throw an exception so there is never an instances of your class which is in a bad state


1521331
silverlight	wpf
Pattern(s): 1	
the model-view-viewmodel is very popular with wpf and silverlight


1522396
procedural	procedural-programming
Pattern(s): 5	7	
functional programming not to be confused with procedural-programming has less problems with this matter mostly because the primary building blocks are much smaller


1523021
flowlayoutpanel	panel
Pattern(s): 10	
if you re using a flowlayoutpanel you could check whether the bottom property of the last control in the panel is more than the panel s height


1523256
category	categories
Pattern(s): 10	
and for the category which is the more difficult part there are some categories that have no subcategories and thus some book records have subcategory_id set to 0 because its category_id refers to an category that has no subcategories in this case the subcategory name column in the book list does not need to show anything


1523688
contains	any
Pattern(s): 0	
i suspect in most cases it would be perfectly acceptable not significantly worse than any other of the multitude of inefficiencies these systems contains


1523860
jquery	dojo
Pattern(s): 4	
for ajax calls you can use a variety of libraries i personally recommend jquery and dojo


1524264
hashmap	map
Pattern(s): 0	
spell checker something better than a hashmap if possible with correct spelling recommendations


1525321
multiplication	addition
Pattern(s): 7	0	
just because multiplication has a higher precedence than addition doesn t mean we need to perform all multiplication in the expression before doing any addition


1526004
lvalue	return-value
Pattern(s): 0	
note that this returns a relative difference meaning that if rvalue is greater than lvalue then the return-value will be negative


1526066
assign	add
Pattern(s): 5	
i need this for a custom form builder that will not add input fields by default that cannot be mass assign


1526545
32-bit	64bit
Pattern(s): 5	
one possible difference is that chars might be aligned on 64bit rather than 32-bit boundaries


1526793
stateless	stateful
Pattern(s): 7	
i think stateful client stateless server makes you more aware of the amount of data that is transported back and forth between tires


1526793
stateless	stateful
Pattern(s): 4	
anyhow gwt and many other modern toolkits silverlight talking to wcf seems to prefer stateful client stateless server due to scaleability issues


1527017
inner-join	join
Pattern(s): 5	
those that will be used for inner-join and those that will be used for left join


1527161
quicksort	mergesort

asp.net	asp.net-mvc
Pattern(s): 2	
which ones do you guys recommend using with asp.net-mvc


1527533
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 7	
installing a real database server is fairly easy so i d recommend sql server express as others have or even mysql or postgresql whatever is easier to set up


1527560
packets	packet
Pattern(s): 0	
web server is probably going to be easier than a packets analyser if you re starting from scratch


1527621
line	lines
Pattern(s): 0	
i don t think you should ever need more than 1500 line ever


1527832
min	max
Pattern(s): 0	0	
the code will also record the edge cases so if the the function produces a value greater than the max or less than the min you.will.know.about.it


1528715
model	datamodel
Pattern(s): 7	
sometimes the datamodel makes more sense with multiple keys


1529187
combinations	permutation
Pattern(s): 0	
itertools does much more than just combinations and permutation so while it would surely be nice to have all of itertools when coding java


1530218
ssh	telnet
Pattern(s): 3	
i can recommend using ssh rather than telnet for security reasons


1530761
symfony	zend-framework
Pattern(s): 5	
i would definitly go for an orm at least if you are working on a big project for which you don t want to use or pdo functions methods directly -- doctrine being the most developped used nowadays it s the default orm of the symfony framework and can be integrated in zend-framework quite easily


1531519
width	display
Pattern(s): 0	
in my iphone application uitable having so many cells with text.the text size is more than the width of the device.so how can i wrap the text in cell and display the text in the different lines or devide it in the lines


1532246
json	xml
Pattern(s): 7	0	
json is typically lighter weight than xml but there are some data structures that don t lend themselves to json serialization


1532246
json	xml
Pattern(s): 1	
if you re using a restful interface you can but not recommended alternate between json and xml depending upon the service call


1532493
tokenize	punctuation
Pattern(s): 1	
you ll really have to write your own analyzer i should think since whether or not some sequence of words is a phrase is dependent on cues such as punctuation that are not available after tokenize


1532513
xls	xlsm
Pattern(s): 0	
using the xlsx open xml file format will be safer than using xls or xlsm since xlsx workbooks cannot contain macros


1533116
boolean	variables
Pattern(s): 10	
also the reason for making the boolean volatile as opposed to the object is that access of a volatile variables is more expensive due to the memory model constraints - thus the boolean allows you to enforce the memory model then the object access can be done much faster within the thread


1533394
arrays	loops
Pattern(s): 5	
in first pass of j loops arrays 1 2 will be compared with arrays0 then 2 will be written to arrays newlength arrays 1


1533797
constructor	copy-constructor
Pattern(s): 10	
thus yes in general your alternative copy-constructor is better but if you only have integral types as members it doesn t really matter


1534151
line	lines
Pattern(s): 4	
this command will match line with 123451234 but not 111111111


1534455
substr	substring
Pattern(s): 0	
is unpack faster than substring


1534459

1534589
c++	python
Pattern(s): 1	
granted it s not as portable as c++ or python but it would leverage your c# .net experience more readily


1534656
linux	unix
Pattern(s): 4	
you have to change your code for different platforms win unix etc... eg socket programming differs on windows and linux


1535156
forward-compatibility	compatibility
Pattern(s): 4	
when there is no special reason for backward compatibility i prefer forward-compatibility


1535381
moq	rhino-mocks

rhino-mocks has been the top dog for a while now but moq has an easier learning curve from online docs although it may not always handle edge scenarios.


1535713
emacs	aquamacs
Pattern(s): 7	
you may also want to look at aquamacs which currently has a beta for the latest emacs and offers somewhat better os x integration than the default build


1535888
default-value	default
Pattern(s): 0	
so boolean query has 1300 clauses which is higher than the default-value of 1024


1537557
listener	listeners
Pattern(s): 5	
there may be tasks that need to be run from listener on shutdown defined in web.xml


1538179
keyword	parentheses
Pattern(s): 5	
and vbscript only expects the argument list be enclosed in parentheses if the call keyword is used


1538563
line	lines
Pattern(s): 0	
but i think it is correct to put many classes in the same header if classes are less than 10 line long


1538975
keyword	parentheses
Pattern(s): 5	
note the call keyword invokes the procedure as if it were part of an expression hence the argument list must be contained in parentheses


1539011
getter	setter
Pattern(s): 5	
if the current value of the property as returned by the getter is same as the value to be set the setter is not called


1539120
line	lines
Pattern(s): 0	
i m not sure 10 line with incomprehensible regular expressions is any better than 30 line of nice looking code


1539470
elevated-privileges	privileges
Pattern(s): 5	
0x800702e4 suggests that the process must be run with elevated-privileges


1539471
nhibernate	entity-framework
Pattern(s): 5	
nhibernate is quite mature and seems be to lighter compared to entity-framework


1539833
asp.net	.net
Pattern(s): 5	
another great thing about asp.net mvc is the strength of the entire tool chain -- from visual studio visual studio add-ins like resharper to windows 2008 iis 7 and microsoft s deployment tools to code samples like the enterprise library there is just a huge amount of great tools and help to be found for .net webapps


1539974
gwt	swing
Pattern(s): 0	
gwt from google is based on the swing model while rap from eclipse is based on eclipse s rcp model which is much richer than swing

Pattern(s): 5	
an uninitialized local pointer variable or field will have undefined value just like uninitialized int or in general pod-type local variable or field would


1540549
memcheck	valgrind
Pattern(s): 5	
if you don t mind poking around in memcheck this functionality should be abled to be added in memcheck mc_leakcheck.c in the valgrind source


1541329
http	https
Pattern(s): 5	
the data is sensitive so should be sent via http


1541438
sql	where-clause
Pattern(s): 5	
by letting the where-clause be computed in sql instead of on the client this can be an order of magnitude more efficient if a low of the items were changed recently as is often the case


1542250
xml-serialization	xml
Pattern(s): 4	
i would choose xml-serialization at least while you are developing since it will help you when debugging you can take a look at the serialized files at any time


1542551
lisp	let
Pattern(s): 1	
these are of course very simple examples but might there be something that is as scalable as let or let in lisp


1542855
set	any
Pattern(s): 5	
the compiler can t however know whether the instance variable is initialised before you hit that method call because it could be set by any other method which may be called in any order by external code


1543106
slide	button
Pattern(s): 10	
viewstack listens for navigation button clicks and passes it to current slide and changes slides only if current slide has no more steps


1544172
selected	button
Pattern(s): 5	
now when i run the form it works but i want the path where the user selected from the browse button so the path should be displayed in button when clicking button


1544581
editor	text-editor
Pattern(s): 7	
any recommendations for a simple yet powerful text-editor that has syntax support for asp.net and a nice ftp client built in


1544893
callback	methods
Pattern(s): 5	
to remember bob you generally make a function as in nickyt s answer to keep a copy of bob in a closure so it can be remembered at callback time and used to call the real methods


1546161
asp.net-mvc	webforms
Pattern(s): 7	0	
if you are interested in good seo and a faster website asp.net-mvc is much cleaner html and faster than webforms


1546562
order	add
Pattern(s): 7	
otoh the foreign key suggests frequent querying by campaign in which case having the clustering done by that column could make sense and would also probably do a better job of scattering the inserted keys in the indexes - both the surrogate key and the timestamp would add records in sequential order which is net more work over time for insertions because the node sectors are filled less randomly


1546912
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 8	
postgresql license bsd is undoubtedly more simple than mysql s


1547949
error-handling	exception-handling
Pattern(s): 5	
i ve seen it argued that all error-handling should be done via exception-handling most recently in clean code by robert martin but i don t agree


1548121
set	any
Pattern(s): 0	
remember - rest is nothing more than a set of architectural constraints for distributed computing independent of any underlying transport protocol


1549670

i don t recommend codeigniter as great and powerful framework but it s simple for beginners and they can learn a lot from it personally i m in favor of symfony and yii


1550763
inno-setup	installshield
Pattern(s): 1	
i am not familiar with inno-setup but this is how we do our installshield installer for an upgrade


1551223
c++	python
Pattern(s): 5	
- the holder trick non-idiom is a design smell which suggests looking for a different and more pythonic approach -- the one case where holder is justified is exactly the special case for which i designed it the case where you want to keep close correspondence between the python code and some non-python you re transliterating a reference algorithm in python and want it working first before refactoring it into a more pythonic form or you re writing python as a prototype that will be transliterated into c++ c# java etc once it s working effectively


1551616
environment	building
Pattern(s): 5	
more importantly can you take advantage of a parallel or shared build environment - from memory clearcase and perforce had mechanisms to handle shared building

margin	margins
Pattern(s): 4	
in your case i would choose margins


1552911
simulation	sampling
Pattern(s): 0	
by decoupling simulation from rendering you can render at a higher frequency than your simulation does for sampling


1553176
callback	methods
Pattern(s): 7	
the delete_all methods is simpler but not advised because it means that none of your other callback will happen on the user record

Pattern(s): 5	
themes are similar to cascading style sheets in that both themes and style sheets define a set of common attributes that can be applied to any page


1555728
copy-constructor	temporary
Pattern(s): 5	
such a copy-constructor cannot be invoked with temporary object as an argument since a non-const reference cannot be bound to a temporary object


1556115
default-value	default

javascript	dom
Pattern(s): 5	
the rest of the html isn t loaded in the dom so the #inner a element cannot be found by javascript


1559056
java	python

1560687
quicksort	mergesort
Pattern(s): 10	
quicksort is a partitioning sorting algorithm you might refer to mergesort which also is a partitioning sorting algorithm the biggest difference is probably the speed quicksort is faster even though both of them are o n log n

all in all i would highly recommend jquery over dojo in any project


1565927
google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 1	
ie8 is considerably better than ie7 however moving around with the cursor keys is a bit unnatural and nothing like as smooth as google-chrome or firefox


1566016

Pattern(s): 4	
how could we compare line in two files using a shell script


1566337
int	primitive
Pattern(s): 0	0	
there are no particular pitfalls with using bigint except that they are significantly slower than primitive int types .


1566437
line	lines
Pattern(s): 4	
i want to compare line one file with the other.diff will give me all the differences in two files at a time.i want a line in the first file to be compared with all the lines in the second file and get the common lines as the output

1569560
expression	evaluation
Pattern(s): 8	
i m not sure what makes you think that assigning the result of the expression to a variable first would be more efficient than evaluation the expression itself but it s never going to matter so choose the option that enhances the readability of your code


1570128
extjs	flex
Pattern(s): 8	
also since you re working with small medium businesses they will be more wowed with flex uis over jquery extjs whatever uis


1570729
x86	64bit

longer answer 64bit x86 has more general purpose registers which gives the compiler more of an opportunity to optimize local variables into registers for faster access


1570767
denormalized	denormalization
Pattern(s): 7	
wikipedia states that denormalization has a better performance but i think i am just getting cocky and thinking i can handle a big denormalization database


1570797
local-variables	function-call

Pattern(s): 0	
a 64bit version might be slightly slower or slightly faster than the 32-bit version


1570916
zero	digits
Pattern(s): 5	
your example means the match needs to be followed by zero or more characters and then a digits but again that part isn t captured

1573480
line	lines
Pattern(s): 4	
will only match line that have string project after the equal sign


1573879
c++	python
Pattern(s): 7	0	
python has much better integration with c++ via things like boost.python sip and py++ than ruby where the options seem to be either write directly against the ruby interpreter api which you can do with python as well of course but in both cases doing so is low level tedious and error prone or use swig which while it works and definitely is great if you want to support many languages isn t nearly as nice as boost.python or sip if you are specifically looking to bind c++


1573879
ruby	python
Pattern(s): 10	10	
i can easily imagine arguments that the python situation is better and that the ruby situation is better

i believe that typedef remains a pure c keyword and really only happens to work with objective-c types usually because they happen to be implemented as struct


1576814
insertion-sort	bubble-sort
Pattern(s): 7	
edit technically bubble-sort is closer to your requirements just if and swaps than insertion-sort so it may be what your instructor had in mind

http put isn t inherently any more secure than http-post if you re allowing the uploaded files to be exceuted on your server


1577633
line	lines
Pattern(s): 0	
but not more than 10 line in total


1577705
double	int
Pattern(s): 5	5	
but in that case you d have to have some way to know which elements of the vector should be treated as int and which ones should be treated as double


1577798
double	int
Pattern(s): 5	
since int can be converted to double without loss of precision.


1578142
json	xml
Pattern(s): 0	
the problem is that using properties file will only works better than xml or json ... on the most trivial classes


1579229

Pattern(s): 4	
i ve created a regular expression that matches any numeric value with leading or trailing spaces that contains ascii or arabic characters


1579370
slider	jquery-cycle
Pattern(s): 7	0	
i am currently using jquery-cycle and the techniques being used in version 1.3.2 do not work when telling it to slider it seems to work only in 1.3.1 there is also a issue of the size slider 3 is much longer than slider 1 and the height it generates is too tall with dead space

controllers	controller
Pattern(s): 5	
it should be written in controllers class


1581034
tcp-ip	tcp
Pattern(s): 0	
at my company we have found memory mapped files to be much faster than loopback tcp-ip for communication on the same box so i m assuming it would be faster than udp too


1581380
set	any
Pattern(s): 5	
at this time i have attempted to use the mergeoption.notracking and the mergeoption.overwritechanges but they both seem to be ignored and any changes in the entity set that should not be modified being persisted to the store

on the other hand you may very well have legitimate reasons to have a bunch of properties that are no more than getter and setter


1585223
linq	linq-to-sql

md5	hash
Pattern(s): 0	
yes sha1 is a better hash than md5


1585911

formally in the current c language you can initialize only integer types with calloc and memset ... 0 ...


1587051
tex	latex
Pattern(s): 1	
if you want to produce very nice-looking documents with tex latex but without learning much about either i suggest you look into lyx a nice graphical editor that allows you to create documents more or less like you do in a word processor but with much nicer results and access to the full power of latex albeit sometimes by embedding latex commands in your lyx document

Pattern(s): 7	
any other good to know for feed is more than welcome


1590985

1594320
java	scala
Pattern(s): 7	0	
that s not to say that you couldn t match scala s performance at doing the same thing - just that it may become an ugly workaround in one language to match the natural idioms in another note i m not saying i believe scala is actually faster than java at anything specifically - i have no data on that - other than that scala is designed with scalability in mind - hence the name


1594818

Pattern(s): 0	
i can t use anything more than basic addition and subtraction and string parsing functions


1595890
duplicates	elements

can be used to lookup any string prefix


1597547
groovy	scala
Pattern(s): 0

1597926
line	lines
Pattern(s): 0	
but not more than 15-20 line


1597983
embed	positioning
Pattern(s): 0	
your best chance would probably be having your own embed iframe element and have it be a sibling of the embed element and give it a higher stacking order with a positioning and index you could also try making it a direct child of the body element so it has a higher z-index than the embed element s parent element


1598143

1604916
sql-server	mysql
Pattern(s): 7	
the sql engine should give an error because of that though some such as mysql just pick a random-ish value out of the several i believe sql-server is better than that


1605680
value	field
Pattern(s): 4	
this will also allow you to choose value of the field for your current records.


1605727
tcp-ip	tcp
Pattern(s): 7	
what you re problem really sounds like is you are trying to send data as you can however you re tcp-ip connection is slower so this is causing the space needed in ram to build up


1606283
log4net	nlog

1613682
grid	gridview
Pattern(s): 7	10	
any time i encounter a gridview with lots of columns i refactor the ui so that the grid displays fewer more important or identifying columns and then when the user clicks a row i display the rest of the row data is a separate details display below the grid

because the latest version of foo might have been upgrade 2 or 3 versioning ago and it wasn t changed since i need to look at the upgrade script for that version


1618906
quicksort	mergesort
Pattern(s): 7	
one can implement a version of quicksort for a single-linked list but normally this is only interesting as a puzzle since mergesort is much easier to implement and works equally well or better for sorting linked lists


1619514
iteration	elements

of course in fact json is much better than xml for the following reasons


1624850
json	xml

1628025
tree	data-structures
Pattern(s): 8

1633363
backwards-compatibility	legacy
Pattern(s): 10

Pattern(s): 5	
write getradioselectedvalue by yourself to get selected radio-button value or set some flag on click


1636643
json	xml
Pattern(s): 10	
this data is too much difficult to understand and arbitary in nature so we have 2 option for the representation of arbitrary data structures either in json format or xml format .but disadvantage in xml it is syntactically more complex and bigger in file size than json


1637094
integer	digits
Pattern(s): 0	
out of range value for integer column type does not truncate to it s maximum value if there are more than 19 digits

Pattern(s): 4	
i personally prefer git but some people find svn simpler to use and some people like mercuiral bazaar or darcs


1639053

Pattern(s): 4	
is there any reason to favor python or java over the other for developing on android phones other than the usual python v


1640847

controllers	controller
Pattern(s): 5	
formbackingbean used to create new instance of the pojo that would be used by controllers


1641091

if you want to go deeper on this the best approach is to read back on the original lean philosophies and then see how you think they can best be applied to project-management


1641729
selected	textbox
Pattern(s): 5	
when user selected the record and press enter that record should be entered in textbox


1641751
getter	setter
Pattern(s): 5

1642048
contains	any
Pattern(s): 4	
the regex should match any strings which contains the comma


1643009
multiplication	division
Pattern(s): 7	0	
the tostring should be slower than parse since division is generally slower than multiplication


1643039
iboutlet	interface-builder
Pattern(s): 5	
ibaction resolves to void and iboutlet resolves to nothing but they signify to xcode and interface-builder that these variables and methods can be used in interface-builder to link ui elements to your code


1643224

Pattern(s): 0	
so next you use the -r flag or -r do svn help ann to make sure to specify the revision one less than the revision you found in the previous step


1644586
arrays	loops
Pattern(s): 7	
firstly you re already aware that there s a length property for the arrays - so you could use that to create a loops that gets rid of the multiple calls to sort at the start and makes the length of the arrays a non problem


1645112
memset	calloc
Pattern(s): 3	
your core graphics surface should be cleared to all zeroes before you render to it so i recommend using calloc instead of malloc or adding a memset after the malloc


1645112
loading	png
Pattern(s): 4	
if you d like to avoid core graphics for decoding png images i recommend loading in a pvr file instead


1645796
set	any

how can i find out why the error occurred or why my assembly must be registered as unsafe


1647078
innodb	myisam
Pattern(s): 10	
i am not sure if this is no longer true myisam is faster than innodb for reads


1647114
innodb	myisam
Pattern(s): 10	
ok there are some cases where myisam is faster than innodb but rarely enough that it s worth putting up with the lack of acid-compliance


1647343
line	lines
Pattern(s): 0	
once you get the idea it is extremelly simple to implement it -- maybe less than 10 line of code for the whole key-generation and validation process


1647830
required	checked
Pattern(s): 5	
if you re not allowed to perform any pre-processing on that list of strings then there s no reasonably efficient solution you re going to have to iterate all over the list checked for each word whether it can be composed as required its signature see below is uniformly less than the incoming bunch s signature


1648263
default-value	default
Pattern(s): 5	
but again the user unchecks the check box the dropdown should be set to default-value that is --selec--


1648539
beautifulsoup	lxml
Pattern(s): 10	
beautifulsoup is more suitable for html parsing than lxml


1648630
swift	objective-c
Pattern(s): 8	
swift is now perhaps less weird than objective-c seems to a programmer coming from some other language

expression	brackets
Pattern(s): 5	
the problem is that if i push more expression onto the stack they will have nested brackets


1649359
actionscript	mxml
Pattern(s): 5	
this is also why actionscript classes and mxml components interoperate very horribly you might have noticed mxml doesn t have the concept of interfaces execution flow and thus time whereas as3 doesn t have the concepts of events or bindings which are native in mxml but are built on top of as3 using some metadata and the flash.events package looking very nice in mxml but being an impressive number of calls and instantiations in as3 .


1649716
set	any
Pattern(s): 7	
really if you want an ordered sequence outside of a key value setup std set is just easier to use than any other


1649793
braces	curly-braces
Pattern(s): 4	
some developers prefer curly-braces and some prefer angle brackets


1649919
elgg	moodle
Pattern(s): 1	
i like elgg only because it is being used by a growing number of online education sites and i think it integrates very nice with moodle


1649960
json	xml
Pattern(s): 7	
however recently last 2 years or so json has become more and more popular so most services decided to also support json and since they already had an xml interface they just kept it


1650002
row	cursor
Pattern(s): 7	
while the using the into variable construct is on the right track the code snippet shown with only this change will fail since the cursor has more row columns declared than variables referenced in the into clause


1650091
double	int
Pattern(s): 4	
so the question what s the best way to compare double and int


1650775
progress-bar	progress
Pattern(s): 0	
if it takes long enough that you even care i would seriously consider stepping outside of the entity framework and using one of the many sql server bulk insert facilities as it will considerably speed up the insert which will probably make your users happier than a progress-bar would


1651199
z-index	overlay
Pattern(s): 0	
i don t know how asp hyperlink works but have you tried giving it a z-index larger than the overlay


1651490

this question sounds outrageous but vs is giving me an error when i check that a string-length is greater than zero


1651490
integer	zero
Pattern(s): 0	
can someone please explain why i cannot check that an integer length property is greater than zero


1651953
annotations	mapping
Pattern(s): 4	
i consider jibx the best of the bunch jaxb castor xmlbeans etc. particularly because i favor mapping files over annotations


1651953
annotations	mapping
Pattern(s): 4	
side comment i prefer mapping files over annotations because annotations


1652078
minimized	minimize
Pattern(s): 1	
for single pass vs multipass -- are you interested in playing with making a very fast assembler with minimize memory footprint

i wrote a handler javax.xml.rpc.handler.handler for a soap web service that inspects header data


1652885

Pattern(s): 5	
if you choose to write a program you may need web-deployment technologies like clickonce or java web start to be launched from web


1653455
linux	solaris
Pattern(s): 0	
but i m far more familiar with linux strace or even solaris truss .


1654513
pointers	stack
Pattern(s): 5	
if it were a class every time you created a new object 8 bytes would be allocated on the heap and another 8 bytes would be allocated on stack for the pointers


1654608
java	groovy
Pattern(s): 5	
it is fairly easy for us to convert current ibatis mappings in sql to oracle used a groovy script to do this also it is easy to convert java code that was calling old mappings that were in sql


1654684
install	deployment
Pattern(s): 10	
your deployment process becomes more complicated since you require the .net framework to be install on your customer s machines and you need to register your .net library as a com component so that your vb6 application can access it


1654844
set	any
Pattern(s): 4	
it s a set of regular expressions to match any number followed by h or m or d to represent hours minutes and days


1655379
fiddler	charles
Pattern(s): 0	
edit if it helps the app charles shows me way more information than fiddler but i really want to figure out fiddler since i like it better


1655426
set	any
Pattern(s): 4	
if you just set the child node to null you ll lose any information about the childs children


1655936
category	categories
Pattern(s): 7	
the only other way i thought of was to loop a 20 limit query for each category but if there are 100 categories that seems even worse


1655966
ruby-on-rails	django
Pattern(s): 5	
now that the application is written and i have some hindsight i wonder what the end product and experience developing the app would have been with django ruby-on-rails or java


1656859
expression	brackets
Pattern(s): 4	
for example how would one write expression which matches brackets balanced string like foo bar bar foo foo1 bar1


1656923
asp.net	.net
Pattern(s): 5	
then you need to ask your webhost to allow the checkload url to be processed by asp.net


1657748
signals	sigaction
Pattern(s): 4	2	
personally i would recommend sigaction over signals


1657908
json	xml
Pattern(s): 7	
the iphone has minimal support for xml and json is far easier imho using one of the json libraries such as those here


1658599
ref	out
Pattern(s): 10	
for example if currently checked out branch is master then .git head file representing head would contain single lf terminated line with ref refs heads master a symbolic reference to refs heads master and .git refs heads master head of master branch would contain for example lf terminated line 0b127cb8ab975e43398a2b449563ccb78c437255 whihc is sha-1 identifier to tip of master branch that is if current branch is not packed then you have to take a look at .git packed-refs


1658665
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 4	2	
i would recommend postgresql over mysql


1659121
constructor	copy-constructor
Pattern(s): 10	
for very small classes like 16 bytes with no copy-constructor it is probably more efficient to use the value syntax rather than pass references


1659389
set	any
Pattern(s): 5	
or more specifically it can t be used in any result set in oracle there is a boolean that can be used in pl sql but you can t return it in a ref cursor or declare a column of being type boolean


1659620
c++	python
Pattern(s): 5	
what is that needs to be coded in python instead of c++ etc


1659733
java	scala
Pattern(s): 10	
now the jvm is becoming less language dependent with clojure and scala running off of it so java has become more interesting now for designing applications


1660613
32-bit	64bit
Pattern(s): 0	0	
as i mentioned in a comment to the answer of brianegge there are not much usecases for hashes with more than 32-bit and most likely not a single one for hashes with more than 64bit


1662540
integer	zero
Pattern(s): 0	
mask each bit in the integer value with 2 bit-index and if the resulting value is greater than zero indicating that the bit at that index is set do something


1663230
boolean	int
Pattern(s): 0	
obviously a string can hold far more information than an int or boolean


1663627
scheme	elisp
Pattern(s): 7	
the original goal was for guile to be backwards compatible with elisp but it seems like developing scheme is the better choice


1664003
model	datamodel
Pattern(s): 7	
with your current datamodel there isn t a more efficient way to do it than recursively querying the database


1664063
typename	typedef
Pattern(s): 0	
they describe intent better than built-in typename do typedef int errcode


1664422
security	cryptography
Pattern(s): 1	
using cryptography primitives directly is not trivial and difficult to get exactly right and with cryptography you have to be not exactly right only once for your security to be broken


1664525
contains	any
Pattern(s): 4	
note that this will match any message that contains the substring target_word


1665608
content-management	content-management-system
Pattern(s): 10	
i think content-management system works better for you


1666052
http	https
Pattern(s): 5	
that part works fine the only problem is it s supposed to be done over http


1666242
difference	date-difference
Pattern(s): 7	
if the date-difference is greater than 30 days inform the user and close the application


1666835

1666835
controllers	controller
Pattern(s): 0	
is it good practice to have more than one controllers


1666846
controllers	controller
Pattern(s): 5	
in a broader scope the actionservlet together with the requestprocessor and action and the initialization info from struts-config.xml could be called the controllers in a struts app


1667154
set	any
Pattern(s): 0	
how can i set things up so that when i set an element to have a greater z-index than any other element on the page it will appear on top regardless


1667576
oracle	firebird
Pattern(s): 1	
in oracle i d think that it would not be because the nested loop join would be much less efficient than a hash join but i m not familiar with firebird at all i m afraid


1667740
line	lines
Pattern(s): 0	
i don t have an installation of biopython on my current machine but if you take a look at the tutorial it won t take more than 15 line of code in total


1668060
height	font-size
Pattern(s): 0	
alternatively you can try altering the line-height variable to 0 in the div then back to 100 in the p but that seemed to change the div s height by a few more pixels than the font-size method when i tried it


1668115
nant	msbuild
Pattern(s): 8	
now let s see which is better tfs build with msbuild or nant


1668196
key	key-value
Pattern(s): 5	
i have no experience with this but it looks like you might have specified a key-value that is not available in the parent table


1668497
line	lines
Pattern(s): 5	
i would like to draw a background for the canvas which draws line like a notepad would have feint blue line on the paper


1668525
editor	text-editor

i ll make a guess that the fit and finish of the visual studio c# text-editor is better than in monodevelop


1668673
selected	checkbox
Pattern(s): 5	
detect if an html checkbox has be clicked selected


1668899
32-bit	64bit
Pattern(s): 0	
i finally realised this might be due to using 32-bit integer type instead of the native type and indeed when i replace with integer 8 the 64bit performance is only 25 worse than the 32-bit one


1668899
32-bit	64bit
Pattern(s): 0	
is it always the case that 64bit will be slower than 32-bit for this type of code i was surprised at this - or is there a chance i could get the 64bit compiled version running the same speed or faster


1668986
32-bit	64bit
Pattern(s): 7	0	
like you i m surprised that the 64bit version is slower than the 32-bit version


1669936

asp.net	asp.net-mvc
Pattern(s): 1	
that is a nice framework built to help make putting together crud operations with asp.net-mvc and nhibernate


1671470
asp.net	asp.net-mvc
Pattern(s): 0	
one of the benefits of asp.net-mvc i keep reading about is that it s easier than with traditional asp.net to create content-specific and or device-specific views straight html or json or xml or iphone-targed html etc


1671489
packets	ping
Pattern(s): 0	
one thing to keep in mind when using icmp based ping is that networking equipment will often give icmp traffic lower priority than normal packets especially when the packets cross network boundaries such as wan links


1671492
asp.net	asp.net-mvc
Pattern(s): 1	
because sharepoint is not compatible with asp.net-mvc

1672104
method-signature	signature
Pattern(s): 7	
as for it being mandatory - basically the java designers decided to stick to a single method-signature which is frankly simpler than allowing for it to be optional


1672840
line	lines
Pattern(s): 0	
however this would not take more than 100 line of c


1672955
controllers	controller
Pattern(s): 0	0	
it is good practice to have more than one controller as a rule of thumb you have one controller per view but this is not a strict rule and you may have more than one controller per view if the view is complex and has distinct features that merit separation of concerns within the controllers


1673035
attributes	properties
Pattern(s): 10	
as implied in 1 properties is a better alternative to get set calls so instead of getx setx user uses less verbose self.x and self.x 1 though personally i never make a properties just for getting or setting a attributes if need arises it can be done later on as shown in #1


1673093

1675140
pointers	stack
Pattern(s): 5	
the best way around this is with smart pointers because as local objects their destructors will be called during stack unwinding and their destructors will properly deallocate memory


1675689
backwards-compatibility	compatibility
Pattern(s): 5	
which language features or base class libraries in c# should be removed if backwards-compatibility were not an issue


1675721
key	key-value
Pattern(s): 5	
if the data sets are that big and can be expressed as key-value pairs with a little de-normalization you should look into couchdb or other nosql solutions


1675885

1678988
cartesian-coordinates	points
Pattern(s): 5	
the link to the referenced paper does not work but if you used the standard hough transform than the four intersection points will be expressed in cartesian-coordinates

authorization	authentication
Pattern(s): 5	
the idea was to have grizzly handle authentication using jaas and jersey handle authorization


1682144

1684524
c++	python
Pattern(s): 10

1684894
windows-xp	windows
Pattern(s): 0	
at least on any platform newer than windows-xp there is strict separation of service and desktop components in the os


1685561
contains	elements
Pattern(s): 4	
b need to select elements which contains any of given text case insensitive


1686187
abstract	implements
Pattern(s): 0	
an interface is better than an abstract class because you can implements multiple interfaces and you can only inherit from one abstract class


1686192
c++	python
Pattern(s): 10	
so i was just wondering if python is faster than java or c# and how that compares to c++ which i figure it ll be slower than


1686193
fonts	embedded-fonts
Pattern(s): 5	
proper support can only be achieved with embedded-fonts or truetype fonts that need to be available on the target systems or need to be embedded as well


1686249
c++	python
Pattern(s): 7	
in terms of raw performance python is definitely slower than java c# and c++


1686834
testng	junit
Pattern(s): 10	7	
junit is more direct and simpel to use if you start to learn java testng has more features but maybe is more complex


1687147

Pattern(s): 5	
they do lots of cool stuff which can be added to asp.net-mvc .net apps includes paging and sorting


1687307
default-value	default
Pattern(s): 5	
note2 the function would rarely be called with select get_new_rand_id but would be assigned as default-value on the id-column instead of nextval


1687594
serialization	deserialization
Pattern(s): 7	7	
serialization deserialization becomes a bigger bottleneck when you scale out to a session server or use sql server to manage session state


1687700
triggers	insert
Pattern(s): 7	
that key would be generated by a triggers after insert which is much simpler than trying to ensure atomicity of the operation and


1688299
extends	implements
Pattern(s): 0	
if your goal is education and not ease of implementation you would probably be better served by extends the uicomponent class and using the treeitemrenderer code as a reference to create a class that implements the same interfaces


1688310
perl	awk
Pattern(s): 7	
perl is a better choice i was starting to play with it but the solution with awk beats me


1688570
set	any
Pattern(s): 5	
dtos help solve this problem by defining a set of objects that can be instantiated in any language whether you re using c# java javascript or anything else


1688614
java	scala
Pattern(s): 5	
bear in mind that these methods will only be seen from java and not the scala world


1688725
scientific-notation	numeric
Pattern(s): 5	
if your column contains numeric values and characters then it will be of mixed types and the jet 4.0 engine needs to to decide whether to choose float in which case your characters will be replaced by the null value or of type nvarchar 255 in which case your numeric values may be converted to scientific-notation


1689004
bag	any
Pattern(s): 5	
these implementations show that a bag can be implemented in any number of ways depending on your needs


1690043
value	field
Pattern(s): 7	0	
but if a field is holding more than one value through the use of delimiters then that field needs to be parsed each time you need the answer to any of these basic functions


1690103
json	xml
Pattern(s): 1	
if you re talking about a traditional browser based web app then i d probably stick with json or xml serialization


1690947
default-value	default
Pattern(s): 7	
this question c initialization of a normal array with one default-value has more information


1691978
jrules	ilog
Pattern(s): 4	
i would surely recommend ilog jrules for your needs


1692561
interpreter	runtime
Pattern(s): 5	
so then fully compiled languages such as java may well run as bytecode and could be considered as interpreter however the point is that there is an explicit compile step there is no interpreter with the sun jre anyway that provides a runtime executable environment for java code


1692893
controllers	controller
Pattern(s): 5	
may be considered as controllers


1693699
spring	stripes
Pattern(s): 4	
spring mvc has adopted some of these patterns but i still prefer stripes because it does one thing and does it well


1693725
lightbox	thickbox
Pattern(s): 3	
since many browsers block popups by default and popups are really ugly i recommend using lightbox or thickbox they are prettier and are not popups they are extra html markups that are appended to your document s body with the appropriate css


1694105
denormalized	denormalization
Pattern(s): 7	
basically denormalization data requires more maintenance than normalized


1694306

it seems to me that most of what can be accomplished with httpwebrequest response can also be accomplished with the webclient class


1694388
httpwebrequest	webclient
Pattern(s): 5	5	
so far i can t see anything that can be accomplished with httpwebrequest response that can not be accomplished with webclient nor where httpwebrequest response will give you more fine-grained control


1695290
category	categories
Pattern(s): 5	
so while the quoted answer suggests letting category be m n to category my suggestion is to allow products to have m n category instead


1696013
set	any
Pattern(s): 4	
the problem is that you are sending a redirect to the user when the action fails instead of just doing a render that means you lose any variables you set up to use within the request


1696406
32-bit	64bit
Pattern(s): 0	
ps 4g is the maximum theoretical heap limit for the 32-bit jvm running on a 64bit operating system see why can t i get a larger heap with the 32-bit jvm

just asking why it does not display the chatbox itself so not the senders after more than 2 line are entered.


1697108
32-bit	64bit
Pattern(s): 0	
this is what you want - the size of a buffer can t possibly be any larger than a 32-bit size_t on a 32-bit system but it can be far larger on a 64bit system


1697188
google-chrome	safari
Pattern(s): 5	
can you tell me why my searches are working ok in ie8 but get stuck with safari and google-chrome


1698530

1698944
linq	linq-to-sql
Pattern(s): 5	
the asenumerable forces linq-to-sql to enumerate the query results allowing the remainder of the query to be resolved using linq to objects and your distance delegate instead of being translated to sql

Pattern(s): 7	0	
in addition i noticed that you also have a possible exceptional scenario for your full constructor when the min value is greater than the max value


1703155
lookup	any
Pattern(s): 7	
at any time the number of dcache lookup is much more than dcache updates so


1703415
private	instances
Pattern(s): 0	
you shouldn t have any accessibility higher than private exposed as direct instances fields


1703680
nested	order
Pattern(s): 10	
if the ##temp has only few rows then the nested loop is better and order makes no difference


1703754
set	any
Pattern(s): 4	
the cycles found are constructed in such a way that you can choose any path and still get a minimal cycle set no cycle can be get doing the union of two others but there is several possible such sets


1703766
.net	wcf
Pattern(s): 7	
wcf is more of a replacement for .net remoting than an alternative


1703778
process	interprocess
Pattern(s): 0	
it s called duplicatehandle and it works well and is more suited for cross process scenarios and would hack less than boost interprocess or similar


1704088
ruby-on-rails	django
Pattern(s): 1	
i am curious so i have looked at other things like django cakephp zend etc but i have never find something as good as ruby-on-rails


1704101
line	lines
Pattern(s): 10	
matching known shapes or dark line is better done with other methods


1704386
integer	digits
Pattern(s): 0	
given a 64-bit integer you can calculate that you won t need any more than 11 digits in the result so using a static 12 character buffer will certainly help improve your speed


1704512
contains	elements
Pattern(s): 0	
but every row contains 52 elements so those add up to more than thousand elements


1704686
replace	substitution
Pattern(s): 0	
for more than one substitution you could use cascading replace statements


1704713
contains	elements
Pattern(s): 10	10	
your css makes perfect sense given the sample of html you ve shown but sometimes putting the style on the link elements itself rather than it s contains elements is less problematic and what i ended up doing earlier today with my problem


1705367
testng	junit
Pattern(s): 3	
third i d recommend using junit 4.4 or better yet the testng idiom - annotations


1705750
contains	any
Pattern(s): 4	
so far i can match any empty html tag that does not contains jstl with the following


1705944

width	display
Pattern(s): 7	
since ul and li elements are display block by default give them auto margins and a width that is smaller than their container


1708310

Pattern(s): 0	
the array is set up to take 5 digits but i need to prepend leading zero to the number when it is less than 5 digits


1708598
packets	packet
Pattern(s): 7	
now my problem is that sometimes the packets is bigger than 256 as for example 336 then it would be


1708976
line	lines
Pattern(s): 0	
it s more than two line of code but you can use the imagereader in javax.imageio to read each single frame of the animated gif and imagewriter to create a new animated gif from the mirrored images


1709198
min	max
Pattern(s): 4	
if this is the case the query could be modified to choose max min etc.


1709258
generics	type-safety
Pattern(s): 7	
generics gives you greater performance among other things because you often avoid the overhead of vtables and because with less indirection the compiler is better able to inline better type-safety because the exact type is known rather than hiding it behind an interface and often cleaner and more concise code as well stl iterators and algorithms enable much of this without using a single instance of runtime polymorphism or virtual functions


1709889
lisp	common-lisp
Pattern(s): 4	
for an example of well thought out clearly specified macro systems i recommend common-lisp s


1710127

for typical situations we re talking about less than 10 line of c# here not counting the dependencyproperty declarations


1711582
sql-server	mysql
Pattern(s): 5	
this is what i would do in a ms sql-server but i guess same optimization can be used in mysql too


1711772
arrays	hashmap
Pattern(s): 0	
this class should use less memory than an hashmap since it uses a primitive arrays no boxing needed it needs only for double s or for float s


1711963
listener	listeners
Pattern(s): 5	
i believe if there are alternatives they will involve complicated mechanisms listener manual sql insert statements etc just to save and retrieve data that belong to the association and not the associated main entities and fetch it as part of one of the main entities formula or ingredient


1711972
defined	declare
Pattern(s): 5	
if the child class is not fully defined before the owner class it would have to be forward declare and can only be included as a pointer

Pattern(s): 5	
local sequence cannot be used in linq-to-sql implementation of query operators except the contains operator


1712620

Pattern(s): 5	
you may have kept the method-signature the same but you have changed the semantics of the interface and so it breaks dependant code


1712652
vbscript	vba
Pattern(s): 1	
however you re in luck as you re likely to be able to move all your vba code out of access and into your vbscript which is quite compatible with vba


1712836
asp.net	asp.net-mvc
Pattern(s): 7	
if you go for asp.net-mvc which is closer to rails then you may look into something like jqgrid

1715483
signals	sigaction

fgets should be interrupted by signals errno is set to eintr though you ll probably need to use sigaction ... rather than signal ... to ensure sa_restart is clear


1716126
environment	configuration
Pattern(s): 5	
any difference between the environment should be expressed in configuration files


1716751

if all you need is a secure channel you re extremely unlikely to be able to do a better job than http


1721898
.net	wcf
Pattern(s): 5	
with wcf 4 - to be released with .net 4 presumably in march 2010 - things will get a lot easier since wcf 4 will already include a base routingservice class - see a endpoint.tv video interview by ron jacobs on this topic

1722180
innodb	myisam
Pattern(s): 3	1	
you should use innodb in such scenarios and most mysql gurus recommend using innodb by default anyway because it s considered more generally reliable than myisam despite being slower under some use cases


1722801

Pattern(s): 7	
in this case - it doesn t matter if asp.net-mvc is better than x or vica versa


1722975
asp.net	asp.net-mvc
Pattern(s): 7	
i have never struggled on the overall picture of asp.net so to think asp.net-mvc somehow makes it simpler is often a misnomer


1723304
grouping	aggregate
Pattern(s): 0	
when you grouping in linq to sql if you ask for the child objects more than aggregate linq to sql will re-query each grouping using the key to get those child objects


1723781
processor	processors
Pattern(s): 5	
it attempts to use the tsc register but for multiprocessor systems this register is not guaranteed to be syncronized between processor and more importantly can vary greatly due to intelligent downclocking and sleep states


1724768
asp.net	asp.net-mvc
Pattern(s): 5	
any control that does not use viewstate or require can be used in asp.net-mvc without problems


1725175
php	python
Pattern(s): 8	
i m more comfortable with php mysql don t know a lick of python yet except for the teeny tiny bit i picked up using the django admin recently...therefore please excuse this very stupid question that i m embarrassed to ask


1725214
height	width
Pattern(s): 0	
if set true then it might increase the width or height if the given width and height are bigger than original width and height


1725568
model	datamodel
Pattern(s): 4	
i have the latest version of xcode and when i select my .xcdatamodel file and then select datamodel add model version i get the following dialog


1725999
upgrade	versioning
Pattern(s): 4	
strongly recommend upgrade your versioning of memcached


1726338
bing-maps	bing
Pattern(s): 5	
it s now even easier to get started with bing-maps use is now free for public-facing non-password protected web sites with up to 125 000 user sessions per year


1726742
height	width
Pattern(s): 5	
and unlike inline elements a included among these block elements can be assigned a width and height


1726749
webrequest	webclient
Pattern(s): 7	
update i ve created a webhelper class that takes the place of webclient but provides more access to the necessary features of the underlying webrequest


1727802
buffering	capture
Pattern(s): 5	5	
you can use named capture buffering


1727859
direct2d	gdi
Pattern(s): 4	
i recommend direct2d and directwrite as you get high-quality rendering that s also ridiculously fast compared to either gdi or anything done in the .net space


1728258
controllers	controller
Pattern(s): 10	
controllers is the more usual name for a class used in a ui that causes interaction between a view and data and they quite often don t need to have public methods


1728658
processor	cpu
Pattern(s): 0	
in theory if you are running on a multi-processor cpu then the threads could be run on different processor so the work is done in parallel but even then there is no point in having more threads than processor


1729152
put	get
Pattern(s): 5	
so my question is at what point in a forms life cycle do the controls on it get disposed of and therefore where would it be best to put the code that stops the update thread


1729502
simpletest	phpunit
Pattern(s): 4	
i would recommend phpunit for your testing as it seems to be the most complete package for php imho many are fans of simpletest as well .


1729806
innodb	myisam
Pattern(s): 10	
am i right that innodb is better for frequent concurrent updates and inserts than myisam


1729806
innodb	myisam
Pattern(s): 10	
we know that myisam is faster than innodb when we don t have many concurrent updates inserts


1730147
triggers	insert
Pattern(s): 5	
it involves a bit of work in the triggers too as every change to table means that associated rows in cc_list_table have to be deleted updated insert as appropriate but is an approach that works in situations where the original table table has to retain its original structure but where you are free to adapt the query as you see fit


1730317
innodb	myisam
Pattern(s): 10	
it is a massive over simplification in some cases and plain wrong in others to say we know that myisam is faster than innodb


1730317
innodb	myisam
Pattern(s): 2	
if you ve tuned innodb properly for your server and are running proper server-grade hardware innodb should be able to compete with myisam on most queries excluding full table scans but you re not doing many of those right


1730317
innodb	myisam
Pattern(s): 7	
if you find that innodb is much slower for inserts updates bear in mind that it offers a much better level of durability - if you tune it for approximately the same durability as myisam then you ll see good performance hopefully


1730672
nant	msbuild
Pattern(s): 4	
i have written build scripts for my project in both nant and msbuild and i prefer nant or a hybrid of the two


1731087
ruby-enterprise-edition	passenger
Pattern(s): 3	
to get some instant performance boast with passenger i recommend using ruby-enterprise-edition


1731404
contains	elements
Pattern(s): 4	
in fact my compare function compares elements of type op_char and i retrieve the operator def from a map which contains elements of type op_def which have a field priority


1731832
ruby	python
Pattern(s): 5	
to start off with clients using this protocol will be written in ruby java and .net and then possibly branch off into python perl scala erlang etc.


1731843
sql-server	sql-server-express
Pattern(s): 4	
since your production server is running standard edition i would choose sql-server express on local machines


1732320
ant	maven
Pattern(s): 0	
first maven is a much younger tool than ant or make so you have to expect that its going to take time to get to the maturity level of those applications


1732705
vba	macros
Pattern(s): 5	
basically you can t return a value from a vba macros called from your c# code using application.run so you have to resort to passing an object by value that has a method or property that can be called from vba to set the instance


1732942
dynamic-programming	memoization
Pattern(s): 7	
i am surprised nobody mentioned this yet because dynamic-programming seems a better approach rather than recursion + memoization


1733045
cvs	version-control
Pattern(s): 1	
zope 2 had it s own simple version-control capabilites and they were as good as cvs which is to say they were limited and sucky.


1733223
progress-bar	progress
Pattern(s): 10	
seekbar looks like the progress-bar but is user modifiable


1733475
unsigned	bigint
Pattern(s): 5	
alternatively you can also explicitly cast your unsigned values to be signed bigint values and then do the subtraction


1733722
line	lines
Pattern(s): 4	
if you want to select line then strip out the bits you don t want


1734088
order	add
Pattern(s): 5	
you have a job description - which may have some constraints on where its performed - and you have a queue of jobs to be performed broadly speaking if there are no other constraints you d expect the jobs to be done in order you take them from the front of the queue and add them to the end


1734306
decimalformat	string.format
Pattern(s): 5	
it can probably be done with string.format ... but you could use decimalformat


1734417
printing	formatting
Pattern(s): 5	
so while printing things that aren t going to be read especially formatting floating point numbers can be a big performance problem you may in fact have other bigger performance problems that you should get rid of first


1734521
asp.net-mvc	webforms
Pattern(s): 7	
it is hard but not impossible to achieve full separation of concerns with asp.net webforms it is lot easier to do it with asp.net-mvc because of cleaner generated html...anyway you have few options here.


1734609
gtk	cairo
Pattern(s): 10	
with gtk it s more common to use cairo already mentioned by jeff foster


1734992
fseek	ftell
Pattern(s): 7	7	
unless there is specific reason to do it fopen fseek ftell is a better idea portable staying within the c standard library

drawimage	draw
Pattern(s): 0	
how can i draw a bitmap with an additional transparency without it taking significantly longer than drawimage


1735122
multiplication	division
Pattern(s): 10	8	
multiplication is less expensive than division so


1735160
textbox	checkbox
Pattern(s): 5	
you have controls in wpf that can contain other controls like a panel that can have label checkbox and textbox i am not sure if there is a timer control but i m sure it can be programmed


1735356
time	subtract
Pattern(s): 1	
it s not as trivial as subtract strtotime results since there are daylight savings and time would be mathematically correct but not physically


1735408
perl	awk
Pattern(s): 0	
note that gawk is vastly faster than awk on this machine but still slower than perl


1735989
controllers	controller
Pattern(s): 5	
for example all controllers need to be extended from controller class so you cannot instantiate any class only a controller


1736112
processor	processors
Pattern(s): 0	
get a bigger machine with more processor more memory etc


1736188
error-handling	exception-handling
Pattern(s): 0	
exception-handling make sense in code were it s okay to drop the current task on the floor and where common case code has more importance than error-handling


1736576
defined	declare
Pattern(s): 5	
the prototype logically declare a type inside the function and therefore should be scoped as defined - and hence a type defined only in the function prototype cannot be used outside the function and a function that cannot be called is of little benefit to anyone


1736656
json	xml
Pattern(s): 4	
i normally don t work with json i prefer xml but since the twitter_oauth gem relies on it i m forced to learn it unless i change the gem s source code or overwrite it - not of my preference


1736702
vim	emacs
Pattern(s): 5	
there is no limit to the size of a system that can be developed in vim emacs unix in fact there are fewer limits than there are in ide s

java	scala
Pattern(s): 5	
how do i write a scala class object that can be executed with java


1737864
pylons	turbogears
Pattern(s): 4	
others prefer turbogears and or pylons maybe bfg maybe grok maybe zope maybe plone


1738010
linq	linq-to-sql
Pattern(s): 7	
if you don t have experience with orms linq-to-sql is slightly easier to learn than nhibernate


1738045
linq	linq-to-sql
Pattern(s): 7	
linq-to-sql is easier and faster to implement and integrate quickly but nhibernate can give you more flexibility if you need more control


1738180
double	int
Pattern(s): 5	
so somehow i need my double to be casted to int


1738274
height	width

1740094
asp.net	asp.net-mvc
Pattern(s): 5	
microsoft has said it will be included in asp.net-mvc when it is released


1741256
required	checked
Pattern(s): 7	
by using the enum type checked is much better but it required that the generic base class be recompiled every time a new documenttype is added


1741448
ftp	telnet
Pattern(s): 10	
ftp protocol is more complex than http or telnet form example


1742612
atomicity	atomic
Pattern(s): 5	
mv and ln can be used for atomicity operations


1742688
line	lines
Pattern(s): 0	
since both of these affect caching naively inlining functions with less than x line or whatever other simple heuristic is likely to generate worse performing code


1742810
http	https
Pattern(s): 1	
i m not very familiar with http


1743175
video-streaming	streaming
Pattern(s): 5	
video-streaming - iis 7 can be enhanced for video-streaming in conjunction with silverlight


1743555
json	xml
Pattern(s): 7	0	0	
however xml is syntactically bigger than json and that makes it heavier than json


1743691
json	xml
Pattern(s): 7	0	
easily parsed by javascript and it is lightweight a document in json is smaller than a xml document that contain the same data.


1743725
json	xml
Pattern(s): 7	0	
then you see json start to fall down but if you just need a serialization format for your data json is smaller lighterweight more human readable and generally faster than xml


1744013
json	xml
Pattern(s): 7	
xml may have its merits but for basic data interchange json is much more compact and direct


1744961
bing-maps	google-maps
Pattern(s): 7

1745182
controllers	controller
Pattern(s): 5	
not be found on controllers


1746454
.when	ready
Pattern(s): 5	
you can even sink dwebbrowserevents2 to get notified .when the folder view is ready


1746560
dns	host
Pattern(s): 4	
also make sure you re accessing the service via the machine s wins dns name or you need to add an explicit host header to the web site instance under iis


1746867
java	python
Pattern(s): 5	
having briefly read through that site i learned that two languages could be used there java and python


1746907
java	python
Pattern(s): 10	
as a language python is faster to learn but java comes with richer tools such as eclipse that may partly compensate


1748270
atomicity	atomic
Pattern(s): 5	
if you mean testing and modifying a bit as a single atomicity operation then the bit test instructions bt bts btr and btc can all be made atomicity by using the lock prefix


1749794
integer	zero
Pattern(s): 0	
an integer greater than zero indicates


1749841
onchange	onkeydown
Pattern(s): 10	
onkeydown although it wouldn t work for pasted data where onchange is probably better


1750167
drupal	django
Pattern(s): 0	
it also seems that your break down of the site and what s required fits the django way of thinking a lot more than the drupal way


1750779
textbox	button
Pattern(s): 5	
there will be an edit button down once the user clicks edit button all the lablel would be gone and textbox and dropdown control should be present so that user can change the values and again update into database


1751198
contains	any
Pattern(s): 5	
this makes it clearer to the reader that this string contains nothing that will be interpolated in any way


1751343
java	scala
Pattern(s): 0	
just for interest if you want really pedantic and rigorous type handling in a language somewhat similar to java you can hardly do better than scala


1751511
inner-join	join
Pattern(s): 1	
it works but it s poor form it s not as clear as inner-join


1751523
line	lines
Pattern(s): 0	
i m acquainted with basic programming stuff know syntax and some concepts of several languages pascal php python now want to learn c# and i debug quite a lot so i can write and have written programs not bigger than 1000 line of code for my own needs

oracle	mysql
Pattern(s): 5	
afaik this can t be done in oracle but maybe someone can add a comment on how to do this in mysql


1751849
max	minimum
Pattern(s): 0	
so i use the formula you have in your second query to first calculate the bounds -- the four lat long values at the extremes of the allowed radius then take those bounds and do a simple query to find the matches within them less than the max lat long more than the minimum lat long


1752142
google-docs	spreadsheet
Pattern(s): 4	
i recommend google-docs and spreadsheet


1752257
waterfall	methodology

in traditional waterfall methodology it s more acceptable for a developer to go dark for weeks on end-- and with a bad team this is the worst possible thing that can happen


1752320
linux	ubuntu
Pattern(s): 5	
the example i m thinking about is libnotify which enables for notification of messages with or without image and title this can for instance be found in ubuntu linux 9.04


1752711
int	nsinteger
Pattern(s): 7	
nsinteger is nothing more than a 32 64 bit int


1752722
http-post	post
Pattern(s): 10	
you would allow post get post is more secure to the php file and would then run an http-post get request from c#


1752830
mobile-safari	safari
Pattern(s): 5	
i have an idea for a webapp for the iphone but its unknown to me how much data can be stored in mobile-safari s sqlite db


1752879
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 5	
and no i m not just a postgresql fanboy i m a senior mysql user i started using mysql with a version 2.something i introduced it more than 10 years ago in the company i still work for and made it the default database and today i don t allow any new development i can decide to be based on mysql


1753093
min	max
Pattern(s): 0	
if i is less than min and more than max

height	width
Pattern(s): 7	
when working with a landscape photo the photo width is greater than the photo height


1753801
height	width
Pattern(s): 7	0	
when working with a portrait photo the height is greater than the width


1754080
sorted	sorteddictionary
Pattern(s): 10	
as you can see on sorted data the sorted list is faster than the sorteddictionary


1754204
linq	linq-to-sql
Pattern(s): 3	
if you re just learning mvc and are ok with sql server then i would recommend using linq-to-sql for a start


1754298
subclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 0	
also you can sorta - it requires a little more implementation than usual subclassing nsmutablearray type using objc


1754637
unix	aix
Pattern(s): 5	
the site here has a list of useful unix commands that can be used on aix machines


1755022
contains	any
Pattern(s): 4	
matches any string and is only for like but if you want to apply it so that it will match any series of letters contains within your character class you need to do


1755642
line	lines
Pattern(s): 1	
but this just plots x with line


1756784
linq	linq-to-sql
Pattern(s): 7	
in my new wpf silverlight app is it better to directly connect to my remote sql server i m using linq-to-sql or is it better to call a wcf service and have the service connect to the database


1757325
triggers	insert
Pattern(s): 5	
if what you re actually looking for is for the records to be merged on insert into the database so you only have a single underlying record which contains all the data then you could do it through triggers but i can t quite see why you d want to because you d end up with a 1 1 mapping for b and c and might as well just have them as a single table


1757781
hex	binary
Pattern(s): 5	
token should be passed in binary and not in hex ascii


1757803
http	https
Pattern(s): 5	
this site is always can only be accessed via http and depending on your stance is a low-risk website


1757885
sql-server	mysql
Pattern(s): 0	
i use c# entity framework and linq with mysql too so it s not an either-or thing although performance is likely to be better with sql-server in a .net environemnt because the teams work together to boost performance and make integration work better


1757885
sql-server	mysql
Pattern(s): 0	
sql-server s sql-language support is richer than mysql s including some very cool features in sql 2008 especially like row_number grouping_sets optimize for computed columns etc


1758002
line	lines
Pattern(s): 5	
and or redirect everything in a file and use a plugin like ntail and use some filter line to exclude selected line from log file display that may be closer to what you are looking for


1758135
enterprise-architect	visual-paradigm
Pattern(s): 4	
i personally prefer enterprise-architect or visual-paradigm for uml for my diagrams


1758300
silverlight	wpf
Pattern(s): 4	2	
however starting today there has been a lot of buzz out there about silverlight 4 being announced at pdc09 and people stating that there aren t many arguments left to choose wpf over silverlight 4


1758303
maven-plugin	maven
Pattern(s): 5	
the build helper maven-plugin attach-artifact goal will tell maven that a particular file should be added to maven s list of artifacts for that project


1758645
gwt	richfaces
Pattern(s): 7	
richfaces and jsf unlike gwt allows for more document-style web-pages rather than application-style


1759169
linq	linq-to-sql
Pattern(s): 8	
this is much nicer than working with sql server compact or even full sql server since linq to objects is so much more powerful than linq-to-sql


1759594
asp.net-mvc	webforms
Pattern(s): 3	
i think the tool is good but if you are just starting the building of the application i would recommend using asp.net-mvc instead of asp.net webforms


1759829
silverlight	wpf
Pattern(s): 5	
however i can see the day when wpf will be called silverlight or perhaps the other way around


1760232
generator	generator-expression
Pattern(s): 10	
for example if you are passing any ol iterable to a function a generator-expression genexpr is often more appropriate and a lc is wasteful


1760394
updates	updating
Pattern(s): 5	
it has a on duplicate key updates statement because this import needs to be done regularly updating the data in mydb


1760594
private	data-members
Pattern(s): 7	
if i m creating an abstract base class and the classes derived from it are going to have some of the same data-members is it better practice to make those members private in the abstract base class and give protected access to them


1760603
derived-class	base-class
Pattern(s): 5	
the base-class could be virtual by the mere fact that only one of its methods must be implemented in derived-class


1760867
public	protected
Pattern(s): 3	
personally i prefer putting public methods first followed by protected methods following by private methods


1761271
cell	cells
Pattern(s): 0	
similarly uitableview view contains more than 15 cell


1761370
adapter	adaptor

html5-canvas	canvas
Pattern(s): 2	
i prefer svg over html5-canvas or png for charts


1763082
linux	unix
Pattern(s): 5	
ideally the mechanism must be based on unix capabilities since we also plan to port to linux


1763733
silverlight	wpf
Pattern(s): 7	
i also think even if silverlight 4 makes better use of the gpu it still won t be to the level that wpf utilizes it


1764259
silverlight	wpf
Pattern(s): 7	
silverlight has a pretty good subset of wpf display features and even manually constructed silverlight content is easier to manage than trying to get .net windows + activex hosting + wpf working


1764492
screens	switching
Pattern(s): 5	
have tried switching off the screens lock in settings but it ll still kick in after a springboard restart


1765061

Pattern(s): 5	5	
you may have noticed field value rendering quickly with place holders spaces for subreports and other resource-intensive objects


1766066
active-directory	adfs
Pattern(s): 5	
we are planning to use adfs for these partner organizations so the users will be authenticated using active-directory within their network and claims will be sent to the webapp via the authentication token cookie set by the adfs


1766066
http	https
Pattern(s): 5	
2 should every page in the adfs enabled webapp be accessed through http


1766534
netbeans	netbeans-platform
Pattern(s): 4	
if you are more into swing maybe you ll prefer netbeans-platform crud application tutorial

be warned gentoo is not a drop dead simple distro to use ubuntu -- you have to understand a bit about how the os works -- but it does provide an excellent developerment environment


1767003
copy-paste	paste
Pattern(s): 5	
i copy-paste and paste the output into an editor notepad++ which told me there were only 2000 characters not 2009 which is what i think should have been paste


1767222
integer	zero
Pattern(s): 0	
if your content is an integer and you want the trigger to fire when it is greater than zero you will have to use


1767488
windows-server	windows
Pattern(s): 7	
for instance windows-server 2008 is much better at managing large objects in memory than xp


1768222
push	pull
Pattern(s): 10	8	
i have found that pull is more scalable than push


1769129
pointers	stack
Pattern(s): 5	
in the non static case a pointers will be allocated on stack and initialized to point in .rodata at each function call


1769414
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 10	8	
postgresql is more sql compliant than mysql


1770241
httpwebrequest	webclient
Pattern(s): 5	
note that the same code can be used against webclient as httpwebrequest


1770959
integer	zero
Pattern(s): 0	
i used kernel-package to compile and i also added a new system call to return an arbitrary integer value greater than zero


1771126
silverlight	xbap
Pattern(s): 0	
they ll probably restrict the use of unsafe code and pinvoke in silverlight 4 to a greater degree than in xbap


1771421
substr	substring
Pattern(s): 1	
obviously i can t use something as simple as substring because it might leave tags unclosed or even leave half a tag


1771577
spring	appfuse
Pattern(s): 5	
spring 3 final is soon to be released and appfuse is based on 2.5


1771849
silverlight	xbap
Pattern(s): 5	
however imo silverlight 4 would appear to deliver enough to give those who might have considered xbap pause for thought


1771934
extend	methods
Pattern(s): 5	
there are several ways to accomplish this but probably the most versatile and rails-ish would be to create a module with a methods to do the ranking and then have any classes or associations that can be liked extend that module


1772076
asp.net	webforms
Pattern(s): 1	
having said that i need to point out that division into layers may not help very much with asp.net webforms project


1772331
http	https
Pattern(s): 5	
not every page on your adfs web app needs to be accessed via http


1772887
java	scala
Pattern(s): 1	
as a language java is far behind c# but scala runs on jvm is as good as c# and it s performance is nearly same as java and also it can use all jdk and other java code as his library


1772948
joptionpane	jdialog
Pattern(s): 0	
usually when people want more flexibility than joptionpane offers it s basically a bunch of static factories for a few dialogs they write their own dialogs using jdialog


1773183

a parameterless constructor is generally more descriptive than passing null you can make it private if you only use it from within the class


1774186
c++	python
Pattern(s): 8	
we are using gae to host our web services as far as i know gae only support java and python at the moment however most of our engineers here are more comfortable with c++ so i was wondering if there is a way to integrate gsoap with gae at all

1776455
haskell	ocaml
Pattern(s): 7	
haskell has higher level bindings to llvm than ocaml the haskell ones provide some interesting type safety guarantees and haskell has by far more libraries to use 1700 packages on making it easier to glue together components


1777234
serialization	serializable
Pattern(s): 5	
i haven t tried it but it has the attribute serializable and so can be de serialization with .net binary serialization soapformatter

the problem comes for the container types you have used and the complexity of the xaml it has produced the canvas is absolute positioning and shouldn t be used for scale really


1778039
routes	controllers
Pattern(s): 10	
since the controllers is no longer in the url of your route aka you don t have controllers in the route url but it s a default value you need to make sure to specify the controllers when generating routes

this only works if the first operand is larger than zero but at least it s short and confusing


1779624
line	lines
Pattern(s): 0	
i can t imagine this taking up more than 20 line of python


1780062
line	lines
Pattern(s): 0	
i think everyone would agree that if you are doing more than 5-10 line that an anonymous inner class is not a good idea i would say more than 2 is too much


1780262
decrement	increment
Pattern(s): 4	
executing an instruction requires first iterating over the denominator checking if the indexed state element is at least the specified value then if it matches decrement state elements specified in the denominator and increment those specified in the numerator

1786428
md5	hash
Pattern(s): 0

Pattern(s): 4	
i ve heard of built with zend framework and but that is ruby on rails i d prefer php for ease of deployment and hosting...


1786810

1786996
vim	emacs
Pattern(s): 10	
on today s machines that s a non-issue but if you ever find yourself dealing with older gear it s my experience that vim is far more likely to work on a wonky terminal than emacs is

1800653
c++	python
Pattern(s): 0	
as myyn suggested something like beautifulsoup or hpricot really excels at this sort of thing so if you aren t absolutely convinced that it has to be in c++ you really should look into those the basics of both python and ruby can be picked up pretty quickly and are certainly much simpler than c++


1800864
public	protected
Pattern(s): 5	
i have some attributes which are const so should these attributes be made public or protected

Pattern(s): 4	
in terms of long-term maintainability asp.net-mvc will simply blow webforms out of the water


1807116
asp.net-mvc	wcf
Pattern(s): 0	
i suppose the wcf serializer could possibly be faster than the asp.net-mvc one but the bottleneck is always going to be getting this data across the wire


1807441
set	any
Pattern(s): 4	
if you want to set a cookie -- including the cookie that s used to hold a session id -- with all subdomains you would need to set the domain property to .domain.com -- note the leading dot which allows the browser to match any domain that ends with domain.com

valueconverter	converter
Pattern(s): 7	
barry yeah i figured it s a step deeper to dwell into baseten but i m the fidgety impatient sort o it wasn t too difficult to grok the basics of binding and such even lead me to implementing a valueconverter or is it transformer


1814936
var	this
Pattern(s): 5	
it dereferences the pointer in your case p should be defined as var p type and accesses a variable in the record in this case rlink and llink

haskell	scala
Pattern(s): 5	5	
what can be done in haskell that can t be done in scala

1815928
contains	any
Pattern(s): 4	
this would erase any id3 and other header information contains in the file and probably destroy any exploit attempts gd would probably choke on such a file and return an error


1815945

Pattern(s): 5	
however the app now cannot be debugged it throw an exception configurationerrorexception


1818742
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 5

receive the response one of the options to be returned is csv or xml


1820968
line	lines
Pattern(s): 7	
afaik from eclipse 3.5 m4 on the formatter has an option never join line which preserves user line breaks


1820997
contains	elements
Pattern(s): 0	
if probs contains fewer than 100 elements you ll get that exception for trying to read past the end


1821607
readability	code-readability
Pattern(s): 4	
it favors code-readability


1821640
controllers	controller
Pattern(s): 10	
but thats getting stuck more on the old procedural||static paradigm of pages because really the action controllers itself has no more to do with a page or section than the association you make as a developer


1821743
upgrade	versioning
Pattern(s): 5	
also bioconductor is a particularly fast moving project and you ll typically be asked to upgrade to the latest versioning of r in order to get any continued support help on the bioc mailing list


1822114
arrays	map
Pattern(s): 0	
are there other publicly-available open-source frameworks with an associate arrays class that uses an underlying data structure that would perform better than stl map


1822596
json	xml
Pattern(s): 5	
also consider the response will be served in xml and json soon


1822866
perl	c++
Pattern(s): 0	
then sun developed jdbc and servlets for java and then other j2ee pieces and java became a higher performance alternative to perl and easier than c++


1822901
value	field
Pattern(s): 0	
since these less than and more than value typically only apply at the ends of the range such a convention allows handling all filtering and ordering with a single field value in a standard fashion


1823057
testng	junit
Pattern(s): 10	
if you have to do a lot of this honestly testng is more flexible but you can absolutely get it done in junit


1823496
checkbox	button
Pattern(s): 5	
default alignment is roughly equal to stringformat.alignment stringalignment.center it can be changed for button and checkbox with their textalign property


1823851
int	nsinteger
Pattern(s): 4	
there s a similar question here on so.com in cocoa do you prefer nsinteger or int and why


1823851
int	nsinteger
Pattern(s): 3	
i prefer using nsinteger because it s future-proof apple now uses it over int and it s the recommended way of doing things


1823900
throw	throws
Pattern(s): 0	
but if the script which takes a longer time more than 5mins throw an exception saying


1824417
line	lines
Pattern(s): 0	
i was going to insert all the code in here i m going to release the script as lgpl anyway but the code is more than 150 line still in development


1825371
udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 4	
udp makes sense if you want to make your stream multicast otherwise i would prefer tcp because it is more reliable


1825484
apc	memcached
Pattern(s): 0	
apc have less feature than memcached and is easly to use and optimize but this depends on your needs


1825595
key	key-value
Pattern(s): 0	
but for experienced perl programmers the format key-value looks clearer than key-value


1825857
java	python
Pattern(s): 7	0	
i m just wondering if python is a better option than java or c# for scientific apps


1826194
subtraction	addition
Pattern(s): 8	
for the sake of completeness i would like to mention another less powerful algorithm with addition subtraction


1826379
line	lines
Pattern(s): 0	
this seems to me like something that should take no more than 2-5 line of code but i can t seem to find anything but huge long examples involving 3rd party packages etc


1826662
line	lines
Pattern(s): 5	
when dealing with plain text what limits should i set on line size and number of lines on a page to get it to print reasonably


1827397
colorbox	simplemodal
Pattern(s): 4	
simplemodal has a similar function but i much prefer colorbox s implementation and documentation otherwise i d use the latter


1827621
32-bit	64bit
Pattern(s): 10	
i don t know about your other issues but the reason the 32-bit version is the more visible one by default is that most plugins still don t have 64bit versions eg


1827661
http	https
Pattern(s): 10	8	
https is more cpu intensive than http


1827764
inner-join	join
Pattern(s): 8	
now i want to make a slightly more complex query with inner-join not just table data extracting


1828255
listener	listeners
Pattern(s): 0	
just having more than one listener on document.ready should not really slow things down - it s lilkely either the code that runs on those listeners or the amount of code you are loading


1828569
.net	compact-framework
Pattern(s): 5	
i was involved in development of a simple in-house mime parser took few days to hack and parsed 95 of received emails which envolved into a commercial product few months of work tons of unittest and hudreds of really vierd test emails from the wild and then was modified so it can be used in compact-framework changes because of memory-constrained devices changes because only small portion of .net framework is ported to .net cf


1828585
set	any
Pattern(s): 5	
another alternative if you want to set up a method that can be overloaded with any user-supplied function or with another of the object s methods is build a custom descriptor


1828611
line	lines
Pattern(s): 7	
the advantage of this approach is that the code that cleans up the line now handles fewer characters for each invocation and should execute much faster even though more invocations are needed


1828700
c++	python
Pattern(s): 10	
i m guessing c++ is faster than python and can probably handle larger files more intense algos


1829564
line	lines
Pattern(s): 0	
the properties file in this case is fewer than 30 line 30 key value pairs


1830229
swing	javafx
Pattern(s): 5	
we found this 100 swing component called flexgantt and curious to know whether there are any specific requirements for a swing component to be run in javafx environment before we actually spend time to learn javafx


1830649
value	field
Pattern(s): 10	
sscanf returns the number of matches that succeeded so if the integer value returned is less than the number of field you expected to match you know the string doesn t match your input format


1830829
height	width
Pattern(s): 0	0	
such that a landscape image would have an ideal height of 300 or slightly larger with a width 400 and a portrait image would have an ideal width of 400 or slightly larger with a height 300


1830870
serialization	serializable
Pattern(s): 5	
nope each one will have to be marked as serialization specifically


1830904
asp.net	.net
Pattern(s): 4	
i would easily choose .net as a platform with asp.net mvc nhibernate


1831212
c++	python
Pattern(s): 0	0	
when i used long longs the c++ was about 100x faster than the python but when i used gmp bindings in c++ it was only 10x faster than the python for the same cases that fit in long longs


1831704
derived-class	base-class
Pattern(s): 5	
1 .yes the interface function prototype has to be same else base-class function get hidden by derived-class function if parameter defers in derived-class function


1831734
launch	startup
Pattern(s): 5	
however it seems every time i launch the app from the homescreen the cache version of the page is used instead of refreshing the page and of course i need the page to be updated on startup and cannot use ajax here - need to dynamically authenticate the user with sso phpcas


1831864
php	ruby
Pattern(s): 5	
i don t know which technology you are proficient in but this can be done in ruby on rails php asp.net and more


1832724
http	ssl
Pattern(s): 5	
calls will be made over ssl if the scheme is http


1833706
windows-mobile	symbian
Pattern(s): 10	
compared to platforms like symbian brew and j2me windows-mobile is much more advantageous for new developers


1833866
derived-class	base-class
Pattern(s): 7	
the first is that the author of the derived-class has much more information than the author of the base-class


1834347
java	python
Pattern(s): 7	
i don t think there are many things comparably easy for c# or java - at least that so seemlessly handle passing numerical arrays of different types although i guess proponents would argue since they don t have the performance penalty of python there is less need to


1834753
linq	linq-to-sql
Pattern(s): 1	
i would much rather use linq-to-sql or linq if not possible with linq-to-sql to figure out the running totals so i can just set datagridview.datasource to my data


1834829
ruby	python
Pattern(s): 1	
i would like know if development with python is as enjoyable as ruby in terms of the clarity and ease of use


1835023
jinja2	mako
Pattern(s): 2	
or you can choose between mako genshi jinja2 or whatever you like for your templates


1835765
.war	war
Pattern(s): 10	
with the springsource server each .war file is deployed more or less traditionally but can access resources classes services etc. via the normal osgi mechanisms


1835794
assign	add
Pattern(s): 5	
if i want user b to have certain access to all directories i either have to add them to a group or assign them to a role which in turn must be created or assign to directories


1835795
c++	python
Pattern(s): 1	
i have pretty good experience with c++ objective-c cocoa familiar with python


1835817

Pattern(s): 5	
local sequence cannot be used in linq-to-sql implementation of query operators except the contains operator.


1836050
jquery	dojo
Pattern(s): 4	
i recommend dojo but others use jquery yui etc.


1836371
java	python
Pattern(s): 5	
it s an unpleasant habit of java coders that should not be seen in python


1836838
double-quotes	single-quotes
Pattern(s): 7	
i used to suggest you use double-quotes everywhere makes it easier to actually add that later on but i now use single-quotes unless i need interpolation n etc.


1836869
nant	msbuild
Pattern(s): 5	
obviously msbuild will continue to advance but given all the extra tasks that can be accomplished using nant why has development suddenly stopped given that many open source and i assume commercial applications depend on nant


1837438
key	key-value
Pattern(s): 5	
i mean the data structure that is a collection of pairs key-value where values can be acceded using key


1837842
serialization	serializable
Pattern(s): 5	
should never be used if serialization


1838114
scite	notepad++
Pattern(s): 0	
by the way if you like minimalistic approach there is also scite editor which is my personal preference for doing small bits of code it s even more lightweight than notepad++


1838134
children	nodes
Pattern(s): 7	
the heap property each nodes is greater than or equal to each of its children


1838575
postback	ajax
Pattern(s): 5	
all this could also be done using ajax but iframe solution is quite easy as you just need to load ready page and all postback are already handled by original page and separated from master-admin-page


1839215
arcgis	arcgis-server
Pattern(s): 10	
for new apis built upon arcgis-server it feels better on resources.esri.com - at least there are many samples and there s also community part that rocks


1839294
callback	methods
Pattern(s): 1	
if you have any experience at all with delphi you re already familiar with callback methods under a different name event handlers


1839558

1840324
richfaces	icefaces
Pattern(s): 5	
as far i know integrating icefaces an richfaces will be possible when theirs jsf 2.0 versions will be released in icefaces 2.0 and richfaces 4.0


1840568
multiplication	division
Pattern(s): 7	0	
if a remains the same and b is changing say if your code is in a loop and it s clear that a does not change between two iterations for instance because it s a const variable then the original version can execute faster because multiplication is cheaper than division assuming the compiler moves the computation of 1 .


1840723
oracle	mysql
Pattern(s): 8	
it s sql is much more ansi-compliant than mysql - so later using oracle sql server sqlite etc should be very straight-forward


1840999
oracle	postgresql
Pattern(s): 4	
the biggest reason why i recommend postgresql to people who have more oracle mssql experience as opposed to mysql is that the sql syntaxes and general feel of the database engine match pretty closely


1841520
asp.net-mvc	webforms
Pattern(s): 5	
lets say i have a asp.net webforms application but i want any new pages to be written using asp.net-mvc could i create a new asp.net-mvc project and then jack it in as an area into the existing webforms application


1841772
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 0	
i ve found that postgresql is in my expirience is slower as mysql


1841996
png	gif
Pattern(s): 7	
a 8-bit png shim is smaller than the same dimension 1 pixel gif and everything will still work as planned

cell	cells
Pattern(s): 5	
in this example items is an nsarray that holds the values to be added as cell to the table


1842236
php	python
Pattern(s): 10	
python is better suited for practically anything that doesn t fall within php s specialty domain which is building websites


1842472
binary-tree	tree
Pattern(s): 7	
unfortunately even for a very large file 48 000 lines my new binary-tree is slower than the old one


1842741
derived-class	base-class
Pattern(s): 5	
since construtor cannot be inherited so base-class data members are to be initialized by passying argument in derived-class constructor and with the help of initialization list


1843182
min	minimum
Pattern(s): 5	
if the equal amount of cards is to be removed removing 1 4 or 3 2 the group with the minimum of the minimum will be removed in the previous example 1 4 will be removed as min min 3 2 min 1 4 belongs to that pair


1843790
php	python
Pattern(s): 7	
it s not that php can t do it but python just does it better and less buggy


1844416
git-commit	git-diff
Pattern(s): 5	
the differences shown by git-diff --cached are what will be committed on git-commit


1845139
parsing	comma
Pattern(s): 5	
it s pretty easy to parsing with either a bunch of splits or regex s until you find out that values can have backticked comma also they can be double quote marked which makes life hard


1845202
aspect	aspects
Pattern(s): 7	
aspects security offers a smaller set of 3 day conference like training options


1845815
height	width
Pattern(s): 5	
i m trying to create a div which will have fixed width and flexible height here is the picture which i want to use for background


1845975

1847130
design-time	designer
Pattern(s): 5	
if you are using entity framework v4 and visual studio 2010 then access mode can be set in design-time using entity designer by setting the necessary value to the entity container access property of the model


1847205
screens	switching
Pattern(s): 4	
the advantage of this dual-natured solution is that the tabbed approach will work the way you want it to work for the majority of cases but for users with say two screens or who prefer switching between browser tabs they will still have the flexibility to work in multi-window mode


1847325
base	digits
Pattern(s): 10	
if your numbers are integers then you can verify -- using integer arithmetic -- that one power of the base is less than or equal to your number and the next is above it the first power is the number of digits


1847576
binary-search-tree	tree
Pattern(s): 5	
you seem to have implemented a binary-search-tree not a b-tree


1849028

delphi	pascal
Pattern(s): 4	
i prefer delphi pascal but i can read other languages if the example isn t overly complex


1849455
cassini	iis

while iis does give us better performance than cassini we would still like to be able to hit f5 to run our application from within visual studio


1850640
ruby	python
Pattern(s): 7	0	
so this thread is definitely not a thread for why python is better than ruby or the inverse


1850640
ruby-on-rails	django
Pattern(s): 4	
again don t compare ruby-on-rails vs django


1850743
ruby	python
Pattern(s): 10	
imho python is more mature - there are more libraries for it although ruby may be catching up and the included libraries i think are better designed


1851303
swing	awt
Pattern(s): 5	
also you should not be overriding the paint and upated method of japplet this is old awt code and should not be used with swing


1851623
points	uniform
Pattern(s): 0	
it should result in nice well-distributed points that should be better than uniform pseudorandom samples for most scenes though could result in horrifying artifacts in some circumstances


1851773
json	xml
Pattern(s): 0	
i tend to use json when working in web applications because it is a lot smaller than xml because it doesnt require the bloat that the nodes create


1852321
height	width
Pattern(s): 0	
however this does not take into account the space taken by the notification bar or window decorations so in reality you have less space than width times height


1852561
inner-join	join
Pattern(s): 10	
it s a strange thing to want to do as commenters say inner-join is usually better and applying a mechanical transformation proves nothing but not difficult


1852818
silverlight	wpf
Pattern(s): 7	0	
so for future project development this may drive demand for sl4 over wpf particularly if there is a perception that silverlight development is cheaper than wpf if the learning curve is less for a subset technology although i don t agree with that sentiment myself


1853219
quicksort	heapsort
Pattern(s): 0	
however quicksort s worst-case performance is significantly worse than heapsort s is


1853707

1854769
32-bit	64bit
Pattern(s): 5	
even if you are allowed to compile in 32-bit mode anyone else can configure it to be run in 64bit application pool mistakenly


1855045
arguments	undefined
Pattern(s): 5	
type-checking in javascript is non-existent you can pass fewer arguments into a function than are declared in the function ... signature in which case the arguments that aren t passed get received as undefined and you can pass more than declared in which case the only way to read them is through the arguments array which always contains exactly how many arguments were passed in regardless of what s in the function signature


1856019
lxml	html5lib
Pattern(s): 4	
out of these i would recommend lxml html5lib and beautifulsoup


1856165
arrays	loops
Pattern(s): 10	
it s a question of whether or not repeating the if test inside loops is less efficient that another traversal of the arrays


1856196
controllers	controller
Pattern(s): 10	
if the state of the unit changes between the time the referring page is rendered and the actual call comes in to the controllers it is not longer ok then the use of an exception to handle that event seems perfectly fine to me like having an exception when an optimistic locking error occurs


1857374
subclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 5	
since we want the newlines to be preserved we subclassing optionparser and change the behaviour of format_epilog


1857451
contains	elements
Pattern(s): 0	
however because the server has sent several messages the byte stream will contains the xml for more than one elements and when it is deserialized a multiple root exception is thrown


1858034
asp.net	asp.net-mvc
Pattern(s): 7	
i have not benchmarked the performance in the two but my experience says that asp.net-mvc is easier to configure on iis7 than on iis6 especially when you are on a shared hosting


1858240
line	lines
Pattern(s): 0	
there are also a few issues when the ball intersects more than one line in a given frame imagine four lines together making a rectangle and the ball intersecting the corner of said rectangle -- which direction should it bounce off

java	python
Pattern(s): 5	
lots of companies have big globs of java code that can be scripted with python


1860693
arrays	loops
Pattern(s): 0	
if you want more than two arrays or variable number of arrays then you might be able to use a nested loops though i think you d need to have and as the individual arrays


1860789
line	lines
Pattern(s): 8	0	
this is made more complicated as lines in the script could actually span more than one line if it is statement or block of code


1861242
tcp-ip	tcp
Pattern(s): 4	
the universal concensus is that unix domain sockets outperform tcp-ip


1861272
set	any
Pattern(s): 4	
simply put each bank organisation is given access to a certain set of prefixes numbers at the start and depending on the level of detail you want you can match any card number to an organisation using the prefix


1861532
java	python
Pattern(s): 0	
python itself is not really good with concurrency and is slower than java anyway


1861726
contains	any
Pattern(s): 5	
you can deploy stand alone custom pages with 100 of your own code and it will run under sharepoint or you can create new application pages that also contains any code you want to write or you can simply add your own webparts that can be added to any page you choose with 100 of your own code


1862934
process	interprocess
Pattern(s): 7	
on the other hand if your process need to chatter a lot option one is the way to go because the interprocess communication is way cheaper than communication between different vms

Pattern(s): 5	
can eclipse be used to building appropriate targets which can then reference the common stuff when running in a live environment


1863782
windows-vista	windows

the rope data structure as a binary-tree is better in certain situations


1864490
line	lines

1864658
ms-access	sql-server
Pattern(s): 1	
i would really rather use ms-access over sql-server so that i can distribute my database with my program rather then connecting to some remote sql-server


1864784
order	add
Pattern(s): 5	
after you have these simple cases working it will be easy to find the element in an order list that is the first one larger than the element to be inserted and add the element in front of the larger one


1864891
ruby	python
Pattern(s): 0	
there s no way the ruby devs would have a hash function that s an order of magnitude worse than python s

this createchildcontrols method is part of the control inherited hierarchy and is typically overriden by subclassing controls


1868485
sealed	implements
Pattern(s): 5	
i ve been thinking about this question for a bit and after a bit of consideration i agree that implements and should only be done on sealed types


1869151
java	python
Pattern(s): 10	
i love python and despite what everyone says my python is better because i know java


1869474
environment	building
Pattern(s): 10	10	
the second option - switching to a fully unix-like building environment is more involved and extends far beyond what editor you will be using


1869622
asp.net-mvc	webforms
Pattern(s): 10	
i know this is probably a case where asp.net-mvc is better but i need to use webforms


1870150
void	main
Pattern(s): 5	
note this static main method must be defined as void return type and it can either take no arguments or it can be defined to take an array of strings to be passed as command line arguments


1870299
http	https
Pattern(s): 5	
the site needs to be hosted on https and we don t control the video so i m assuming it needs to be on http


1870484
java	scala
Pattern(s): 2	
playframework is totally mvc with a fantastic template engine and allows you to choose freely between java scala


1870710
photoshop	fireworks
Pattern(s): 8	
i have fireworks 8 as well as photoshop cs3 on my windows pc but i m more familiar with fireworks


1871257
execution	jobs
Pattern(s): 5	
i thought that creating and scheduling multiple jobs would actually cause multiple worker threads to be created execution the jobs in parallel unless there was an ischedulingrule conflict


1871278
javascript	dom
Pattern(s): 0	
there are so many ways to do this but dom manipulation will almost always be slower than javascript manipulation


1871301
jquery	jqtransform
Pattern(s): 3	
yes i would also recommend using jquery a very nice plugin is the jqtransform plugin


1871713
ogre	irrlicht
Pattern(s): 5	
you can find a step by step tutorial that shows you how to get started with irrlicht here and with ogre here


1872552
upgrade	versioning

spring roo seams to be very similar to seam just that seam is longer there and more mature


1928171
linux	unix
Pattern(s): 5	
if i was running the shop i would skip the eval and begin by selling them on using ironpython because i think it is a better choice in the long run and python skills can be leveraged on linux unix projects or java projects as well as in .net


1928209
javascript	dom
Pattern(s): 0	
on intranet bandwidth isn t a bottleneck old clunky ie javascript engine might be so i d say send generated html even in better browsers native parsing of html fragments should be faster than building dom with javascript


1928623
difference	factors
Pattern(s): 0	
this can realistically differ by a factors of 4 way more than the difference in clock frequency you re likely to encounter


1929951
throw	throws
Pattern(s): 5	
single expects only one row to be returned and throw an exception if there are multiple rows


1930483
udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 10	
tcp windowing is more expensive than raw udp but if you use udp to go faster and add a custom loss-recovery or seqno ack resend manager then that may slow you down again


1931454
json	xml
Pattern(s): 5	
input format could be changed to xml or yaml in adition to json listed above but i am using json within the project and changing format in specific place would not be very good


1931826
show	next
Pattern(s): 0	
if you find traditional for loops simpler than next any and all let us know and we ll show how to recode these uses of the higher abstraction forms into those lower-layer concepts


1932105
value	field
Pattern(s): 4	
friendinfo contain friendid and some other field relative to friend info which are quine in this table and iteminfo contain the itemid as primary key and friend id as foreign key i want to execute the join query which select value from friendinfo table based on friendid and also select item from iteminfo based on same friendid


1932229
hex	binary
Pattern(s): 4	
i ve used both otool and otx to disassemble various binaries and i ve found the easiest way to edit them is to figure out what the assembly of the new code i want is using nasm or similar then just use a hex editor i prefer hex fiend on the binary file


1932233
forwarding	port
Pattern(s): 5	
setup router whatever router you re sitting behind will need to be configured to forwarding port 80 or a development port like 8080 to your local ip address


1932632
erlang	python
Pattern(s): 0	
i m not sure whether this is better than python wsgi like django middleware and there is already ewgi for erlang


1933259
unmanaged	c++-cli
Pattern(s): 4	
if you don t have unmanaged interop needs or don t have to work with a legacy code base then there are few reasons to select c++-cli


1934512
java	python
Pattern(s): 4	
do you want the python details spelled out or do you prefer java


1934610
authorization	authentication
Pattern(s): 10	
especially in customer off-the-shelf applications authentication is generally more naturally handled by the application


1934735
javascript-framework	dojo
Pattern(s): 7	0	
once you do fully understand how ajax works by the way you may probably want to move to a javascript-framework that makes it easier such as jquery dojo or google s closure


1934809
vb.net	vb6
Pattern(s): 0	
i d say vb6 is still ok for throw away prototyping and probably better than vb.net in that regard


1935145
double	int
Pattern(s): 0	
you re getting the outofmemory because if you declare int 1000 the memory is allocated immediately additionally double take up more space than ints-an int representation will also save you space


1935264
apc	memcached
Pattern(s): 7	
memcached has more overhead since you have to use a tcp connection to access it versus just a function call for apc xcache shared objects


1935450
denormalized	denormalization
Pattern(s): 7	
but i wouldn t start out denormalization it s more code and arguably premature optimisation


1935468
operators	bitwise-operators
Pattern(s): 5	
it can be done using bitwise-operators and |


1935994
simpletest	phpunit
Pattern(s): 4	
if you prefer phpunit i think you can fairly easily use simpletest s browser from within phpunit


1936043
trac	redmine
Pattern(s): 7	
i understand redmine is more of a trac clone but retrospectiva seem to support agile methodologies via a nice plugin


1936076
.net	wcf
Pattern(s): 7	
wcf is a bit more evolved than the original web-services offered in .net and has better wse support although asmx can be extended via wse3


1936148
php	python
Pattern(s): 10	
furthermore php may be able to produce applications outside of webservers and clis but is definitely aimed at those two environments while python is more all purpose


1936372
swing	awt
Pattern(s): 5	
the code is based on old awt painting techniques which should not be used with swing


1936659
crystal-reports	business-objects
Pattern(s): 4	
if you are willing to pay for a commercial bi solution i would recommend crystal-reports and business-objects


1936677
version-control	git
Pattern(s): 0	
git and svn and mercurial etc is great for version-control but keeping systems in sync often requires more than version-control


1936919
c++	python
Pattern(s): 0	
perhaps something like c++ would actually be a better example than python for that reason


1936968
quicksort	bubble-sort
Pattern(s): 10	8	
i vote for quicksort which is more elegant than bubble-sort and easier to understand too


1937120
jquery	scriptaculous
Pattern(s): 1	
drag drop mechanism is relatively easy with jquery or scriptaculous we use both so i am willing to accept an answer that uses either of these two


1937130
aspect	aspects
Pattern(s): 10	
no doubts you should go directly to d2010 not to d2009 - in this aspects d2010 is actually more like d2009 sp1 than a fully new version just with some nice additions like an updated rtti


1937150
line	lines
Pattern(s): 5	
there also appears to be highlighted line along polygon edges


1937370
postgresql	mysql

Pattern(s): 7	
i want to loop through this sorted dictionary and change the key to key+1 if the key-value is greater than a certain amount


1937974
category	categories
Pattern(s): 0	
categories can contain other categories and products and products can belong to more than one category


1938404
mouse	click
Pattern(s): 5	
but it will stop js executing really at any event - so if you have a button which catches mouse move and mouse click - i will not be able to stop on mouse click since script will be stopped at mouse move each time you try to move mouse over this button


1938783
perl	python
Pattern(s): 4	
i prefer python to perl


1939539
http	https
Pattern(s): 5	
however whenever the user lands on a page where we ask for credit card details we want these details to be sent over http


1939678
settimeout	window.open
Pattern(s): 5	
you should be okay with window.open because you re calling it in direct response to a click by the user make sure you re calling it from the event handler or a function called by the event handler not after a settimeout or some such


1941649
haskell	prolog
Pattern(s): 7	0	
the conclusion that the authors come to is that expressing at least some of these types of problems in haskell is easier than in prolog primarily because the haskell type system makes it easier to come up with nice representations of search states and moves from state to state


1941864
single-table-inheritance	activerecord
Pattern(s): 7	
activerecord provides much more functionalities such as translations scoping in queries or support for single-table-inheritance


1941873
.when	ready
Pattern(s): 5	
i want to be notified somehow .when a message is ready in input stream


1942016
internet-explorer	firefox
Pattern(s): 0	
i m not sure if they re still as pervasive now as they were in years past but they re one of the reasons why internet-explorer is so much less secure than firefox and other browsers


1942020
c++	python
Pattern(s): 5	
what is a recommended way to import a bunch of constants defined in a c-style not c++ just plain old c .h file into python module so that it can be used in python s part of a project


1942272
asp.net	webforms
Pattern(s): 1	
this is a very common complaint with asp.net webforms and unfortunately there s not much you can do about it

.when	ready
Pattern(s): 5	
wrap the statement in so it will get called .when the document is ready


1943007
loops	nested-loops
Pattern(s): 1	
obviously this is not optimal code with nested-loops and unnecessary point objects


1943120
value	field
Pattern(s): 5	
under each text field there is a php section where you can run some php code to get allowed value


1943159
inner-join	join
Pattern(s): 7	
inner-join is the longer version of alex brasetvik s answer


1943166
duplicates	elements
Pattern(s): 4	
assuming you really want to select elements with a given class which is more correct as there should not be elements with duplicates id and if there are exactly one element with class searchfield for each elements selected by then you can use


1943198
defined	declare
Pattern(s): 5	
since in your example externalfunction is not declare within the scope of the function it is global or at least in whatever scope it may have been defined in outside ready


1944716
directory	folder
Pattern(s): 5	
however i think that you should be able to use linked folder so that you have a eclipse project directory which is basically empty but for a .project file and a linked folder which points to your source tree


1945343
controllers	controller
Pattern(s): 7	
maybe it s a good idea to make a separate controllers for each component and then the big form has its own controllers which controls the smaller ones


1945433
linked-list	nodes
Pattern(s): 7	
each nodes can point to the previous and next nodes it is easier to add nodess to the end of a linked-list


1946302
line	lines
Pattern(s): 0	
the console application code had less than 200 line of code and was basically loading the projectviewmodel and doing operations on it


1946810
asp.net-mvc	webforms
Pattern(s): 4	
so if you re going to develop a web app that relies heavily on ajax then webforms may just beat asp.net-mvc


1946875
local-variables	instance-variables
Pattern(s): 0	
setting local-variables with the locals option is simpler and much more dry than using instance-variables


1946930
mobile-safari	safari
Pattern(s): 5	
this will all be done in mobile-safari


1946932
udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 10	8	
btw i concur that udp is far more appropriate than tcp in this case


1946968
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 10	
i would say personally i find foreach a bit more readable over for-loops but you should use the best for the job at hand and not have to write extra long code to include a foreach loop if a for-loop is more appropriate


1947132
var	this
Pattern(s): 7	
this line works as a ternary operator because the expression returns 1 or 0 depending on whether var is bigger than 65 or not


1947136
var	this
Pattern(s): 7	
this expression will return true equivalent to 1 thus picking retired if the value of var is greater than 65


1947407
line	lines
Pattern(s): 0	
we have a handful of asp.net pages that include more than 50+ line of javascript specific to that page


1947694

Pattern(s): 0	
if cs has the no pad characteristic then the pad character is an implementation-dependent character different from any character in the character set of x and y that collates less than any string under cs


1948765
mouse	keyboard
Pattern(s): 4	
i find most users prefer keyboard data entry as opposed to mouse click data entry - it is a lot faster


1948986
haskell	python
Pattern(s): 10	8	
as a purely functional language haskell basically mandates that one program in a declarative functional style so hands-down haskell is more functional than python


1949361
getter-setter	getter
Pattern(s): 4	
depending on your language you should prefer getter-setter up front because you can t introduce them later i m looking at you java if it turns out you do need them


1949368
strcpy	strncpy
Pattern(s): 4	2	
not related to the leak but if you know the length prefer strncpy over strcpy


1950136
line	lines
Pattern(s): 4	
using the ddms logcat window you can select line and copy and paste text to other windows


1950416
http	https

it then said folder d projects test will be bound to http mycomputer 443 svn test trunk . then i clicked finished


1950600
atomicity	atomic
Pattern(s): 5	
unlike other propositions pseudo-propositions can not be analyzed into atomicity pictures and their combinations and therefore they are not pictures of the world

sql-server	mysql
Pattern(s): 8	
i don t know which version of mysql you re running and i m more familiar with sql-server than mysql


1951108
loops	nested-loops
Pattern(s): 10	
the nested-loops solution is definitely faster than parallel query - see edit 4 below


1951120
spring	grails
Pattern(s): 7	
i personally don t believe learning spring and hibernate is worth it unless you have a good job related reason to grails is much easier to use


1951271
decrement	increment
Pattern(s): 4	
having to go to memory more often than needed is much more expensive than compares increment or decrement


1952059
synchronous	.when
Pattern(s): 5	
but with a synchronous call the read data line will only be executed .when putting the data is complete


1952096
value	field
Pattern(s): 4	
i m having one text field normally when touch the text field keyboard will appear is it any possibilities where when text field is touch one drop down list will appear to recommend value to be enter and value is selected it will appear in texr field


1952274
set	any
Pattern(s): 5	
how we set or get focus on any control in cocoa


1952586
swt	jface
Pattern(s): 1	
i am trying to build a very simple gui with jface and swt - the code is straightforward there s plenty tutorials what it s not so straightforward is that i can t seem to get jface and swt to work outside a plugin project


1952762
width	display
Pattern(s): 0	
can anyone pls provide some reasons as to why my iframe that display a report within it shows a horizontal scrollbar even though the width of the report within it seems to be smaller than the width of the iframe

Pattern(s): 5	
be precise on margins width left alignement .


1953469
http	https
Pattern(s): 5

remote-debugging	debugging
Pattern(s): 5	
was can be configured for remote-debugging via the web administration console


1954346
fwrite	fclose
Pattern(s): 5	
fclose will flush any unwritten output via fflush before returning so the error results from the underlying write won t be reported at fwrite or fprintf time but when you do the fclose


1955016
asp.net	.net
Pattern(s): 0	
.net is used for more than just asp.net


1955109
callback	methods
Pattern(s): 0	
may be slower than functor methods for callback that can be statically computed at compile-time


1955443
boost-asio	boost
Pattern(s): 10	
another alternative is boost-asio which is more complicated


1955452
expression-blend	designer

messages	communication
Pattern(s): 4	
i will be using a message passing architecture to communication between my java components and i d like to efficiently match messages to actions


1956377
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 5	
unless you need to access its value after the for-loop ends leave the variable inside loops it will be closer to the code that uses it your code will be more readable and its scope will be bounded by loops itself your code will be more elegant and less bug-prone


1957626
latex	mathml
Pattern(s): 0	
i am developing an application for undergrads and i was looking for something less complex than latex and easier to write than mathml


1957727
line	lines
Pattern(s): 0	
functions should be as short as possible - as a general rule of thumb i will go back and see if it is practical to refactor any function longer than 20 line


1957876
erd	diagram
Pattern(s): 4	
personally i prefer erd diagram for databaser data models


1958204
line	lines
Pattern(s): 0	
there are more than 10000 line in this file


1958862
environment	restart
Pattern(s): 5	
this can be fixed by restart visual studio but restart my entire ide after every run cycle is not exactly conducive to a great coding environment


1959216
arrays	linked-list
Pattern(s): 7	0	
for most data types optimal sorting algorhitm is o n log n but keep in mind that some structures are still slower for instance sorting linked-list is slower than arrays athough both have n log n complexity


1959495
getter	setter
Pattern(s): 5	
this object may be composed of getter and setter but it is a model of a student and would thus be extremely useful in a database system


1959633
height	width
Pattern(s): 0	
my array larger than max height width but not max height max width


1959754
final	modifiers
Pattern(s): 5	
also regarding code like this will compile given a final modifiers on x


1959795
innodb	myisam
Pattern(s): 10	
anyone who thinks myisam is faster is either not tuning innodb correctly or has such small data that who cares


1959842
screens	switching
Pattern(s): 7	
when the switching gets bigger than a couple of screens full split it into functions that handle each state using a state table to look up the function directly

java	scala
Pattern(s): 5	
i ve completely replaced my server side processing data crunching that would previously be written in java with scala


1960286
oracle	mysql
Pattern(s): 0	
but i don t want to use oracle and want better performance than mysql


1960622
asp.net	.net
Pattern(s): 5	
while it could be done in asp.net in .net 2.0 it just isn t practical given the amount of work involved and the fact that it s already done for you in a later version of the framework


1961121
memmove	memcpy
Pattern(s): 0	
although in reality i find it hard to imagine the memmove could be faster than memcpy i don t discount the possibility


1961483
java	groovy
Pattern(s): 8	
for this particular use is there any reason why java would be more cumbersome than groovy or beanshell


1961714
tfs	vsts
Pattern(s): 10	
unless something has changed a lot with 2010 the basic vsts install is more or less the same as the pro version of vs - and then you install the team explorer on top to gain the tfs specific client-side extensions


1961871
visual-c++	turbo-c
Pattern(s): 1	
if it comes to understand a programming-language it is about the programming-language not about understanding now to configure an ide and the turbo-c compiler is as good as visual-c++ for learning the language caveat not for production code


1962499
selected	checkbox
Pattern(s): 10	
just remember that you re actually working with a multiple selected element that is just displayed as a bunch of checkbox which is imo better because of the usability


1962548
32-bit	64bit
Pattern(s): 7	
from the way that the application happens to be loaded into memory it may be that the 32-bit app on 32-bit windows and the 64bit app on 64bit windows get lucky no important memory locations are overwritten whereas the 32-bit app on 64bit windows is less lucky and crashes


1962687
asp.net	webforms
Pattern(s): 1	
something like asp.net webforms or jsf although jsf is not as bad as webforms


1962928
ati	nvidia
Pattern(s): 8	
4 is nvidia cuda technology is easier more flexible than ati brook+ language


1963403
pointers	stack
Pattern(s): 5	
inside the function that pointers would be typecast to stack object type then used in


1963703
abstract	implements
Pattern(s): 5	
this is one area where you may want to consider an abstract base class - there you can create protected abstract methods which inheritors can implements without exposing them to external callers


1963927
tree	nodes
Pattern(s): 5	
also thought of dfs traversal of the dom tree but again all xpath evaluators seem to return detached nodes where node.getparent will always return null


1964189
height	width
Pattern(s): 5	
how can i set width and height of a jface listviewer


1964408
asp.net	asp.net-mvc
Pattern(s): 4	
personally - i prefer asp.net-mvc framework and don t want to go back despite that in some cases it does take more work - implementation of custom pagination which can be easily made way more sophisticated than one that pagination control provides


1965421
asp.net-mvc	webforms
Pattern(s): 5	
the expectation of my framework is that you ll pass in the imodule s so it can easily be used in asp.net-mvc webforms etc


1965541
multiplication	division
Pattern(s): 0	
i haven t benchmarked any of this code but just by examining the code you can see that using integers division by 2 is shorter than multiplication by 2


1965643
ready	live
Pattern(s): 5	
drop in an .htaccess file to refuse connections from anyone but you and your client s ip and use this to make changes until the updates are ready to be pushed live


1965744
asp.net-mvc	webforms
Pattern(s): 0	
if you find yourself fighting the unit test model with webforms you will find things easier with asp.net-mvc


1966087
github	dropbox
Pattern(s): 0	
i think this can cause minor problems if there are more than a few people working on the same project but for personal projects i find dropbox to be even better than github if only for the fact that pushing pulling is faster


1966941
http	https
Pattern(s): 5	
i d imagine browsers assume cookies set via https shouldn t be transferred over http as they may be sensitive data


1967340
line	lines
Pattern(s): 0	
edit now the op s getting an error for trying to call this function in line 9 since this function definition is more than 9 lines it s probably getting called from module top-level rather than from within another function before it s defined in which case the simple fix is to call it only after it s defined


1967670
asp.net-mvc	wcf
Pattern(s): 5	
i am setting it up so that the public facing pages will be html from asp.net-mvc but the administration portion will be a silverlight navigation application using using wcf ria services for data access


1967903
category	categories
Pattern(s): 0	
in a yellow pages directory that non-technical people use who don t browse there every day and a structure is essential for carefully navigating towards the sought after branch or business tags could be counter-productive and the application far better off with category


1968394
pre-increment	post-increment
Pattern(s): 5	
++ can be used as post-increment operator like in your example or it could be used as a pre-increment operator if used before variable


1968467
linq	linq-to-dataset
Pattern(s): 7	
linq-to-dataset makes it easier and


1968580
selection	selected
Pattern(s): 5	
adding tabitems manually will create new control for every item and in selected area different elements will appear based on selection


1968640

Pattern(s): 0	
in particular it will throw an exception if the file doesn t exist the first two line have inappropriate data or there are less than two line


1968853
32-bit	64bit
Pattern(s): 5	
on intel the program can be compiled to 32-bit i386 and 64bit x86_64 versions


1969021
svn	revision
Pattern(s): 7	
also for the great simplicity of handling local revision mercurial is much simpler to setup use than svn as simple as hg init hg add hg commit


1969120
multiplication	addition
Pattern(s): 7	0	
of course it is 10 because the addition operator has a lower precedence than the multiplication operator and so 4 + 3 2 always means 4 + 3 2


1969372
line	lines
Pattern(s): 0	
there s not a lot of data more than 10000 line in the previously mentioned table in the database so i guess performance was not that important


1970160
innodb	myisam
Pattern(s): 7	0	
someone just told me that innodb is much better than myisam


1970176
innodb	myisam
Pattern(s): 4	2	
imho you should always prefer innodb over myisam because of the transactional support which is at the heart of every relational database system


1970242
innodb	myisam
Pattern(s): 5	
myisam is fast but may get currupted easily innodb is slow but is more stable thanks to transactions and foreign keys


1970258
innodb	myisam
Pattern(s): 4	
i do this all the time because i prefer innodb for the fks but i sometimes need myisam for the full-text search


1970470
winpe	windows
Pattern(s): 5	
by doing this the dialog is not dependent on any other windows files and can be run in winpe 2.0


1970931
progress-bar	progress
Pattern(s): 0	
if you report more than 100 times you will just be wasting time trying to report a finer detail than the progress-bar will helpfully display


1971941
rar	zip
Pattern(s): 5	
edit i forgot to mention that the files are generally going to be compressed archives zip rar and on occasion jpg images


1972630
ironpython	ironruby
