additionally if you want to put something somewhere other than stack you ll need to use pointers
otherwise you can have git commits older than the cvs ones which isn t that useful.
both use the activerecord pattern so you ll actually get your database tables back in objects without fancy domain logic but datamapper is way easier to work with and is thread-safe
i think using asp.net-mvc source is much better than reflector
it s a lot easier than ant fully compatible with eclipse use maven eclipse eclipse to create eclipse projects and easy to configure
with non-virutal inherited this is less tricky than you might think - at the point where the cast is compiled the compiler knows the exact layout of the derived-class after all the compiler did the layout
if you absolutely must resurrect objects this javaworld article suggests creating a fresh instance rather than resurrecting the instance being finalized because if the instance being finalized becomes eligible for collection again it will simply be collected the finalize won t be run again
it s supposed to be included in asp.net-mvc futures
this can be handled using sql like clause alongwith where-clause
whenever you mix padding with ie you start to lose control over width height
i also still don t understand and would love to be educated why httpserver plugins are necessary and we can t have a php webserver agnostic solution
css properties have corresponding entries in the html dom which can be modified through javascript
so while i prefer postgresql sql-server db2 etc. i find access to be of use from time to time when i need to move data around from one source to another
this seems like a good candidate for a table however so you might want to do more with category so it should be a reference table imo
ver_suite_smallbusiness microsoft small business server was once installed on the system but may have been upgrade to another versioning of windows
json has a smaller payload than equivalent xml
json is easier to deal with in javascript compare eval ing a json object to walking an xml fragment
keep in mind that 64bit integers have alignment restrictions at least as great as 32-bit integers on all platforms
if dynamic memory allocation is required it must be implemented using malloc and free of c types
i can t speak for symfony but i believe it s more heavyweight than cakephp
i would recommend sql-server express its free and can be redistributed with .net applications as part of the install process
it s not quite as nice as rubymine but it has built-in svn support and similar templates to textmate
the actual xml file is much larger as well as the xsd but it fails at the very beginning so i have reduced the problem to almost nothing
2 32 + 1 should be recognized as double even though it looks like int
the key field will be compared by value for an equality test instead of comparing the references to the two anonymous types
output can be exported to xml postscript csv or plain text
nb i am not implying that digest authentication over http is always more secure than using post over https
having - combined with + grouping+ this can be used to filtering the records that a grouping by returns
so you may need to do a loop that takes only part of the batch at a time but pretty much any number greater than one row at time will be faster than one row at a time this is slower than updating or inserting or deleting the whole batch but faster than row-by row operations and may be needed in a production environment with many users and little available downtime when users are not trying to see and updates other records in the same table
i am inclined to conclude that web-services are very different than web-applications and accept option 1 always stateless but it would be nice to hear other opinions based on real project experience
otherwise if the operand that has unsigned int type has rank greater or
troubleshooting the build maven is less reliable than ant especially the non-core plugins
receive returned integer value greater than zero
ruby 1.9.1 is about twice as fast as php and a little bit faster than perl according to some benchmarks
i can recommend common-lisp on sbcl
object may also be created from constructor functions
bazaar is more discoverable if you are given the tool wo any documentation any semi-competent user will be able to use bazaar that s not so true with git
bazaar is easier to extend in an api way git is easier to extend in a unix way pipes
if you are not comfortable with bash you can continue to work in a standard windows command dos shell
in general inline-code can do anything code-behind code can do the code-behind code is just cleaner and sepearates files
the first exe needs to be launched with elevated-privileges to invoke the second without a uac prompt
that said i found icefaces to be a useful product and much better than richfaces especially in terms of the quality of the documentation
the cbutton control can later contain other values as onclicked handlers are used for me to map selected radio-button values properly
you must have downloaded sql-server express cause that is what gets installed
honestly though postgresql scales much better than mysql
from a purely technical point of view all of the major rdbms vendors oracle sybase db2 sql server et al. are significantly more capable than mysql is currently or can reasonably be expected to be in the foreseeable future
if this is all just for personal use - then just do what works - but for an application you want others to use i can only recommend http-post and in small batches 2k say
instead they should be assigned a default-value just before their use
i m just looking for something a little more polished than vim or emacs but not quite as heavyweight as netbeans or eclipse
now on linux i still prefer gedit to the other options i ve tried with apologies to vi and emacs fans
what must be taken into account is the administration in terms of user access
asp.net web-hosting tends to be far more expensive than vanilla linux hosting and requires more control over the server environment
the cookie will typically be included in any type of request but the scenario you describe is what s known as a third-party cookie that is the cookie is set on a domain that is different than the domain of the loaded page and most browsers offer a privacy setting to block third-party cookies
as int exponent gets larger taking powers might be faster than multiplication
it is worth learning both because emacs is better than vim at editing certain languages and doing certain tasks and vice versa
in order to choose category i want to use dropdown lists
for small bits of code like inner loops it would usually be done with inline-assembly
order-based lazy declaration works just like functions in c you don t have to declare a method prototype unless you have a dependency that can t be resolved by order but you can add method prototypes inside the implementation if needed
scheme has continuations for example and it s good to learn about those in scheme even though they can be implemented in common-lisp
since the change set that removes the file maintains what the file s file id file name and parent directory were files can be restored at any time without having to load them into the system again
it s more complex than csv i9mport export but also a bit more robust
ie8 on windows-server 2008 is much more stringent with its default security settings
note that stack grows downwards so stack pointers address gets lower when stack grows.
the fact that java method names are inconstant regarding this can be explained by the fact that in earlier versions of java this naming conventions were not yet followed and they cannot be changed for backwards-compatibility reasons
and firebird could be embedded in you application and the licensing model is less restrictive than mysql one
python is much more strictly oo than java and c#
vmware is much more for usable virtualization rather than down-and-dirty
i have no experience using python but i know it s a much easier language to master than c++
many linux commands such as cat cp ls more and tar are locate in bin
the article you link to points this out as a solution to the seq scan problem if you add range constraints to the date field of each partition this query can be optimized into a loop where you query the latest partition first and work backwards until you find a single value that is higher than the range of all the remaining partitions. --but doesn t show the improved plan you d see after that change
usually recording the state on a stack takes less space that the call stack as you re selecting only the essential local state to record and are not recording return addresses or any caller-save registers if you used a functor rather than a function pointers then it s more likely that the compiler might be able to inline routine and so not save the caller save registers in the simple recursive case so reducing the amount of stack required for each recursion
i don t know either of them but i have always worked with fireworks for things as web design as seemingly opposed to a lot of people who prefer photoshop
a png file can contain a background-color which can be used when transparency doesn t work
times that are less than 4 digits long need to be prefixed with a zero 0 to make them the same length as the ones with 4 digits
even the embedded text editor i still shiver calling it that was unable to create texts with more than 250 line of text
there are also potential issues with punctuation or other characters which are neither words nor whitespace characters
i think you just need to watch your heap and stack usage you can grab pointers to local variables to get an idea of where stack is at the moment and if it s too high reduce it
an argumentnullexception would be misleading so argumentexception is a better fit
just because an if statement is normally constructed with curly-braces doesn t mean it must be constructed with curly-braces
i realise python is so much more dynamic than c++ it s taken me a while to see how little code you actually need to write
t is not very important as long as alpha is small otherwise you will run into some rather weird nyquist issues aliasing etc. and if you are working on a processor where multiplication is cheaper than division or fixed-point issues are important precalculate omega
i m trying to play devil s advocate since everybody else s recommending django but for a beginner django may in fact be better than pylons still spending a day or so lightly researching each main alternative before you commit to one is a good investment of your time
note that i ve also added a root elements in case your dictionary contains more than one elements and i m guessing that none of the dictionary key values is root
for more complicated numbers generation needs a sequence object offers more flexibility
since i want to call the library from within another open-source software with a bsd-ish license i would prefer lgpl over gpl
the basic reason you can t go that direction ienumerator t to a ienumerable t is that ienumerable t represents a set that can be enumerated but ienumerator t is a specific enumeratation over a set of items -- you can t turn the specific instance back into the thing that created it
your getinstance method could maybe be written like this as well to avoid having the s_instance var
rather than gushing any more simpletalk by redgate did an awesome wrap up of sqlcmd - the sqlcmd workbench
texture width or height is larger than the device supports
the automation part usually involves reading the screen and writing heuristics or algorithms for determining the state but can also be as nice as packets sniffing a lot of information there in poor poker implementations or as hacky as reading memory locations directly
if your mysql database is on unix linux and a file will be read on unix or database is on windows and will be read on windows then try this
it will be used to upload files to a regular linux webserver
then when he hits upload he should be shown a progress-bar while the files are uploaded
i have worked pretty heavily with both flavors of the gwt extjs libraries though i ve spent more time with gxt recently
regardless i d strongly recommend using shark instead of gprof - it s very easy to use and superior in pretty much every way to gprof - and doesn t require you to recompile your program
you can still use other ruby-based frameworks if you just like ruby but rails would not be the right choice - and i d probably recommend php since it does well at simple scripts
scons is better but cross-compiling is not its strong point
cmake s approach is a little more heavywieght with the toolchain file but it means you don t have to specify all of you tools and libraries cc cxx ranlib --with-ibfoo etc as they are figured out from a standard convention
adding the methods in same place as the rest of the standard class implementation is easier to understand no hunting to find where the magical code came from and less fragile than using category adding the same method via different category can result in undefined behavior
depending on the size of the libs you may want to set it up as a distinct target in your project or for even more flexibility as a subproject of your main project
basically he was saying that asp.net-mvc is not for large-scale enterprise applications that it is not as flexible as webforms and that an mvc app will be slower than a web forms app
performance - since both asp.net-mvc and webforms use the same asp.net as the core framework and asp.net-mvc is lighter and http compliant it gives you better performance
i want to develop a system virtual-keyboard with swt technology on the platform of powerpc under ubuntu and what the problem i meet is that how to make the shell lose focus when initializing the shell window
the variant with 0-sized arrays is better because your caller doesn t need to check for null and can process the arrays in a consistent way - say in a loops which would be empty in this case
i avoid nesting ternary operators or check more than one conditional with them as that makes the code obscure really fast
what criteria should i use to choose between swt and swing
it can be hard to get the layuots exact the way you want in swt it s usually easier in swing
when reflection was added to c++ known as runtime type identification or rtti it was hotly debated
personally i ve been very happy with cmake primarily because it is the only build-system which can generate real visual studio projects
my criteria to choose between swt and swing
notice i have only commercial experience with swt on small project and my swing experience is so small that can t be taken seriously - my knowledge is rather theoretical than practical
briefly after my swt eclipse rcp experience - on next project i would choose swing
it api seems for me easier than swt you haven t got to manage disposing components by hand to prevent memory leaks you adding component to panel instead of constructing components with parent panel information former is closer to my previous experience...etc. native look and feel you can get in swing too overall performance is enough good swt should be faster because it s using native components of backed os - but is the performance gain really big pro
to add to the kevin s answer your constructor for your class resources should really be made private for it to be a true singleton otherwise nothing is stopping someone from creating a new instances of the resources class through the constructor
shorter than margins 0 auto
2 yes hashes always cause data loss except in the case where your output space is the same as or larger than your input space -- and in that case you probably didn t need to hash
is it or can it be supported by pyflakes pylint or similar tools
i have a really odd issue with asp.net-mvc
the latter is just a bunch of key and values and can be parsed the same way whether for get or post whereas the former requires full mime support and is thus more useful when you have data that can t simply be represented as key-value pairs
for something that involves parsing multiple log files formatting the output to a summary status file and sending you an email notification if it notices certain types of events you might be better off with perl or python
as jeff mentions if you are compiling to any cpu managed code this code can be run on 32-bit or 64bit frameworks
i would not recommend putting 32-bit programs in the 64bit installation directory but this is simply for convention
it can be done in smalltalk and in lisp
i want 64bit application to be compiled on 32-bit machine so that when it runs it will take full advantage of 64bit o s without any emulation
the default for the verticalcontentalightment on your listbox is center so even though you were setting the verticalalignment elsewhere it was just aligning to the top of the listboxitem which were still centered instead of streched or placed at the top
specific ones bubble-sort can be much faster than quicksort depending on input characteristics
i have a thousands of data parsed from huge xml to be inserted into database-table using php and mysql
for example you may actually write a simple blog application in less than 100 line of code
as a rule predicate pushing makes the optimizer to choose nested-loops instead of hash join
i actually prefer pylons because it is much leaner than django but considering you specify enterprise ready i think you might want to hedge toward the larger framework and carry the kitchen sink around with you
think about it like this if you have more than one controllers accessing a single model then shouldn t common things between them be in a common place as long as that common thing actually has something to do with the model
the first index will be used for order by the second one will be used for join
if you want to manipulate the data in the dom consider json which is quite compatible with javascript
i want to read through a fairly large bytebuffer as line of text and for performance reasons i want to avoid writing it to the disk
it can be connected via tcp-ip using the common modbus protocol a hand-coded driver is usually no more than a few dozen lines
you don t need to have stylecop install on your or the build machine - simply add stylecop s binaries to your source control about 1.5 mb of stuff
i want the lines to be divided by line commands not par commands in the rtf
edit allow me to clarify my goal as i have been told python does a lot more than php
and i used windows-xp for development and the target os without any isseus
as a side note using toupper is more efficient than using tolower so toupper would be the way to go
see custom field value classes for more details
is this even possible for starters because this is about adding protocols to setter and a getter is much more easy like
if your map is used only on one thread it will make no difference and you should have been using hashmap instead of hashtable anyway
textures use apple s own texture2d class from the samples bmp will work but i recommend png because of the platform optimizations
insert dbi with your appropriate db driver though there are higher level wrappers too such as dbix-class
we found redmine to be a better than trac simply because it is easier to use
if you stored the results in an arrays it might be called map
oddly msvs has these alternate groups i m not really sure why... with curly-braces
first regarding the dictionary class that class is considered obselete the documentation recommends using map instead
now when i do the same thing in silverlight and load an control that can be dragged the scrollbar are not triggered when i drag out of view nothing happens.
it is fine for short-lived messages where you know the same version will be used for serialization and deserialization
if you just have a stories array controller whose content set isn t bound to anything you ll be creating stories effectively in a vacuum - they won t be linked to any feeds or tags which might be why you re getting these errors
all that needs to be changed is any emails that contains oldhost not all do to newhost
if a function go beyond 1 screen then it s too long except if it do form validation which is must be done in controllers
instead of service-locator i d recommend using dependency-injection di
i ran into the same issue where google just wasn t quite up to the job of more complicated addresses but the yahoo-api has more flexibility
i normally select tcp-ip
the data needs to be aggregated denormalization so that we re not burdening the db
the reason i m not just loading the 2nd video dynamically .when i need it is i want the video to start downloading so that it is immediately available to be played .when i am ready to make it visible
if you have a label with longer text that will make more than one line set numberoflines to 0 zero here means an unlimited number of lines
for extremely easy installation redmine can be installed using bitnami available for windows mac and linux
all the files within that directory should be treated by http
if you have access to the original msi used for the installation you can simply right click it in windows explorer and select uninstall
whenever there are more than one set associated with the same hash value this means that most likely they contains a common subset of at least five integers
in that regard i d recommend scheme which is in my opinion more elegant than common-lisp
if it s returning two rows with different effective dates that are less than the invoices date you may want to change your date join to
before you tell me that i want to do it in python or the like i just want to reiterate why i would choose java
if you know that all recurrent entries start at 0 and are contiguous then you joining adjacent line is even more trivial
edit given you want it to change based on font-size this would become necessary you can not explicitly set the height and also want it to auto size the height at the same time edit
it is optimized for downloading larger files where the setup overhead is amortized over the size and number of downloads http is very light-weight you can communicate to an http server using telnet much easier than ftp especially before passive ftp and is designed around html -- the concept that in the course of your navigation you will be visiting many different servers and grabbing only a couple of files at a time from each
right now i think it s better than nested-loops but it starts to get perl-one-linerish when you have a generator in a list comprehension
pressing pause while in the vs ide shows that the additional time appears to be spent in malloc free
if the tree aspects of this hierarchical data are very important and you have a choice of how to store data consider the nested set model which can maintain order and is much easier to reconstruct a tree
with that encoding 2 characters will be used to encode each byte from the hash using the symbols 0 through 9 and a through f
anyone who suggests something as heavy as seam or jsf isn t realizing that gwt clients are stateful and you don t need anything outside of the easiest action-request framework you can find which grails currently is
yes in most databases when you have a grouping by clause you can only select aggregate of columns or columns that appear in the grouping by clause
i have never seen any performance statistics suggesting that a regex based lookup is faster or more performant than string indexing
now i understand the normal policy the files must also be hosted on http but are there any other gotchas i should be aware of
the value is got from the getter call in one fixture and then should be used as field in another fixture both columnfixtures
if you don t want to edit an existing column and lose any valuable data for instance you could just create a new column temporarily go back into the datasheet view and set a value in that column for all events
it s open source quite easy to use and as a java library it can be invoked from scala
but then your setter is less restricted than your getter which is odd.
python not quite as good as java but still good
they re better than a subclassing in two ways
if so you should probably be reminded that swing painting should all be handled on the awt eventqueue
if you are new to linux then i defiantly recommend ubuntu
just remember to set the z-order of the overlay window lower than your modal dialog
how can dynamic breadcrumbs be achieved with asp.net-mvc
the json format is much lighter than xml and you serialize and de-serialize with a library such as json.net
using http also affects browser behaviour in some cases
the m multiline modifier makes and match line rather than the whole string
if you re not happy with mousedown and mouseup perhaps you could just put the rectangle in a button and handle the button s click event
without going into too much detail we are looking to use xml as meta-data to describe constraints on properties this is a cutdown example and xsd did not support our proposed complex model there are two options being considered which of the following xml strucutures makes better sense
i m not yet familiar with asp.net-mvc in particular but i have a good knowledge of the mvc pattern
json will produce a light-weight file much smaller than xml and should be a bit faster when processing
testing for equality to true can lead to a bug at least in c in c if can be used on int types not just on boolean types and accept any non-zero value
i favor having the select being left-most that i will break the justification inner join order by
means that process will be started with elevated-privileges
the reason that your arrays iterating is faster is that the the number of iteration is constant and compiler is able to unroll loops
obtain the maximum number of bytes which would be used to encode a character in the given encoding
json takes a lot less space than xml although xml compress very well
you should be able to mix and match icefaces and richfaces just fine
does a application in .net need to be built in 64bit to take full advantage of a machine with a 64bit os on it or will it take advantage of it just as a 32-bit build
how can i satisfy the 3rd-party shared library s reference to stat given my building environment
if you choose linux then i suggest going with ubuntu as that has one of the best automatic hardware configuration i have seen
to be called unix you have to pass a certification that it conforms to the specification so linux is more precisely called a unix-like operating system
4 if the release works and you would usually perform some testing to check all of your components it s ready to be run in live
if you already have the arrays of ints there is not quick way to convert you re better off with loops
for example tri-state checkbox aren t particularly intuitive and providing a drop-down or set of three radio button is more approchable for those less technically inclined
there seems to be very close coupling between controllers context views view data routing data and the html render methods
union-all may be faster than union but possibly result in duplicate records
for example if they select checkbox in rows 1 and 2 the data from other columns in rows 1 and 2 can be selected and passed into a messagebox
i m trying to match line with a format like point d d
i would recommend using argumentexception or argumentnullexception for parameters passed to routines rather then local variables
also note that without compression also image size is just 30kb for rgb image and if you reduce size to 60x60 pixels image size would be only 10kb without any compression i.e you can use bmp images and if you want lesses sizer but lossless compression you can choose png
as gotw #2 put it pre-increment is more efficient than post-increment because for post-increment the object must increment itself and then return a temporary containing its old value
perl probably would have been a better choice than awk but here goes first we sort the two city names and put the id at the end of the string which i did in the first section
my problem is that .when i bind to text and id on this control i want their data to be populated synchronous so that .when a propertychanged event fires on either property both of them have updated data
in my experience it is much better than boost-python swig or ctypes
maven usage is lower compared to ant but just how much lower is not really known
you can remove it by going to tools plugins menu installed tab selected task list from the installed plugin list and clicking uninstall button
if i understand correctly you have a single column which has numeric value and you want to find sum of this field for all thw rows where the field value is less than 30 and same condition with the variation of field value greater than 30
the code i m using to cause the fadein is quite simple as show below
i would highly recommend using icu instead of gettext and the locale stuff offered by the standard library if you are developing a commercial application
i know that python is older than java but i can t figure out where does this come from
if you prefer nant msbuild or powershell you can use those too.
instead of using to do your powers i would do a for loop using multiplication and then taking the mod of the number as you go along by using a conditional to check if the number calculated is greater than the mod
i want to have xhtml+css progress-bar with contrast colors between filled and empty background areas
if you would like to see how git compares to other version-control systems there is no better suited site than this one why git is better than x coincidentally that site s source is on github
note that even in this scenario duplication can be removed or minimize by careful care and refactoring of the controllers and models and views of course
for instance all the different type of models could inherit a common base-class or implement a common interface the latter might be the better of the two solutions - but it s difficult to say if you should prefer inherited or composition in this case
is there something built into cocoa carbon that s easier than the options above
for my webapp the integrated visual studio server cassini ist much slower than iis
i recommend mysql or oracle
at any event the above does not give a compilation but rather a runtime error - so a class can be casted to subclassing in some instances otherwise the code would not compile
it has a very clean mvc implementation -- playing around with it made it pretty easy to get started with asp.net-mvc when it came along
it can be stored freely int double etc
substring is better if all you need to do is extract a fairly simple substringing from a string but thats about it
however the total work listener do is more important
in that case you have few options because event handlers cannot be shared in vba vb6
or if you feel more comfortable with webclient i personnally prefer it over webrequest
it might be more efficient to do repeated integral division than to cast to a float perform an exponent then floor and cast back to an integer but the basic idea remains the same
given that wcf and .net remoting are not very easily interchangable .net remoting is based on remote objects while wcf is more about document-oriented messaging i wouldn t go to the trouble of rewriting the code to wcf just because .net remoting is no longer considered hot
being an expert in both c++ and python my mantra has long been python where i can c++ where i must python is faster in term of programmer productivity and development cycle and easier c++ can give that extra bit of power when i have to get close to the hardware or be extremely careful about every byte or machine cycle i spend
as the msdn article you found indicates read operations when properly aligned can be considered atomicity at all times without further precautions
i would take the user requests and queue them then have a separate process could be shell php perl anything running as root by cron check this queue check to see if the request fit the allowed parameters and make the changes
i am not familiar with mysql but here is the way i would do it in tsql sql-server maybe try to find an equivalent way of doing it in mysql
i made ant script for it that can be used in maven
the use of web-services tends to be safer although security is often more a people issue than software issue
the short answer less than 250 line
setup and tear down are convenience-methods - they shouldn t attempt to do much more than initializer a class using its default constructor etc
would erlang compiled using ada be noticably better or worse than the erlang made with c
vice versa if you loathe javascript but must execute some code in the user s browser java s gwt generating the javascript for you from your java-level coding is far richer and more advanced than python-side alternatives in practice if you choose python you ll be writing some js yourself for this purpose while if you choose java gwt is a usable alternative if you loathe writing js
in terms of libraries it s pretty much a wash -- the jvm is restricted enough no threads no custom class loaders no jni no relational db to hamper the simple reuse of existing java libraries as much or more than existing python libraries are similarly hampered by the similar restrictions on the python runtime
i want to use jtree with more complex elements than jlabel such as
for clustered key this is far worse because the clustered key-value is used as the lookup value on all other non-clustered indexes so it increases the size of all indexes
i simply want to keep my content in a separate directory so that my packaged .war is easier to disassemble and diagnose when something doesn t work
i ve used the fftw a fair amount and have found that unless you re going to more than two processor it s almost always a cleaner solution to just use the single threaded version
of course the c version is limited to 32-bit integers which can trivially be changed to 64bit integers if you so desire
as far as when awt may be more useful than swing -
i ve used javascript many times and am quite familiar with dom manipulation but simply not the api or gears of jquery
if what you re trying to do is to have more than one grid on the page at some point you just need to instantiate a new gridview set the properties including the datasource and databind it
best practice in mvc is to have your models be stateless the controllers gets to handle state
we wrap this in the ready function of jquery so all calls will only be made .when the document has fully loaded
i prefer jquery-plugins because i use jquery to all other plugins and components in my app
is one assembler instruction could always be viewed as atomicity operation
longer than any writer the set of
python is much more expressive that java and if you restrict yourself to one class per file which python does not prevent you from doing you will end up with lots of very small files - more to keep track of with very little benefit
i hope there is an easy way to do it - preferably without decorating the properties with an attributes but if the setup is easier with the attributes i guess that s cool
to toggle between positive and negative i created an if function so if the float value of my textfield is greater or equal to 0 then an - is inserted but if the float value of my text field is less than zero the - is removed using deletecharactersinrange
the serialization seems quicker but deserialization much slower and the app is doing more deserializing than serializing
if you do it s possible that some of the udp packets will be lost dropped by the network so your code will need a method sequence number in the packet headers to detect lost packets
then you can query your repository generate and group your orders determine the best bids and asks and fill out your ordersbycontractids this could be done using linq-to-sql but its a tad bit complicated for this answer
value for right mouse button is 2 although also note that it recommends using mousedown or mouseup events rather than click
you may compare this with client-server computing as paradigm and browser webserver or db-client stored procedure as two of various other architectural realizations of this paradigm
buy ibm websphere mq mqseries
then buy pc-lint or another static analysis tool to check your code for misra and other rules
i know that scipy has some signal processing tools for wavelets in scipy.signal.wavelets and a chart can be drawn using matplotlib but it seems i can t get it right
getting all the urls of images wouldn t be too difficult less than 20 line of code if you assume that all images are going to be in img tags
the entire taskpane loses keyboard focus to word s main window but retains mouse capture
if the datamodel is complicated more than say 10 significant entities or stores thousands of items then a sql-style database is more appropriate
btw on my simulator setting index greater than 3 throw an error for iphone os 2.x - so i have wrapped this in a try .. catch id .. block - hope this technique helps someone
i suspect that you should be fine with alignment issues since your struct contains unsigned chars which can be aligned at any byte so the compiler won t insert any packing between the members but strictly speaking this is implementation dependent so use caution
because firefox is better than internet-explorer
although i use python django the same thing can be applied in php
c and c++ don t have reflection so none of this information can be recovered at runtime
try to keep the sample small less than 100 line and for the purposes of this forum lets keep it limited to java c# and pl sql
you are calling executenonquery which should be used for updating the database insert delete updates
so i think we can conclude that ruby are not better and likely neither worse than python in this respect
if the data is external such as on a socket or other input device then the handle can generally be set to allow waiting for data to become available - no need to poll in that case since the event will always be signaled .when data is ready for consumption
imho the main reason that they didn t catch on is that they require tended to require too much skill and used awt swing which produces worse uis than what a designer with little programming skills could achieve with flash
most importantly you can easily supplement udp with some reliable delivery hand-shaking that s less overhead than tcp
since udp does not involve connection establishment there fore applications like dns where connection establishment delays needs to be avoided udp is preferred over tcp
until you discover that it needs to be promoted to protected or public
how to get selected cell from tdbgrid in delphi 5
some protocols are more complex because what s needed are some but not all of the features of tcp but more than what udp provides
a sql-server database corresponds more to an oracle user schema
the outer join is intended to address the cases where you wish to select a set of records from a primary table which may or may not have related records contains in a secondary table
however i ve noticed that running the vb6 tools is becoming more and more painful over time so i m looking at the possibility of migrating this code to vb.net 2008
all in less than 100 line
if arrays is lower on the stack than i this code will loops infinitely because it mistakenly accesses and zeroes arrays 10 which is i
i m working on a php dynamic web page that has a element that lets user write text and have it show in real time in a element just javascript-processing the text and tags
if you have more than one line selected this will work over multiple lines too
double-quotes are more common than single-quotes in general but i ll use single-quotes if i have a double quote in my string
like bigtable cassandra provides a columnfamily-based data model richer than typical key-value systems
fills are rendered much better than line
spreadsheetgear for .net is an excel compatible spreadsheet control for winforms which can also be used in asp.net applications
functional-programming is harder to get your head around than imperative-programming
also a good frontend webserver like nginx is way faster than any webapp layer you d have to write to read the blob from the db
xfce runs much smaller than gnome and is full featured
i ve been spoiled by .net and am used to using xpath to select nodes from a dom tree
also instead of loading saving individual properties like left use the win32 api setwindowplacement and getwindowplacement functions instead which also allows you to load save maximized minimize states accurately as well
here is an article about the decision made by kde developers to choose cmake over scons
a derived-class concrete_with_knobs is 400k larger than its base-class concrete
i also want to have the songs be separated into category by either artist or genre
recently one of the creators of the groovy language said in a blog post he would never have bothered designing groovy if scala had been around at the time
while this approach could be developed in c++ it would likely be easier to use a tool such as perl to implement it
do note that selection could be more than one cell so your check for a marked cell needs to check the whole range in some way
in many libraries that support http putting cookies into the http-request is more difficult than putting say a query parameter into the url
we can mix and match boolean and int values in our designs obtaining an if then else that requires evaluating both branches simd style by evaluating cond then + 1 - cond else using 1 as true and 0 as false in cond so you can get away with using the built in arithmetic of your ring to make your circuits more shallow
where in this case _list is an arraycollection object whose filter function depends on the showall field to choose value
just remember that the selection can be more than one cell so you ll need to allow for that in your code
now if you free some values on the heap and allocate more with malloc you may be given back some of that dirtied memory that you scribbed on earlier
if you are allowing users to enter html that will then be rendered on the site you need to do more than just encode and decode it
the wifi could be blocking the 443 port - but i d be surprised since http is a pretty commonly used protocol by standard users
on the other hand php is a poorly designed language and is usually slower than python in benchmarks
the map needs to be able to tell whether one key s value is less than another key s value by default this means that key1 key2 must be a valid boolean-expression that the key type should implement the less than operators
so back to the original question is unpack ever faster than substring
i want not less than k cell in the jth column as zero
things similar to decorators can also be created in ruby and it can also be argued that they aren t as necessary as in python
a c# application that calls the advantage.data.provider.dll and therefore ace32.dll must be targeted for x86 32-bit
invest in a good ide i recommend intellij idea and a good profiler i recommend jprofiler
if you want more information about fields the tfields object asqlite3query1.fields has a default property and a count property so you can use it like an arrays and an enumerator both of which can be used to loops over each tfield object and retrieve its metadata
also usually rails applications have the catch all route enabled to match controllers action
std set is a binary-tree and if an element in a binary-tree is not bigger nor smaller than a specific element it should be in the same place
asp.net-mvc is much more well constructed allowes for much better code seperation and control over markup and is much lighter on the server that imho the only reason not to move is if you have a legacy .net application or other that is working flawlessly and you re not expected to perform serious adjustments fixes on it in the near future
in any case writing stuff in asp.net-mvc is much faster than in webforms even if done from scratch
you won t need a database build script won t mix a bunch or incosistent sql php java xml where 0 means false in one language and not the other and other great implications were that we shan t have it bosses claiming that a relational-database is the solution to all and any problem different entities of same kind can have different number of properties the most relevant design pattern is entity which also can be used with rdbms
claims based authentication makes life easier if you want to flow identity through multiple systems such as a middle tier and onto a compatible back end without having to mess with impersonation and delegation.it s also partially for federation - allowing other people s systems to perform the authentication and for you to then authorise access to your application based on the identity information sent by those systems
the setup i m currently using below actually executes fine but newplace validator receives _post city_fk as field instead of the desired group of posted value
xml is much more complex than json though
personally i prefer jython because it s based on python in fact it is python but a little bit outdated but i must admit that groovy is more tightly coupled with the jre it s more syntactically similar to java and thus might be a better option
i am writing an app based on uitabbarcontroller which has more than 10 viewcontrollers with corresponding uinavigationcontroller
in that case you just want to pre generate a sequences of cryptographically secure random numbers and then assign each url to be encoded a unique number from the sequences
ado.net entity-framework is more flexible
if you want to run it on mac os x you can simply setup your webserver i recommend nginx with phusion s passenger and your database server to start on boot that way whenever your computer has to restart it will have your site running
part of the reason is that exception-handling handling is always more costly and complex than more conventional error-handling
aside from obejctive-c convention and best practices nserror is much more robust and flexibly than nsexception and allows the caller to effectively ignore the problem if they want to
the cpu operation for float division is much more complicated than multiplication
if you think back to grade school you ll recall that multiplication was harder than addition and division was harder than multiplication
pydev is pretty well integrated with pylint see here -- and pylint is a much more powerful checker than pyflakes beyond the minor issue of misspelled variables it will catch style violations etc etc -- it s highly customizable for whatever your specific purposes are
further informations about command-prompt options can be get by cmd
you would have to create a designer so the controls can be seen at design-time
we re in the process of creating a new api for our product which will be exposed via web-services
with this comes issues of precedence and specificity and cascading since cascading can only be done between contains container elements - when conflicting style rules from the and which would be the same level in a multiple inheritance hierarchy occur - which should the cell actually use
then i would simply check the edges of all blue polygonss whose lower bound of distance is lower than the upper bound of minimal distance against all the edges of the red polygons
it can be used to push put a view into a region or pull let modules declare which region they populate
perhaps you want something a level up such as nhibernate subsonic entity-framework etc
calculate the actual minimum distance and continue through the sorted list until the maximum distance between the polygons is greater than the minimum distance found so far
create a super controller that manipulates smaller specific controllers
the cell selects highlight blue
this feature allows the taskbar to span across both monitors allows games to be played in fullscreen across both monitors and allow remote-desktop connection to span both monitors without the span feature i have four monitors so my total screen width is more than rdp s limit of 4096 pixels making span very annoying
type definitions cannot be altered at runtime via reflection and hence it cannot be used as a device to make a type immutable
yea it s more than 4 line
on the other hand if you develop on windows and for visual studio then you can t use autotools and you need to choose cmake that provides such tools
that said it s hard to beat asp.net-mvc as it s
however the transition from the initial touchesbegan event to the first touchesmoved is less obvious sometimes the device waits a while
code-readability is much more important than saving a little time writing the code
can someone explain the fine line here and help me come to a conclusion on the line between using a lot of backing field in your methods or properties rather than some params you specify in the methods..even though some of those params may still be passed a value from a backing field or property when another method calls it
for the linked-list it is easier to remove and add elements from the middle although that should not be needed at all for a queue
the linked-list implementation uses more memory per element but the arrays implementation requires more contiguous memory
i have found before that on large tables this might work better than an inner-join
write a stored procedure that deletes records older than 24 hours
vbscript is much more convenient than creating an activex on vb6 or c# vb.net
override could also be used to declare attributes that are not defined in the base class
have more space to arrange when wraping string more than 80 line long
i have a tableivew with a bunch of cells and i am trying to get the uilabel to display more than 3 line
since you are already familiar with asp.net and sql why not look into asp.net-mvc and subsonic
personally i prefer webforms but am learning asp.net-mvc within rails just to broaden my experience and to gain the benefits of better testing
i prefer asp.net-mvc over webforms for the following reasons
however i doubt all spocs can be replaced by linq-to-sql
i would recommend codeigniter cakephp or zend framework
iirc oracle s default semantics are very transaction-oriented unlike sql-server s
i cannot specify the document library b c i don t want to have to define a new lookup column for each new document library...instead i m hoping to do this as a custom content type that can be used in any document library
so my plan was to use mstest to create the unit test project and test methods that run against my service and any run-time dependencies would be handled by typemock which would create mock objects for my service to use
if you always keep track of the lengths of your strings you can compare lengths and use memcmp which is faster than strcmp
for this application i want my window to have a variable number of small tile -like structures which can be moved closed minimize just like windows by the user inside my main frame and which will display each a small table
website will be based on asp.net-mvc and c#
require a bit more learning time than linq-to-sql
i d prefer not to bundle a db and engine with a small plugin but would like similar semantics for instance using linq to select value where some field match etc
to my mind there s an implication that it s reasonably cheap to get set the value but not that it s stored as a field with a trivial implementation
as indicated by the error message a while must be followed by an as the conditional it tests for must be enclosed inside parentheses
of digits after the decimal as mentioned for printf i heard can be used for scanf as well i am not sure sure the compiler i use doesn t support that format
i am more familiar with python than ruby
is there any way to have eclipse these arguments populated with project or workspace wide default options
depending on neighbouring elements and border collapse settings particularly on firefox more than ie safari though that border may disappear in some circumstances
attempt at psychic debugging if your win7 os is 64bit and xp isn t you may have forgotten the 32-bit designator after program files
you would have to implement your own interrupt handler to get notified .when the data is ready
probably not in ways that you care about though the compiler can use the empty base-class optimization if you happen to inherited from more than one base-class with
where python abounds with high-level framework-- things like web.py java seems much more lower level
it would be a violation of hig to have pushed views slideup from the bottom for example
other languages have runtime time information sufficient to support dynamic casting and yet nothing that could be described as reflection c++ being an obvious example
point taken couchdb is much more than a key-value store but on the other hand not less suitable for it
it blows linq-to-sql out of the water in terms of features though not ease of use
also if your seek is on an ordered field you can optimize your navigation by checking whether the sought value is greater or lesser than the value of the current record and choosing .findprevious or .findnext accordingly because the dao recordset find operations work sequentially through the index
i choose bazaar over git mercurial coz bazaar is notifications are very well integrated in ubuntu
final note this is probably happening because in theory you could have chosen to implements a root object entirely separate from nsobject and in that case it wouldn t respond to -respondstoselector
if i don t specify any size it will render the image at full size but i want it to be restricted by height and width
wxwidgets is better for c++ developers who has knowledge about mfc and windows
integer multiplication is much faster than division
blogs and article are all well and good but i d like to see some real working source code however i am currently stuck with webforms at work for the time being and most open source projects that i know of that are implementing these kind of development practices seem to be based on asp.net-mvc nerd dinner
given your situation i would recommend using stax rather than sax
obviously it can be done by subclassing nsview or it s subclass and catching it in it s drawrect but that s too ugly
i would like to add that the sockets can be shared on unix linux via af__unix sockets inter-process sockets
for instance here is a regex which will match typedef of struct which point to a single name and may or may not have a pointer
what can be done gracefully and well in python that can t be done in ruby with such beauty and good engineering or vice versa
if you have written a class which implements its own equalsity that is different from reference equalsity then you are required to override gethashcode such that two objects that compare as equals have equals hash codes
hover over the variable name to find out the type - and if var is being more of a curse than a blessing go back to explicitly typing your variables
as for version-control - i would recommend git it is faster and has more features
when using this technique microsoft strongly recommends using http to protect the cookie value on the wire
mysql is more than capable of serving your needs as well as alex s suggestion of postgresql
these aren t the only two options you can also use json or yaml which are much lighter weight than xml
on the other hand any data that can be represented in csv can also be represented in xml although it s not guaranteed and indeed is also verified that it will be more efficient in terms of space ease of parsing etc
among the reasons you may prefer xml over csv depends on the task at hand of course
is there any special advantage to choose https over http in this case
tried to use liquibase but it seems not enough mature yet to be used with hibernate
if the stream is concated as simple as gecko firefox and khtml web engines gets only first part a
the array will never contains more than 5-10 elements
this properly means if the file is an image of gif or jpeg or png and is less than that size
as for their pricing it s entirely up to them to set the price at 750 or 75k or 7 and none of those numbers is more right than any other
i don t know of any already-made tools to do that but writing the code to parse out the text file and extract a function body from a c++ code file should not take more than 20 line of code
i ve got matching the first bit correctly i think but i can t seem to get it to only select line that don t have any text following the initial match
it can be done in smalltalk and in lisp
so when would you actually choose asp.net-mvc over asp.net webforms or asp.net webforms over asp.net-mvc
you do choose asp.net-mvc or asp.net webforms and there are lots of good reasons to do that
compares object without digging into prototypes then compares properties projections recursively and also compares constructor
main thing is i have multiple places on my page where i want an image to be replaced via swfupload and i don t really want to instantiate a new swfupload class in every place i want to do an upload
in that server side method i try to grab value of that current row but they are all the old cell value before i modified the field data using jquery javascript
fyi postgresql scales better than mysql on multi-processor overlapping requests from a review i was reading a few months back sorry no link
i d recommend considering web-deployment projects
you won t need more than 50 line of code to create your own unit of work implementation to abstract session and transaction management
min would be _get max - 5
you should have static xml data that can be used to compare against serialization output and to use as input data for deserialization
on a mac you can do that too but macports and fink just don t are the same quality and so updated as debian ubuntu fedora etc
however even when you fix that the line will still raise an exception assuming your revised method-signature still includes more than one argument
i d suggest oo - it s not harder than procedural-programming actually easier to maintain with the right tool
this garentees that while a can be issued to the pipeline every cycle it will have a higher latency than an add subtract circuit
you have to make sure your local sql instance is exactly at the same build versioning versioning like the hosting provider otherwise your local sql may upgrade the database structure and you ll be unable to restore it back on the hosting provider or you ll be unable to restore in on your local server if your versioning is earlier than the host s
generally json is a more efficient way to retrieve data via ajax as the same data in xml is a lot larger
not to be found in haskell or sml
if you re writing graphics code for windows 7 you should consider direct2d over gdi which has a programming model that is compatible with but very different than gdi s
if you want to go open source i would recommend using postgresql instead of mysql
i believe python is better for this than ruby but i could be wrong
the core of python is somewhat cleaner than the core of ruby and if you learn the basic core of scripting with python first you will more or less as a bonus learn ruby
disclaimer i prefer ruby in a production commercial setup over python
i prefer ruby over python on windows
i prefer ruby over python on the things i do at home
tamir khason does this also with line and goes into more depth about bitmap style performance wpf here
one point of interest here is this would not remove source code compatibility with existing debuggers because my system would require the debugger be implemented in managed-code managed api and the existing ones are written in unmanaged-code
it uses very simple yaml files which are far easier to edit than xml and have hierarchy which is better than ini files
it can be used with php rails perl and until now for me worked like a charm
i think it depends on the skillset of your team but having said that from my experience wpf is much easier to develop windows-applications with
instead the rendered div for the panels has no height and witdh settings and is therefore somehow smaller than the grid
i personally prefer ruby over python largely because of blocks but i envy the clarity-first attitude in the python community
django may have less magic than ruby-on-rails but there is still some there
isnt xmlelementattribute and xmlchoiceidentifierattribute xml-serialization which is a older serialization compared to the datacontractserializer which reads datacontractattribute and datamemberattribute
unless you re creating memory leaks by connecting dom javascript objects circular references that won t be cleared by dom and js gcs
the type itself must be marked as serializable as must any internal fields that are also to be serialization
a listview is a bit more heavyweight than a datalist - it offers paging sorting and insert edit delete templates
cleartype often needs to be switched on windows-xp
simple clicks gives you comparisons between internet-explorer 6 the native version of internet-explorer installed other browsers you may have installed locally firefox 3.5 safari 3 safari 4 and even an bitmap images of website prototypes
it should be less than 12 line of code
at the very least you should have added more line in order to track down the source of the problem
this code is nothing more than standard c-preprocessor macros
then use one property to be bound to gridview
my system would require the debugger be implemented in managed-code managed api and the existing ones are written in unmanaged-code
does left outer join gives better perfomance then inner-join
outer join are more expensive than inner-join
by the way this regex contains a lookbehind that can match any number of characters
if you select tcp-ip you will get reliable transfer .
persistence can be done via hibernate or ibatis or lots of other options
as for the community gruby-on-rails community is not as big as ruby-on-rails though since the acquirement by spring more and more people are using it in serious application
ruby-on-rails has more job openings in the market compared to gruby-on-rails that is if you want to invest in looking a new job
for example the hellofs is a small extremely limited filesystem in less than 100 line of c code
that line would basically create a 100x100 thumbnail the zc specifies a zoom crop crop to match aspects ratio and the thumbnail library does some pretty nifty caching to reduce server load
i probably would have found this to be a bigger problem if hadn t had ctrl-shift-v as a shortcut to the var section
you have to compare width and height in this method
the api will be used in web-services and a client application
following the pattern set forth by library types such as arraylist which can be initialised from any collection but not an iterable would lead me to use
values can be the sibling of another value e.g a photo value could have name location width height as sibling values
i m looking for answers or reasons why ado.net is better than ado with regards to data-access when it comes to windows forms applications
one of the biggest issues that was able to get people to switch to ado.net at my day job was the fact that ado vb6 flavor is all com you get better performance with ado.net
have tried in safari a couple versions of firefox and ie7 and all look just the way that they are supposed to
i found that builtin functions are much faster than loops when processing large arrays
you probably don t want to go back to anything earlier than delphi 3 but some pascal programming books can be helpful
postgresql requires more tuning than mysql to achieve optimal performance
postgresql is already slower than mysql up to a certain point it is actually faster when you have a ridiculously large database
and unless you require animation i d always recommend png over gif
webstorm i use for the bigger projects where the sublimetext is more for the files to open or a small projects because it is very fast
when you specify more than one endpoint uri any types that share a common schema will be generated once and reused amongst all service contracts
i would have expected the division of two long values to result in a long thus removing the decimal part but it resolves it as a double leaving the exact same value after the multiplication
validator should be decoupled from controllers into separate service layer like for instance showed in this tutorial
a rest api should be entered with no prior knowledge beyond the initial uri bookmark and set of standardized media types that are appropriate for the intended audience expected to be understood by any client that might use the api
and you can have precalculated sin and cos values for a b ranges ie
i recommend creating java interfaces to represent the operations that you plan to use along with separately-packaged implementation classes that wrap the python code
additionally the number of vms that need to be updated is minimize by virtue of the fact that they re shared
i don t know of an automated solution for all of your vms but i would recommend using windows-server update services to keep track of the update status of every vm and provide a local windows update repository to speed up the updating process
i would recommend updating slightly differently as your tblmailinglist user will not be valid to be updates in your repository
these benchmarks also report the source code size and python was significantly more concise than java and c#
my second problem is when i am selecting particular radio-button that details should be displayed in textbox
the most important factors is that double being implemented as a binary fraction cannot accurately represent many decimal fractions like 0.1 at all and its overall number of digits is smaller since it is 64-bit wide vs
local sequence cannot be used in linq-to-sql implementation of query operators except the contains operator
i would recommend reading datamodel patterns by david c
if they are not authentication they will be redirected to login
please note that the outputcache is varybyparam and testing out a hardcoded path controllers action does not actually clear the outputcache so it looks like it has to match controllers action param1 param2
also if your enum has a huge number of values jon skeet s map alternative is likely to perform better than any arrays iteration
this can be a major clock-cycle saver since multiplication is often much faster than a division operation
this behavior isn t new to windows 7 - it s been this way at least as early as windows-xp possibly earlier i don t have access to anything earlier to test
compareto compares values and returns an int which tells if the values compare less than equals or greater than
cpython probably has better ide support at present than ironpython - so this may be a factor in the choosing of one over the other
when properly engineered these sorts should provide better performance than glib qsort
for a programming exercise i designed for myself and for use in a pretty non-secure system later on i m trying to compare md5 hash
also i d recommend you check out sharpdevelop it is mostly compatible with visual-studio solutions and project files and has built-in support for ironpython projects
impossible to override functions properly so calling them on the base class invokes the one in the container of the base without using function-pointers which is possibly more overhead than virtual-functions
windows-vista has more extended options on the context menu
the size of every packets is in the first two bytes of the header of the packets which is 6 bytes.so one real packets it s first two bytes + 6.that s how i find if there is more than one packets
if your author field is selective and sorting is cheaper than filtering
i d recommend windows-server 2003 2008 or windows 7
i would probably stick with a custom attributes but the other potential option would be to do something like hold a static dictionary that had string and properties info or properties name so you could get set the properties directly via this
this is true for any webform if you press enter while an input-field has focus the form will be submitted except textarea
assuming you are accessing the remote machine over the internet the router will need to be configured to forwarding port 8080 to the server
all integer floating point ops will be treated as 64bit values so if your end result relies on 32-bit chunks you will have to compensate for such
a 50-line form could kill internet-explorer and at the same time be very usable with opera or firefox
how do i get selected radio-button in radiogroup
keep it simple ideally a unit test should be less than 10 line of code
if it grows to much more than 20 line of code you should seriously consider refactoring either the test code or the api you are testing
we are creating some wcf services that will initially be consumed by .net clients but in the future will be consumed to java clients
i think that maybe i am missing latex but i am not very familliar with tex and latex
of course this demo is somewhat contrived as we could have animated both height and width in the one animate command
is it possible in c c++ to create my own custom stream of type file stdio that can be used with fputs for example
several other questions on so have come to the same conclusion i have -- using an itemscontrol with a datatemplate for each item constructed to position items such that they resemble a grid is much simpler especially to format than using a listview
grass can be customised in python perl ruby.
the fact that you have height length and width makes it harder than a simple knapsack problem
do you have any situation where stateful is more appropriate than stateless
so the standard c python is not necessarily slower than java or c#
cassini is not actually iis it is more of an emulation
in ie 6 - 8 running on windows xp when you select the non-breaking spaces and copy-paste them they will be copied paste as normal spaces u+0020
we build the majority of our flash projects in this manner or sort of in reverse where we build the assets in flash professional output a swc of the graphics and use that swc in a better development environment we prefer fdt
i have found that 64bit jvms have been slower than 32-bit versions
add a condition compare listname field you can compare value in the field in your case your approve column
the browser might be mozilla ie opera google-chrome or any other mobiles device such as sonyericssonk610i samsung-sgh-e370 sonyericssont700 or nokian73-1
another difference between functions and language constructs is that some of those can be called without parentheses like a keyword
groovy has slower run-time performance to java in most areas since it is a dynamic language
the second way i thought is testing for icollection instead of ienumerable since ienumerable is more of a potential collection than an actual one
for instance the application in this case had a user account tied to a web application so on load the application would initialize the singleton object and when the user signed in it would keep a reference to the user object in the singleton so that user info could be referenced for api calls
from what you re describing perhaps a gridview or datalist is a better option
it s likely the c++ code is faster smaller than equivalent python
features of c++ such as manual memory management allows for the development of very fast libraries which can then be called from python in order to gain performance
because a boolean is a value type you cannot set it to null but there are some cases where you d want to like in a data access class because database field can have null value
you re probably being hit by the borders or margins on the body element -- you re asking for document.width height effectively but putting it in an element with a border so the total width of the page canvas.width+ left right borders is then bigger than the width height you originally asked for
problem is asp.net-mvc is much younger product than asp.net
this will of course change when you draw more than 400 line
the trick about template metaprogramming or generic programming in general is that it allows a lot of computation to be moved to compile-time and it enables flexible parametrized code that is just as efficient as hardcode values
now there is a png encoder in as3 in the as3corelib and i guess there are even others but probably most people considered it pointless to write a decode since flash does this in its own and also encoding is easier than decoding because decoding means you have to implement the whole format .
for a dedicated-server is it better to store the connection string in web.config or machine.config
xml is simply a poor fit for its most common application representing object hierarchies and json is a better fit
it is not as fancy as calendarview but i think i would be great for your scenario
if a word must be broken across line a hypen should be inserted prior to the break
i would probably recommend sml over haskell if you feel like trying on a functional language for the first time
examples of that would be rmi in java python s pyro module etc which will provide some functional parity with dcom
update i understand that programmatically one could put more than one item in the pasteboard using additems as kevin ballard points out or by setting the items property to an arrays containing more than one dictionary
if your connection stays open after your transaction you might want to issue a rollback or a commit but generally a rollback is less costly in order for your next transaction to execute in a clean state
would anyone know where i should go for a good introductory tutorial with code on how to have deffered shading with lighting
if it s easier to blacklist actions by attributing actions for which this logic shouldn t be performed than whitelist actions you could create a suppresswhateverlogic attribute and apply it to the methods you want to be blacklisted
not sure how popular that is with other windows users but the following set of utilities come in handy and can be used by any editor capable of binding keys functions to commands
json is much more faster than xml
even though its not recommended approach still i feel its better than custom adaptor approach
i ve got what s effectively your makedeepcopy in the copy constructor but without any of the necessary conditional on the calling code because it is a copy constructor and a simple two line assignment operators that is imho more obviously exception safe
update also zend-auth courtesy of the zend-framework is supposed to be very good and can be integrated into codeigniter
add an on insert triggers which sets sort_order to md5 url
this kind of thing could also be handled by aspects oriented programming
since mantis is a bit more complete than bugzilla when it comes to features you could define separate issues with custom field for your tasks
the input will be translated into messages and each message will be given to controllers by a method call which can then interpret the message to modify model data or send data over the network as i am hoping to have a networking option
i want to do this in one step and be able to deploy more than one .war in a single maven project
one key-value is much easier to understand than one row from a table
while i personally think maven is a better tool than ant in the long run our experience will make maven3 a better tool than maven2
obviously not every piece of code can be written as message-passing and shared style which is why kamaelia also has a simple software transactional-memory stm which is a really neat idea with a nasty name - it s more like version control for variables - ie check out some variables update them and commit back
if you think your users technical users will be happier with directory use that but otherwise i would go with folder
i would like to use this one because it is a python framework i like python more than java but i don t know if they have implemented the advanced features of a web crawler
note as i am not familiar with threads on windows i hope the discussion will be limited to linux unix threads
and it s not possible with setter getter function you have to call setlabel bla from the script
now there are at least three serious threading issues in less than 10 line of code here
at devconnections a few years ago a session on sql server performance stated that a order of outer join does matter and b when a query has a lot of join it will not look at all of them before making a determination on a plan
also interprocess communications is more work than simple threads
wmd provides options to create and destroy instances of itself but i have had no luck creating an instance and assigning it to a specific textarea by id or class
another interesting variation what if you have 64-bit numbers 8 terabytes worth of data overall say on a bigtable or clone thereof and as many machines as you want each with about 4gb of ram on a pretty fast lan say one that s substantially better than gb ethernet -- how do you shard the problem under those conditions
say all instance-variables are 32-bit ints for simplicity if the superclass has 3 and the subclass adds 2 more then each instance of the subclass will allocate 5 x 4 20 bytes -- 8 for its own instance-variables plus 12 for the instance-variables of the superclass
that will be passed to controllers action
indexes are defiened to the all columns used in the where clause as wll as inner-join
generally javascript is faster when you search or alter the dom as little as possible
the textbox is like a searching textbox where i search for folder s in a particular folder the list of searched folders will be displayed in listbox
my experience is with windows but the same or similar can be done on unix linux
what you could also do is first see if the file is there and then if it is delete it of course this destroys any special file permissions you had set on it
it s easy much easier than installing freebsd or god forbid opensolaris pretty straightforward and the perl and python will be 64 bits out of the box and part of default installation
i m less familiar with maya but take a look at the 3ds max sdk id 7481355 to see what you can do
after base64 encoding the compressed data yes it will expand a bit but not as much as url-encoding expands it
wcf or asp.net web api are the only technologies that should be used for .net web services going forward
if you re storing the points in just an external javascript file then i would recommend using json format over xml as the xml parser that google maps uses is much slower than json
i believe it should return a json as i ve discovered it is much quicker than xml parsing
assuming maximum performance is the goal i would ideally choose substring my_field 1 6 and create a function-based index to support the query
i haven t done any shopping-cart stuff but there are gems out there for integration with paypal and activemerchant
it is written in tcl which is a language somewhat simpler than perl but broadly in the same family and not difficult to learn
you are mixing libraries and levels of libraries jogl and lwjgl are both pretty thin wrappers around opengl iirc lwjgl has more wrappers for openal audio
perhaps it might help if you posted a situation where you were unsure whether or not it was a good idea to split your controllers that is more specific and less cruddy because crud is fairly straight forward
i personally would recommend yourkit java profiler i ve found it much more user-friendly than tptp and while i haven t tested it it should work on os x
so in mvc the valid email validation from above wouldn t go into a controllers or view because input into that piece of business logic is likely to happen in more than one controllers view and this would require the duplication of the validation logic
they will probably be done in asp.net-mvc
i would highly recommend reading datamodel patterns - conventions of thought by david c
the problem is that jfx script can t be embedded into swing nor eclipse swt
one problem is general is that field sometimes use delta if there are more than one value for the same field
side note this has to be done in webforms not asp.net-mvc
i also recommend using web-deployment projects
png compresses much better than gif and allows more colors at the same time
functional-programming is not more intuitive or easier to learn than imperative-programming
this means that memmove might be very slightly slower than memcpy as it cannot make the same assumptions
i have to deploy some web services on a server that only supports the java ones but some of them will be done using perl or python
so my second option is to make a hierarchy with interfaces and abstract classes meaning that the value will not be stored in field but rather just returned by methods when needed
i recommend using builder-pattern
even more lightweight than the python solution is a perl
protocol is usually not as important as authentication authorization and other application-level concerns when talking about application updating
i would recommend using parametric-polymorphism with one card behaving according to how it has been configured
a program must be built with x86 mode if it has unmanaged 32-bit dependencies or if it has managed libraries that are buit in x86
also note that x86 dlls cannot be loaded on 64bit process
it may be a better idea to follow mvc model-view-controllers principles where you have one class that knows something about your model database another that knows how to transform the model into objects that will be presented controllers and the third that actually shows the data with all of its css goodness view frequently just a php template file
however we have a few webservices published that need to be accessed over http - there s some systems in place out in the wild that are using
i apologize i think we never ever considered that somebody might want to put carriage returns there -- but then it doesn t make any more sense to have form feed there and we do accept that .
it must be marked serialization as shown for drag and drop between applications
of particular interest is swt which has a more platform-native look-and-feel
i have also noticed that if i manually show it and exit ie the next time it will have remembered its show status
there will be window of vulnerability when updating more than one atomicity variables even though each call to is atomicity
when submission an upload form an alert shows up error form elements must not be named submit
if the subquery returns more than one row you probably want to use sum in-subquery
each datagridviewcolumn as a displayindex property which can be applied at any time and even works with autogeneratecolumns set to true
in terms then of creating a new row in the database i suppose a new instance of the model would be created populate with data and effectively a save method called
if you look at the fanfare surrounding mysql 5.4 it says now supports more than 4 processor
you can add basic authentication htaccess to avoid unauthorized people to trigger your script and stronger security by using http
i find cobertura and emma to be largely interchangeable in terms of coverage checking just that cobertura has a better maven plugin and emma has a better eclipse plugin in my opinion
is there way for the grid panel to be used with itemscontrol so that there is a single grid to contain all the items
i have a subversion repo with directories that contains the usual source-controlled files but in addition to that contains files that are a dependency for execution but not checked into source control and instead added as svn ignore since they would be kept in duplicates all around the repo if they were checked in into all folders
that separates the user interaction from the controllers and provides for better decoupling between the ui layer and the business layer
assuming the 16-bit architecture could address sufficient amounts of memory to hold the runtimes either in flash memory or ram. 32-bit values could still be calculated albeit slower than 16-bit and requiring more operations using library code
this could potentially be a viable option - i still think the dom is the better way but this looks far superior to the standard javascript implementation of regex
for someone just starting to program would you recommend using vim emacs or should you use some ide
the first possibility should be no more than 10-20 line of actionscript code .
however i find that linq-to-sql is easier to maintain especially since the dal classes can be regenerated if the database changes
even other n sorting algorithms such as insertion-sort tend to have better performance than bubble-sort
i find context approach to tex cleaner than latex but that might just be me
this is much like removing outliers based on the median ie you re going to need two passes over the data one to find the median - which is almost as slow as sorting for floating point data the other to calculate the average but requires less overhead at the time of working out the average at the cost of maintaining a sorted list
the code below works in safari 4 and will return the node the selection is anchored in where the user started to select selected backwards will return the end instead of the start if you want the element type as a string just get the nodename property of the returned node
you could also have added onchange code from the onload event
having something which can switch modes at any time is considerably worse as your application now has to deal with more than one set of behaviour too
for example in thinqlinq.com site i have posts that can be assigned to category
if this is the only dimension of variation between your subclassing there s no longer a need for inherited here
i ve was always so spoiled with asp.net controls in webforms that i don t know any good practices for this sort of thing
does anyone know if the upcoming v8 versioning is easier to upgrade or if its easier to upgrade from a certain previous versioning compared to earlier versioning
i m not knowledgeable enough about redhat to know how to install them probably an rpm command and where they will be installed with debian and derivatives put them you have to use -i usr src linux- kernel-version include
wcf v4 - to be released with .net 4.0 later this year 2009 will include a routingservice class which can be used in scenarios like this
the way you re using it all it is doing is popping up a confirm messagebox which is much more easily done manually
it should be noted that asp.net-mvc is configured out of the box to ignore url requests for files that physically exist on the disk although scott s ignoreroute technique is apparently more efficient
i m trying to match line such as and match title and blah in two groups
linq to entities is more complicated than linq-to-sql and is designed to make the database tier transparent
all of which are less than 20 line and i have a very sparse coding style
available on almost every platform true of vi vim too of course - whether gui- or text-based java ides are available on most platforms too but only in gui mode and are significantly larger and need to be installed separately whereas emacs is generally more widely available - bsd nix linux mac systems
in fact because you are eliminating the redundancy of epsilon transitions many simple dfa s actually get smaller than the nfa they represent but there is simply no way to guarantee that
your position pointers have to grow with the length of the input and now your algorithm now requires more than constant space to execute
shells as your default shell and it will be used as subshell in gnu
personally i d recommend tcl since it does regex very well and it s handling of unicode is for all intents and purposes completely transparent -- much better unicode support than python for example
here s one that matches line with 8 or fewer pairs of # characters or with an odd number of them
in perl if you want to remove occurrences of any pattern of your above set that has less than 9 # d# s you can use the following
subtraction is similar using subtraction of the base type and borrow instead of carry multiplication can be done with repeated additions very slow or cross-products faster and division is trickier but can be done by shifting and subtraction of the numbers involved the long division you would have learned as a kid
git stores ignore patterns using in-tree .gitignore file which can be put under version-control and distributed
be limited to http using the
i relise that normally for a from to get and appending querystring params it needs to have hidden form field so i could write a utility function that automatically adds a bunch of hidden form field for any querystring value but i wanted to check that there s wasn t an easier approach or maybe i m going about it the wrong way
your methods are less than 50 line and
my thoughts are that having separate modules helps with code clarity and later on if by some chance these modules grow to more than 10 line i won t feel so bad about having them separated
modules grow to more than 10 line i
another thing that may help is to prefer local-variables over globals or class-members
your images will be loaded by the browser when the src-attribute is set and can be appended to any html container per normal dom-operations
your code is c++ so it must be compiled with g++ the c++ compiler not gcc the c compiler
how to get called subclassing method from a superclass
edit please note that the message will not be sent over https they will be sent over http
can anyone tell me how this would be achieved in linq-to-sql
i haven t tried it and it might not work given your target-platform since jmagick uses jni
i m not familiar with scala but it uses similar principles to erlang s and i feel somewhat comfortable there
if you have a mac i would recommend aquamacs which is a beginner-friendly version of gnu-emacs and therefore has all the power of emacs while still offering standard copy-paste save and other features including normal file dialogs and windows
it s much much faster than beautifulsoup and it even handles broken html better than beautifulsoup their claim to fame - lxml just isn t as vocal about it
coords within the boxes are defined using a variable number of bits that are are just linear between min and max values depending on the precision needed
...do you spot the flaw hint compare line 2 and 4 of that snippet
the documents will then be checked on marshalling and unmarshalling and you won t have to rely on the annotations for validation
i also use simplejson quite often because i prefer using json rather than xml
there is nothing that can be reused in asp.net-mvc based web site
for example p o 1234 should be validated and alert error message
i d recommend removing line 17-23 and replacing them with a simple statement
i m creating a tree of categories with parentid s which can be called from children in such a way
for example your complete solution may be as follows i m using left outer join because you did so i m not sure it s the right way maybe inner-join is more suitable
so it needs more functionality than filtering and sorting
if you ve never used xaml and you ve got a sort timeline to get this thing done you best be prepared to put in some extra time or be okay with a less than stellar look and feel
the contentsize height seems to be always equal or greater than the height of the scrollview frame but never smaller
basically webforms give you less control more overhead and rapid development time while asp.net-mvc gives you more control less overhead and takes more time to develop
this could be implemented by any container that supports efficient reverse enumerator
so how can i determine a smaller width and height to which i will resize the watermark image something much less than 150 width 20 height so that it will appear still as a watermark and wont mask the image completely
or maybe the use of udf s on sql-server is more prevalent and the mysql engine s optimizer simply hasn t evolved as far yet
it needs to be done synchronous because the case is opened immediately .when it s created from an activity
ignore dinosaur platforms with 8bit or 16-bit architectures
for example p o 1234 should be validated and alert error message
gwt makes it easier for gmail-type applications eg web-applications which mimic desktop application functionality
on the other side asp.net-mvc is easier for dynamic sites
judging from the technical debt as seen on the nemo sonar instance spring batch has the lowest debt line ratio for projects larger than 10k lines of code
this whole thing should be less than 100 line of code aside from communications with the c program
as you say the answer depends on what are your needs but if you need to use only one or two features only there is not point paying for all.for example if you are going to use only profiling it is less expensive to buy a tool that like red gate s dot trace
.net asp.net-mvc is really more like the ruby on rails framework than struts but you should find it pretty easy to pick up if you know struts as well
disclaimer i haven t done much asp.net-mvc programming
for example p o 1234 should be validated and alert error message
i need to compare line in a file
if the answer to this is that it could be written without nested-loops what is it in the model or the linq query that is causing it
if you have it already setup and you are a primarily ms based network sharepoint makes a lot of sense and can handle revision control for the ms based documentation much better than svn
internet-explorer doesn t use the mozilla engine so it is considerably slower than firefox
firefox is slower than google-chrome which boats one of the highest javascript engines a modified version of webkit
that s much more important than line of code per catch block
it is more than 100 line but not by much
does opengl es have a better performance than core-animation and uikit when it comes to highly animated user interfaces
by the way extends thread is not generally as good as implements runnable for quite a few reasons
not all languages have properties java only has fields that must be accessed by getter and setter
an additional path for those not so keen on maven unable to port or perfectly happy with ant ivy
python - good language strategically a better choice than ruby although there are other aspects of ruby that can be argued to be superior
but it won t be compiled and throw an error
if you add dynamic entities and have the temporary entity i mentioned above you can actually discard invisible dynamic entities automatically once you have a method to figure out which cells are visible and which not if a cell is invisible its associated dynamic entity will also be invisible but beware an entity can touch more than one cell
just make sure your maps will never have an area with empty space that can see more than 16 cell or whatever you decide
maybe the hoverintent plugin can be made to work but i think just using the mouse click is a more elegant solution
update if you do decide to go forward with calling stored procedure via jdbc i would strongly recommend using callable-statement to invoke it
in your post you mentioned that it use libpcap to grab packets but as i know libpcap will just get a copy of the incoming packet and then that packet will still pass into the normal kernel stack path and that may be not what you want
if the parameter is greater than 0.5 multiplying lambda by two and subtract one this maps onto and return the interpolated color between color b and color c
in which case your application would be a consumer - in short the user would need to login and agree to authorizing your application to have access to the their data on the provider and you would be given an access-token which can be used to gain access to those protected resources
in this case i need product.id 1 to be shown selected in the listbox
the trouble is choosing a good value for x since for this particular page google-chrome is so very much faster than firefox which is faster than ie
best way to achieve it is to use log_min_duration_statement with value of 0 and using log_line_prefix such that is it will include information required to match line coming form the same backend
yes it can be done with linq-to-sql as bdukes and pcampbell has shown but it can be done with nhibernate as well
linq-to-sql is a smaller and simpler framework than entity framework but it has some nice features and is quite easy to get started with
you set a z-index that is higher than any other div in that spot
if you wish to match line beginning with the word stop followed by a space
or if you wish to match line beginning with the word stop but followed by either a space or any other non word character you can use your regex flavor permitting
however if you restrict the search spaces to for example common passwords with length under n you might no longer have the irreversibility property because the number of md5 output is much greater than the number of strings in the domain of interest
if that line ends up more than a couple of lines away from the top of the function it ll be confusing
i ve just decided to venture off into php land for fun and to learn reading that php is loosely typed and that var s can be reused is this true that the code below will pose no problem
if you are worried about the cost of purchasing a database there are very good proven open source databases out there such as mysql and postgresql that won t cost you anything
while i am not sure about tfs i do know that it supports nant and msbuild scripts which can be utilized for continuous-integration
is the entity-framework more efficient than nhibernate when used with visual studio
this new style for loops can be used with arrays as well
i appreciate the app could be pull based http-request response style but ideally i don t want to be polling that heavily just to check for notification
it seems to me that implementing the interface on the base-class makes it less obvious that the derived-class implements the interface but then again requires the interface to be specified for each derived-class
this is done in eclipse by creating a project for abstracttablemodel and selected it in the select types for which javadoc will be generated selection during javadoc generation
json is much easier to work with than xml in my opinion and json_encode decode is very fast so there s little overhead
however you will lose backwards-compatibility with python json requires version 2.6+
that way you could have the data sorted with a tree traversal and you could have fast lookup too
i m not familiar with mysql but the above would work in sql-server
xsd s allow you much tighter control over document content and i m pretty sure that restricting the number of occurrences of a particular child element in a mixed type complex element is possible even easy using an xsd
i think you should start with an architecture similar to nerddinner and refactor after you become more familiar with how asp.net-mvc works
but until you re well familiar with asp.net-mvc i would recommend sticking with the basic view engine - it s easiest to find help and samples for that
support for older versions of firefox is a lot trickier since any workaround you created would need to be hidden from safari
in your example i think you try to do an associative array and you should use object array is not meant to be used for key-value pairs
i want to compare median to average for each group city
the reason for this is that without the template keyword the compiler assumes that bar is a value and you wish to invoke the less than operators on it
i can t feel that how asp.net-mvc is better than webforms
i finally figured out that keypress has a better compatibility than keydown or keyup on linux platform
when you store more than one value in a field it s almost always some problems accessing the data
some styles are inherited so if you for example apply a font-size to the body element that would be inherited by any elements that doesn t already have a specific font-size set
c++-cli is a bit clunky because it contains language constructs for managed and for unmanaged programming but if you re already familiar with unmanaged c++ and c# you probably won t have any problems understanding it.
twice as wide twice as long four times the memory excepting smaller distances between the cell
the div .showarea is the div which needs to be rotated next prev but i want to keep only one div show at a time.
could this be done with boost iostream combination or boost iostream copy perhaps
if your tools can handle unix-style line termination you should set them to produce unix lines which can then be read by windows vs2008 notepad++ ... and unix alike and can be processed by any sh git-scripts
this site is will be hosted on server which has .net 3.0 installed and in iis asp.net 2.0 would be selected under asp.net tab
qt does have a good collection of containers but i am greatly familiar with stl boost stuff
c++ is as slow as python and 6 times slower than java
and web2py is more lightweight than django ruby-on-rails whatever on pretty much all counts
jsf is a web ui framework whereas seam is a more general web application framework that integrates not just jsf but conversational contexts workflow jbpm and object persistance preferably ejb3
i think the reason scala requires the type annotation on the parameters of a newly defined function comes from the fact that scala uses a more local type inference analysis than that used in haskell
the dashboard will just display charts and tables which can be fed by json xml etc
seam certainly is far better than using plain jsf refer the link posted by damo a couple of answers above
the marshalling module can be used to serialization code objects which can then be reassembled into a function
asp.net-mvc and webforms can live side-by-side in the same app so could new pages sections simply be developed using asp.net-mvc if that s the route you want
will select all field from tablex where somevariable x and the weekdifference variable value is greater than or equal to the recurrencetemp variable value
it s nice in that the overall data packets size is smaller but it makes it interesting when working with frameworks that all expect the same format
why would 32-bit be faster than the 64bit for a development box and vice versa for servers
however if you are using your main os to host vms then you can probably benefit from a ton of memory for your various virtuals - and then you can choose 32-bit and 64bit vms to suit your needs it is harder to have a 64bit guest vm in a 32-bit host
the only reason i can think of to choose 32-bit os is that you know that what you develop will work on 32-bit and 64bit machines
how can you get similar highlightings to zsh s less than bash s less in ubuntu
there are some things that asp.net-mvc does better and some things that webforms do better but if you don t know both technologies you can t choose the best one for the current project you are doing so please don t do yourself a disservice - go and learn asp.net-mvc
i think the real problem with traditional project-management is that more often than not it doesn t really exist
where of course a for-loops can be substituted to loops over a b c ... and a small part can be memoized
all you have to document is the data types that will be used xml formats json etc.
i keep getting the error sequence contains more than one elements
authentication is the more interesting part of the problem here
i prefer amf over xml or json
basic auth over http is more secure and it should work with your hashed password
though if you are going to eventually fill a substantial portion of the map the dictionary method is much less efficient
on the other hand oledb can be used via ado from c++ and that you might find very comfortable coming from ado.net although there serious differences between ado and ado.net
strncpy is not safer than strcpy it just trades one type of bugs with another
my personal opinion is that it is vastly more useful than strncpy and strcpy
you can use webrat or webrat selenium or simply selenium with cucumber in such cases
if you need this path in external programs for build eclipse has internal variables that can be used for ant maven etc.
therefore book writers were more familiar with linq-to-sql and or felt it was more stable
a balanced binary tree also has o log n lookup performance however it is much faster to update also around o log n while a sorted list is more like o n for updates o log n to find the position for insert or the element to delete but then up to n elements must be moved within the list and this is o n
mac os x comes with one out of the box which required nothing more than checked a box in system preferences. setting up such a server for development would let you view the site at and might resolve this relative links problem
the behaviour of a derived-class is more specific than that of a base-class and covariance expresses one aspect of the difference
i am scraping a list of rss feeds by using curl - look at the xml from the rss feed that s giving the problem there s more than one feed so it s possible for some feeds to be right and for the feeds that are wrong to be wrong in different ways
i am not shure why si that but from peopletable p jobtable j can be replaced with cross-join
you can use the javascriptconverter class when you need more control over the serialization and deserialization process
have the users select cells and then click the button to change the .colorindex property of the selection to the button s .colorindex
often times the order you list tables is dictated to you you start from tablea and you need to list tableb first in order to have access to columns required to join in tablec
still not pretty but might appeal to you a little more than putting derived-class names in the base-class
as others have mentioned a version-control system i prefer git but subversion will also work and some form of communication
if you decide to take the json.net plunge you ll also want to grab jsonnetresult as it returns an actionresult that can be used in asp.net-mvc application
since that code is and ing the 64-bit variable j with the 32-bit result of a bit-shift the result will be expanded to 64bit by the compiler
i have built an app which has the ability to delete cell from a table but only if there are more than two cell
the issue of cross-site scripting can be mitigated quite good with whitelist
i prefer fluid version of 960.gs fluid 960 grid system
the configuration can be defined in a parent project and will be inherited by all the child projects if you do this avoid declaring any files as they won t be discovered only set the filepaths property
however what you could do is learn ajax - if you don t know it yet - and create a script php asp perl ssi etc. that counts the files in the directory and prints the number - i recommend perl -
it must have the overall general behaviour of a cocoa object when using cocoa so that it can be added to arrays used as keys to a dictionary etc except in regards to its memory management since it was allocated differently
scala is a functional programming language that is fully compatible with java runs through the jvm
from my experience webrick is slower than mongrel is slower than thin
secondly i did not use ienumerable because it is more generic than icollection and does not even have simple properties like count
this msdn article states that static classes should be declared as sealed and abstract
note that the regular expression d will match zero or more digits - this includes the empty string since this is exactly zero digits
surprisingly the c++ version runs significantly slower than the python version
postgresql supports some more security features than mysql for example integration with gssapi or kerberos for logins last i checked mysql didn t have these
traditionally postgresql has had fewer security issues than mysql but they are both doing very well on that
shouldn t be more than 5-6 line
if you choose asp.net defently go for the new mvc framework and you will also learn about the .net framework and c# unless you choose another language of course
so i would recommend asp.net-mvc
i prefer asp.net-mvc but have found that it s so loosely coupled that you need to really learn a bunch of stuff to build something using a proper stack with best practices
when performing pointer arithmetic these types should also be used in 32-bit code that needs to be compatible with 64bit
scala collections are far richer than their java counterparts but most java frameworks are unable to use them
for php i would recommend yii cakephp or codeigniter .
all classes that inherit from the base class will also be marked as serialization
in terms of development speed i would say that there is not much to choose between ruby-on-rails and grails as both allow similarly rapid development
with java iterator s i have used the hasnext method to determine whether an iteration has more elements without consuming an element -- thus hasnext is like a peek method
i can be reached on twitter via or email via rory nothinggoeshere becker gmail . com
this is less common for me because i only use var to shorten very long declarations and ulong is the opposite
it could be combined with git version-control for better interaction
continuous-integration is extremely helpful when you have to integrate changes into a codebase from more than one development-environment and it s pretty tough to automate builds when you re tied to a gui
from my initial research it looks like maven myeclipse integration is even worse
doing mvvm in silverlight is harder than in wpf but we ve done it
we ve recently switched from trac to redmine where i work and i think i like it a little more than trac and use the wiki functionality almost everyday
if you have the ability to spend money i d recommend fogbugz otherwise go with trac or the others recommended here
ruby-on-rails fast flash-to-bang django s more than just crud is included wicket s designer-friendly templating.... listed on to see if they match what you want
the sequence as per hibernate s error message can be cast to long-integer short or string while your sequence returns a bigdecimal
inner-join s tend to be faster than left join s
redmine was written to be a better trac than trac
third oracle s version of sql is much differnt from mysql and the administration of oracle databases is much more complex
for example i ve read that opera and ie will fix framerates slower than firefox
the learning curve for linq to sql may be slightly less steep than for ado.net entity-framework
another interesting point i have found is that linq-to-sql tends to write much more efficient sql than linq to entities just something to keep in mind
if you want to select configuration-files based on the url i would just identify the call stack that leads to this function and pass in either an enum value or the config file s name directly
he also points out that python is faster than ruby
scala uses jvm as a backend and thus is not going to be any faster than java - and if you use higher-level abstractions it will most likely be slower somewhat but probably in the same ballpark
running your application through an obfuscation makes reverse-engineering more difficult and costly
i might be inclined to extend or otherwise wrap contentvalue with a class that offers that methods hence making the code reusable
it can be integrated to c++ also very easily and conveniently using the boost python c++ binding for the python c api
declarations which contains a single expression are expected not to be enclosed inside curly-braces unless other syntactic considerations make that impossible
you will match line containing one and only one among that list
64bit systems can process data in chunks twice as large as 32-bit which helps some operations go more quickly
i like to use languages that are specifically made to be embedded in c++ or c like lua falcon or chaiscript
the code beneath works great but the problem is that the code is designed to compare var a with var b this is a bottleneck because it s a 1 on 1 action
thanks mikushi for the comment another possibility that i haven t used much is the the xhprof extension it also helps with profiling can generate callgraphs -- but is lighter than xdebug which mean you should be able to install it on a production server
if it is an option make it only be transmitted with http data
the drawback is that a 64bit cpu with everything equal would consume more power than a 32-bit cpu just due to roughly twice the amount of circuitry needed
for example the results could be assigned to private-members of the thread object and guarded with a flag that is atomically by the thread to say it is done
normally in the mvc pattern when a user clicks on a page the request would be sent then controllers would handle the request then process it using the model and route it to the appropriate view
scala unfortunately has neither of these properties and so cannot provide a full equivalent to haskell s where clause
the downside with constructor injection is that the configuration of your object graph is more complicated
you will likely get a lot more assistance with sql-server and access in the newsgroups and such than you would with mysql
i personally prefer isapi-rewrite as it is much better simpler to write rules and has more features
however you are probably wasting your time since you will hardly find any lossless-compression that does more than a 1-10 size reduction
and can someone please provide some resources or sample codes that i can learn on how to properly write a .net dll which has functions with parameters that can be called from vb6 vba app
one case for doing this in init is that viewdidload can be called after viewwillappear
i also can t have entrydailyavg subclassing entry as django will save a new entry base every time i save a new entrydailyavg
perhaps the subject was forward-compatibility which makes things easier if you have it but require forethought and some luck vs
this is just an overview of the most simple way to do this there are many more details that will make this look much better such as shading with a lighting source to get the bump appearance
besides the cocoa frameworks--which can be used from python via the built-in pyobjc bridge ruby via macruby or rubycocoa -there are a number of other options
regarding the language if given the choice between c++ and python i would pick python 100 of the time
even ignoring the obvious difference in abstraction between those languages python simply has more useful libraries than c++
you can have gas work perfectly fine with intel-syntax by putting the following line at the top of your source file
word existence could be done with a trie or more simply with a set a hashtable
the single-threaded application model requires that no single object live in more than one sta thread at a time verses the mta thread model
doesn t mean that delphi or c++ is more powerful than .net since .net is gaining quickly on the gui application level
the md5 hash is no smaller than the uuid so it doesn t help with storage
i also made it clear that visual basic would be less powerful than delphi since delphi had much better database-aware components
but if you do decide on using a framework from my experience of having used stripes struts1 and jsf myfaces recommend stripes without hesitation
asp.net controls cannot be used in asp.net-mvc
i prefer the command line because i have a shell window open in the source anyway to run builds and tests and along with file name completion using the keyboard is faster than using the mouse for me
can be called to upgrade your settings from the previous versioning
the same can be applied for width height min and max with minor adjustments
should i create a new routes rule or this can be achieved in controllers and view without editing routes
i have no recent experience as to how pyrxp today compares with lxml or celementtree
to be clear it does not match any string that contains or
in that case i would recommend net.tcp binding with on both ends
i have too little experience with postgresql or oracle to judge so i will just stick with not recommending mysql
i personally prefer to write classes that can themselves be persisted poco rather than deal with a separate data entity model
i suspect this is due to the display block in the li elements but they need to have fixed width height is there a way around this
i am usually using linq to entities and have not much experience with linq-to-sql
basically all types that the database system itself offers like numeric varchar etc. or that the programming language of choice offers int string etc. would be considered atomicity data base types
i d like to try and do this in python even though i could it in php in half the time this is because i dont know anywhere near as much python as php
when i select run as blackberry-simulator it works as expected
i happen to know all three php java and ruby and have written many applications in all of them plus others but i drastically prefer ruby
i think you should choose between python or ruby
this will force the browser to display a scrollbar when the contents of the inner table are larger than the height of the surrounding
this may be difficult to get exactly right because some users may have set their scrollbar to be wider or smaller than the default
the built-in network service user account has fewer access privileges on the system than the localsystem user account but the network service user account is still able to interact throughout the network with the credentials of the computer account
the leading-underscore convention is widely used not just for private names but also for what c++ would call protected ones -- for example names of methods that are fully intended to be overridden by subclassing even ones that have to be overridden since in the base-class they raise notimplementederror
is there an expandable array class in the java api equivalent to the vector or arraylist class that can be used with primitive int char double etc
after the first print try system.out.flush and see if the first line appears without more lines being printed
and you only need the in your css function if you are modifying more than one key-value pair
if you plan on doing massive updates i might hesitate to recommend updating all columns since it may cause fk look-ups etc
since you re on windows i can highly recommend heidisql over phpmyadmin for working with mysql
those events which are inserted using code templates can be modified by editing the template files they are xml document in the c program files codegear rad studio xxxx objrepos code_templates delphi directory
i think this type of thing could be achieved on linux unix using the setfacl getfacl commands but i m unsure on how to do this with os x
the truth is you never actually need more than one controllers
operators should be considered language-features and not expected to translate well between different languages
what all this means is that a 64bit computer can store and retrieve much more information than a 32-bit computer
i ve read in some other places that using a different mouse event can work as well such as mouseup or mousedown
python is a nice language but much bigger than lua and in the throes of a major revision transition from 2.5 to 3.x
ruby is less complex than python but more complex than lua
my workmate claims that for object types pre-increment is more efficient than post-increment
i guess the word serialization is throwing me off more than serialization object
if so you just need a streaming api such as stax or sax - stax will probably make this significantly easier than sax but it isn t built into java 1.4 so you d need an extra dependency
my problem is that using the thread pool and 4 threads is much slower than doing the jobs sequentially having one loop executed by a separate thread is much slower than execution it directly in the main thread sequentially
to add the subreport you simply choose subreport from the insert menu and go through the steps of creating the new subreport or pointing to an existing report to be used for the subreport
if you choose to do a new report you give it a name and choose report wizard to create the subreport
asp.net-mvc is a vastly superior framework over webforms it just requires a bit more upfront work and has a learning curve
virtual means that the method may be overridden in subclassing but has an directly-callable implementation in the base-class
it sounds like what you really need is a rich text-editor that has html support
in jquery how can i set an event such that when user is browsing some pictures and presses the left right arrow key it calls a function which can be used to show the previous next photos
from users perspective to view wpf browser application user will need total dot net framework to be installed that is considerably higher than silverlight runtime
using which sql operator can i check that residue of division in decimal digits is greater then zero
digits is greater then zero
winforms and wpf are easier than silverlight when you have to access a database because you can do it directly
the first sequence contains more than one elements
check out reporting services in sql-server express with advanced services for key differences and editions and components of sql-server 2008 has more info
i ve also evaluated hudson it seems to be somewhat more flexible than cruisecontrol.net but i dont personally like the configuration interface of it
generally a view controllers is more in charge and tells the view what data to display or where to position itself etc
a simple git-svn will reproduce the svn branches actually simple directory with copies in it so i would recommend using svn2git and git2svn
this will match https as well as http links
secondly iterators don t allow the source collection to be modified during iteration so there isn t any opportunity to remove elements during the select anyway
you haven t told us anything about your database structure but since you are successfully allowing people to add links you must have a sequences defined somewhere which keeps track of an integer id for the link so that every link can be given a unique id in the database
network cards and routers have a tendency to prefer tcp-ip packages above udp
elementtree is included in the standard library but lxml is faster
you ve already said the network is private lan which eliminates one of my suggestions the other is to make sure the network is switched - a hub could easily lose packets
the getpositionlist may be badly designed and simply create a new array for you essentially meaning that the library author should have used out instead of ref
mysql is more widely supported and a little easier to use but postgresql has some very cool features and functionality that s worth taking a gander at
edit i guess to help clear up some of the confusion in the comments below i get the intuition that php would be better than python at organizing the front-end presentation part of a website while python would excel at the back-end part the actual programming...
the question is - am i wrong and is python just as good as php for front-end
that said python is much easier than php
if you want php nothing is more php than php itself and python takes different approaches so maybe you re going to be frustrated because things are not like you re used to
so basically for 3.0 and 3.1 the exact same thing is happening but when running the app in 3.0 simulator the last line seems to get cut off if the cell.detailtextlabel.numberoflines has more than three lines of text
you can t easily compare php and python
i can t think of any sitecore projects that i think would have benefited from asp.net-mvc
an instance of the mylistsurrogate class can then be passed to the datacontractserializer constructor and it will be called during serialization and deserialization to substitute types as needed on the fly
getimagedata has a for-loop i realised that each index in loops is called more than once
then you can do a simple json post i would recommend json for this because it s a very simple post requesting very simple data so xml would be overkill
the difference between a thread and a process is that different processes usually cannot directly share memory and data structures although various mechanisms to share information between processes exist they are usually more costly than sharing information between threads
also c++-cli allows you a much more clean interop with unmanaged code actually allowing you to mix managed unmanaged code which is a performance crucial environment may be of benifit
not much experience with windows 7 but i can tell you that it took some time to get the installation procedures for windows-xp and the associated development tools documented on our team
passing a function to lets you supply code to be run .when the document is ready meaning .when the page itself has loaded without necessarily having loaded external resources like images stylesheets et cetera for which you wouldn t want to have to wait
optimization affects the debugabbility of your code - some line of code may be removed some line of code from different parts of a function or from different functions may be merged together local variables may be folded together and so on
scala can compete directly with java and give it a run for its money on almost all aspects
dont pop a messagebox which requires user input to clear on a hidden desktop instance
i am not very familiar with java but i can say python is very well suited for the job
the user will select checkbox from a datagrid of rss feeds on my site and when pressing a button the heavy lifting will happen
otherwise i recommend using postgresql over mysql since it is more standards compliant and has a nicer license
these two steps together are likely to take less work than any solution that relies on the nested set representation
ubuntu heavily relies on python scripting and generally consumes more resources than debian
and now the mvc pattern can be added with asp.net-mvc
can i check this before sending to controllers and gives an alert to user or it should be done in controllers
all of the default string functions strlen strpos etc. should be replaced with multibyte string functions that look at the character instead of the byte
it sounds like you just want to have stuff under version-control this way you won t have to worry about the learning curve associated with git
or at least imagine you are going to and get the project finished in such a way that you would not be shamed to put it out into the open
i want to match any string that does not contains the string dontmatchthis
im looking for simple script that will compile to exe and i found py2exe
3 mysqlhotcopy inly works on myisam tables and in most applications you are better off with innodb
for a virtual machine i d recommend ubuntu-server edition jeos as that won t have any un-needed software on it
implementing common-lisp is a larger task since the language is larger
for disk space you can just zip it and that can be done while recording so while playing that memory is not being hogged
i m not super familiar with linq-to-sql yet but something that strikes me is that this
i d recommend linq-to-sql for just getting started and you can use a lot of that in linq to entities going forward
i recommend using ubuntu-server and deprec as it provides a ton of sysadmin recipes that make things even easier
you can use a base controllers class and override the onactionexecuting method directly on the controllers which is probably more appropriate than using a filter if your intent is to apply your filter code on all actions across the board
ocaml is a great language -- one of my favorites -- but if your interest is distributed systems than i d recommend going with erlang which is head and shoulders ahead of the other fp languages with regards to distributed systems although there s an offshoot of ocaml called jocaml which has some interesting aspects
so i m only useful with c++ java python and the web design languages html css javascript jquery
if encoding differs for all documents then remember this the whole document itself must have been encode by some encoding type thus all those xml documents it includes will be using the same encoding no matter what each header is telling you
understand why your managed code such as .net clr should not be granted elevated-privileges
since you re familiar with c++ java and python i would recommend using c++ java or python
update given that syntax-error in the question has been corrected see for a description of what values are acceptable
nowadays datejs is outdated and not maintained so use momentjs which is much better as pointed out by t.j
but the function vad does not get called in firefox nor in google-chrome
i would choose asp.net-mvc because it s widely used in web development these days rails .net asp.net-mvc which is used for so so my application will be more easily maintainable by someone else
if you need a surrogate primary key using an auto_increment field is better than an md5 hash because it is fewer bytes of data and database backends optimize for integer primary keys
i m assuming you re doing eclipse rcp because otherwise i d recommend spring dm or ipojo google guice with peaberry or declarative services ...
it s cross platform and you can literally code this effect in less than 30 line of code
so far i am just binding two separate cells but then when i m expanding the tree the icon cell grows larger and a gap appears between the icon and its accompanying label
i wouldn t be worried about the perf overhead of keeping a separate record of this - it only has to be updates when users are printing and printing will definitely be more expensive than updating a file
if you really want all 8 bytes in a single number then you need to read more than the unsigned short
use the html interoperability features to get set call javascript and the serving web page s dom
i wonder because there seems to be a view that the least amount of line used is better however i would like to understand if this is because there is a tangible technical benefit or if there was at some point a tangible benefit or if it is indeed for a reason that is quantifiable
in your example everything on one line is actually more readable than separate lines
to do this so that it works over a range that is less than one line is a little more complicated this allows either sorting multiple lines individually or sorting part of one line depending on the visual selection
this is the sort of thing that used to be handled by bitwise-operators
com has been replaced by .net in many projects but com still can be written in low-level mfc atl c++ and people only use com for writing high performance application where every cpu cycle counts probably directx game apps hardware interfacing etc
if your rich text box was going to have more than 10 line or so it would be a good idea to use a stringbuilder instead of a string to compose the new text with
crackers will crack by sniffing the traffic between your app and the dongle and either disabling any code that tests for dongle presence or writing code to emulate the dongle by replaying recorded traffic whichever looks easier
please note that the actions of qwidget and qmenu are stored as a qlist which can be read using qwidget actions
the php arrays type is actually more akin to an an ordered map than a traditional c arrays
for example if a user selects category apple and banana projects foo and qux show up
oh and poll is generally better than select in terms of not having to copy as much data around
be aware that even if you lock inside each method in your type calling more than one method in a sequence can not be considered atomicity
a class that doesn t need to inherit any special behavior from another class should nevertheless be made a subclassing of the nsobject class
also json has a smaller footprint than xml and is also usually better human parseable
since ireadwrite implements ireadonly ireadwrite is said to be a subclassing of ireadonly although subclassing is more accurately used to describe a class which inherits a base-class rather then implements an interface--for the sake of simplicity they are very nearly the same concept
the abstract class urlconnection provides set getusecaches methods which can be used by any subclasses
it has a helper function that can be used with arrays and can be a shortcut for simple for each loops
for the latter approach i suggest using expect if you are proficient with tcl or pyexpect if you prefer python
i am trying to choose between postgresql and firebird databasses
to confirm that a tcp socket can be opened try telnet on the listening port from the new machine
if you want to avoid javascript reading your cookies and man in the middle attacks you need to use a server with http and set the session cookie to only be transported over http
having something implement a serialization interface makes more sense as saying this is something the class can do not what the class is
but in stored procedures firebird is much more powerful than postgresql
postgresql do not say that is worse than firebird firebird is not that much better than postgresql
i ve been working with postgresql firebird oracle mysql mssql more than 6 years ago and my preferred are firebird and postgresql
the article outlines how this is implemented in mysql but it can easily be ported to oracle
in reality under the hood a pointers may be passed on stack to facilitate this
lost-focus covers me better in that respect but that s only after the focus has already been lost though of course i could switch it back
also although you re adding a document it doesn t seem to work if you specify more than one element
better average time complexity than with a sorted list can be obtained using hashtable
postgresql is much more complete and solid and will much better support complex queries and their optimization while mysql may shine in terms of retrieval speed for extremely simple queries
for starters i usually recommend trying ruby or php
the subi instruction can be used to add subtract any 8 bit constant to from an 8 bit value
a friend runs an entire shipping company with millions of transactions on postgresql with linux servers java and he is very happy.but the maintenance is more heavy than firebird
if you have a full version of visual studio 2008 rather than the express edition it integrates the inbuilt mstest much better than nunit does and cruise control also supports mstest
this is more than 5000 line of serious spaghetti code
there is also no way to determine a line number because again by the time of execution the notion of code lines is no longer meaningful in javascript
firebird is smaller and easer than postgresql but it s also very good in performance stability and low mantenaince
i should imagine that it will be released .when it s ready
edit my first impulse is always to use a filter but the generator-expression is more memory efficient and shorter .
a dump from 32-bit process can be analyzed on 32-bit and 64bit machine
i prefer ado.net myself but just for balance there is one advantage of classic ado over ado.net it is arguably more usable
openid and its extensions could be used for authorization and oauth can be used for authentication which can be thought of as a no-op authorization
pylons is not that much simpler than django and it doesn t seem to have the same community
64bit apps will not always run faster than 32-bit
scala code can easily call directly into java code but sometimes calling scala code from java code is trickier since the translation from scala into bytecode is not quite as straightforward as for java
a number of people at the company i currently intern at prefer emacs or vim
i can t see how a basic text-editor is faster or easier than an ide in general although i appreciate some things like building tend to be faster from the command line
in the name of good housekeeping i remove script blocks from the dom that apply to old content blocks since that javascript is no longer needed
it s probably easier to learn from scratch than cvs but i don t have experience that way. if someone needed a centralized source-control system i would recommend perforce as long as they had the resources to license it
if the specified selection position is less than 0 then the item at position 0 will be selected
this question is similar in nature to whether ant is better than maven or c# better than java
performing addition on this slightly larger type will pretty much always be faster than doing division or modulus on the type itself
for example on most 32 bit systems 64-bit addition is faster than 32-bit division modulus
if you already know java i highly recommend programming groovy
put partials used by more than one controllers into the shared folder
the range of double is much wider than the range of int or long
my goal is to accept a set of these and generate a query that returns any rows that match any single inclusion filter without matching any single exclusion filter
additionally after the filtered query set is built ordering may be applied by any of the fields
an arbitrary oauth access-token can t be used for authentication because the meaning of the token is outside of the oauth core spec
what i am thinking is to create a form in ms-access which should have a browse button for selecting my source access mdb file and then another button for processing on clicking the table specified above by browse button should be imported into sql-server
in this regard json is far more lightweight then xml
note that you can ofcourse also use the java library from scala so other ways to format numbers from java can also be used from scala
in this case the int values you gave will be converted to double
spreadsheetgear for .net reads and writes csv xls xlsx and does more
spreadsheetgear for .net reads and writes csv xls xlsx and does more
other audio codecs that can be used with ogg include speex for speech celt for ultra-low delay audio and flac for lossless audio compression
write it in perl it is faster and uses less resources than php
in any case where the value you re trying to match contains both single and double quotes you can construct an expression that uses concat to produce the text that it s going to match
because there are much better choices than linq-to-sql nhibernate and subsonic being two of them there is no need to worry about microsoft s future plans for linq-to-sql or lack thereof
mysql has been shown to have tied oracle as the fastest and most scalable database software
however these different systems have different strengths postgresql has a ton more functionality than mysql and can handle some very specific tasks that mysql struggles with
mysql has been shown to have tied oracle as the fastest and most scalable database software
when scrolltop is less than 300 show the div otherwise hide it
to stored the flat file i think berkeley db is a good choice the key can be generated by md5 or other hash function and you can also compress the content of the file to save some disk space
is a negative set that matches any character that is not in the set
one possible fix is to use the post redirect pattern which is becoming more common with asp.net-mvc but the principles still apply
there s a feeling of i could spend time and plot all this out in uml...or i could just write some python that actually implements the design and expresses it in a language i like to read and lots of people can read. java programs tend to feel heavier than their ruby or python counterparts it s part of the design of the language
as a previous poster said c++ is lower level than python
so it would match line that look like this
another option is to spend a bit of cash on a 15000 rpm disk or a ssd solid state disk although that ll be slower than a ramdisk
after importing more than 4000 revision i m now getting the following error whenever i run git svn fetch or git svn rebase which i don t manage to get rid of
this setting should be inherited from shell to subshell so java should use the setting in the shell it was started from
a list of rsa dsa identity files to be used in rsa dsa authentication
but it should be the standard that would be adopted by opera-mini gwt etc
i m trying to create a multiline textarea in a php page and i want to validate so that if the user can t insert more than 50 characters per line or more than 50 lines
im not too familiar with jquery - but id suggest using the prototype framework along with scriptaculous - within prototype you can definately achieve this effect
this is quite annoying as more than just error-logging is broken
however innodb tends to be slower as myisam
i would check out slimdx a much thinner directx wrapper than xna or wpf
for more advanced ussages you might want to check out jquery at which goes together great with asp.net-mvc
it is more complex than linq-to-sql as it provides much greater flexibility
note that while mac osx uses a different method for it s prng and therefore does not block my personal benchmarks done in college have shown it to be every-so-slightly less random than the linux kernel
all new web service development should be done using wcf - which is not available until .net 3.0 and gets quite mature and stable at .net 3.5
suppose i ask the user do you want to run in 32-bit mode or 64bit mode and they pick 32-bit
ie is less performant than safari chrome and firefox when it comes to js - but have you really developed a page that is unusable in ie with js turned on
if you do have reliable sessions set to true you re most important settings are maxconcurrentsessions how many sessions clients can be connected at any given moment and maxconcurrentinstances how many instances of your service object can exist at any given time
an explicit rollback is probably more appropriate when you encounter a condition that is not causing an exception but you still don t want to commit
the assign macro dialog will be displayed selected the macro and click the ok button
two rows will only be joined when gethashcode of left and right are the same and equals returns true
i recommend llvm and gcc with binutils neither produce great code but they are multi platform and multi target and both have optimizers
basically i don t want to compare elements but elements that thy contains
anyone has any idea whether this could be possible because of stricter policies which might have been set on any folder
it s inescapable for functions that can have side effects but it s actually almost trivial to define some functions that just should literally be replaced with line of code every time they appear translate the source code into that and only then compile
i m not too familiar with asp.net-mvc but shouldn t your testsubmit method look more like this
take the numeric type class it says that anything that is an instance of the class can perform certain operations + - so integer is a member of numeric and provides implementations of the functions necessary to be considered numeric and can be used anywhere a numeric is expected
if you are familiar with php i d recommend using asp.net-mvc over webforms but from the sound of what you are saying you ve already started down the road of webforms
if you re more familiar with wcf you could also use it in place of .net remoting
i m thinking the syntax that is involved with category is much more complex than tagging in another where
i recommend doing fontfamily helvetica neue helvetica arial font-size 20pt and setting the font weight to the lowest possible 100
how do i programmatically check for create a custom event log to be viewed in windows-xp 2003 event viewer
i tried a few ides on ubuntu and it just didn t seem right - gedit is lightweight and i actually enjoy using it more than textmate on os x
me i use vim usually in the gvim incarnation as my python ide and i ve seen emacs-using colleagues do at-least-equivalent wizardry but i just can t get used to emacs myself
remember to add this in a script before the body tag so it will be called .when all elements are rendered in the page dom ready trick
a cocoa app is much easier than writing and reading a carbon app
if there is more than one constructor then you d have to check some external state of the returned object
i agree that firebird can be better than sql lite and m sql express or even is better than mysql scales better with the number of cpus and is more mature triggers and transactions are implemented for many many light years ago
awk is the tool of choice for column-based data some prefer perl but not me
so if the input iterable is sorted the combination tuples will be produced in sorted order
i would strongly recommend against having a scrollable select with 100s of options for usability reasons
i haven t chosen a db yet so if mysql or postgresql is better in some way over the other please provide your preference and perhaps why if you have time
python bindings to gobject and glib provide an application framework not bound to gui or anything-- however if it should be bound to a ui gtk comes closer
oracle also incorporates more features than mysql
in my machine this means solutions with less than 100k line of code
attributes are burnt in at compile time and cannot for reflection be set at runtime
if i choose llvm gcc 4.2 or clang llvm when i hit breakpoint local symbols are not available and gdb says no symbol self in current context if i try to print self or any other local symbol
this article compares perl and lisp macros but the point is still the same text level macros perl c++ cause massive problems compared to source level macros lisp
this will validate that it is any number of digits with at least one 1-9 so greater than zero
appropriate codecs to play the video need not be bundled in blackberry-simulator
sql-server will perform better than postgresql for most actions and about the same as db2
other databases where it was about the same for a transactional database as oracle sql server where were better than mysql postgresql etc
the cpu is indeed slower on sparc 1.2ghz and as answered by one of the sun s engineers t2 is usualy 3 times slower for single-threaded application than modern intel processor
a lot of articles about bazaar will tell you it is a lot slower than git or mercurial
another option might be to scale to maximum width and then check if the scaled height is greater then the maximum allowed height and if so scale by height or vice versa
the problem is that even if the session-timeout is set to be longer than the forms-authentication timeout i ve noticed that sometimes the current session is reset ie session null
not completely but confguration that corresponds closely to code structures such as jpa mapping or dependency injection in spring can often be replaced with annotations and is then usually much less verbose annoying and painful
i personally would have made a controllers that generates the menu by populating a model with the menu hierarchy from the database and calls a template to render an html fragment of the menu
some people were saying that postgresql is better for security purposes whereas mysql is becoming more feature rich.
postgresql is faster than mysql s innodb
community has been a big reason that i ve liked using out of house projects - either the microsoft ecosystem if you choose entity-framework or the very vibrant open source community around projects like nhibernate
it should work similar to how xml can be validated using xsd
but in both cases even if i put controls in a table and set the width of the table and columns to 600px if i put say 1000 characters in the textarea on page one on page 2 the display control is far wider than the 600 pixels i want to limit it to
and also don t forget - http.sys much more customizable than httplistener
jdbc only exposes a result set that can be closed so they may have put a finalize that closes the connection if you haven t called close on the result set and closed it yourself
and postgresql has fewer experienced administrators than the big databases and mysql which i believe contributes to the reputation
c++ does not have built in runtime reflection
why isn t postgresql as widespread as mysql
union select select select
linq-to-sql is faster with large schemas and in most cases emits
none of these are quite as short as the perl solution already posted but they certainly seem to beat python and ruby
i think you should create a trigger on your table that will be fired on updates and will change the value after updating first row
typically child windows can t be maximized or minimize
if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values
if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value
personally i find shark more useful than instrumentation for profiling my code and finding out what s taking up time when it matters
so for example you might pick linq-to-sql or the entity framework for your data access side
i usually work in mysql and i understand ms sql-server is better at grouping queries
some sort of binary serialization will often do much better than xml-serialization
you can bind an event to be fired .when the dom tree is ready which will generally be before the page is displayed
i m not sure about iis 6 but in iis 7 you select the site and go to bindings and click add select http it will automaticaly chose port 443 and then chose your ssl cerificate
since you are already using asp.net forms authentication the asp.net roleprovider which can be integrated into asp.net-mvc via the authorize attribute is just as easy to setup
however amfphp seems to be outdated and zend-amf from what i understand only works with the zend framework something i dont use nor like imho
i feel extremely comfortable dealing with 32-bit powerpc assembly code but i am completely lost when trying to make sense of x86 code
hence your typical netbeans project can be compiled with ant and your maven project already is a netbeans project
consider setting split-height-threshold to a larger value than the frame height
it seems to me that a feature is usually bigger than a task - one feature usually required several things to be done - checked if this sth will affect efficiency add the control in the gui implement new extension to the core engine update documentation
although if you aren t interested in using adobe cs you can use ubuntu distro which is easier than other linux distro and quiet popular so you won t have any problem finding solution
asp.net-mvc makes it easier for different members of a team to work on different sections of the application
clearly wcf is designed specifically for creating rest endpoints with all of the security implications that are implied thereof whereas asp.net-mvc is designed to create rest endpoints which can be used by asp.net-mvc itself
wcf rest more automation than asp.net-mvc a much more solid frameowkr than asp.net-mvc rest caching security error handling etc basically all the stff you d have to write yourself using plain asp.net-mvc
a sample code for swing is available here if you don t need anything fancy or special it may be easier than jfreechart because of the direct available documentation
in this situation the code function that created the url downloader may no longer even be in memory if it was called in response to a user selection a menu item or an action in a view controllers that is no longer on the screen
using asp.net-mvc gives you more control and an easier experience integrating this way
if you really wanted to rename the variables and parameter names you would probably want to try and build a process that just parses the code files to do a text replacement with regular expression or basic string manipulation depending on what you know bearing in mind it would be a once only change this would probably be quicker than evaluation code refactoring tools
it can be done if inorder preorder traversal of a tree is given
check out the official asp.net website which has plenty of articles tutorials screen casts and demos on how to get started on asp.net webforms development
json is actually faster to load and write than standard xml
i know virtualbox allows you to define shared folder which are directory on your host that are exposed to the guest
properties can be registered with getter setter
everything works fine with windows authentication but when i change the authentication to form based the login process get fails
to avoid the many problems that can always arise with buffering for tasks such as getting the subprocess s output to the main process in real time i always recommend using pexpect for all non-windows platform wexpect on windows instead of subprocess when such tasks are desired
with this in your soldier model i m assuming there is an associations that contains more email addresses you want to use
now that asp.net-mvc exists i d say webforms is more about letting non-web devs do web
libraries expected or hoped for in the deployment environment xml or jrocket must be included for building and test purposes but excluded from the shipping product
count will only be executed for category where category.matches query returns true
closest to but lower than the sequence numbers of the snapshot
for sql statements the log4j.logger.org.hibernate.sql property needs to be set to debugging and for sql parameters returned values the log4j.logger.org.hibernate.type property needs to be set to trace
in many cases this is a better choice than stl set which i personally more or less use only to build a sorted list incrementally
reflection is much more general and enables you to inspect type information at runtime and manipulate objects without knowing their type at compile time
i do think you might be better off with perl and its unpack feature but awk can handle it too albeit verbosely
at what point can instances be created destroy
well the bubble-sort algorithm is shorter than 100 line and doesn t use any function calls so why should you
i am tempted to create a single login method over ssl instead that authentications a user and returns a guid that will be passed to authentication subsequent requests with an expiration policy per guid etc
when you call a function any local variable will be stored on stack and stack pointers will be incremented
stack pointers will point at the next location where new data can be pushed to stack where it will stay until it s popped back again
you may still find some really performance critical bits of code written in assembly in some games but generally whole functions will be written in assembly rather than using bits of inline-assembly in c c++ code
errors should be caught as exception-handling in a try-catch block
re-order your script so the subtraction test is timed first then the addition and suddenly addition becomes the faster operation again
yes that s possible by adding the top circle with a transparency edge in a div that has the bigger circle as background-image if needed also transparency
the reason is that your .net application is very likely to be built in anycpu configuration which means it will run as a x64 application on a x64 platform
a union-all will normally perform better than a union as a union is a set operation and will remove duplicates by default as will minus and intersect
if you just want a default-value is probably better because its actually a string and you can call string methods on it
i have a situation where i want a java client to have a two-way data channel with a servlet i have control over both so that either can begin data transferring without having to wait for the other to do something first but to get through the firewalls this needs to be tunnelled in http or https
basically the large controllers project invokes the smaller projects
i am guessing this is because modifying a double is a more complex operation than modifying an int
or you can switch to path based authentication
now the problem that i am facing is that the processing of the data which is to be show is taking more than 3 seconds so what i have done is that before the app starts to process data for the next update the refresh qtimer is stopped and after the data is processed i again restart the qtimer.the app should work in such a way that after an update refresh during this refresh the app goes unresponsive the user should get ample time to continue to work on the app apart from seeing the data being updated.i am able to get acceptable pauses for the user to work-- in one scenario
today my question is - how should i set content-type and content-disposition headers when serving several requested byte ranges
the easiest way i have been able to restore files and not lose revision history is using svn copy the merge example above to me seems like a more complex way to achieve the same thing
i believe the reason for this is that more than one event-listener can be added this way and if they d return different truth values the result would be ambiguous
why do people recommend app-config or web-config
the answer is simple if you want to print for example html code in which naturally there are a lot of double-quotes wrapping the string in single-quotes is much more readable
i feel hashmap is better option if i can come up with good hashing function
2 the libraries in ironpython are very different than cpython
note that break statements after each case that multiple case statements can be used per condition and that there is a catch-call default case that will fire if nothing else matched
here the lower confidence interval for between run cv is less than zero so reported as nan
you would pick mono and perhaps c# for cross platform development for the same reason that someone would pick java or python
it s currently limited to appending one line s worth of text if the clipboard contains more than one line it will default to a comma at the end of the selected lines
you can see this blog .post on how to integrate yui with wicket the same concepts can easily be extended to jquery
i can t post all the code because it has more than 1000 line
all the .net methods i tried were slower than vba and vb6 but the best ones were able to use the xll interface which gave better results than the automation interface
the width is greater than the height so our calculations are
i m not really familiar with stl or boost so i can only figure out how to do this the bruteforce way in c++ but i m guessing that the stl for_each
if it can be practically determinized this give you a dfa that can be exponentially larger than the nfa then by all means do that
the shelloid thing in question might be written in python or in c or tcl or... using the pty module of the standard library or higher-level abstraction based on it such as pexpect and the fact that the two programs to be connected via a pty-based pipeline are written in c++ and python is pretty irrelevant
it s almost certainly overkill but you can do this for c c++ php java c# and more with doxygen if you have graphviz dot installed
i m learning nhibernate to learn a more robust orm than linq-to-sql but i m struggling with some simple things
besides i tell you from experience that cocoa is much easier than carbon
i need some cms that can be integrated with asp.net-mvc
sorry for obvious question but can the dotnetnuke be used with asp.net-mvc
problem is pickle+unpickle can be faster in the c implementation because it s less general than deep-copy many object can be deepcopied but not pickled
if the native-code is just pure numeric code porting it is probably easier than testing it under an emulator
i am trying to create a popup which will be used to selected a month year for a textbox
and dont forget to increase server.scripttimeout because it could take more time than the default-value for all the mails
i m somewhat the opposite of luke101 as i ve worked mostly with spring mvc and very little with asp.net-mvc
with an abstract property they would be forced to implements it or face compile errors
note that this requires that you url encode the characters but i prefer that over url-encoding the + and characters from the standard base64 alphabet
this code should really be wrapped in an if statement that checks that the tree has more than one nodes
i know you said you prefer php and python but you also said you are willing to explore other solutions
programming in python is far more fun than c++
with inherit the background image would be copied to each element and displaced by margins padding etc has a more obvious effect with background images
a text-editor is more useful for this kind of stuff
at the moment i use quicksort but the funny thing is that this is almost no faster than bubble-sort
for a very small set insertion-sort can usually beat quicksort because it has very low overhead
i also want the user to be able to select one using radiobutton or more than one nodes using checkboxes from that tree component
if you have an attribute that needs to be modified any time it is set is there a slick way of doing this short of writing the accessor yourself and mucking around directly with the content of as done in this example
looking at the former year solutions they seem quite easy not more than 30 line of code
update to follow on from voyager s comment on web services you are building a communications layer which could be written in tcp-ip sockets low-level up to web services mostly xml over http
connections can be secured with ssl and you can leverage various authentication methods ntlm kerberos basic
read.table the number of data columns is determined by looking at the first five line of input or the whole file if it has less than five line or from the length of col.names if it is specified and is longer
using constructor injection and a modern framework the resolver will get called when object are constructed
usually it is needed to call methodss on a given instance without knowning about the object so-called methods binding like in boost bind these bound instance-methods can be used as callback for algorithms
be aware of the real-world impact of the so-called hidden constants too - for instance the classic quicksort algorithm is o n 2 in the worst case and o n log n on average whereas mergesort is o n log n in the worst case but quicksort will outperform mergesort in practice
i m not terribly picky about language but i would prefer something with c++ or python
don t forget that a union eliminates the duplicates so if you want duplicates to be included uyse union-all
any output generated from user-input should be encoded before output
another drawback of binary format like pb is that if there is a single bit of error the entire data file is not parsable but with json or xml as the last resort you can still manually fix the error because it is human readable and has redundancy built-in
they changed this a couple of releases ago for performance reasons - most people don t need full bash functionality for shell script and this limited shell is much faster at startup
what other toplevel ocaml programs can be recommended for windows-vista
i was having some trouble grokking the list comprehension syntax in python so i started thinking about how to achieve the same thing in perl which i m more familiar with
in this respect it is no more dangerous than java python or any other language
so the build-in authentication is more complex than i need
if so a margins makes more sense
the validation array is easily more than 30 line because i seperate each array entry with a newline
mysql is obviously cheaper and you can go far on mysql but there is no question that oracle which i m more familiar with than sql server has a better optimizer is more capable and is more robust than mysql
double-metaphone is an attempt to deal with much more complex variations than soundex or metaphone and was designed to handle irregularities in a range of languages
the file will be retrieved by http-request exactly the same as any other web page
the first one doesn t have to be implemented in the base-class but enforces it to be implemented in inherited classes
you have to implement the second one in the base-class and it can be implemented in inherited classes
the root cause of your issue is that your xml document has more than one root element per file
it can be set in environment in application configuration file it can be current user directory or anything else
icomparable is an interface that defines that two instances of the implementing class can be seen as greater than less than or equals to one another
there are two ways that objects in your code could be compared equals and gethashcode
i would recommend textmate as above and also macvim if possible
sometimes the simplicity of a good text-editor is better than an ide
the second group is split into the first part or the url assumed to contains any character other than then match any number of groups of followed by a non-digit followed by anything other than
2 if you do not want the list to be modified by any consumer the list of points can t change once you re done manipulating them then consider exposing an enumerator for the list instead of the list itself
the solution can be based on cobertura or emma or any other java code-coverage tool
the algorithm i was thinking of was basically splitting polygons with line where the line are a grid so you mostly get quads
i ve done very little work with ruby and have an app i ve written in php
i m not very familiar with php but one approach might be to write a shell script in ruby and call that from php
in theory i can wrap it with either perl or python whichever is easier to get this behavior but then i d need to shell out anyway to map the drives
you haven t specified the itemtemplate property of the treeview
your code is fine but your datatype attribute values need to be wrapped in curly-braces
some cookies have rules set like only accessible by http or only accessible by .images.google.com
the adaptor pattern is more about getting your existing code to work with a newer system or interface
depending on the context switch s can also sometimes be replaced by arrays or hashmap
for example if you scan something with a barcode gun the text gets typed much faster than any human could possible type but still slower than copy-paste
however if scriptb returns more than one line anotherscript runs for each of those lines
yes a session id can be stolen by sniffing the traffic so there is a security risk involved with using the session for identification
you should compare javafx with swing
sortedlist tkey tvalue uses less memory than sorteddictionary tkey
the point is that i cannot serialization the mailsender which is org.springframework.mail.mailsender btw and want it to be injected at deserialization time
i d check the column was greater than zero if so then i d use the fact that the column collection can be referenced by column name as well as integer to set the identity column to hidden
the parentheses on the other hand are important since the assignment-operator binds stronger than the comma-operator it has higher precedence and would get evaluated before the comma-operator without the parentheses
i ve had experience with web developers with these skill sets but not so many with wpf silverlight experience and looking on the internet for these people hasn t turned up much
you could always populate a disabled textbox to hold the name of the picture - it won t populate the browse input-field but is better than nothing
you could also have specific folders for different eclipse versioning so each developer wouldn t be forced to upgrade if something changed in the .settings or .project file between versioning
a timer is better than counting duplicate events because you can t assume that a given system will have the same repeat rate set as yours
i m getting into micro-controller hacking and while i m very comfortable with bitwise-operators and talking right to the hardware i m finding the resulting code very verbose and boilerplate
my older version with radio buttons only works fine as you could test here click
do all the files i pull into my page have to be called as http as well
or does only the master page itself need to be called as http
and i tend to think that after a moderate amount of customisation of either one vim will still start up faster than emacs
definitely not as elegant as python but nothing quite is as elegant as python in c++
cut and paste in vim takes more steps than in emacs iirc
i general procs are used for callback and hooks so that you don t have to write named methods and refer to them putting the code in question directly in the option hashes and such
hash tables do have an even larger advantage over sorted trees when the key comparison is expensive as with strings because for large sets fewer items will have a hash collision than a search tree is deep and because it s possible to cache the hash code for keys already in the set skipping the expensive comparison for probably all but the matching result
if you mean that you don t want the jar to be included in any bundles you can set the scope of the dependency to provided
there probably aren t as many jobs in python and ruby c++ is harder for a beginner but it s stuff you need to know eventually c# java hide you from that hard stuff to begin with but like i said you ll need to learn it eventually
the keywords themselves can be written in python java or just about any other language
even though i use emacs all day every day and love it unless you intend to spend a lot of time in the program you choose i would pick vim
also any intermediate values generated using the assignment operators have a post conditional that they compare equal with operators and operators is transitive for iterators
as far as i understand the scripts could be ported to jscript vbscript or plain batch which shouldn t be a problem
but if we imagine that this could not be done any differently and you are worried about performance you could always implement some sort of caching to reduce the number of database lookup and to store the entire contents of the order in cache as well
they are easily generated for udp simply by making the datagram bigger than the mtu
if you send a udp datagram larger than the mtu it will be fragmented
so far i found numerous things that i could easily have done in perl that are very hard cumbersome to do in c++ foreach loop as an example and anytime i hit one of these the answer 50 likely ends up being you can t do this in standard c++ but you can do it with boost
html tidy s libtidy doesn t seem to have python bindings bit it does have perl and c++ etc but ought to be easy to run as an exe in a pipe
now if user clicks delete then this whole data needs to be sent to controllers
i m personally familiar with jprofiler but i expect any worthwhile profiler would let you do this
on the assumption that you have fewer than 32 processor it s entirely possible that you may well not get much of an improvement - if the operations are fast you ll spend as much time creating os threads and switching between them as you do doing anything useful
anything better than cruisecontrol.net for .net ci
if more than four digits leading zero are prohibited and 0000 is prohibited
i personally recommend googletest and gmock
this is not possible with xml-serialization unless you implement ixmlserializable on your collection class and implement your own serialization
basically what i am doing is writing a program that will encrypt a request to be sent over tcp-ip and then decrypted by a server program
viewstate size is larger than the value in bytes placed in this attribute so the viewstate should be chunked in multiple input field but the page is generated with a single input field
joomla has a new from the time i ve used it oop framework that i haven t used - but it looks like it s as complex as drupal but doesn t
my understanding was it was written in vanilla python cpython but if you are more comfortable with ironpython it shouldn t be hard to translate
now getting back to erlang scala scala has actors and message passing as well and is based on the jvm so it might be a better alternative than erlang given your constraints
web2py may be young but the mailing list has 2000 messages month which is similar to django and far more than turbogears
windows embedded is generally easier to develop for - it s just desktop windows-xp with a few bits removable
oracle and sql server include such a tool but i m not familiar with mysql
is silverlight can be use in wpf windows application
some slight confusion about it what benefits of silverlight may be taken in wpf windows application
under patch settings select general information next select build settings and at the right hand side pane select the first tab named as common and in that checked the checkedbox option patch uninstallation allow patch to be uninstalled required windows installer 3.0
how can i set the secure flag on an asp.net session cookie so that it will only be transmitted over https and never over plain http
it also works even if the number of items in some category is fewer than four
a heartbeat is by nature a connectionless contrivance so it goes that udp connectionless is more relevant here than tcp connection-oriented
if i try to add more than 1 ssl binding i get the error at least one other site is using the same http binding and the binding is configured with a different certificate ...
note that you may have to override the following methods to draw correctly when the cell can be typed in selected for editing and the tooltip
how can this be done in asp.net-mvc
i prefer dom4j personally but i don t mind other apis such as jdom or even xpp3 which has xpath support
it s free very very easy to set up and use doesn t require a server because it can just access the local filesystem and you can find loads and loads of documentation and help if you get stuck because i think there are far more people who use svn than bazaar or git for example..
as others have said illegalargumentexception is an option but i think nullpointerexception is more communicative
this is a better oo approach leads to less coupling and will certainly perform better than runtime reflection
i guess the question is then why does the compiler choose int instead of double in the first example
and it seems working fine antialiasing is much better however this beats the idea of a transparent background in the process
for more details on that style of schema i recommend datamodel patterns by david hay
the import feature can be problematic for moving a wordpress blog as you have to configure your php.ini file often because the default-value of files you can upload on a hosted php implementation tends to be too small by default
running pear -v gives me versioning 1.7.2 when i run pear upgrade pear it says my versioning is newer than the current noe which is 1.9.0 if ran pear upgrade -f pear to force an upgrade it downloads the files and installs successfully but i still have versioning 1.7.2 and cannot install phpunit
even with i conversion as the hex 0x is a longer sequence than the decimal 0 .
quoting rapidxml s author i would like to thank arseny kapoulkine for his work on pugixml which was an inspiration for this project and 5 - 30 faster than pugixml the fastest xml parser i know of he had tested against version 0.3 of pugixml which has reached recently version 0.42
it may perform slower than raw ado.net calls but you will greatly minimize coding and you can use stored procedures in l2s and entity-framework and they both can work well under stress
on the client side the caller of the async callback contract wcf should do the right thing and behind the scenes your synchronous version will be called .when the data arrives on your end
as mjv surmised - awk or perl or python is a better choice
the binary serialization protocol is much stricter than any xml json or other text format meaning it is easier and faster to parse
if you have a tougher product or equate operator let s say taking a product of two terms means summing the strings and finding the sha-1 hash you may be stuck doing nested-loops which would be o n x where x is the number of terms variables
groovy just makes java easer with list manipulation apis closures xml parsing etc
the triggers could be made after insert instead and this would avoid the possibility of deleting some record unnecessarily if the new record was a duplicate
i can totally understand why someone not already familiar with emacs wouldn t want to use viper-mode but as someone coming from vim you really have the opportunity to get the best of both worlds
99 of java code can be expressed in scala
the only difference is that scala is more productive it produces more bytecode per line of code than java does
i have a co-worker that started grails withouth groovy knowledge and learnt his way into the language but he still wrote far less efficient and bloated grails code just by falling back to java since learning groovy is more than learning syntax
long time back in past i had read somewhere that if we want to enter data in image typed field of table whose value is more then 8kb then we must explicitly specify parameter type to sqlimage
in many text editors that are aimed at programmers if the user has a selection that spans more than 1 line and presses the tab key those lines are indented by 1 tab or a number of spaces depending on how the editor is configured
i would have thought that asp.net-mvc would have figured it out where if i pass in a parameter in the querystring it would go to the index string tag method and if i didn t pass in a parameter it would go to index
alternatively you could write an implementation to compare any two nodes and return whether or not they re the same - and then pass that into the call to the appropriate overload of the contains extension method defined in enumerable assuming you re using .net 3.5
or if you prefer line
zero crossing won t work because a typical sound has harmonics and zero-crossings much more than the base frequency
your ccc label field must be assigned a value before you try to modify the .text property
in such a case converting to the other class and then converting back would likely cause those properties to be lost reset to their default values
that this can validly be done and that it always works is probably due to the fact that the digits base 100 in this case aren t real digits and can legitimately assume values both greater than their base over 100 and even less than zero
adding soap headers is one of those things that got more convoluted with wcf compared to the previous add web service reference in visual studio .net 2003 2005 and creating a soap extension
the tooling provided with the jdk jstat jconsole jvisualvm is much more reliable
for example setting a delegate on a subview controllers is fine because the subview controllers has a shorter lifespan than the caller
i should have salted the md5 hash - because it s currently possible to decode unsalted md5 hash using rainbow tables
decode the passwords yourself and re-encode them with a salt i recommend something a little more fancy than md5
when i click on the file to be downloaded in firefox or google-chrome it works fine and saves the file on to disk
the images may have been scale cropped etc so a simple pixel comparison won t work
if its linux solaris and has more than 2gb memory and more than 2 processor
do you have texas event listener on all your sprite objects
although i currently use moq i used to use rhino-mocks before and it certainly has some features that i occasionally miss with moq - ordered expectations being one of them
if you properties are really properties that is they have the lifecycle of owner entity and can t belong to more than one entity at once consider splitting them into two tables one for images and one for collections and using one-to-many associations
i m required to write a function to overload the operator to compare width height and colour
is there a similar property with which we could specify whether horizontal scroll bars should be provided when the width of an element is greater than the width of a viewport ie display area
if you have only a few double dispatch or the visitor-pattern is probably more appropriate
update although frederik gheysels s answer is not completely correct decorating with serialization is pre-requisite for both onserializing ondeserializing attributes and iserialization interface he did however points out that onserializing ondeserializing attributes are meant to be supplement of iserialization so i am accepting his answer on this point
in this illusion the bottom line looks longer because the angled lines connecting it make it appear to be off in the distance
so i set the class to be configured for any data from the slingbox s ip address instead of a specific port
anything that s possible in a stateful application could also be implemented as stateless - you simply have to store the state on the client and submit all relevant state information on every request
i seem to have started a .war of words down below by not giving enough info
perhaps 128-bit distributed-system internet-wide pointers but no more than 64bit in a system call or perhaps even a legacy 32-bit limit
most likely malloc allocates more memory and puts so-called guard values that happen to contain null bytes or it puts some metadata to be used by free later and this metadata happens to contain a null byte right at that position
richfaces looks more good option to work than icefaces bcoz it has inbuilt support its easy to learn its long time support guarantee for seam+richfaces combination
i fire off a displaymodule event that should be received and hide an existing module and show a new one but my question is where is the place i should receive this event and display the module
the script can be included in any web page with any character set
i have committed three times now it is not allowing any more as it throw that error
there could be more than one elements contains directly withing a single e.g
transport can and should be encrypted using https - http is not any good
if you want every step of yours reserved you have to create another branch on your hacking branch before doing the git-rebase this can be done with git-branch small-dirty-changes-i-don t-want-anybody-to-see
this may be optimal indeed if the table access to retrieve the values missing in the index is more expensive than filtering and sorting
if you need spatial data capabilities postgis with postgresql is better than mysql
is it the generated files from the datamodel that matters more or is the actual xcdatamodel file
the basic principle is that expression evaluation is easier for a computer using a stack and reverse polish notation so the algorithm converts a in-fix notation expression with associated order of precedence and parentheses to rpn and then evaluates it by popping operands performing operations and pushing results until there are no operations left and one value left on the stack
http is faster overall by a significant amount 10
http is still faster
so on godaddy shared hosting at around 6 00pm on my specific server content served over https is faster than over http
i need to read data from a csv file display it as a data grid.the csv file contains name value pair column a will contain name column b will contain its value.also the user can add a blank row to the end of it insert data manually by clicking on an add button.the user can select any row delete the row completely by pressing on the delete button
once accepted the requests is transferred faster than http
timing tests show this runs 5-20x faster than the original script and the time is more predictable from one run to the next
i prefer cxxtest as i find it easier not to have to register my test cases explicitly as you have to do with cppunit
so something along these line is easier to follow
a listviewitem can t belong to more than one listview at the same time so this condition
i don t have thorough benchmarks but i m personally convinced that just like lighttpd can outperform apache on simpler tasks mod_wsgi gives apache the laurel when it comes to serving python web apps
is there something that i am missing when i conclude fckeditor is better by going through them because it is not as widely used
here s quite a good example of how you can get caught out from not declaring local variables with var
this must be a faq so i expect it to be closed as duplicates however i can not find a question that contains a good overview of the issues etc.
of course - your method across multiple line gives you more places to insert debugging code if need be i usually compress this sort of thing manually after i verify it works
unfortunately unless you re happy with supporting only specific browsers ie7 win safari firefox 3.5 there s no pure css solution to your problem
another blog here compares ruby and php
i don t think it is quite as functional as scala clojure but it s certainly a lot more functional than java
the common-lisp loop is much easier to read although very difficult to write but that s a different story
and you can write scala code with functional features almost as fast as java code
i wouldn t worry too much about the shell since operating as root isn t usual behavior for most administrators - so you can pick bash or ksh
i prefer sftp to ftp
https is a lower level protocol than http and will protect both sharepoint http and webdav traffic
you ll also want to grab jsonnetresult as it returns an actionresult that can be used in asp.net-mvc application
to my knowledge and i have been doing extensive work with wcf in the last month you can not share the same exact uri for more than one endpoint
i would have preferred an inner-join but i guess this will do for now
my functionality is proper because if i click on page after logout it will again redirect me at login page but my problem is i should not land on userpage using browser back after logout
the above code should have included the controllers as well as the action
while the delphi pascal syntax is more text oriented begin end or and so the underscores look a bit strange as you don t expect them there
about writing more maintainable software with webforms from my experience implementing a presentation pattern like mvp in webforms to respect srp increase maintainability enable unit testing etc is a lot more work than using asp.net-mvc out of the box and you get the same results
python is much easier to use than c++ for something like this
to answer klochner both seems quite popular but ruby is not a language that i am familiar with and django seems more heavy and complex to me than web2py
easier with perl python or powershell
i m going to argue perl is a better choice than awk here
with asp.net the best part is that i can do this with linq to xml in less than 100 line of code
iterate over every file in the client javascript folder that match dir command and for f are totally unneeded here though and only complicate things especially when file names contain spaces commas and the like
i would recommend going with python or perl if you swing that way
the contents of profileinfo are not updated i would have assumed field like .lpprofilepath should have good value and getuserprofiledirectory fails to find the path obviously - it doesn t exist - i also check manually and there is nothing under documents settings for the new account
i closed out that post saying that a 64bit computer can store and retrieve much more information than a 32-bit computer
64bit allows you to use more memory than a 32-bit app
while neither the declarative nor imperative approach is really better than the other both have their merits
in java s regular expression i want to match any sentence that contains the word mary and the word are in that order but does not contain bob in between mary and are
it is composed of various modules which can be used with testng or junit .
of course revision and pages needs to be stored in svn
because 1.0 has type double and compiler really doesn t know what type to choose between int and float so it asks you to give it a hint
because this is such a specific corner case which has to be supported for primitive types such as int - bool and reference type conversions otherwise you d get a very pedantic language this is handled but not as a case of method overloading
and as well i would think they would be included in cldc 1.1 midp 2.0 so if you find them there we can conclude that their footprint is negligible plus probably implemented in an optimized built-in thus being of virtually no cost to use them
that will match any two letter sequence in parenthesis that my contains more two letter sequences separeted by hypens
based on the code you ve shared it looks like your touchesmoved method will only be called for gestures within the tile
when a gestures is faster however the x y touchesmoved events will be farther apart and you ll lose the gestures when one x y point is far enough away from the last one that it is outside of the tile already
java is less dynamic than python and more effort has been put into its vm making it a faster language
in reply to comment how can java be faster than python
python is one of the faster ones after java
so the speeds range from python being 2x slower than java to 174x slower python generally beats java in code size and memory usage though
but if it s really a simulation and what you want are the analysis results implements an actual distributed model would be a horribly complex approach that is likely to yield far less data than an abstract simulation would that is the simulation itself doesn t have to be a network of asynchronous actors communicating
all this is just the same set of issues that you must deal with for stdin - the only possible difference being that stdin coming from a terminal will give you short reads for each line of input whereas each read from a pipe will give you a short read for the size of the pipe buffer or the atomicity writes smaller than the buffer size and a plain disk file will only usually give you a short read on the last block of a file
however i don t find windows development on mono so much better than linux and or osx
i have a client that i m doing this with who has an asp not asp.net based shopping-cart
i have tried using certain libraries like pdfsharp itextsharp even acrobat reader ocx control
i know that i can match lines containing a specific pattern using grep or other tools but once i have such lines how can i extract a portion of the line
i don t know why you think ado.net is more consistent than entity-framework
in the long run that will be the cheapest because paying someone to learn a new set of tools will be much more expensive than any other costs that might be associated wit ha particular set of software
at least these common applications must be supported safari firefox no applescript
the more general issue is methods in an opaque superclass that rely on the behaviour of other methods that could be changed by subclassing and what to do in the case that you want to subclass an object to change behaviour like this
the numbers do not have to be used in sequence
you have several options read the manpage for ksh and configure it or install another shell you re more familiar with like bash
however i still think there s scope for a complete replacement for built-in serialization without having to write and maintain any custom code - this can t be done at runtime because reflection is needed to query objects and access private data
mstest comparisons and the developer community seems to pretty much overwhelmingly choose nunit
at the end of the markup select and focus are called to select any text in the field and to set focus so all the user has to do is scan the value
basically make every visible object that can be skinned subclassing a movieclip
just be careful of the settings you use and how you set up your data because it is very easy to lose any benefits of parallelization by the intermediate loads and saves the package makes
the widget layout is set to grid the qgraphicsview size policy is set to fixed on the 2 axes and it the qgraphicsview is center in the empty zone of the qdialog
the query only needs to be parsed or prepare once but can be execute multiple times with the same or different parameters
and it seems to me that a simple no matching operator could be clearer than 50 line of gibberish concluding in obscure wording that function requires less-than-comparable concept
you should be able to find plenty of papers on this problem and a dynamic programming solution would take no more than 20 line of code
do you recommend using getter and setter or accessing the member variables directly
items to be classified line from the requirement document are made of a relatively small number of attributes values for effectively a single dimension keyword
is there something similar in jquery where you can add javascript objects to jquery selected dom objects without using ad hoc html text
in the case of xml-serialization it gets more interesting
the percentage of people using perl who do quick and dirty hacks with bad style and worse code quality is probably higher than say python
then set the image to be fixed in height and auto for width
the countif function probably compares cell as numbers
does anyone know how to force vba countif function to compare cell as strings or other way to check for duplicates in vba
luckily the asp.net-mvc framework gives us more integration points specifically the modelbinder
i m logging every request parameters and how long did it take so single log isn t very large not bigger than 4 line but since there are pretty high number of requests it grows instanely fast
if you are already familiar with vbscript or jscript note that you do not use the scripting language s function for creating a new object instance createobject in vbscript or new in jscript
i haven t read it fully but i prefer s#arp-architecture idea of saveorupdate mapped from nhibernate for entities it s more convenient thant add remove
why would mainform need to be marked as serialization
if the http-request is slower than the time i would need to download the extra non cached parts on every page then i would put everything in 1 big file on every page 1 different big file on every page
fit within a technology stack sql win .net asp.net vs
what you ll need to do than is to complete the javadoc comments for the classes and methods that are more sophisticated than getter setter or default constructors
for some operations you may see that it is 1000 times slower than c++ so yes you should investigate into this and do necessary benchmarks before you make time-critical algorithms in python
i d prefer python don t know java or php use macosx and firefox
edit actually you resize the one that is the biggest if width is bigger you resize that and if height is bigger then you resize that
the problem is that the end user can t set a blank value for the field - they can only select value from the lookup table
i am a perl newbie but i like it better than php
it may be related to generics only being implemented for reference-type
and just for good measure i have read should functional-programming be taught before imperative-programming
as a note for all readers informed or otherwise i just bought an 800 page 2008 copyright book on the subject from a major - in the preface the author does a hey wait a minute .. in which it is noted in detail that more than one security professional with heavy credentials and field experience had been ahem rendered moot .
jquery doesn t really give you much help here since selectors can only select elements and the contains selector is recursive so not too useful to us
note that this will not now match line with a single vowel if you need that too then we need to get a bit cleverer and use some or s
this matches line that consist only of one or more capital vowels does not match blank line
but there is a nant task called xmlpoke that can be used to set values in any xml file at build time
calling responsepanel.removeall will remove the components but the components may still be registered as listener on the responsepanel or other objects causing them to be retained in memory
will this service only ever be called by .net wcf clients
regarding interop w java scala is closer to java but i m sure both languages interoperate well
scala is more likely to be the next java while it s hard to imagine that lisp will finally take off after not doing so for over 50 years
i am not sure what the eclipse export utility does but you might try looking at ant as it may give you more control over the build-process
xml which can be done simply with xmlserializer or datacontractserializer but that offers much less control over the xml or json json.net etc
if you want the area to have height and width but still flow inline you can use display inline-block
if you really need to improve password security i would recommend using http and hashing it at server side
does that type have to be marketed serialization
also coming from the php world i think it s easier to get started with asp.net-mvc because there s less magic going on under the hood in that flavour
note that the sieve-of-eratosthenes has much better run time-complexity than trial division should run much faster for bigger num values when properly implemented
some kind of http communication is more likely to work out and if you have structured or complex data to send over xml would make sense as a messages format
much longer than 32-bit or 64bit can hold
additionally the post-increment expression i++ would be evaluated first because it has a higher precedence than the pre-increment ++i operator
the non-parallel version speeds up a tiny bit because i m running in 64bit mode and it likes 64bit registers slightly better than 32-bit registers
beyond the api level behavioral changes should also be taken into account
adjusting the time intervals in which watch runs cmd can be adjusted using command-line parameters
how can i allow a user to enter a string into a winforms application and then use reflection to parse that string which can be executed at runtime
note that i select cells by dragging cursor from top-left-most cell with value 1 to the bottom-right-most cell with value 4
have mytestableclass extend myclass and then provide public methods in mytestableclass that expose the protected methods of myclass that you need
theoretically udp should be be 30-50 faster than tcp because it s missing the extra trip for the ack and has a smaller header overhead however in reality there are many cases where tcp would outperform udp just because of congestion control
i would use django because of its large user base and existing modules including the built-in admin interface but i would imaging that cherrypy is more flexible than django
long answer it won t because it can t know if a bit-shift is faster than a multiplication on the platform the code eventually will be running
in my experience the only thing that nhibernate requires of a domain is virtual properties and methods and a default no-argument constructor which as jeff mentioned can be marked private or protected if need be
my controllers action is even simpler
takes a list of values that will be mapped as key-value key-value .
the full source for python-crontab is less than 500 line anyway and is very readable
in other words if you use a pointer to the base-class to iterate over an array of the derived-class you ll get wrong results if the derived-class has a bigger size than the base-class because it will iterate in steps of sizeof baseclass bytes
this is sometimes easier than yacc bison and usually more intuitive
since ref is more general why do you ever want to use out
out is more constraint version of ref
on the other hand if you like applications that are highly performant and cleanly architected need precise control over your markup and would like your application to be testable then asp.net-mvc is a better choice
data-wise a jquery-dialog recommended is nothing more than another div tag in your form
the transport security can be enabled using ssl if you are using http for your services
xml is arguably more flexible than json to represent your data
instead you should use an external dependency management system such as maven or ivy ivy works if you use ant but maven is both a build tool and a dependency management system so i would recommend maven if you can
more providers will allow you to run php and you can generally find php hosters a bit more cheaper than python hosters
generally it s easier to code with python in many regards but this is something that can be overcome simply by using more time with php
if an exception occurs between line 05 and 16 the transaction will never be marked with commit and thus rollback as soon as the transaction and connetion is finalized at line 18
my only advice do not create memory leaks by connecting dom javascript objects circular references that won t be cleared by dom and js gcs
i have a project in which i use more than one adaptor
zend-amf and amfphp both by the same guy zend-amf is newer but a little more complex to set up are both great
the clients prefer php but shell scripts perl python and plpgsql are all used on the system in one form or another
generally i prefer constructor which guarantee the object is in a good state or if that cannot be done perhaps because some of the arguments to the constructor were invalid throw an exception so there is never an instances of your class which is in a bad state
the model-view-viewmodel is very popular with wpf and silverlight
functional programming not to be confused with procedural-programming has less problems with this matter mostly because the primary building blocks are much smaller
if you re using a flowlayoutpanel you could check whether the bottom property of the last control in the panel is more than the panel s height
and for the category which is the more difficult part there are some categories that have no subcategories and thus some book records have subcategory_id set to 0 because its category_id refers to an category that has no subcategories in this case the subcategory name column in the book list does not need to show anything
i suspect in most cases it would be perfectly acceptable not significantly worse than any other of the multitude of inefficiencies these systems contains
for ajax calls you can use a variety of libraries i personally recommend jquery and dojo
spell checker something better than a hashmap if possible with correct spelling recommendations
just because multiplication has a higher precedence than addition doesn t mean we need to perform all multiplication in the expression before doing any addition
note that this returns a relative difference meaning that if rvalue is greater than lvalue then the return-value will be negative
i need this for a custom form builder that will not add input fields by default that cannot be mass assign
one possible difference is that chars might be aligned on 64bit rather than 32-bit boundaries
i think stateful client stateless server makes you more aware of the amount of data that is transported back and forth between tires
anyhow gwt and many other modern toolkits silverlight talking to wcf seems to prefer stateful client stateless server due to scaleability issues
those that will be used for inner-join and those that will be used for left join
why is quicksort better than mergesort
which ones do you guys recommend using with asp.net-mvc
installing a real database server is fairly easy so i d recommend sql server express as others have or even mysql or postgresql whatever is easier to set up
web server is probably going to be easier than a packets analyser if you re starting from scratch
i don t think you should ever need more than 1500 line ever
the code will also record the edge cases so if the the function produces a value greater than the max or less than the min you.will.know.about.it
sometimes the datamodel makes more sense with multiple keys
itertools does much more than just combinations and permutation so while it would surely be nice to have all of itertools when coding java
i can recommend using ssh rather than telnet for security reasons
i would definitly go for an orm at least if you are working on a big project for which you don t want to use or pdo functions methods directly -- doctrine being the most developped used nowadays it s the default orm of the symfony framework and can be integrated in zend-framework quite easily
in my iphone application uitable having so many cells with text.the text size is more than the width of the device.so how can i wrap the text in cell and display the text in the different lines or devide it in the lines
json is typically lighter weight than xml but there are some data structures that don t lend themselves to json serialization
if you re using a restful interface you can but not recommended alternate between json and xml depending upon the service call
you ll really have to write your own analyzer i should think since whether or not some sequence of words is a phrase is dependent on cues such as punctuation that are not available after tokenize
using the xlsx open xml file format will be safer than using xls or xlsm since xlsx workbooks cannot contain macros
also the reason for making the boolean volatile as opposed to the object is that access of a volatile variables is more expensive due to the memory model constraints - thus the boolean allows you to enforce the memory model then the object access can be done much faster within the thread
in first pass of j loops arrays 1 2 will be compared with arrays0 then 2 will be written to arrays newlength arrays 1
thus yes in general your alternative copy-constructor is better but if you only have integral types as members it doesn t really matter
this command will match line with 123451234 but not 111111111
is unpack faster than substring
it doesn t loop through any strings the expectation that is set up will simply match any string that it is given when sendemail is called returning a true result
granted it s not as portable as c++ or python but it would leverage your c# .net experience more readily
you have to change your code for different platforms win unix etc... eg socket programming differs on windows and linux
when there is no special reason for backward compatibility i prefer forward-compatibility
rhino-mocks has been the top dog for a while now but moq has an easier learning curve from online docs although it may not always handle edge scenarios.
you may also want to look at aquamacs which currently has a beta for the latest emacs and offers somewhat better os x integration than the default build
so boolean query has 1300 clauses which is higher than the default-value of 1024
there may be tasks that need to be run from listener on shutdown defined in web.xml
and vbscript only expects the argument list be enclosed in parentheses if the call keyword is used
but i think it is correct to put many classes in the same header if classes are less than 10 line long
note the call keyword invokes the procedure as if it were part of an expression hence the argument list must be contained in parentheses
if the current value of the property as returned by the getter is same as the value to be set the setter is not called
i m not sure 10 line with incomprehensible regular expressions is any better than 30 line of nice looking code
0x800702e4 suggests that the process must be run with elevated-privileges
nhibernate is quite mature and seems be to lighter compared to entity-framework
another great thing about asp.net mvc is the strength of the entire tool chain -- from visual studio visual studio add-ins like resharper to windows 2008 iis 7 and microsoft s deployment tools to code samples like the enterprise library there is just a huge amount of great tools and help to be found for .net webapps
gwt from google is based on the swing model while rap from eclipse is based on eclipse s rcp model which is much richer than swing
an uninitialized local pointer variable or field will have undefined value just like uninitialized int or in general pod-type local variable or field would
if you don t mind poking around in memcheck this functionality should be abled to be added in memcheck mc_leakcheck.c in the valgrind source
the data is sensitive so should be sent via http
by letting the where-clause be computed in sql instead of on the client this can be an order of magnitude more efficient if a low of the items were changed recently as is often the case
i would choose xml-serialization at least while you are developing since it will help you when debugging you can take a look at the serialized files at any time
these are of course very simple examples but might there be something that is as scalable as let or let in lisp
the compiler can t however know whether the instance variable is initialised before you hit that method call because it could be set by any other method which may be called in any order by external code
viewstack listens for navigation button clicks and passes it to current slide and changes slides only if current slide has no more steps
now when i run the form it works but i want the path where the user selected from the browse button so the path should be displayed in button when clicking button
any recommendations for a simple yet powerful text-editor that has syntax support for asp.net and a nice ftp client built in
to remember bob you generally make a function as in nickyt s answer to keep a copy of bob in a closure so it can be remembered at callback time and used to call the real methods
if you are interested in good seo and a faster website asp.net-mvc is much cleaner html and faster than webforms
otoh the foreign key suggests frequent querying by campaign in which case having the clustering done by that column could make sense and would also probably do a better job of scattering the inserted keys in the indexes - both the surrogate key and the timestamp would add records in sequential order which is net more work over time for insertions because the node sectors are filled less randomly
postgresql license bsd is undoubtedly more simple than mysql s
i ve seen it argued that all error-handling should be done via exception-handling most recently in clean code by robert martin but i don t agree
remember - rest is nothing more than a set of architectural constraints for distributed computing independent of any underlying transport protocol
now when you go to retrieve the column aliased by truncated_title in this example it will only contains at most however many characters as set in your maxchars constant
i don t recommend codeigniter as great and powerful framework but it s simple for beginners and they can learn a lot from it personally i m in favor of symfony and yii
i am not familiar with inno-setup but this is how we do our installshield installer for an upgrade
- the holder trick non-idiom is a design smell which suggests looking for a different and more pythonic approach -- the one case where holder is justified is exactly the special case for which i designed it the case where you want to keep close correspondence between the python code and some non-python you re transliterating a reference algorithm in python and want it working first before refactoring it into a more pythonic form or you re writing python as a prototype that will be transliterated into c++ c# java etc once it s working effectively
more importantly can you take advantage of a parallel or shared build environment - from memory clearcase and perforce had mechanisms to handle shared building
they are still running iis6 and asp.net-mvc is better less problematic under iis7
in your case i would choose margins
by decoupling simulation from rendering you can render at a higher frequency than your simulation does for sampling
the delete_all methods is simpler but not advised because it means that none of your other callback will happen on the user record
is there any way of setting an estimated content length so the progress-bar works more or less
most comparative operations in python are faster than in php in my subjective experience
expected exception-handling message assertion - can be done using attribute in nunit but must be done using try-catch in ms-test
if you sign the .war it will be treated as jar so all the rules will apply
themes are similar to cascading style sheets in that both themes and style sheets define a set of common attributes that can be applied to any page
such a copy-constructor cannot be invoked with temporary object as an argument since a non-const reference cannot be bound to a temporary object
also if the bl says that the user must be disabled by default and explicitly enabled should i prefer an enable variation considering that the default-value for system.boolean is false
you can set the custom action to run based on any condition including a checkbox in a dialog
we have a set of asmx but could be wcf 64bit web services which need to execute some 32-bit managed code the apis have 32-bit com dependencies and cannot be executed in 64bit for processing on the same physical machine
i receive the following error sequence contains more than one elements when trying to populate my promotion table object
the tuplefraction parameter says this for some of the rules if edmgen++ thinks that it has found a subclassing but the new subclassing has less than tuplefraction of the instances from its parent class consider the new subclassing insignificant and don t create it
the rest of the html isn t loaded in the dom so the #inner a element cannot be found by javascript
depending on your background the learning curve may be steeper than using java or python but the pay-off is that you get access to a very powerful toolkit
there are frameworks for .net that can make this much easier such as masstransit or nservicebus
credentials cannot be used for ntlm authentication
further should the nature quantity security level of data change in future you will be better off with a json xml response than allowing total access
quicksort is a partitioning sorting algorithm you might refer to mergesort which also is a partitioning sorting algorithm the biggest difference is probably the speed quicksort is faster even though both of them are o n log n
click on common tab and check shared file radio-button and check in the launcher configuration with your project
in my current project i have 58 objects mapped in 58 xml mapping files each with less than 50 line
i have a image button in a page which can be triggered on mouse click by default it gets triggered on enter press also which i want to disable
from less than 50k line of source i get shared objects that are almost 4 mb and static archives pushing 9
your application runs fine the first few minutes then when some error occurs the above class can t be loaded which throw the exception as posted
if you decide your new material must have version 1.x numbers you ve hosed yourself - you have to choose between backwards-compatibility and forward motion
lxml -- 100x better than elementtree
is it true that better concurrency can be achieved in oracle databases than in ms sql-server databases
my favorite granularity rule of thumb for a function is no more than 24 line of 80 characters each -- and that s not just because 80 x 24 terminals were all the rage back when i started
you can have it as attributes instead or skip it altogether if column name matches properties name
that path will be passed the value of the field in a _get
some jar files which are dependencies for the project and have been declared in pom.xml need be included in .war under web-inf
if you do this when compiling in 64bit mode your returned pointer will be truncated to 32-bit
all in all i would highly recommend jquery over dojo in any project
ie8 is considerably better than ie7 however moving around with the cursor keys is a bit unnatural and nothing like as smooth as google-chrome or firefox
if you want to exclude numbers like 123a street addresses for example or 123.123 numbers with more than 2 digits after the decimal-point try
the blocks are usually more than 3 line in length and all start with probably ctrl+k c was used to comment these out
if the minimum value of the vector found using the min function is less than zero then this value is subtracted from every element of the vector
how could we compare line in two files using a shell script
there are no particular pitfalls with using bigint except that they are significantly slower than primitive int types .
i want to compare line one file with the other.diff will give me all the differences in two files at a time.i want a line in the first file to be compared with all the lines in the second file and get the common lines as the output
in other words match unique characters do not match characters that are repeated
randy fixed this up in the comments to work on more than 100000 line
this can be applied to json files csv files and fixed-format files
as 64 bits support is not expected in the next versioning it is no longer an option to wait for the possibility to migrate our existing code base to unicode and 64-bit in one go
i m not sure what makes you think that assigning the result of the expression to a variable first would be more efficient than evaluation the expression itself but it s never going to matter so choose the option that enhances the readability of your code
also since you re working with small medium businesses they will be more wowed with flex uis over jquery extjs whatever uis
longer answer 64bit x86 has more general purpose registers which gives the compiler more of an opportunity to optimize local variables into registers for faster access
wikipedia states that denormalization has a better performance but i think i am just getting cocky and thinking i can handle a big denormalization database
if a function-call allocates more than 4096 bytes of local-variables it is possible that the first stack access from it will actually stretch beyond the guard page
a 64bit version might be slightly slower or slightly faster than the 32-bit version
your example means the match needs to be followed by zero or more characters and then a digits but again that part isn t captured
your best bet may be to export backup your mysql data in a simple text form which can be massaged into postgresql format and imported
why is it that the line height of the last line of text in any quote with 3 or more lines is greater than the line height of the above lines
normally your dependencies will be injected via constructor injection and when testing you can instead supply mock object as those constructor dependencies
essentially we are concatenation the serials that match with comma to a variable within a user defined function and then retuning the result
will only match line that have string project after the equal sign
python has much better integration with c++ via things like boost.python sip and py++ than ruby where the options seem to be either write directly against the ruby interpreter api which you can do with python as well of course but in both cases doing so is low level tedious and error prone or use swig which while it works and definitely is great if you want to support many languages isn t nearly as nice as boost.python or sip if you are specifically looking to bind c++
i can easily imagine arguments that the python situation is better and that the ruby situation is better
then wrap the selection that would have been highlight in a span that has some css applied to it mimicking the highlight
i prefer mongodb because i don t know java and found couchdb easier to get up and running
for example many hr apps seem be to .net based while financial banking apps seem to favor java
a also allows me to write custom functions embedded in .net assemblies that can be loaded at runtime to extend the capabilities of interpreter b
your devtags entity will be linked as one-to-many to this one
php is more similar in syntax to c++ than python but python is easier to learn and more modern
if you don t want your website to be taken over upgrade to drupal 5 or better 6 and use the maintained and secure openid modules of these versioning
i believe that typedef remains a pure c keyword and really only happens to work with objective-c types usually because they happen to be implemented as struct
edit technically bubble-sort is closer to your requirements just if and swaps than insertion-sort so it may be what your instructor had in mind
but the downside of ruby-on-rails compare to django is mainly there are too much magic less explicit and the docs is not as good as django
i m trying to setup my xcode project to be instrumented with gcov so i can determine the code-coverage of my unit tests
while boost is more modern c++ it also harder to use for non trivial tasks - and without a modern c++ experience and deep stl knowledge it is difficult to use correctly
http put isn t inherently any more secure than http-post if you re allowing the uploaded files to be exceuted on your server
but not more than 10 line in total
but in that case you d have to have some way to know which elements of the vector should be treated as int and which ones should be treated as double
since int can be converted to double without loss of precision.
the problem is that using properties file will only works better than xml or json ... on the most trivial classes
the assembly case should be done with inline-assembly in the same c program as you use for the pure c test
i ve created a regular expression that matches any numeric value with leading or trailing spaces that contains ascii or arabic characters
i am currently using jquery-cycle and the techniques being used in version 1.3.2 do not work when telling it to slider it seems to work only in 1.3.1 there is also a issue of the size slider 3 is much longer than slider 1 and the height it generates is too tall with dead space
now i mostly tend to prefer msbuild over nant because it s simpler
i don t think this is likely to be the right solution to your problem because there are more than one-to-many to one relationships to your parent entity table
it should be written in controllers class
at my company we have found memory mapped files to be much faster than loopback tcp-ip for communication on the same box so i m assuming it would be faster than udp too
at this time i have attempted to use the mergeoption.notracking and the mergeoption.overwritechanges but they both seem to be ignored and any changes in the entity set that should not be modified being persisted to the store
the nodeport class is an attributes that may be set on properties to provide details such as the human-readable name and data-flow direction for the properties
even though this is supported by c# via ienumerator ienumerable there is a better idiom foreach
i need to bind this class with jibx so result of the method would be marshalling to xml element attribute and would be omitted when unmarshalling
if it receives it as udp is not as reliable as tcp of course
scala runs on the java virtual machine so it can be used in java shops
i would have suggested mastering lisp in some relevant dialect so even if you have lisp and scheme on your resume it might be worthwhile to really learn deeply
on the other hand you may very well have legitimate reasons to have a bunch of properties that are no more than getter and setter
linq-to-sql is more or less only available for mssql and many find it to be a simple and natural technology to work with
yes sha1 is a better hash than md5
locks are not slower than atomicity operations because they are doing something different they are slower because they are doing more of the same thing from a coherency standpoint
formally in the current c language you can initialize only integer types with calloc and memset ... 0 ...
if you want to produce very nice-looking documents with tex latex but without learning much about either i suggest you look into lyx a nice graphical editor that allows you to create documents more or less like you do in a word processor but with much nicer results and access to the full power of latex albeit sometimes by embedding latex commands in your lyx document
if the connection cannot be made using tcp-ip the other enabled protocols are attempted
it seems evident that there s ajaxswing that a lot of swing could be ported to gwt just perhaps not the java2d stuff
one way of doing this is could be modify hosts-file in windows as -
unpack is better than substring
which grabs cell from an
i prefer python though java would be acceptable
substring is generally faster or as
the same technique could be implemented in delphi or c++ easily enough
this is the same as the constructor issue is it better to raise an exception during the construction or initialize a void object and then call an init method.
any other good to know for feed is more than welcome
note you haven t given any information about the environment or useres that might run this so there s also the possibility that users may set ld_library_path to something they need
python is a fine language and won t perform worse than php
the overlapping div has a higher z-index
the prototype object is meant to be used on constructor functions basically functions that will be called using the new operator to create new object instances
every function in javascript has a prototype object because there is no way to know which functions are intended to be used as constructor
assuming i understood your question in that you have multiple accounts each with their own set of tags that could be applied to any model in your application that calls acts_as_taggable
i prefer ant over maven personally
generally speaking the entire request will be sent including postdata
you should get comfortable doing it both ways and i d recommend using margins in this case and as your first approach in general
no there s still a chance your page can be found by search-engine web-crawler
that s not to say that you couldn t match scala s performance at doing the same thing - just that it may become an ugly workaround in one language to match the natural idioms in another note i m not saying i believe scala is actually faster than java at anything specifically - i have no data on that - other than that scala is designed with scalability in mind - hence the name
ejb containers require ejb modules to be packaged as jar files - these have a ejb-jar.xml file in the meta-inf folder
web applications in these containers are to be deployed as .war files only
unfortunately i don t know how well vs deals with git or git and perforce simultaneously
runtime output testfile.txt is just a large text file with more than 10 line
the csv format specified by wiki states that single-quotes should be handled with double-quotes escaped_list_separator will strip away all quote characters
i want to build a shared library using waf as it looks much easier and less cluttered than gnu autotools
and any modifications that you need to do will be in python which is less effort than java however you still have the object-oriented capabilities that you are familiar with from java
part of the problem is that he wrote it for vba vb 6.0 and so all that code would have to be translated to vb.net or c#
i can t use anything more than basic addition and subtraction and string parsing functions
i also make sure i obtain the offending elements so i can say something clever to the user such as user x cannot be saved because email y is duplicates rather than user x cannot be saved duplicates entry
can be used to lookup any string prefix
i d be inclined to avoid ioke on account of it s immaturity and for the purpose of a dsl i think a dynamically typed language like groovy or javascript is a better choice than scala
but not more than 15-20 line
your best chance would probably be having your own embed iframe element and have it be a sibling of the embed element and give it a higher stacking order with a positioning and index you could also try making it a direct child of the body element so it has a higher z-index than the embed element s parent element
these utilities may be used by more than one controllers
if you intend to allow that username to be used to login through http basic authentication you must disallow the character because the basic auth scheme encodes a username password pair with no escaping if there s a colon in the username or password
app-id with wild card cannot be enabled for in-app purchases
edit the contents of the app-config and settings.settings seem to make a difference though changing for example the web reference url in the dll project s app-config file on its own makes no difference but if you edit the url in the app-config and then open the settings.settings file the changes you made in app-config then get copied into settings.settings
it is our pratice to usualy make a new branche in the repository for new developpments and then merge them in the trunk to be tagged .when ready to be deployed in production
i m developing a windows mobile winform application that uses sql server ce 3.1 with .net compact-framework 2.0 sp2 and c#
an ajax request is nothing more than another http-request
with the first catch block you know that single threw an invalidoperationexception because the sequence contains more than one elements or is empty
in that regard a view model is very doable with asp.net-mvc and i m sure it could be leveraged in webforms as well
aspectj provides a great deal more flexibility as the join points can be decidedly more complex in order to do what you want
insertion-sort is better than quicksort on short lists
that is outside of the 2 byte difference in storage per field when you compare value that are of two different types sql will be forced to convert one of them
the rehash means your array of m slots should be resized to contains more elements a prime number greater than the current size or 2x greater is ideal and that your elements must be distributed in the new larger array
setting up your functions in frame 1 and then hiding showing or enabling disabling is better than adding listener in different frames
it would have been super correct if adding a final qualifier to class test would have allowed access to field s but it does not
one example of haskell in action is xmonad a featureful window manager in less than 1200 line of code
union-all is faster because it doesn t - and in that case you would need the group by.
the sql engine should give an error because of that though some such as mysql just pick a random-ish value out of the several i believe sql-server is better than that
this will also allow you to choose value of the field for your current records.
what you re problem really sounds like is you are trying to send data as you can however you re tcp-ip connection is slower so this is causing the space needed in ram to build up
have a look at logger.isdebugenabled in nlog versus log4net from our tests nlog has less overhead and that s what we are after low-latency stuff
decompiling native-code c++ is much more difficult
is it too bad to write a really long more than 200 line test method
objects in the charts can be connected with line and arrows in a variety of styles
this can be used to filtering on the resulting properties of groupings after grouping ing - for instance
assuming you d like the specialized version to be picked for any integral type and not just int in particular one thing you could do is provide that as a template function and use boost.enableif to remove those overloads from the available overload set if the operand is not an integral type
both domains need to be served http - is it technically possible to handle serving different certs for the same app using connectors or other method
generics type interference cannot be applied to primitive-types
but did you try structured exception-handling handling - __try __catch not try-catch
as most other answers have pointed out if you want to pass in an initialized object ref is the stronger choice
to put for the obvious and broad point compiled languages tend to have higher performance than interpreter ones since compiling precludes the need for a runtime interpreter
i don t know if this is also applicable under ruby but for the python sax module one must throw an exception to get out of the parse phase.
let s compare i have worked often with n hibernate icriteria queries which can be considered a fluent mapping to sql
my team leader doesn t want all of the code to be programmed in linux - unix
if your form points to http it should only be served via http
in each case the code sample is no more than ten line of clearly-formatted code that utilises basic c# skills inheritance generics anonymous delegates
if you feel like using a tool to handle your builds then there are lots about such as cruisecontrol.net which is ant based and has pretty deep integration with your source code control
any time i encounter a gridview with lots of columns i refactor the ui so that the grid displays fewer more important or identifying columns and then when the user clicks a row i display the rest of the row data is a separate details display below the grid
while this is no problem for me to do when the search is case-sensitive it s more problematic to do it case-insensitive
otherwise if you don t do anything you ll be able to selected more than one radio-button simultaneously
if this is standard 32 64-bit universal then universal binaries with 32-bit and 64bit versions will be built
this is faster than calculating sin and cos on each iteration
i wrote my own loader using some opensource gif library and without any optimization entire decoding loading of the gif frames takes less than 100ms
i m not sure if this is your problem but browsing working with and copying files from mapped where you have assigned a drive letter to a network-drive is much quicker than using the unc intranet notation
when you define a method with same name in in derived-class the base-class methods with same name will be hidden in derived-class
i am quite new with linq-to-sql and mvc but i follow the nerddinner on asp.net site
i don t know about emacs but i would recommend learning vim for a beginner in a heartbeat
the ... can be split over line for example and your current version wouldn t handle this
future of mysql is also not very clear as it was bought by sun which was bought by oracle which has monopoly issues to resolve
i haven t myself used iis for ages but according to the book deploying rails applications using fastcgi could be a bit tricky and recommends using isapi-rewrite instead
perhaps you can convert this app to a php based mvc framework like cakephp but again you d need an experienced php developer to do this and in this case i think this would be a difficult task if they aren t also fairly familiar with ruby on rails
because the latest version of foo might have been upgrade 2 or 3 versioning ago and it wasn t changed since i need to look at the upgrade script for that version
one can implement a version of quicksort for a single-linked list but normally this is only interesting as a puzzle since mergesort is much easier to implement and works equally well or better for sorting linked lists
it could also be done with iteration but iteration seems unnatural as well since there is only a single elements
json definitely beats xml for performance reasons
my application will be deployed on windows-server with sun jdk installed by default in order to connect to the websphere queues i have two choices
i am currently only familiar with php and python and would thus enjoy a library which i can access from said languages
fltk the fast light toolkit is a cross-platform graphical user interface gui written in c++ library and can be use on unix linux microsoft windows
i would strongly recommend learning python ruby or perl
regarding front end stuff i recommend aptana studio here aptana has recently acquired pydev by the way
overall i also belive that script based upgrade using metadata versioning is supperior to diff based upgrade because of reasons of testing and source control i had already talked about in the link to q1525591
if you treat your server as a dumb persistence layer with the exception of validation authentication authorization life is easier
stick to html5 which has much better compatibility with legacy uas
i skipped soappy because it seemed to have been abandoned and more complex to install compared to suds
i m leaning towards option 3 but with a perl or python angle assuming they would be faster than php
i was wondering if i could create a routing map with one more higher level than the controllers
can android os that is installed on actual devices be emulated in vmware or virtualbox
json is fine for this use and will be more compact than xml
i find json less verbose than xml and there is a very nice database in development called couchdb which lets you store search json documents directly
of course in fact json is much better than xml for the following reasons
the main advantage to using json for a large amount of data is that the parsing time to decode the data is quite a bit less than parsing xml
there is a certain amount of compiled-query caching which the entity framework does but it does not live any longer than the objectcontext
the control market around webforms is quite a bit more mature than asp.net-mvc so tools from companies like telerik devexpress infragistics will have a more mature implementation and broader base of support
on the other hand errors are always global and can be handled by any function class set by the set_error_handler
edit sorry this is more than three line of code
i am very comfortable with asp.net-mvc
it s actually the default orm framework of symfony and can be used with zend-framework quite easily
doing a job search for c# gives a lot more hits than for lua or haskell for example
alternatively videos can be displayed tile in this mode
the obvious cure is to tell it to sample the function at smaller intervals -- specifically small enough so the transition from +1 to -1 or vice versa happens in less than the width of a pixel as you ll end up display it
should you require data-structures that are more complex than tree you should check a topological sort algorithm
if you want to use based on min max of the visits table use
using windows forms i would like to have a small login screen the user authentication himself herself through say its form1 so the main application say its form2 would be opened after login
as far as i can recall a static-class is nothing more than a nested-class
can easily be done with ruby django php there are some good pdf libraries out there.
as i ve been looking into the differences between postgresql and mysql it has struck me that if what i read is to be believed mysql should be disclaimer by reading the rest of this sentence you agree to read the next paragraph as well the laughingstock of the rmdb world it doesn t enforce acid by default the net is rife with stories of mysql-related data loss and by all accounts and the query optimizer is a joke
it s not hard to tell that mysql has about a million times as much hype as postgresql it s la m p not lapp big installations of mysql are not unheard of lj
explain in postgresql is way more useful than in mysql
it would be great if this could be explained using python since i don t know c++ but i ll take what i can get
calculating the great-circle distance can be done using haversine or vincenty formula
this will generate a part of makefile just like c-preprocessor does or more correctly lisp macros
your 64-bit int will be converted to double which will at least usually have a significand that s smaller than 64-bits
this optional display width may be used by applications to display integer values having a width less than the width specified for the column by left-padding them with spaces
this optional display width may be used by applications to display integer values having a width less than the width specified for the column by left-padding them with spaces
i prefer json to xml as it seems to be easier to manipulate with php
never use legacy classes any more they don t behave correctly with respect to properties and much else besides and for backwards-compatibility they can t -- in python 3 legacy classes have finally been annihilated so every class is new-style without the requirement to explicitly inherit from object any more
i m assuming that you want the contains elements to be smaller than or contains entirely within the
this allows apache s user www-data to run only ejabberdctl with elevated-privileges and without requiring a password
whenever i use the eclipse source code formatter beautifier via the menu item source - clean up or ctrl - shift - f it reformats statements that i have broken into multiple lines back into one line that is longer than 80 chars eg i have
the .with string parametername syntax should only be used with primitive types string int etc
matching regular expressions with backreferences is np-hard which is at least as hard as np-complete
write getradioselectedvalue by yourself to get selected radio-button value or set some flag on click
this data is too much difficult to understand and arbitary in nature so we have 2 option for the representation of arbitrary data structures either in json format or xml format .but disadvantage in xml it is syntactically more complex and bigger in file size than json
out of range value for integer column type does not truncate to it s maximum value if there are more than 19 digits
i m liking fortran more at the moment because by the time you add all the required type annotations in cython i think it ends up looking less clear than the fortran
if you are looking to invest more time but not get too complicated i would recommend opencart or prestashop which are both standalone shopping cart systems
the default-value replacement raises a larger flag just because it is less common
you need to load the language file you want to use before you grab line from it
when an update is available it has to be installed backwards-compatibility with the database is not ensured with old versions
see if the user enters a name that does not match any of his friends idname gets set to an empty string instead of a uid number and name gets set to the entered text
i would recommend using nant or msbuild for that purpose but powershell or a simple bat file will also do
i personally prefer git but some people find svn simpler to use and some people like mercuiral bazaar or darcs
if using arcgis-server you can also expose your imagery and feature layers via a rest endpoint that can be consumed by openlayers
i like the monodevelop ide even better than sharpdevelop but i m not sold on installing and using mono s compiler just yet nor do i know if it can even handle the latest vb.net c# language features
is there any reason to favor python or java over the other for developing on android phones other than the usual python v
if i add a production i d like to see more than atomicity production that is used everywhere think identifier conflicts with rule foo yes there is more info s r r r than that but i think you get my drift
formbackingbean used to create new instance of the pojo that would be used by controllers
you also have to ensure that you do not destroy free the old block if the malloc fails - you just return 0
if you want to go deeper on this the best approach is to read back on the original lean philosophies and then see how you think they can best be applied to project-management
when user selected the record and press enter that record should be entered in textbox
no exposing non-api methods or allowing unfettered access to public variables - everything should be done with setter and getter
the regex should match any strings which contains the comma
the tostring should be slower than parse since division is generally slower than multiplication
ibaction resolves to void and iboutlet resolves to nothing but they signify to xcode and interface-builder that these variables and methods can be used in interface-builder to link ui elements to your code
so next you use the -r flag or -r do svn help ann to make sure to specify the revision one less than the revision you found in the previous step
firstly you re already aware that there s a length property for the arrays - so you could use that to create a loops that gets rid of the multiple calls to sort at the start and makes the length of the arrays a non problem
your core graphics surface should be cleared to all zeroes before you render to it so i recommend using calloc instead of malloc or adding a memset after the malloc
if you d like to avoid core graphics for decoding png images i recommend loading in a pvr file instead
it will not be shown to any logged in user in fact in vista and later oses you cannot show it to a user even if you set the service to interactive
a few html things have also been fixed is a self-closing tag and there are better ways than to centering tables
how can i find out why the error occurred or why my assembly must be registered as unsafe
i am not sure if this is no longer true myisam is faster than innodb for reads
ok there are some cases where myisam is faster than innodb but rarely enough that it s worth putting up with the lack of acid-compliance
once you get the idea it is extremelly simple to implement it -- maybe less than 10 line of code for the whole key-generation and validation process
if you re not allowed to perform any pre-processing on that list of strings then there s no reasonably efficient solution you re going to have to iterate all over the list checked for each word whether it can be composed as required its signature see below is uniformly less than the incoming bunch s signature
but again the user unchecks the check box the dropdown should be set to default-value that is --selec--
beautifulsoup is more suitable for html parsing than lxml
swift is now perhaps less weird than objective-c seems to a programmer coming from some other language
the problem is that if i push more expression onto the stack they will have nested brackets
this is also why actionscript classes and mxml components interoperate very horribly you might have noticed mxml doesn t have the concept of interfaces execution flow and thus time whereas as3 doesn t have the concepts of events or bindings which are native in mxml but are built on top of as3 using some metadata and the flash.events package looking very nice in mxml but being an impressive number of calls and instantiations in as3 .
really if you want an ordered sequence outside of a key value setup std set is just easier to use than any other
some developers prefer curly-braces and some prefer angle brackets
i like elgg only because it is being used by a growing number of online education sites and i think it integrates very nice with moodle
however recently last 2 years or so json has become more and more popular so most services decided to also support json and since they already had an xml interface they just kept it
while the using the into variable construct is on the right track the code snippet shown with only this change will fail since the cursor has more row columns declared than variables referenced in the into clause
so the question what s the best way to compare double and int
if it takes long enough that you even care i would seriously consider stepping outside of the entity framework and using one of the many sql server bulk insert facilities as it will considerably speed up the insert which will probably make your users happier than a progress-bar would
i don t know how asp hyperlink works but have you tried giving it a z-index larger than the overlay
this question sounds outrageous but vs is giving me an error when i check that a string-length is greater than zero
can someone please explain why i cannot check that an integer length property is greater than zero
i consider jibx the best of the bunch jaxb castor xmlbeans etc. particularly because i favor mapping files over annotations
side comment i prefer mapping files over annotations because annotations
for single pass vs multipass -- are you interested in playing with making a very fast assembler with minimize memory footprint
i wrote a handler javax.xml.rpc.handler.handler for a soap web service that inspects header data
if you choose to write a program you may need web-deployment technologies like clickonce or java web start to be launched from web
but i m far more familiar with linux strace or even solaris truss .
if it were a class every time you created a new object 8 bytes would be allocated on the heap and another 8 bytes would be allocated on stack for the pointers
it is fairly easy for us to convert current ibatis mappings in sql to oracle used a groovy script to do this also it is easy to convert java code that was calling old mappings that were in sql
your deployment process becomes more complicated since you require the .net framework to be install on your customer s machines and you need to register your .net library as a com component so that your vb6 application can access it
it s a set of regular expressions to match any number followed by h or m or d to represent hours minutes and days
edit if it helps the app charles shows me way more information than fiddler but i really want to figure out fiddler since i like it better
if you just set the child node to null you ll lose any information about the childs children
the only other way i thought of was to loop a 20 limit query for each category but if there are 100 categories that seems even worse
now that the application is written and i have some hindsight i wonder what the end product and experience developing the app would have been with django ruby-on-rails or java
for example how would one write expression which matches brackets balanced string like foo bar bar foo foo1 bar1
then you need to ask your webhost to allow the checkload url to be processed by asp.net
personally i would recommend sigaction over signals
the iphone has minimal support for xml and json is far easier imho using one of the json libraries such as those here
for example if currently checked out branch is master then .git head file representing head would contain single lf terminated line with ref refs heads master a symbolic reference to refs heads master and .git refs heads master head of master branch would contain for example lf terminated line 0b127cb8ab975e43398a2b449563ccb78c437255 whihc is sha-1 identifier to tip of master branch that is if current branch is not packed then you have to take a look at .git packed-refs
i would recommend postgresql over mysql
for very small classes like 16 bytes with no copy-constructor it is probably more efficient to use the value syntax rather than pass references
or more specifically it can t be used in any result set in oracle there is a boolean that can be used in pl sql but you can t return it in a ref cursor or declare a column of being type boolean
what is that needs to be coded in python instead of c++ etc
now the jvm is becoming less language dependent with clojure and scala running off of it so java has become more interesting now for designing applications
as i mentioned in a comment to the answer of brianegge there are not much usecases for hashes with more than 32-bit and most likely not a single one for hashes with more than 64bit
mask each bit in the integer value with 2 bit-index and if the resulting value is greater than zero indicating that the bit at that index is set do something
obviously a string can hold far more information than an int or boolean
the original goal was for guile to be backwards compatible with elisp but it seems like developing scheme is the better choice
with your current datamodel there isn t a more efficient way to do it than recursively querying the database
they describe intent better than built-in typename do typedef int errcode
using cryptography primitives directly is not trivial and difficult to get exactly right and with cryptography you have to be not exactly right only once for your security to be broken
note that this will match any message that contains the substring target_word
i think content-management system works better for you
that part works fine the only problem is it s supposed to be done over http
if the date-difference is greater than 30 days inform the user and close the application
can we have more than one controllers in our application
is it good practice to have more than one controllers
in a broader scope the actionservlet together with the requestprocessor and action and the initialization info from struts-config.xml could be called the controllers in a struts app
how can i set things up so that when i set an element to have a greater z-index than any other element on the page it will appear on top regardless
in oracle i d think that it would not be because the nested loop join would be much less efficient than a hash join but i m not familiar with firebird at all i m afraid
i don t have an installation of biopython on my current machine but if you take a look at the tutorial it won t take more than 15 line of code in total
alternatively you can try altering the line-height variable to 0 in the div then back to 100 in the p but that seemed to change the div s height by a few more pixels than the font-size method when i tried it
now let s see which is better tfs build with msbuild or nant
i have no experience with this but it looks like you might have specified a key-value that is not available in the parent table
i would like to draw a background for the canvas which draws line like a notepad would have feint blue line on the paper
i ll make a guess that the fit and finish of the visual studio c# text-editor is better than in monodevelop
detect if an html checkbox has be clicked selected
i finally realised this might be due to using 32-bit integer type instead of the native type and indeed when i replace with integer 8 the 64bit performance is only 25 worse than the 32-bit one
is it always the case that 64bit will be slower than 32-bit for this type of code i was surprised at this - or is there a chance i could get the 64bit compiled version running the same speed or faster
like you i m surprised that the 64bit version is slower than the 32-bit version
you may also want to take a look at why git is better than x a site that attempts to convince you of the superiority of git over mercurial bazaar subversion and perforce
if updating a fact in the database such as a street address requires more than one updates
if that s all you re looking for i d recommend python or ruby
this will take precedence over the globally set value and be returned to any code in your application that is performing localization
cmake is more generalised than qmake which is specialised for qt projects
however as things stand right now ironpython is much more mature and has much better performance than ironruby so you may prefer to use that
that is a nice framework built to help make putting together crud operations with asp.net-mvc and nhibernate
one of the benefits of asp.net-mvc i keep reading about is that it s easier than with traditional asp.net to create content-specific and or device-specific views straight html or json or xml or iphone-targed html etc
one thing to keep in mind when using icmp based ping is that networking equipment will often give icmp traffic lower priority than normal packets especially when the packets cross network boundaries such as wan links
because sharepoint is not compatible with asp.net-mvc
it ll load up a gui interface under settings check the box that says force https to be fetched using http
as for it being mandatory - basically the java designers decided to stick to a single method-signature which is frankly simpler than allowing for it to be optional
however this would not take more than 100 line of c
it is good practice to have more than one controller as a rule of thumb you have one controller per view but this is not a strict rule and you may have more than one controller per view if the view is complex and has distinct features that merit separation of concerns within the controllers
as implied in 1 properties is a better alternative to get set calls so instead of getx setx user uses less verbose self.x and self.x 1 though personally i never make a properties just for getting or setting a attributes if need arises it can be done later on as shown in #1
i extracted the same pdf as html and the html can be described by line of the following regex
i prefer java or python however any solution would be welcome -
according to wikipedia the bmp of the ucs has 65536 characters the latest version of unicode contains more than 107000 characters and the ucs has more than one million code points
the best way around this is with smart pointers because as local objects their destructors will be called during stack unwinding and their destructors will properly deallocate memory
which language features or base class libraries in c# should be removed if backwards-compatibility were not an issue
if the data sets are that big and can be expressed as key-value pairs with a little de-normalization you should look into couchdb or other nosql solutions
the map doesn t have to be sorted so hashmap should work too
is the unicode character at code point 1634 decimal or 0662 hex which is the more standard notation
i ve found it best to write scripts so they can be run without highlight except when i highlight just the selected part to see what records i m affecting
can be used to set any variables or functions that are used while
data structure design is very different between c++ and haskell so i bet that most people coming from an oo language ask the same thing
the link to the referenced paper does not work but if you used the standard hough transform than the four intersection points will be expressed in cartesian-coordinates
whenever i resize an image to a desired size there whe width is greater than the height the proportions get screwed
if the year has fewer than two digits the number is padded with leading zero to achieve two digits
when i saw logs i found these line
what this was doing was to set the focusvisual rectangle to be shown on cell selection
i would also recommend if you were not already aware to make your packets sizes less than the mtu
the idea was to have grizzly handle authentication using jaas and jersey handle authorization
however when i place an instance in the designer the auto value for the width and height fields is no longer available as it is with the default treeview
the compiler parsing it as because has a higher priority than the comma operator
here again jboss_home is the root of your jboss installation it may not be set as environment variable.
a controllers that receives form data
unless c++ develops better generic programming mechanisms like reflection it will be ill suited for generic programming and higher level languages like python will be a better fit for those use cases
at least on any platform newer than windows-xp there is strict separation of service and desktop components in the os
b need to select elements which contains any of given text case insensitive
an interface is better than an abstract class because you can implements multiple interfaces and you can only inherit from one abstract class
so i was just wondering if python is faster than java or c# and how that compares to c++ which i figure it ll be slower than
proper support can only be achieved with embedded-fonts or truetype fonts that need to be available on the target systems or need to be embedded as well
in terms of raw performance python is definitely slower than java c# and c++
junit is more direct and simpel to use if you start to learn java testng has more features but maybe is more complex
they do lots of cool stuff which can be added to asp.net-mvc .net apps includes paging and sorting
note2 the function would rarely be called with select get_new_rand_id but would be assigned as default-value on the id-column instead of nextval
serialization deserialization becomes a bigger bottleneck when you scale out to a session server or use sql server to manage session state
that key would be generated by a triggers after insert which is much simpler than trying to ensure atomicity of the operation and
if your goal is education and not ease of implementation you would probably be better served by extends the uicomponent class and using the treeitemrenderer code as a reference to create a class that implements the same interfaces
perl is a better choice i was starting to play with it but the solution with awk beats me
dtos help solve this problem by defining a set of objects that can be instantiated in any language whether you re using c# java javascript or anything else
bear in mind that these methods will only be seen from java and not the scala world
if your column contains numeric values and characters then it will be of mixed types and the jet 4.0 engine needs to to decide whether to choose float in which case your characters will be replaced by the null value or of type nvarchar 255 in which case your numeric values may be converted to scientific-notation
these implementations show that a bag can be implemented in any number of ways depending on your needs
but if a field is holding more than one value through the use of delimiters then that field needs to be parsed each time you need the answer to any of these basic functions
if you re talking about a traditional browser based web app then i d probably stick with json or xml serialization
this question c initialization of a normal array with one default-value has more information
i would surely recommend ilog jrules for your needs
so then fully compiled languages such as java may well run as bytecode and could be considered as interpreter however the point is that there is an explicit compile step there is no interpreter with the sun jre anyway that provides a runtime executable environment for java code
may be considered as controllers
spring mvc has adopted some of these patterns but i still prefer stripes because it does one thing and does it well
since many browsers block popups by default and popups are really ugly i recommend using lightbox or thickbox they are prettier and are not popups they are extra html markups that are appended to your document s body with the appropriate css
basically denormalization data requires more maintenance than normalized
that way everytime the user updates the content of the div an ajax call can be made updating the server side representation of the div
it seems to me that most of what can be accomplished with httpwebrequest response can also be accomplished with the webclient class
so far i can t see anything that can be accomplished with httpwebrequest response that can not be accomplished with webclient nor where httpwebrequest response will give you more fine-grained control
so while the quoted answer suggests letting category be m n to category my suggestion is to allow products to have m n category instead
the problem is that you are sending a redirect to the user when the action fails instead of just doing a render that means you lose any variables you set up to use within the request
ps 4g is the maximum theoretical heap limit for the 32-bit jvm running on a 64bit operating system see why can t i get a larger heap with the 32-bit jvm
int can hold a smaller range than double
just asking why it does not display the chatbox itself so not the senders after more than 2 line are entered.
this is what you want - the size of a buffer can t possibly be any larger than a 32-bit size_t on a 32-bit system but it can be far larger on a 64bit system
can you tell me why my searches are working ok in ie8 but get stuck with safari and google-chrome
if you are at the beginning of a project and really concerned about the structure of the generated html you may be interested in asp.net-mvc which is more web html standards oriented
the asenumerable forces linq-to-sql to enumerate the query results allowing the remainder of the query to be resolved using linq to objects and your distance delegate instead of being translated to sql
then a cube may help it s designed for aggregate math functions - sum and grouping by
32-bit ruby can be installed in 64bit windows versions thanks to wow64 windows on windows functionality
once you install ssl-certificate your website could be accessed using https protocol like so
images and css files will be loaded using http protocol as long as you use relative paths
language selection is more important than a page selection thus selected language should go first in a true human-readable url
anyway - that s a bad idea and should be avoided through controllers viewmodel inheritance or something..
i like enterprise-architect better than visio
it will take you less than 40 line of code in say python
just using a generator-expression is probably more readable than itertools though
b model has to be bigger than controllers
i prefer using notepad++ for developing
in my experience drupal is far more flexible than joomla
in addition i noticed that you also have a possible exceptional scenario for your full constructor when the min value is greater than the max value
at any time the number of dcache lookup is much more than dcache updates so
you shouldn t have any accessibility higher than private exposed as direct instances fields
if the ##temp has only few rows then the nested loop is better and order makes no difference
the cycles found are constructed in such a way that you can choose any path and still get a minimal cycle set no cycle can be get doing the union of two others but there is several possible such sets
wcf is more of a replacement for .net remoting than an alternative
it s called duplicatehandle and it works well and is more suited for cross process scenarios and would hack less than boost interprocess or similar
i am curious so i have looked at other things like django cakephp zend etc but i have never find something as good as ruby-on-rails
matching known shapes or dark line is better done with other methods
given a 64-bit integer you can calculate that you won t need any more than 11 digits in the result so using a static 12 character buffer will certainly help improve your speed
but every row contains 52 elements so those add up to more than thousand elements
for more than one substitution you could use cascading replace statements
your css makes perfect sense given the sample of html you ve shown but sometimes putting the style on the link elements itself rather than it s contains elements is less problematic and what i ended up doing earlier today with my problem
third i d recommend using junit 4.4 or better yet the testng idiom - annotations
so far i can match any empty html tag that does not contains jstl with the following
i have a method in c# code behind..which needs to be executed 10000+ line from assemblies as well as in child group methods
.single always fails if the collection it is called upon is empty or contains more than one elements
usually when people use strncpy they forget to do this which is why i recommend strcpy
all the buttons with regards jquery seem to be initiated on postback ajax style within an updatepanel using the pagerequestmanager however the viewstate is lost on the buttons made invisible by the placeholder
since ul and li elements are display block by default give them auto margins and a width that is smaller than their container
the array is set up to take 5 digits but i need to prepend leading zero to the number when it is less than 5 digits
now my problem is that sometimes the packets is bigger than 256 as for example 336 then it would be
it s more than two line of code but you can use the imagereader in javax.imageio to read each single frame of the animated gif and imagewriter to create a new animated gif from the mirrored images
if this is the case the query could be modified to choose max min etc.
generics gives you greater performance among other things because you often avoid the overhead of vtables and because with less indirection the compiler is better able to inline better type-safety because the exact type is known rather than hiding it behind an interface and often cleaner and more concise code as well stl iterators and algorithms enable much of this without using a single instance of runtime polymorphism or virtual functions
for an example of well thought out clearly specified macro systems i recommend common-lisp s
rather than include them in source control for easy of deployment create a deployment distribution mechanism that allows all dependencies to easily be obtained and install
click set as default so that this will be uised for any open of a wiq in future
allow the code to decide whether an object should be serialized with json or with xml
if an assembly is installed in the global-assembly-cache it s easier to go to c windows assembly and find it in the list of gac assemblies
for typical situations we re talking about less than 10 line of c# here not counting the dependencyproperty declarations
this is what i would do in a ms sql-server but i guess same optimization can be used in mysql too
this class should use less memory than an hashmap since it uses a primitive arrays no boxing needed it needs only for double s or for float s
i believe if there are alternatives they will involve complicated mechanisms listener manual sql insert statements etc just to save and retrieve data that belong to the association and not the associated main entities and fetch it as part of one of the main entities formula or ingredient
if the child class is not fully defined before the owner class it would have to be forward declare and can only be included as a pointer
local sequence cannot be used in linq-to-sql implementation of query operators except the contains operator
you may have kept the method-signature the same but you have changed the semantics of the interface and so it breaks dependant code
however you re in luck as you re likely to be able to move all your vba code out of access and into your vbscript which is quite compatible with vba
if you go for asp.net-mvc which is closer to rails then you may look into something like jqgrid
hex is somewhat more readable than binary if i happen to be loading a data dump in a text editor etc
you can do it with arrays but as you can see from the code dictionary is the easier way
by deafult name should get selected in radio-button list
im not very familiar with ms-dos commands
i came across this great site why git is better than x i thought i d add it to this answer for other people thinking of switching to git for version-control
perl cpan provides unix uptime - however it is not currently compatible with sunos but may be in the future
if you can add python as a dependency you can get a minimal http server running in less than ten line of code
i want to be able to use this function in a loops over another arrays that contains the names of the elements to be removed removethese arrays one three
note that anything you put into viewstate or sessionstate must be marked as serialization
have your detail view contains a member variable for the info to be displayed the elements in your dictionary
fgets should be interrupted by signals errno is set to eintr though you ll probably need to use sigaction ... rather than signal ... to ensure sa_restart is clear
any difference between the environment should be expressed in configuration files
it would appear from your question that the period of the tcp message is shorter than the arp refresh time
we can grab any point on this line to do the math we need and we usually pick the easiest one that way we don t have to do any multiplication just set
postgresql is a bit more restrictive than mysql
groovy is a joy to use so much more fun than java
implementing clone to perform a shallow object copy deep-copy is more involved is trivial compared to implementing a copy-constructor or a factory method to perform the same operation
any number of times then an equals then a space then there is a capture the brackets that grabs zero or more digits
sequence contains no matching elements is more a first predicate or single predicate thing.
the fsfs repo format is platform compatible please check that linux svn version is same or higher than you visualsvn version
it has it s own controllers and is better at handling more complex logic than a partial view
the floor times the ceil are greater than the floor xy...that s very much possible
that said i highly recommend asp.net-mvc
if all you need is a secure channel you re extremely unlikely to be able to do a better job than http
with wcf 4 - to be released with .net 4 presumably in march 2010 - things will get a lot easier since wcf 4 will already include a base routingservice class - see a endpoint.tv video interview by ron jacobs on this topic
i want to create triggers which will be fired after insert into some table let s say user
this can be applied to line in a file or characters in a string or anything else you can turn into a sequence in python
i once heard somebody say that if he writes more than 10 line of code without tests then he begins to be unsure whether the code he just wrote will work right.
you should use innodb in such scenarios and most mysql gurus recommend using innodb by default anyway because it s considered more generally reliable than myisam despite being slower under some use cases
in this case - it doesn t matter if asp.net-mvc is better than x or vica versa
i have never struggled on the overall picture of asp.net so to think asp.net-mvc somehow makes it simpler is often a misnomer
when you grouping in linq to sql if you ask for the child objects more than aggregate linq to sql will re-query each grouping using the key to get those child objects
it attempts to use the tsc register but for multiprocessor systems this register is not guaranteed to be syncronized between processor and more importantly can vary greatly due to intelligent downclocking and sleep states
any control that does not use viewstate or require can be used in asp.net-mvc without problems
i m more comfortable with php mysql don t know a lick of python yet except for the teeny tiny bit i picked up using the django admin recently...therefore please excuse this very stupid question that i m embarrassed to ask
if set true then it might increase the width or height if the given width and height are bigger than original width and height
i have the latest version of xcode and when i select my .xcdatamodel file and then select datamodel add model version i get the following dialog
strongly recommend upgrade your versioning of memcached
it s now even easier to get started with bing-maps use is now free for public-facing non-password protected web sites with up to 125 000 user sessions per year
and unlike inline elements a included among these block elements can be assigned a width and height
update i ve created a webhelper class that takes the place of webclient but provides more access to the necessary features of the underlying webrequest
you can use named capture buffering
i recommend direct2d and directwrite as you get high-quality rendering that s also ridiculously fast compared to either gdi or anything done in the .net space
controllers is the more usual name for a class used in a ui that causes interaction between a view and data and they quite often don t need to have public methods
in theory if you are running on a multi-processor cpu then the threads could be run on different processor so the work is done in parallel but even then there is no point in having more threads than processor
so my question is at what point in a forms life cycle do the controls on it get disposed of and therefore where would it be best to put the code that stops the update thread
i would recommend phpunit for your testing as it seems to be the most complete package for php imho many are fans of simpletest as well .
am i right that innodb is better for frequent concurrent updates and inserts than myisam
we know that myisam is faster than innodb when we don t have many concurrent updates inserts
it involves a bit of work in the triggers too as every change to table means that associated rows in cc_list_table have to be deleted updated insert as appropriate but is an approach that works in situations where the original table table has to retain its original structure but where you are free to adapt the query as you see fit
it is a massive over simplification in some cases and plain wrong in others to say we know that myisam is faster than innodb
if you ve tuned innodb properly for your server and are running proper server-grade hardware innodb should be able to compete with myisam on most queries excluding full table scans but you re not doing many of those right
if you find that innodb is much slower for inserts updates bear in mind that it offers a much better level of durability - if you tune it for approximately the same durability as myisam then you ll see good performance hopefully
i have written build scripts for my project in both nant and msbuild and i prefer nant or a hybrid of the two
to get some instant performance boast with passenger i recommend using ruby-enterprise-edition
in fact my compare function compares elements of type op_char and i retrieve the operator def from a map which contains elements of type op_def which have a field priority
to start off with clients using this protocol will be written in ruby java and .net and then possibly branch off into python perl scala erlang etc.
since your production server is running standard edition i would choose sql-server express on local machines
first maven is a much younger tool than ant or make so you have to expect that its going to take time to get to the maturity level of those applications
basically you can t return a value from a vba macros called from your c# code using application.run so you have to resort to passing an object by value that has a method or property that can be called from vba to set the instance
i am surprised nobody mentioned this yet because dynamic-programming seems a better approach rather than recursion + memoization
zope 2 had it s own simple version-control capabilites and they were as good as cvs which is to say they were limited and sucky.
seekbar looks like the progress-bar but is user modifiable
alternatively you can also explicitly cast your unsigned values to be signed bigint values and then do the subtraction
if you want to select line then strip out the bits you don t want
you have a job description - which may have some constraints on where its performed - and you have a queue of jobs to be performed broadly speaking if there are no other constraints you d expect the jobs to be done in order you take them from the front of the queue and add them to the end
it can probably be done with string.format ... but you could use decimalformat
so while printing things that aren t going to be read especially formatting floating point numbers can be a big performance problem you may in fact have other bigger performance problems that you should get rid of first
it is hard but not impossible to achieve full separation of concerns with asp.net webforms it is lot easier to do it with asp.net-mvc because of cleaner generated html...anyway you have few options here.
with gtk it s more common to use cairo already mentioned by jeff foster
unless there is specific reason to do it fopen fseek ftell is a better idea portable staying within the c standard library
how can i draw a bitmap with an additional transparency without it taking significantly longer than drawimage
multiplication is less expensive than division so
you have controls in wpf that can contain other controls like a panel that can have label checkbox and textbox i am not sure if there is a timer control but i m sure it can be programmed
it s not as trivial as subtract strtotime results since there are daylight savings and time would be mathematically correct but not physically
note that gawk is vastly faster than awk on this machine but still slower than perl
for example all controllers need to be extended from controller class so you cannot instantiate any class only a controller
get a bigger machine with more processor more memory etc
exception-handling make sense in code were it s okay to drop the current task on the floor and where common case code has more importance than error-handling
the prototype logically declare a type inside the function and therefore should be scoped as defined - and hence a type defined only in the function prototype cannot be used outside the function and a function that cannot be called is of little benefit to anyone
i normally don t work with json i prefer xml but since the twitter_oauth gem relies on it i m forced to learn it unless i change the gem s source code or overwrite it - not of my preference
there is no limit to the size of a system that can be developed in vim emacs unix in fact there are fewer limits than there are in ide s
how do i write a scala class object that can be executed with java
others prefer turbogears and or pylons maybe bfg maybe grok maybe zope maybe plone
if you don t have experience with orms linq-to-sql is slightly easier to learn than nhibernate
linq-to-sql is easier and faster to implement and integrate quickly but nhibernate can give you more flexibility if you need more control
so somehow i need my double to be casted to int
but i m not always sure if an image will need to be shrunk by height or width
if less than a packets has issues discard
exact duplicates of how to select elements like question1 question2 question3 in jquery form validation plug-in
microsoft has said it will be included in asp.net-mvc when it is released
by using the enum type checked is much better but it required that the generic base class be recompiled every time a new documenttype is added
ftp protocol is more complex than http or telnet form example
mv and ln can be used for atomicity operations
since both of these affect caching naively inlining functions with less than x line or whatever other simple heuristic is likely to generate worse performing code
i m not very familiar with http
video-streaming - iis 7 can be enhanced for video-streaming in conjunction with silverlight
however xml is syntactically bigger than json and that makes it heavier than json
easily parsed by javascript and it is lightweight a document in json is smaller than a xml document that contain the same data.
then you see json start to fall down but if you just need a serialization format for your data json is smaller lighterweight more human readable and generally faster than xml
xml may have its merits but for basic data interchange json is much more compact and direct
anyways bing-maps seems more cumbersome to develop for compared to google-maps
not be found on controllers
you can even sink dwebbrowserevents2 to get notified .when the folder view is ready
also make sure you re accessing the service via the machine s wins dns name or you need to add an explicit host header to the web site instance under iis
having briefly read through that site i learned that two languages could be used there java and python
as a language python is faster to learn but java comes with richer tools such as eclipse that may partly compensate
if you mean testing and modifying a bit as a single atomicity operation then the bit test instructions bt bts btr and btc can all be made atomicity by using the lock prefix
an integer greater than zero indicates
onkeydown although it wouldn t work for pasted data where onchange is probably better
it also seems that your break down of the site and what s required fits the django way of thinking a lot more than the drupal way
there will be an edit button down once the user clicks edit button all the lablel would be gone and textbox and dropdown control should be present so that user can change the values and again update into database
this makes it clearer to the reader that this string contains nothing that will be interpolated in any way
just for interest if you want really pedantic and rigorous type handling in a language somewhat similar to java you can hardly do better than scala
it works but it s poor form it s not as clear as inner-join
i m acquainted with basic programming stuff know syntax and some concepts of several languages pascal php python now want to learn c# and i debug quite a lot so i can write and have written programs not bigger than 1000 line of code for my own needs
afaik this can t be done in oracle but maybe someone can add a comment on how to do this in mysql
so i use the formula you have in your second query to first calculate the bounds -- the four lat long values at the extremes of the allowed radius then take those bounds and do a simple query to find the matches within them less than the max lat long more than the minimum lat long
i recommend google-docs and spreadsheet
in traditional waterfall methodology it s more acceptable for a developer to go dark for weeks on end-- and with a bad team this is the worst possible thing that can happen
the example i m thinking about is libnotify which enables for notification of messages with or without image and title this can for instance be found in ubuntu linux 9.04
nsinteger is nothing more than a 32 64 bit int
you would allow post get post is more secure to the php file and would then run an http-post get request from c#
i have an idea for a webapp for the iphone but its unknown to me how much data can be stored in mobile-safari s sqlite db
and no i m not just a postgresql fanboy i m a senior mysql user i started using mysql with a version 2.something i introduced it more than 10 years ago in the company i still work for and made it the default database and today i don t allow any new development i can decide to be based on mysql
if i is less than min and more than max
if min is less than is and is is less than max
how do you capture submitted value from a form and displayed them back on the page in the form field using php
when working with a landscape photo the photo width is greater than the photo height
when working with a portrait photo the height is greater than the width
as you can see on sorted data the sorted list is faster than the sorteddictionary
if you re just learning mvc and are ok with sql server then i would recommend using linq-to-sql for a start
also you can sorta - it requires a little more implementation than usual subclassing nsmutablearray type using objc
the site here has a list of useful unix commands that can be used on aix machines
matches any string and is only for like but if you want to apply it so that it will match any series of letters contains within your character class you need to do
but this just plots x with line
in my new wpf silverlight app is it better to directly connect to my remote sql server i m using linq-to-sql or is it better to call a wcf service and have the service connect to the database
if what you re actually looking for is for the records to be merged on insert into the database so you only have a single underlying record which contains all the data then you could do it through triggers but i can t quite see why you d want to because you d end up with a 1 1 mapping for b and c and might as well just have them as a single table
token should be passed in binary and not in hex ascii
this site is always can only be accessed via http and depending on your stance is a low-risk website
i use c# entity framework and linq with mysql too so it s not an either-or thing although performance is likely to be better with sql-server in a .net environemnt because the teams work together to boost performance and make integration work better
sql-server s sql-language support is richer than mysql s including some very cool features in sql 2008 especially like row_number grouping_sets optimize for computed columns etc
and or redirect everything in a file and use a plugin like ntail and use some filter line to exclude selected line from log file display that may be closer to what you are looking for
i personally prefer enterprise-architect or visual-paradigm for uml for my diagrams
however starting today there has been a lot of buzz out there about silverlight 4 being announced at pdc09 and people stating that there aren t many arguments left to choose wpf over silverlight 4
the build helper maven-plugin attach-artifact goal will tell maven that a particular file should be added to maven s list of artifacts for that project
richfaces and jsf unlike gwt allows for more document-style web-pages rather than application-style
this is much nicer than working with sql server compact or even full sql server since linq to objects is so much more powerful than linq-to-sql
i think the tool is good but if you are just starting the building of the application i would recommend using asp.net-mvc instead of asp.net webforms
however i can see the day when wpf will be called silverlight or perhaps the other way around
for example if you are passing any ol iterable to a function a generator-expression genexpr is often more appropriate and a lc is wasteful
it has a on duplicate key updates statement because this import needs to be done regularly updating the data in mydb
if i m creating an abstract base class and the classes derived from it are going to have some of the same data-members is it better practice to make those members private in the abstract base class and give protected access to them
the base-class could be virtual by the mere fact that only one of its methods must be implemented in derived-class
personally i prefer putting public methods first followed by protected methods following by private methods
similarly uitableview view contains more than 15 cell
using adaptor is a better approach as described in this article
i prefer svg over html5-canvas or png for charts
ideally the mechanism must be based on unix capabilities since we also plan to port to linux
i also think even if silverlight 4 makes better use of the gpu it still won t be to the level that wpf utilizes it
silverlight has a pretty good subset of wpf display features and even manually constructed silverlight content is easier to manage than trying to get .net windows + activex hosting + wpf working
have tried switching off the screens lock in settings but it ll still kick in after a springboard restart
you may have noticed field value rendering quickly with place holders spaces for subreports and other resource-intensive objects
we are planning to use adfs for these partner organizations so the users will be authenticated using active-directory within their network and claims will be sent to the webapp via the authentication token cookie set by the adfs
2 should every page in the adfs enabled webapp be accessed through http
if you are more into swing maybe you ll prefer netbeans-platform crud application tutorial
unless the screen height is less than 580px or width less than 930px
in mysql we should execute trigger body under authentication of user who
be warned gentoo is not a drop dead simple distro to use ubuntu -- you have to understand a bit about how the os works -- but it does provide an excellent developerment environment
i copy-paste and paste the output into an editor notepad++ which told me there were only 2000 characters not 2009 which is what i think should have been paste
if your content is an integer and you want the trigger to fire when it is greater than zero you will have to use
for instance windows-server 2008 is much better at managing large objects in memory than xp
i have found that pull is more scalable than push
in the non static case a pointers will be allocated on stack and initialized to point in .rodata at each function call
postgresql is more sql compliant than mysql
note that the same code can be used against webclient as httpwebrequest
i used kernel-package to compile and i also added a new system call to return an arbitrary integer value greater than zero
they ll probably restrict the use of unsafe code and pinvoke in silverlight 4 to a greater degree than in xbap
obviously i can t use something as simple as substring because it might leave tags unclosed or even leave half a tag
spring 3 final is soon to be released and appfuse is based on 2.5
however imo silverlight 4 would appear to deliver enough to give those who might have considered xbap pause for thought
there are several ways to accomplish this but probably the most versatile and rails-ish would be to create a module with a methods to do the ranking and then have any classes or associations that can be liked extend that module
having said that i need to point out that division into layers may not help very much with asp.net webforms project
not every page on your adfs web app needs to be accessed via http
as a language java is far behind c# but scala runs on jvm is as good as c# and it s performance is nearly same as java and also it can use all jdk and other java code as his library
usually when people want more flexibility than joptionpane offers it s basically a bunch of static factories for a few dialogs they write their own dialogs using jdialog
and lastly it can be modified to associate more than two field together for example a name description and a numeric value
that functions matter more than line of code
the default routes in the global.asax are set up to match controllers action id
a parameterless constructor is generally more descriptive than passing null you can make it private if you only use it from within the class
we are using gae to host our web services as far as i know gae only support java and python at the moment however most of our engineers here are more comfortable with c++ so i was wondering if there is a way to integrate gsoap with gae at all
haskell has more momentum these days but there are plenty of good parsing libraries for ocaml as well including the peg parser generator aurochs menhir and the glr parser generator dypgen
myisam inserts are going to be faster than innodb so if you re logging data and retrieving it later that will be a win
git is more flexible and powerful and might be a better option than using both types of version-control systems in parallel
find the closest 32bit unsigned int that is larger than x
if the rating is greater than zero but less than one ceiling will return one the smallest integer greater than the input
haskell has higher level bindings to llvm than ocaml the haskell ones provide some interesting type safety guarantees and haskell has by far more libraries to use 1700 packages on making it easier to glue together components
i haven t tried it but it has the attribute serializable and so can be de serialization with .net binary serialization soapformatter
mysql s totally non standards compliant group by can be emulated by postgresql distinct on
the problem comes for the container types you have used and the complexity of the xaml it has produced the canvas is absolute positioning and shouldn t be used for scale really
since the controllers is no longer in the url of your route aka you don t have controllers in the route url but it s a default value you need to make sure to specify the controllers when generating routes
uses addressing to select line that consist only of default 0 or default 1 or default 2 in the second form with any non-zero amount of spaces and or tabs between default and the number
i recommend networkx www.networkx.lanl.gov to build your graph structure and which you can then use to call the relevant matplotlib methods to plot
just be aware that basic md5 hashing is no longer a secure hash
the two queries fetches the same amount of data but the linq-to-sql query is more than 5 seconds slower and uses 150mb more ram
this only works if the first operand is larger than zero but at least it s short and confusing
i can t imagine this taking up more than 20 line of python
i think everyone would agree that if you are doing more than 5-10 line that an anonymous inner class is not a good idea i would say more than 2 is too much
executing an instruction requires first iterating over the denominator checking if the indexed state element is at least the specified value then if it matches decrement state elements specified in the denominator and increment those specified in the numerator
let s not compare line of code yet.
i have found that this method of deduping is extremely fast with perl and would like to see how python compares
since the tablet pc input panel is running as a child process of a service it has higher integrity level than user programs and thus cannot be sent any or a very limited set of messages to
c# code can be split between line on pretty much any syntatic construct without a need for a _ style construct
your social network graph can be stored in mysql in memory as a sparse adjacency matrix or you can take a look at neo4j
also pre-increment can be faster than post-increment as there is no need for a copy of the variable for comparison - however optimisers can deal with this
is this the proper way to accomplish joining 3 or more tables with linq-to-sql
according to your code snippet this control state would be disabled + selected + highlight for the duration of the network operation
the new getct function should call the previous getct function to see how many items prior to this one are greater than the average and then increment that total if this item was also greater
at times content may be delivered over http and the use of about blank can cause warning messages to appear to the effect of do you want to include content from unsecure location or some such thing
also one benefit of declarative programming is that purpose is usually more easily understood from reading the code whereas imperative gives you finer control over execution
i know this is sql-server code but can easily be changed to ms-access
another important feature i m trying to implement is to have a loading animation in the center of the screen that stays until the image is ready to be shown and goes away .when it s no longer needed
it is likely that you could do an sha hash of 100kb in well less than 10 second though and though sha-1 is still theoretically flawed it is of higher strength than md5
i ve heard of built with zend framework and but that is ruby on rails i d prefer php for ease of deployment and hosting...
still as those two are not as popular as drupal or joomla or whatever other well-known cms you can think about i would probably not use them for any real site -- at least not before studying them for a while
on today s machines that s a non-issue but if you ever find yourself dealing with older gear it s my experience that vim is far more likely to work on a wonky terminal than emacs is
firstly microsoft would have developed the asp.net-mvc framework using their sdl processes which includes security from the beginning
take charge of your security - phil haack compares asp.net to asp.net-mvc
but stop and consider it looks like it s possible to not match any dog and cat elements which would leave you returning null for one or both of the tuples components
since it is more bare-metal than asp.net webforms you do have more opportunity to shoot yourself in the foot if you are not careful
in general python s support for defining functions taking default arguments variable numbers of arguments and keyword arguments is more flexible than any other scripting language i ve ever seen
it depends on the character set unicode or ansi wchar_t or char so if your are using ansi simply tchar will be char without any casting but for unicode you have to convert from wchar_t to char you can use widechartomultibyte
prefer procedural-programming
just to get closer to the solution write a javahelp.bat or .cmd if you prefer put it on the path and call that from ruby
i suggest using hover this instead of binding to mouseenter and mouseleave looks cleaner to me
both cxf and jaxb are xml oriented more than json oriented
so i have a gap between in-memory result of xsl transformation and javax.swing.text.styleddocument which can be rendered by jeditorpane or jtextpane
why is the super constructor recommended to be called when extends any of the rim screen classes
if any of the fields are text the value will have to be surrounded by single-quotes or two double-quotes in a similar way to date and time
do other datatypes besides varchars pose the same problems when using a default-value or is it more problematic with string datatypes
my understanding was that if the path of a cookie is not set the cookie will be sent to any page on the domain though i tried adding to the cookie in case that would help anyhow
you just need to extend the basiccomboboxui and then override required methods like
when series is accessed for editing it would show a list of all elements it contains derived from contententrybase where those items could be edited or sorted
you can use the command to match braces brackets parentheses in vim
instance-variables are more costly than local-variables
if you are using .net 3.5 i recommend using linq-to-sql but if you are able to experiment with .net 4.0 i would highly recommend looking into entity framework
i think many people like python more than ruby but find ruby on rails features better as a whole than the ones in python web frameworks
this is something that ruby is much better at than python
i usually balance in between 2.1 and 2.2 so that i put trivial things related to the data into business objects and create services for a bit more complex scenarious if there are more than 4 line of code - make it a service
i much prefer try-catch using a procedure template like the one described here exception-handling handling and nested transactions
i am trying to lean boost bind boost lambda libraries and how they can be used with stl algorithms
now i m not sure if i d say postgresql is generally better than mysql -- there are certainly things that mysql does much better and so it certainly has its uses -- but these are a few things i absolutely love about it
the breadth-first-search algorithm can be extended to dijkstra s algorithm that calculates the shortest path between your source and destination as long as all graph edges are non-negative
depending on f step 1 and 2 may need to be reversed postorder instead of preorder
none of the data is more complex than key-value pairs
if you say that asp.net-mvc is for the hardcore and the alpha geeks then by your logic other language developers are much more advanced than .net developers
in ie6 7 8 and in google-chrome text has proper size but in firefox it s bigger
for .net 4 the routing service functionality will be included into wcf out of the box
note digest access authentication is not helpful if you want to have form authentication a html form with user password login page using the visual style of your app nicer wrong-password error reporting possibly additional features such as remember me or forgot password
i know of some neat tricks to read a text file directly into a single appropriately sized buffer but breaking it down into line makes it trickier at least as far as i can tell
as suggested by ikkebr python is probably as good as or better than perl
wordpress can be used for more than just blogs having recently won an award for best cms proves that
as myyn suggested something like beautifulsoup or hpricot really excels at this sort of thing so if you aren t absolutely convinced that it has to be in c++ you really should look into those the basics of both python and ruby can be picked up pretty quickly and are certainly much simpler than c++
i have some attributes which are const so should these attributes be made public or protected
this will accept positive and negative integer number with not more than 17 digits
i tried to implement concat as same as haskell s concat in scala
i dont know why the windows go to the back but the behavior is not consistent between windows-xp vista 2003 etc
there is the mono project that aims to allow .net code to run on mac and linux but between the two delphi being pascal is somewhat more portable
an associative arrays on the other hand could be called a dictionary or hash
you want to compare apc key-value store vs memcached right
memcached has more functionality but is intended for distributed environments while apc works on single servers only
the picture box is in a panels with autoscroll true so that scroll bars appear when the picture is larger than the panels
a new key can be generated at alert message when trying the site
you ll need some o r mapping to your database using linq-to-sql and then this can be done in linq
i ll always recommend subversion with visualsvn for server software and tortoise svn for the clients
subversion is excellent and installation is almost trivial with visualsvn-server and use is straightforward with tortoise as a client
typically your logout page will redirect back to the login page so the user when they return to their computer will be prompted to login
can it be made using http
keep in mind that union will return a distinct list - duplicates will be removed but it will perform slower than using union-all which will not remove duplicates
if you haven t specified a value or not selected an option in a select field it s reset to an empty value or for a select field the first option
wordpress.com exports in xml so that might be easier than using feed or otherwise grabbing html and parsing it
python is in fact compiled just as much as java is the only differences are
the python compiler is much faster than the java compiler
the default is compile-time which means annotations are available in the class file but cannot be accessed at runtime using reflection
ps cmake is much more powerful than autotools too
update i just noticed that obviously in a c99-like language the conditional of an if statement would be enclosed in parentheses
i load this .arff file use 10-fold cross-validation no test file and choose naivebayes then i classify the data and it gives me 5 incorrectly labeled 100 correctly labeled
this is the one feature of asp.net-mvc that will make me choose asp.net-mvc over webforms every day of the week
in terms of long-term maintainability asp.net-mvc will simply blow webforms out of the water
i suppose the wcf serializer could possibly be faster than the asp.net-mvc one but the bottleneck is always going to be getting this data across the wire
if you want to set a cookie -- including the cookie that s used to hold a session id -- with all subdomains you would need to set the domain property to .domain.com -- note the leading dot which allows the browser to match any domain that ends with domain.com
isn t the neighbour relationship between two cell in itself an object that needs to be referenced by cell 20021 and 20022
and to automate this even further you can implement this in an action filter so validation will be automatic for your entity objects that get passed into controllers action
memcached around 4-5 times slower than apc but run as a single process that can be touched everywhere in my environment
notice that the last curly brace blob is now in three lines and that each line is less indented than the previous
some people suggested doxygen some ccdoc which should be more similar to javadoc but is less supported
i have a list of phones that i have to see if they exist in the table phones the problem is that there is more than one field that each value can be in the table
this will only display one answer and if value can be in more than one field it will only display the first field it finds the value in not all of them.
today i have tried to make it all work with asp.net-mvc 2 preview 2 which can be found here asp.net-mvc 2 preview 2
also atoi doesn t provide any way to detect errors so prefer strtol and similar functions
suppose i wanted to have all files named .myexcellentpage to be parsed with php or with perl or as html or what have you
the interpreter compiler providing that implementation is under no obligation to maintain the officially undefined behavior beyond backwards-compatibility and whatever commitments the producer may make
i recommend using instrumentation performance profiling tool that is bundled with xcode and the developer tools
here are some sites that i ve done with wordpress that are more than just blogs
it will be less code than c++ and java for sure to do the same thing probably less code than python or ruby even
i know that memory blocks and reallocation are implementation so specific but when there are contiguous free blocks of memory realloc works better than a new buffer allocation and memory copy
also avoid identity which can be impacted by triggers doing insert s
so if the cookie array contains more than 10 elements i want the elements to be replaced one by one
are they going to be fixed width or height
xmldatastore.class.php has recently been refactored and it used to be longer than 981 line
i would still recommend checking out postgresql and postgis in comparison to mysql if you intend to do more complex queries in the foreseeable future
if it s the setup that s making trouble for windows i am very happy with visualsvn server a free svn server wrapper gui for svn
per the page i linked to compareto returns a negative integer zero or a positive integer as this object is less than equals to or greater than the specified object.
one option is to use lxml i m not familiar with beautifulsoup so i can t say how to do with it it defaultly supports xpath
with one bag any particular item will eventually be drawn by any player with the same probability
also in the c program files microsoft sdks windows v6.0a bin folder you have tools like mt.exe which can be used to embed manifest external into exes dlls. for managed apps too
barry yeah i figured it s a step deeper to dwell into baseten but i m the fidgety impatient sort o it wasn t too difficult to grok the basics of binding and such even lead me to implementing a valueconverter or is it transformer
it dereferences the pointer in your case p should be defined as var p type and accesses a variable in the record in this case rlink and llink
what can be done in haskell that can t be done in scala
d and go will probably just become as popular as python and ruby are today
i do recognise that c++ can be hard memory management so i think it s good to have a add on language where performance is not essential and readability maintainability scores high i recommend python for this
this would erase any id3 and other header information contains in the file and probably destroy any exploit attempts gd would probably choke on such a file and return an error
in your implementation of the action method for this switch value change you ll need to implement logic to determine whether rows should be added or subtract and then actually add or subtract the rows
type inference in haskell is more complete than in scala having full inference even for partially applied polymorphic type constructors
but instead of ant i d choose maven because it will require less work imho and it has a built-in feature called profiles that is perfect to manage environment specific stuff like here
while today 32-bit are considered a standard in 10 years doing things in less than 64bit may possibly seem distasteful
i am not familiar with hlsl but i am with glsl
wouldn t you need considerably more than 4 processor and a reasonably parallelizable task to make up for the performance difference between a clojure app and even a single-threaded sbcl version of the same app
however the app now cannot be debugged it throw an exception configurationerrorexception
anyway as tom hawtin said it is sometimes better to use the old syntax when you need to get the current index information by using a for-loop or the iterator as everything you win when using the java5 syntax will be lost in loops itself.
with this any url having abc xyz or pqr will be redirected to https and any url not having it will be forced back to http
because any clicks coming from a https page would never get converted to http
in django if i an object of type django.forms.booleanfield for example how do i know what database type it is going to be saved to int boolean varchar
this can be run as vba code or a macros
right-click the cell with the comment and choose show hide comment might do the trick
is there any easy php testing framework and may be simpler than simpletest and not command line based like phpunit
all of them no more than 200 line of code
xml is arguably more readable than csv
csv is more lightweight if you want to move things about since its normally 2 more times smaller than xml
receive the response one of the options to be returned is csv or xml
afaik from eclipse 3.5 m4 on the formatter has an option never join line which preserves user line breaks
if probs contains fewer than 100 elements you ll get that exception for trying to read past the end
it favors code-readability
but thats getting stuck more on the old procedural||static paradigm of pages because really the action controllers itself has no more to do with a page or section than the association you make as a developer
also bioconductor is a particularly fast moving project and you ll typically be asked to upgrade to the latest versioning of r in order to get any continued support help on the bioc mailing list
are there other publicly-available open-source frameworks with an associate arrays class that uses an underlying data structure that would perform better than stl map
also consider the response will be served in xml and json soon
then sun developed jdbc and servlets for java and then other j2ee pieces and java became a higher performance alternative to perl and easier than c++
since these less than and more than value typically only apply at the ends of the range such a convention allows handling all filtering and ordering with a single field value in a standard fashion
if you have to do a lot of this honestly testng is more flexible but you can absolutely get it done in junit
default alignment is roughly equal to stringformat.alignment stringalignment.center it can be changed for button and checkbox with their textalign property
there s a similar question here on so.com in cocoa do you prefer nsinteger or int and why
i prefer using nsinteger because it s future-proof apple now uses it over int and it s the recommended way of doing things
but if the script which takes a longer time more than 5mins throw an exception saying
i was going to insert all the code in here i m going to release the script as lgpl anyway but the code is more than 150 line still in development
udp makes sense if you want to make your stream multicast otherwise i would prefer tcp because it is more reliable
apc have less feature than memcached and is easly to use and optimize but this depends on your needs
but for experienced perl programmers the format key-value looks clearer than key-value
i m just wondering if python is a better option than java or c# for scientific apps
for the sake of completeness i would like to mention another less powerful algorithm with addition subtraction
this seems to me like something that should take no more than 2-5 line of code but i can t seem to find anything but huge long examples involving 3rd party packages etc
when dealing with plain text what limits should i set on line size and number of lines on a page to get it to print reasonably
simplemodal has a similar function but i much prefer colorbox s implementation and documentation otherwise i d use the latter
i don t know about your other issues but the reason the 32-bit version is the more visible one by default is that most plugins still don t have 64bit versions eg
https is more cpu intensive than http
now i want to make a slightly more complex query with inner-join not just table data extracting
just having more than one listener on document.ready should not really slow things down - it s lilkely either the code that runs on those listeners or the amount of code you are loading
i was involved in development of a simple in-house mime parser took few days to hack and parsed 95 of received emails which envolved into a commercial product few months of work tons of unittest and hudreds of really vierd test emails from the wild and then was modified so it can be used in compact-framework changes because of memory-constrained devices changes because only small portion of .net framework is ported to .net cf
another alternative if you want to set up a method that can be overloaded with any user-supplied function or with another of the object s methods is build a custom descriptor
the advantage of this approach is that the code that cleans up the line now handles fewer characters for each invocation and should execute much faster even though more invocations are needed
i m guessing c++ is faster than python and can probably handle larger files more intense algos
the properties file in this case is fewer than 30 line 30 key value pairs
we found this 100 swing component called flexgantt and curious to know whether there are any specific requirements for a swing component to be run in javafx environment before we actually spend time to learn javafx
sscanf returns the number of matches that succeeded so if the integer value returned is less than the number of field you expected to match you know the string doesn t match your input format
such that a landscape image would have an ideal height of 300 or slightly larger with a width 400 and a portrait image would have an ideal width of 400 or slightly larger with a height 300
nope each one will have to be marked as serialization specifically
i would easily choose .net as a platform with asp.net mvc nhibernate
when i used long longs the c++ was about 100x faster than the python but when i used gmp bindings in c++ it was only 10x faster than the python for the same cases that fit in long longs
1 .yes the interface function prototype has to be same else base-class function get hidden by derived-class function if parameter defers in derived-class function
however it seems every time i launch the app from the homescreen the cache version of the page is used instead of refreshing the page and of course i need the page to be updated on startup and cannot use ajax here - need to dynamically authenticate the user with sso phpcas
i don t know which technology you are proficient in but this can be done in ruby on rails php asp.net and more
calls will be made over ssl if the scheme is http
compared to platforms like symbian brew and j2me windows-mobile is much more advantageous for new developers
the first is that the author of the derived-class has much more information than the author of the base-class
i don t think there are many things comparably easy for c# or java - at least that so seemlessly handle passing numerical arrays of different types although i guess proponents would argue since they don t have the performance penalty of python there is less need to
i would much rather use linq-to-sql or linq if not possible with linq-to-sql to figure out the running totals so i can just set datagridview.datasource to my data
i would like know if development with python is as enjoyable as ruby in terms of the clarity and ease of use
or you can choose between mako genshi jinja2 or whatever you like for your templates
with the springsource server each .war file is deployed more or less traditionally but can access resources classes services etc. via the normal osgi mechanisms
if i want user b to have certain access to all directories i either have to add them to a group or assign them to a role which in turn must be created or assign to directories
i have pretty good experience with c++ objective-c cocoa familiar with python
local sequence cannot be used in linq-to-sql implementation of query operators except the contains operator.
i recommend dojo but others use jquery yui etc.
it s an unpleasant habit of java coders that should not be seen in python
i used to suggest you use double-quotes everywhere makes it easier to actually add that later on but i now use single-quotes unless i need interpolation n etc.
obviously msbuild will continue to advance but given all the extra tasks that can be accomplished using nant why has development suddenly stopped given that many open source and i assume commercial applications depend on nant
i mean the data structure that is a collection of pairs key-value where values can be acceded using key
should never be used if serialization
by the way if you like minimalistic approach there is also scite editor which is my personal preference for doing small bits of code it s even more lightweight than notepad++
the heap property each nodes is greater than or equal to each of its children
all this could also be done using ajax but iframe solution is quite easy as you just need to load ready page and all postback are already handled by original page and separated from master-admin-page
for new apis built upon arcgis-server it feels better on resources.esri.com - at least there are many samples and there s also community part that rocks
if you have any experience at all with delphi you re already familiar with callback methods under a different name event handlers
as i have check box in gridview if i dont select any one checkbox and if i click asp button then i have to show message to user to select checkbox
as far i know integrating icefaces an richfaces will be possible when theirs jsf 2.0 versions will be released in icefaces 2.0 and richfaces 4.0
if a remains the same and b is changing say if your code is in a loop and it s clear that a does not change between two iterations for instance because it s a const variable then the original version can execute faster because multiplication is cheaper than division assuming the compiler moves the computation of 1 .
it s sql is much more ansi-compliant than mysql - so later using oracle sql server sqlite etc should be very straight-forward
the biggest reason why i recommend postgresql to people who have more oracle mssql experience as opposed to mysql is that the sql syntaxes and general feel of the database engine match pretty closely
lets say i have a asp.net webforms application but i want any new pages to be written using asp.net-mvc could i create a new asp.net-mvc project and then jack it in as an area into the existing webforms application
i ve found that postgresql is in my expirience is slower as mysql
a 8-bit png shim is smaller than the same dimension 1 pixel gif and everything will still work as planned
in this example items is an nsarray that holds the values to be added as cell to the table
python is better suited for practically anything that doesn t fall within php s specialty domain which is building websites
unfortunately even for a very large file 48 000 lines my new binary-tree is slower than the old one
since construtor cannot be inherited so base-class data members are to be initialized by passying argument in derived-class constructor and with the help of initialization list
if the equal amount of cards is to be removed removing 1 4 or 3 2 the group with the minimum of the minimum will be removed in the previous example 1 4 will be removed as min min 3 2 min 1 4 belongs to that pair
it s not that php can t do it but python just does it better and less buggy
the differences shown by git-diff --cached are what will be committed on git-commit
it s pretty easy to parsing with either a bunch of splits or regex s until you find out that values can have backticked comma also they can be double quote marked which makes life hard
aspects security offers a smaller set of 3 day conference like training options
i m trying to create a div which will have fixed width and flexible height here is the picture which i want to use for background
i have a modal view controllers that creates core data changes in it s own context and when i click done it saves the changes that dispatches the merge changes notification notifies the delegate and dismisses
if you are using entity framework v4 and visual studio 2010 then access mode can be set in design-time using entity designer by setting the necessary value to the entity container access property of the model
the advantage of this dual-natured solution is that the tabbed approach will work the way you want it to work for the majority of cases but for users with say two screens or who prefer switching between browser tabs they will still have the flexibility to work in multi-window mode
if your numbers are integers then you can verify -- using integer arithmetic -- that one power of the base is less than or equal to your number and the next is above it the first power is the number of digits
you seem to have implemented a binary-search-tree not a b-tree
the certificate won t be used for http only for the as2 connection and the partner has stated that it can be self signed doesn t need a trusted ca
i prefer delphi pascal but i can read other languages if the example isn t overly complex
while iis does give us better performance than cassini we would still like to be able to hit f5 to run our application from within visual studio
so this thread is definitely not a thread for why python is better than ruby or the inverse
again don t compare ruby-on-rails vs django
imho python is more mature - there are more libraries for it although ruby may be catching up and the included libraries i think are better designed
also you should not be overriding the paint and upated method of japplet this is old awt code and should not be used with swing
it should result in nice well-distributed points that should be better than uniform pseudorandom samples for most scenes though could result in horrifying artifacts in some circumstances
i tend to use json when working in web applications because it is a lot smaller than xml because it doesnt require the bloat that the nodes create
however this does not take into account the space taken by the notification bar or window decorations so in reality you have less space than width times height
it s a strange thing to want to do as commenters say inner-join is usually better and applying a mechanical transformation proves nothing but not difficult
so for future project development this may drive demand for sl4 over wpf particularly if there is a perception that silverlight development is cheaper than wpf if the learning curve is less for a subset technology although i don t agree with that sentiment myself
however quicksort s worst-case performance is significantly worse than heapsort s is
.net framework 4 beta 2 can be installed on windows-server 2003
i want a method in the base class to be invoked any time a property in a derrived class is accessed get or set
d+ is 1 or more digits and then . d+ is 1 or more digits after a decimal-point
even if you are allowed to compile in 32-bit mode anyone else can configure it to be run in 64bit application pool mistakenly
type-checking in javascript is non-existent you can pass fewer arguments into a function than are declared in the function ... signature in which case the arguments that aren t passed get received as undefined and you can pass more than declared in which case the only way to read them is through the arguments array which always contains exactly how many arguments were passed in regardless of what s in the function signature
out of these i would recommend lxml html5lib and beautifulsoup
it s a question of whether or not repeating the if test inside loops is less efficient that another traversal of the arrays
if the state of the unit changes between the time the referring page is rendered and the actual call comes in to the controllers it is not longer ok then the use of an exception to handle that event seems perfectly fine to me like having an exception when an optimistic locking error occurs
since we want the newlines to be preserved we subclassing optionparser and change the behaviour of format_epilog
however because the server has sent several messages the byte stream will contains the xml for more than one elements and when it is deserialized a multiple root exception is thrown
i have not benchmarked the performance in the two but my experience says that asp.net-mvc is easier to configure on iis7 than on iis6 especially when you are on a shared hosting
there are also a few issues when the ball intersects more than one line in a given frame imagine four lines together making a rectangle and the ball intersecting the corner of said rectangle -- which direction should it bounce off
i m noticing a very strange problem with linq 2 sql throwing exceptions mainly specified cast invalid or sequence contains more than one elements when under a certain amount of load
using wordpress i have created a multiple select box so that users can select category to exclude
i recommend m2e plugin for eclipse maven integration
it can be done although c++ is probably the wrong choice python + pywinauto might be a better choice
lots of companies have big globs of java code that can be scripted with python
if you want more than two arrays or variable number of arrays then you might be able to use a nested loops though i think you d need to have and as the individual arrays
this is made more complicated as lines in the script could actually span more than one line if it is statement or block of code
the universal concensus is that unix domain sockets outperform tcp-ip
simply put each bank organisation is given access to a certain set of prefixes numbers at the start and depending on the level of detail you want you can match any card number to an organisation using the prefix
python itself is not really good with concurrency and is slower than java anyway
you can deploy stand alone custom pages with 100 of your own code and it will run under sharepoint or you can create new application pages that also contains any code you want to write or you can simply add your own webparts that can be added to any page you choose with 100 of your own code
on the other hand if your process need to chatter a lot option one is the way to go because the interprocess communication is way cheaper than communication between different vms
can eclipse be used to building appropriate targets which can then reference the common stuff when running in a live environment
my findings revealed that this could be done under windows-vista windows 7 and mac os x although i m unsure about the latter
the rope data structure as a binary-tree is better in certain situations
your program will bomb when it tries to scroll more than 200 line 201 x 80 x 4 64320 bytes oddly off a bit from 65536
i would really rather use ms-access over sql-server so that i can distribute my database with my program rather then connecting to some remote sql-server
after you have these simple cases working it will be easy to find the element in an order list that is the first one larger than the element to be inserted and add the element in front of the larger one
there s no way the ruby devs would have a hash function that s an order of magnitude worse than python s
also all the embedded link will be served from http
sequence cannot be used in linq-to-sql
if you have a dot or comma followed by no more than two digits it s the decimal-point
this createchildcontrols method is part of the control inherited hierarchy and is typically overriden by subclassing controls
i ve been thinking about this question for a bit and after a bit of consideration i agree that implements and should only be done on sealed types
i love python and despite what everyone says my python is better because i know java
the second option - switching to a fully unix-like building environment is more involved and extends far beyond what editor you will be using
i know this is probably a case where asp.net-mvc is better but i need to use webforms
note this static main method must be defined as void return type and it can either take no arguments or it can be defined to take an array of strings to be passed as command line arguments
the site needs to be hosted on https and we don t control the video so i m assuming it needs to be on http
playframework is totally mvc with a fantastic template engine and allows you to choose freely between java scala
i have fireworks 8 as well as photoshop cs3 on my windows pc but i m more familiar with fireworks
i thought that creating and scheduling multiple jobs would actually cause multiple worker threads to be created execution the jobs in parallel unless there was an ischedulingrule conflict
there are so many ways to do this but dom manipulation will almost always be slower than javascript manipulation
yes i would also recommend using jquery a very nice plugin is the jqtransform plugin
you can find a step by step tutorial that shows you how to get started with irrlicht here and with ogre here
these locations will convert when they go to windows 7 perhaps or because the application they use internally is upgrade and needs the newer browser versioning
if you re looking into a new desktop-development-language then i d recommend java or python both of which you d ease into with your c# and vb.net experience
in my opinion debuging linq2sql is much easier than both stored-procedures and ado.net
some people recommend learning silverlight before full wpf because it is actually a subset of wpf
it allows you to safely concatenate several js files into one to serve it quicker as one http-request
i prefer apache 2.2 however lighttpd can also be deployed if it offers a feature for the implementation
i am creating a web application which requires threading and i am trying to figure out which langauge between php and ruby has better threading functionality and better performance
also i belive isbn-numbers only have a modulus check which only can detect that one digits is wrong more than one may cancel each other out
by default nmock uses equals to match arguments passed to expectations in your case to see whether loadprojects sets mockview.projects to expectedsetprojectsrequest or not
this is exactly the same as ofri s answer except i have wrapped it in a shell function and am using the less -s option to stop the wrapping of line makes less behaves more like a office oocalc
when if the subscript into the map creates a new item that item will have the chosen key and your associated int will be initialized to zero automatically
any java class can easily be used in groovy with no change plus you have the groovy syntax
i find this scary and ruby runs slower than python so i m not actually urging you to switch to ruby
some are even incapable of performing operations sometimes even load operations on unsuitably-aligned data - in order to work on such data it has to be loaded into two registers and then a series of bit shifts and masks need to be performed to get a usable value and then it needs to be put back
all of them seem to be targeted at playing and recording audio
now that i ve gotten relatively familiar with web2py i d like to give django a go
if you were to invent a new language do you think primitive datatypes should be capitalized like int float double string to be consistent with standard class naming conventions
i have a validation that needs to be done in controllers
transform that is use for cross tab queries in ms-access cannot be used in mysql
that is an old awt trick and should not be used with swing
regarding comparison between gridview and listview my experience is that listview is more lightweight as compared to gridview
the major difference is that mochiweb is faster and nimbler while yaws handles more concurrent connections
i would recommend gif over png because there are some issues with color profiles in webbrowsers and pngs
however it doesn t say explicitly if the header name should be interpreted in case-sensitive or case-insensitive manner
if the numbers of items in the sequence is larger than the range then clearly yes.
i there is mixed unmanaged managed-code in one clr project function with variable number of parameters will be compiled as unmanaged function here
i want to use built in asp.net-mvc validation logic as much as possible
web2py was very much inspired by django and if you know one it is easy to learn the other
how would this mapping be done with annotations rather than an hbm file
i defined the button selected by default and selected my image for the selected state use drop-down list in inspector window to choose selected state configuration before selected the image
is there any way to either disable the warning for the file cs1591 or put values that will be imported into xml comments into the xsd file
jquery is suited for html manipulation asp.net-mvc gives you more control of the html you output which is the reason its so easy to use jquery with mvc
my conclusion clean functional-programming need not be slower than imperative-programming and may sometimes find unexpected avenues of optimization or parallelization
scala runs on the jvm so concurrency support at the vm level cannot be better than java
however i prefer having an anonymous union
when the 32-bit dll is dynamically loaded and begins processing the memory footprint of the 64bit application will be about 60 mb larger 250mb as 64bit vs 190mb as 32-bit than if the application is built as a 32-bit app
the function you call should be written to hide the flash object and or it s container and display the container with all of your content that you re ready to show
to be concise i will just say that the fact that objective-c just like any other object-based programming language due to introspection and other objective requirements is significantly slower than procedural-programming languages
sometimes a reference is better than 40 line of comments or even suggestive variable names
xts extends this further but zoo is a better starting point
i am programming in a hebrew environment and so i want the tabs on the top of a ttabcontrol to be displayed from right-to-left
thus they can be merged and minimize
the amount of data will vary depending on whether you choose kml or json or georss but if you end up with 20 bytes per line segment that would take 50 seconds to fetch on a 1 megabit broadband connection
i managed to get the propertiesgroup name to print but i can t seem to retrieve more than one attributes from the properties elements without doing two linq queries
one way to do this would be to define a route for the controllers action eg the route would be defined as controllers action
i want to create a field that looks like this ....can any one tell me how this could be done which field could i use where in i can select value by using the trackball wheel or in case of storm i could slide.
i d prefer cocoa but will be willing to go carbon if i must
is something like groovy or javafx really a wrapper for something that technically could be written in java
for instance on my personnal svn server for a web-project my blog which is not that big the svn repository has a size of 181 mb -- and there are no more than 150 revision or so i ve stopped using svn for that project
mit for example uses python for some programming 101 courses -- and yet most definitely that doesn t turn students off harder languages such as c or even c++ which is harder yet
if you are doing arcgis-server then you can escape arcobjects as their silvelight wpf api is written in c# and seems to have a cleaner api than arcgis engine
although the shebang says korn shell the code is actually ok with bash or even the original system v-ish bourne shell
16-bit quantities must be stored at 16-bit or 2-byte alignment and 32-bit 4 bytes at addresses which are a multiple of 4
the mvccontrib is not compatible with asp.net-mvc 2
i did some tests to find out if it can handle compiled free pascal delphi units and found it easy to implement
if you include the appropriate scala library jar file in the classpath a scala program can be run using java since compiled scala code is the same as compiled java code
depending on what the internal tool spits out each line will always be different and there can be more than five lines
perhaps the mappings for java apps could be written in groovy
not familiar with notepad++ but what i use in vim is
the reason i am bringing this stuff up is because it seems that many people are switching from xml as a datasource to json which makes more sense as a datasource
if someone can change that url and get access to something they shouldn t have access to then it s a security problem and needs to be handled by authentication and authorization
the requests can be sent by ssl http which is very secured
ado.net is better than ado for data access and more options such as the entity-framework data repository blocks linqtosql
an int is some kind of number but it s not guaranteed to match a specific kind of number which could be say double
the parentheses are needed because in c the operators ++ has higher precedence than the unary operators
you may want to consider using jquery timers instead which abstracts away many of the ugly details of settimeout setinterval and makes them easier to use in your code for things like what you are describing
i think using fgetc or getc is a better solution in this case but the other answers are wrong about fscanf in this case
this returns an integer bigger than zero if success and the char value will contain a null-terminated string that points to the executable that launches this file extension
if you really mean unix and not linux i would recommend solaris eclipse does run on solaris and it s much easier to understand than aix
will be called .when the dom is ready for manipulation not .when the entire page has loaded
your r-tree approach is the best approach i know of that s the approach i would choose over quadtree b+ trees or bsp trees as r-tree seem convenient to build in your case
what i am trying to achieve is a layout with some boxes in the main-content area that can be expanded and collapse when the user press either a link in the sidebar or on a header on the box itself
indeed i don t think i ve ever written one that is more than 20 line or so
note trace can only be viewed on debugging mode in flex
what i have thought of so far is that tcp is going to be more reliable than udp and in rmi corba we want network reliability
glib is more temperamental
the problem with this of course is its going to select any of the divs that contain the number 1 and not just the one that only contains 1
if you re using classic asp.net without using any of the server-side controls there s not much of asp.net that you re using -- it s basically classic asp with .net instead of vbscript behind it at that point
i m not a python guy but a quick look indicates they support multiple inheritance which can be used like java interfaces python does not seem to support interfaces
des not to be confused with 3des has 56 bit keys
personally i hate it mainly because methods should for the most part be no more than 10 line of code i hardly ever go over 20
i dunno about .net 4.0 but in pfx june 2008 ctp there is system.threading.tasks.taskmanagerpolicy class which i m using to limit used processor count
there is way more than webforms in asp.net-mvc
examples of such tools can be make ant cmake scons eclipse and visual studio
i used installshield installscript msi project created a feature and for each dll that had to be put in gac created a component with destination global-assembly-cache
here the application needs to be configured after installation such that only users belonging to certain groups can execute the main program or edit the configuration file
finding the handles yourself at runtime is technically possible with reflection
have n front-end processor assigning fep id and job id and network animation frame number to incoming jobs
even if you did encrypt the password if the password is always the same it would be as easy as sniffing packets to figure out what needed to be sent to your server to authenticate
pyqt seems more consistent across different flavors of linux where gtk is constantly changing and breaking on older distributions
templated object types can be namespaced made private-members of a class etc
a 16-bit image will allow the image to be brightened more than an 8bit image because there is more information to start with
write a loop that goes through every element and compares min max values with your arguments
it s a method of any xmlhttprequest object and can be used to set headers on your ajax queries
can fckeditor be integrated with ckeditor
json is an alternative markup to xml that s more compact
boxlayout is far easier than gridbaglayout because you don t have to learn how to specify constraints
should i expect any problems with webbrowser-control if wpf will be deployed as xbap in a browser or it should work straightforwardly
lilypond 340 characters shorter than common-lisp
accessing an item is slower than an arrays since it is a call to operator and a linked-list
accessing an item is slower than an arrays since it is a linked-list linear traversal
the general rule is that anything which is new to html5 is and will be supported by firefox safari chrome webkit and opera
then you have to choose between udp and tcp
no because quicksort is demonstrably better than a bubble-sort in all but a very few set of circumstances involving extremely small datasets
or compare bubble-sort to a selection sort or insertion-sort both o n 2
bubble-sort even may not beat quicksort on small cases
about the security it is more or less as secure as the whole server is but you should make sure your private key is hidden outside the document root of the webserver
in left and right outer join the position of the filter matters much more than inner-join since affects whether it will be applied before join clause or after where clause the join is carried out
primitives that are smaller than 1 cell are padded out primitives larger than 32 bits long and double take 2 cells
since multiplication is more expensive than addition you want to let the machine paralleliz it as much as possible so saving your stalls for the addition means you spend less time waiting in the addition loop than you would in the multiplication loop
as for whether to use xslt or xquery the proof is in the pudding xslt is better at transforms and xquery is better at queries
i edited this to account for when the lookup value is smaller than any of the values in the list
the flwr syntax of xquery is quite intuitive if you have an sql back-ground imo xslt is the more powerful language when dealing with one input one output situations especially if the output will not be xml
if your input is based on more than one xml document you are pretty much stuck with xquery if your output is not xml based you are pretty much stuck with xslt
unless you are using the static typing feature xquery is no more strongly typed than xslt
i just add it to my master page and it will get executed automatically .when the page is ready
it is essentially xml over http
studies have show that the probability of a node going offline within the next hour gets lower the longer it has already been online
even if perl would be faster than php the most would choose php because of the simplicity of php
the error i could not spot was the this where it should have been jquery this in the var id line
for the cross-domain part i would recommend easyxdm
will match line that have as their first two characters and as their last two
however i get the error error cs1611 the params parameter cannot be declared as ref or out
the space between the individual elements can be set using margins 5px
something along the line below is better imho
i need to match elements that contains neither pcdata nor child elements
cryptography is difficult better buy the security solution from experts than doing it yourself
i d advise that the loosely typed settings are older and really should only be used for backwards-compatibility
therefore everything you can do deployment with java respectively speaking swing can be done with swt if you provide the according libraries
jemmy had moved to also it is not depend on netbeans modules so can be used for awt swing swt javafx testing
a resource profile can be used to set limits on all sorts of usage in any particular session - one resource limit available is connection time
this is not perfect either because some of the data is needed in more than one controllers
obviously wpf has a much richer toolkit than silverlight so it may well be that silverlight just isn t an option
wpf has a richer control tree whereas silverlight is a reduced set for compact size
sometimes the uninstall cancellation takes longer that the installation would have
multiplication is far easier and faster for a cpu to do than division
footnote inline python is better code than pyperl and i would suggest using that instead but it only supports having python call back to perl when python is invoked from perl in the first place -- the ability to embed perl into python is listed as a possible future feature but it s been so since 2001 so don t hold your breath
but i can t see that any one set of levels is better than any other
padding on the left can be increased to add spaces that does not get stripped on output
however this will be pricey you can look into a virtual dedicated-server which is cheaper and should allow you to install whatever applications you need
asp.net-mvc is faster than webforms
heap a nodes is bigger than or smaller than all of its children
so its bigger than the default-value
and before binding is applied i want textblock to be collapsed but default-value of visibility property is visible
i ve found solution for wpf but it can t be applied in silverlight
use the python re module to match line
for starters beautifulsoup is no longer actively maintained and the author even recommends alternatives such as lxml
note that this dialog is not available on operating systems older than windows-vista so be sure to check commonfiledialog.isplatformsupported first
windows mobile has fairly easy development with .net compact-framework
php language may appear less complicated than python but you ll do more work to create the site
mysql is not less complicated that postgresql -- they re the same thing
if the user enters value in more than one field then i need to search on all of those field
i ll admit i am pretty new with asp.net programming and i have been asked to take all our gateway pages written in classic asp and make one universal gateway page to the few c# .net applications we have that i wrote
use ajax return a very small page with javascript that will trigger the search which would modify the dom with the results as they are being flushed or make several calls to the search program with a parameter denoting how many results you want and the offset
which mysql server parameters should be tuned in order to minimize the time it takes to add new columns indexes
compared to java python solves same problem in less code and less ways in longer development and vm time where java has more ways solve same problem in more code and faster vm and faster development time
cleaner validation with asp.net-mvc model binders the enterprise library validation application block
while i have no personal experiences with it i ve heard that scala is an even better choice than groovy in many cases
i am not sure how familiar you are with ant but using ant will give you more control over the build-process at the expense of requiring defining the process
while there haven t been any official announcements ms has made it pretty clear that entity framework is the future and that significant enhancements won t be made in linq-to-sql here s a list of what s new in l2s for 4.0
its crazy fast because it s compiled and is quite a bit lower-level has a much smaller api than either php or ruby rails
b use indexes - postgresql has bigger repertoar of indexes then mysql so use it - there are gist gin indexes
thanks for the links guys but i ended up downloading a fresh copy from the website the archive that i had must have been corrupt somehow because i tried using it again and had the same issue
spring roo seams to be very similar to seam just that seam is longer there and more mature
if i was running the shop i would skip the eval and begin by selling them on using ironpython because i think it is a better choice in the long run and python skills can be leveraged on linux unix projects or java projects as well as in .net
on intranet bandwidth isn t a bottleneck old clunky ie javascript engine might be so i d say send generated html even in better browsers native parsing of html fragments should be faster than building dom with javascript
this can realistically differ by a factors of 4 way more than the difference in clock frequency you re likely to encounter
single expects only one row to be returned and throw an exception if there are multiple rows
tcp windowing is more expensive than raw udp but if you use udp to go faster and add a custom loss-recovery or seqno ack resend manager then that may slow you down again
input format could be changed to xml or yaml in adition to json listed above but i am using json within the project and changing format in specific place would not be very good
if you find traditional for loops simpler than next any and all let us know and we ll show how to recode these uses of the higher abstraction forms into those lower-layer concepts
friendinfo contain friendid and some other field relative to friend info which are quine in this table and iteminfo contain the itemid as primary key and friend id as foreign key i want to execute the join query which select value from friendinfo table based on friendid and also select item from iteminfo based on same friendid
i ve used both otool and otx to disassemble various binaries and i ve found the easiest way to edit them is to figure out what the assembly of the new code i want is using nasm or similar then just use a hex editor i prefer hex fiend on the binary file
setup router whatever router you re sitting behind will need to be configured to forwarding port 80 or a development port like 8080 to your local ip address
i m not sure whether this is better than python wsgi like django middleware and there is already ewgi for erlang
if you don t have unmanaged interop needs or don t have to work with a legacy code base then there are few reasons to select c++-cli
do you want the python details spelled out or do you prefer java
especially in customer off-the-shelf applications authentication is generally more naturally handled by the application
once you do fully understand how ajax works by the way you may probably want to move to a javascript-framework that makes it easier such as jquery dojo or google s closure
i d say vb6 is still ok for throw away prototyping and probably better than vb.net in that regard
you re getting the outofmemory because if you declare int 1000 the memory is allocated immediately additionally double take up more space than ints-an int representation will also save you space
memcached has more overhead since you have to use a tcp connection to access it versus just a function call for apc xcache shared objects
but i wouldn t start out denormalization it s more code and arguably premature optimisation
it can be done using bitwise-operators and |
if you prefer phpunit i think you can fairly easily use simpletest s browser from within phpunit
i understand redmine is more of a trac clone but retrospectiva seem to support agile methodologies via a nice plugin
wcf is a bit more evolved than the original web-services offered in .net and has better wse support although asmx can be extended via wse3
furthermore php may be able to produce applications outside of webservers and clis but is definitely aimed at those two environments while python is more all purpose
the code is based on old awt painting techniques which should not be used with swing
if you are willing to pay for a commercial bi solution i would recommend crystal-reports and business-objects
git and svn and mercurial etc is great for version-control but keeping systems in sync often requires more than version-control
perhaps something like c++ would actually be a better example than python for that reason
i vote for quicksort which is more elegant than bubble-sort and easier to understand too
drag drop mechanism is relatively easy with jquery or scriptaculous we use both so i am willing to accept an answer that uses either of these two
no doubts you should go directly to d2010 not to d2009 - in this aspects d2010 is actually more like d2009 sp1 than a fully new version just with some nice additions like an updated rtti
there also appears to be highlighted line along polygon edges
in my experiance with the two postgresql has shown to be faster on most write operations while mysql is slightly faster on the reads
i d walk a person through one relatively simple function with less than ten line of code
i want to loop through this sorted dictionary and change the key to key+1 if the key-value is greater than a certain amount
categories can contain other categories and products and products can belong to more than one category
but it will stop js executing really at any event - so if you have a button which catches mouse move and mouse click - i will not be able to stop on mouse click since script will be stopped at mouse move each time you try to move mouse over this button
i prefer python to perl
however whenever the user lands on a page where we ask for credit card details we want these details to be sent over http
you should be okay with window.open because you re calling it in direct response to a click by the user make sure you re calling it from the event handler or a function called by the event handler not after a settimeout or some such
the conclusion that the authors come to is that expressing at least some of these types of problems in haskell is easier than in prolog primarily because the haskell type system makes it easier to come up with nice representations of search states and moves from state to state
activerecord provides much more functionalities such as translations scoping in queries or support for single-table-inheritance
i want to be notified somehow .when a message is ready in input stream
i m not sure if they re still as pervasive now as they were in years past but they re one of the reasons why internet-explorer is so much less secure than firefox and other browsers
what is a recommended way to import a bunch of constants defined in a c-style not c++ just plain old c .h file into python module so that it can be used in python s part of a project
this is a very common complaint with asp.net webforms and unfortunately there s not much you can do about it
wrap the statement in so it will get called .when the document is ready
obviously this is not optimal code with nested-loops and unnecessary point objects
under each text field there is a php section where you can run some php code to get allowed value
inner-join is the longer version of alex brasetvik s answer
assuming you really want to select elements with a given class which is more correct as there should not be elements with duplicates id and if there are exactly one element with class searchfield for each elements selected by then you can use
since in your example externalfunction is not declare within the scope of the function it is global or at least in whatever scope it may have been defined in outside ready
however i think that you should be able to use linked folder so that you have a eclipse project directory which is basically empty but for a .project file and a linked folder which points to your source tree
maybe it s a good idea to make a separate controllers for each component and then the big form has its own controllers which controls the smaller ones
each nodes can point to the previous and next nodes it is easier to add nodess to the end of a linked-list
the console application code had less than 200 line of code and was basically loading the projectviewmodel and doing operations on it
so if you re going to develop a web app that relies heavily on ajax then webforms may just beat asp.net-mvc
setting local-variables with the locals option is simpler and much more dry than using instance-variables
this will all be done in mobile-safari
btw i concur that udp is far more appropriate than tcp in this case
i would say personally i find foreach a bit more readable over for-loops but you should use the best for the job at hand and not have to write extra long code to include a foreach loop if a for-loop is more appropriate
this line works as a ternary operator because the expression returns 1 or 0 depending on whether var is bigger than 65 or not
this expression will return true equivalent to 1 thus picking retired if the value of var is greater than 65
we have a handful of asp.net pages that include more than 50+ line of javascript specific to that page
if cs has the no pad characteristic then the pad character is an implementation-dependent character different from any character in the character set of x and y that collates less than any string under cs
i find most users prefer keyboard data entry as opposed to mouse click data entry - it is a lot faster
as a purely functional language haskell basically mandates that one program in a declarative functional style so hands-down haskell is more functional than python
depending on your language you should prefer getter-setter up front because you can t introduce them later i m looking at you java if it turns out you do need them
not related to the leak but if you know the length prefer strncpy over strcpy
using the ddms logcat window you can select line and copy and paste text to other windows
it then said folder d projects test will be bound to http mycomputer 443 svn test trunk . then i clicked finished
unlike other propositions pseudo-propositions can not be analyzed into atomicity pictures and their combinations and therefore they are not pictures of the world
i don t know which version of mysql you re running and i m more familiar with sql-server than mysql
the nested-loops solution is definitely faster than parallel query - see edit 4 below
i personally don t believe learning spring and hibernate is worth it unless you have a good job related reason to grails is much easier to use
having to go to memory more often than needed is much more expensive than compares increment or decrement
but with a synchronous call the read data line will only be executed .when putting the data is complete
i m having one text field normally when touch the text field keyboard will appear is it any possibilities where when text field is touch one drop down list will appear to recommend value to be enter and value is selected it will appear in texr field
how we set or get focus on any control in cocoa
i am trying to build a very simple gui with jface and swt - the code is straightforward there s plenty tutorials what it s not so straightforward is that i can t seem to get jface and swt to work outside a plugin project
can anyone pls provide some reasons as to why my iframe that display a report within it shows a horizontal scrollbar even though the width of the report within it seems to be smaller than the width of the iframe
be precise on margins width left alignement .
it s yet another ie6 7 idiosyncrasy but one of my web pages needs to be loaded using http
was can be configured for remote-debugging via the web administration console
fclose will flush any unwritten output via fflush before returning so the error results from the underlying write won t be reported at fwrite or fprintf time but when you do the fclose
.net is used for more than just asp.net
may be slower than functor methods for callback that can be statically computed at compile-time
another alternative is boost-asio which is more complicated
i am not able to purchase expression-blend and am looking for a stand-alone xaml designer that i can use to help me when designing wpf controls
i will be using a message passing architecture to communication between my java components and i d like to efficiently match messages to actions
unless you need to access its value after the for-loop ends leave the variable inside loops it will be closer to the code that uses it your code will be more readable and its scope will be bounded by loops itself your code will be more elegant and less bug-prone
i am developing an application for undergrads and i was looking for something less complex than latex and easier to write than mathml
functions should be as short as possible - as a general rule of thumb i will go back and see if it is practical to refactor any function longer than 20 line
personally i prefer erd diagram for databaser data models
there are more than 10000 line in this file
this can be fixed by restart visual studio but restart my entire ide after every run cycle is not exactly conducive to a great coding environment
for most data types optimal sorting algorhitm is o n log n but keep in mind that some structures are still slower for instance sorting linked-list is slower than arrays athough both have n log n complexity
this object may be composed of getter and setter but it is a model of a student and would thus be extremely useful in a database system
my array larger than max height width but not max height max width
also regarding code like this will compile given a final modifiers on x
anyone who thinks myisam is faster is either not tuning innodb correctly or has such small data that who cares
when the switching gets bigger than a couple of screens full split it into functions that handle each state using a state table to look up the function directly
i ve completely replaced my server side processing data crunching that would previously be written in java with scala
but i don t want to use oracle and want better performance than mysql
while it could be done in asp.net in .net 2.0 it just isn t practical given the amount of work involved and the fact that it s already done for you in a later version of the framework
although in reality i find it hard to imagine the memmove could be faster than memcpy i don t discount the possibility
for this particular use is there any reason why java would be more cumbersome than groovy or beanshell
unless something has changed a lot with 2010 the basic vsts install is more or less the same as the pro version of vs - and then you install the team explorer on top to gain the tfs specific client-side extensions
if it comes to understand a programming-language it is about the programming-language not about understanding now to configure an ide and the turbo-c compiler is as good as visual-c++ for learning the language caveat not for production code
just remember that you re actually working with a multiple selected element that is just displayed as a bunch of checkbox which is imo better because of the usability
from the way that the application happens to be loaded into memory it may be that the 32-bit app on 32-bit windows and the 64bit app on 64bit windows get lucky no important memory locations are overwritten whereas the 32-bit app on 64bit windows is less lucky and crashes
something like asp.net webforms or jsf although jsf is not as bad as webforms
4 is nvidia cuda technology is easier more flexible than ati brook+ language
inside the function that pointers would be typecast to stack object type then used in
this is one area where you may want to consider an abstract base class - there you can create protected abstract methods which inheritors can implements without exposing them to external callers
also thought of dfs traversal of the dom tree but again all xpath evaluators seem to return detached nodes where node.getparent will always return null
how can i set width and height of a jface listviewer
personally - i prefer asp.net-mvc framework and don t want to go back despite that in some cases it does take more work - implementation of custom pagination which can be easily made way more sophisticated than one that pagination control provides
the expectation of my framework is that you ll pass in the imodule s so it can easily be used in asp.net-mvc webforms etc
i haven t benchmarked any of this code but just by examining the code you can see that using integers division by 2 is shorter than multiplication by 2
drop in an .htaccess file to refuse connections from anyone but you and your client s ip and use this to make changes until the updates are ready to be pushed live
if you find yourself fighting the unit test model with webforms you will find things easier with asp.net-mvc
i think this can cause minor problems if there are more than a few people working on the same project but for personal projects i find dropbox to be even better than github if only for the fact that pushing pulling is faster
i d imagine browsers assume cookies set via https shouldn t be transferred over http as they may be sensitive data
edit now the op s getting an error for trying to call this function in line 9 since this function definition is more than 9 lines it s probably getting called from module top-level rather than from within another function before it s defined in which case the simple fix is to call it only after it s defined
i am setting it up so that the public facing pages will be html from asp.net-mvc but the administration portion will be a silverlight navigation application using using wcf ria services for data access
in a yellow pages directory that non-technical people use who don t browse there every day and a structure is essential for carefully navigating towards the sought after branch or business tags could be counter-productive and the application far better off with category
++ can be used as post-increment operator like in your example or it could be used as a pre-increment operator if used before variable
linq-to-dataset makes it easier and
adding tabitems manually will create new control for every item and in selected area different elements will appear based on selection
in particular it will throw an exception if the file doesn t exist the first two line have inappropriate data or there are less than two line
on intel the program can be compiled to 32-bit i386 and 64bit x86_64 versions
also for the great simplicity of handling local revision mercurial is much simpler to setup use than svn as simple as hg init hg add hg commit
of course it is 10 because the addition operator has a lower precedence than the multiplication operator and so 4 + 3 2 always means 4 + 3 2
there s not a lot of data more than 10000 line in the previously mentioned table in the database so i guess performance was not that important
someone just told me that innodb is much better than myisam
imho you should always prefer innodb over myisam because of the transactional support which is at the heart of every relational database system
myisam is fast but may get currupted easily innodb is slow but is more stable thanks to transactions and foreign keys
i do this all the time because i prefer innodb for the fks but i sometimes need myisam for the full-text search
by doing this the dialog is not dependent on any other windows files and can be run in winpe 2.0
