junit	testng	junit	unitils	junit	easymock	testng	unitils	testng	easymock	easymock	unitils
pattern7	
but i would recommend unitils a great wrapper for junit testng dbunit easymock regardless of which route you take

9788
subtraction	addition
pattern5	
additionally while reads and writes are atomic there is a race condition with addition subtraction and incrementing and decrementing primitive types since they must be read operated on and rewritten

10232
ant	maven
pattern6	
they do a great job for us and i would highly recommend using maven over ant

12586
rss	feed
pattern7	
the rss brand very much defines the entire feed category though so on the rare occasion that someone does know enough to choose they will tend to choose rss because it s got the name. they will also tend to choose rss 2.0 because it s got the bigger number

12586
rss	feed
pattern7

to go along with what everyone here is saying i use hashtab when i need to generate compare md5 and sha1 hash on windows

25701
jdom	xom
pattern7	
i ve worked with jdom as well and there s absolutely nothing wrong with it although i do prefer xom

27440
postgresql	mysql
pattern7	
better performance can be bought with more ram and cpu and more appropriate database design and clever stored procedure tricks and so on - and all of that is cheaper and easier for random-website-x than agonizing over which to pick mysql or postgresql and specialist tuning from expensive dbas

27529
postgresql	mysql
pattern7	
hard to compare mysql and postgresql

34295
emacs	aquamacs
pattern7	
if it is emacs you want i would recommend aquamacs more mac-like or carbon emacs more gnu-emacs-like

34474
phpunit	simpletest

i prefer phpunit now but when i started out i used simpletest as i didn t always have access to the command line

34566
equals	gethashcode
pattern5	
if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value

34566

37162
portrait	landscape
pattern7	
web browser print dialogs default to portrait so for every print job the user has to manually select landscape

44638
merb	ruby-on-rails
pattern7	
ok ruby-on-rails is actually pretty good but there is just a little bit too much magic going on in there from the ruby world i would much prefer merb to ruby-on-rails

54817
invalidoperationexception	argumentexception
pattern7	
this seems like an object state invalid scenario to me so i d pick invalidoperationexception over argumentexception the parameters are valid but not at this point in the objects life

54817
invalidoperationexception	argumentexception
pattern5	
this seems like an object state invalid scenario to me so i d pick invalidoperationexception over argumentexception the parameters are valid but not at this point in the objects life

memcached	apc
pattern7	
i would recommend memcached or apc

60137
ubuntu	debian
pattern7	
i haven t decided which one yet but my understanding is that they ll give me a base os install i d prefer debian or ubuntu an ip address a root account ssh and that s about it

62220
postgresql	mysql
pattern7	
however the observation of database-locking stands - if you have particularly onerous updates sqlite performance won t match mysql or postgresql

64644
vim	emacs
pattern7	
i don t think you would want to wait 10 seconds for your text editor to become ready ...if you are going to spend some serious time coding then spend some time and learn to use vim emacs too but i recommend vim

70375
equals	gethashcode
pattern5	
if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value

84239
distance	polygons
pattern7	
for each vertex in the red polygons compute the distance to each vertex in the blue polygons and find the closest hint compare distance 2 so you don t need the sqrt

84974
union	distinct
pattern7	
in most cases what you really want to say is union all as it does not do duplicate elimination think select distinct between sets which can result in quite a bit of savings in terms of execution time

85414
vmware	virtualbox
pattern5	
i ve been using vmware for a while and am very happy with it but i would like to compare it with virtualbox

87006
cvs	svn	accurev	cvs	accurev	svn
pattern7	
i ve used svn cvs clearcase base ucm ccc harvest but none of them can beat accurev s strengths

88100

for instance if a preference picks tcp versus udp have your conditional instantiate a tcpprovider or udpprovider which the rest of your code uses with minimal muss or fuss

91149
jboss	glassfish
pattern7	
i would choose jboss or glassfish for a start

95821

i see that it supposedly beats erb and eruby now.

113331
wxpython	pyqt
pattern7	
wxpython has a very good demo and it can do pretty much anything which pyqt can do i would anyday prefer pyqt but it may bot be free for commercial purpose but wxpython is free and is decent cross platform library

pattern7	
select profiling from the product menu in xcode 6 to launch apple s instrumentation tool

146871
lisp	scheme

cvs	svn
pattern7	
seriously why would you prefer cvs to svn

161559
cvs	svn
pattern5	
nowadays i prefer git over svn but it takes a while to get over the threshold if you come from cvs svn land

162047
int	chars
pattern7	
then you need a function called int scanback const chars s const chars matches int start which starts at start goes down to z as long as the chars being scanned at s id contained in matches return the last index where a match is found

162785
post	put
pattern6	
you could put the text into an invisible span and read that spans width but basicly this looks like someone trying to sabotage your site and therefore i would recommend banning post with words longer than a certain lenth for example 30 characters without spaces allowing links to be longer

162991
swt	swing
pattern7	
i will probably choose swt swing or qtjambi for the ui controls but i am wondering what to do with the graphical part of the simulation

167539
getdate	dateadd
pattern7	
select dateadd dd 1 getdate will return a current date + 1 day

167922
mouse	keyboard
pattern7	
the net effect of this was that it was very difficult to get two machines to boot up and work on the kvm switch and the switch would lose keyboard or mouse input on one or both machines every few days

171958
merb	ruby-on-rails
pattern7	
i personally prefer merb over ruby-on-rails as it adopts more ruby conventions

171958

177532
verilog	vhdl
pattern7	
do you prefer vhdl or verilog and why

178555
verilog	vhdl	verilog	hdl
pattern7	
once you re ready to choose an hdl i heartily recommend verilog having learned vhdl first

179294
post	get
pattern7	
further i recommend to use post wherever possible avoid using get for form submits - if some users want to simulate a form submit via get make sure your application supports the desired parameters either via post or via get but when you submit the page yourself via a button or js prefer post over get

pattern7	
i find it most disturbing to see so few people around here are actually using maven or at least ant though i prefer maven for the dependency handling.

186645
perforce	svn
pattern7	
i would certainly recommend perforce for a number of reasons already covered in other answers but i m not in a position to offer a comparison with svn having never really used it

192156
coalesce	isnull
pattern7	
other rdbms would prefer coalesce instead of isnull

194197
lxml	elementtree
pattern7	
i actually prefer lxml as it has api like elementtree but has also nice additional features and performs well

194489
xstream	xom
pattern6	
if you decide to roll your own xml configuration i d recommend using xstream with customized serialization options or if you just need to parse some xml take a look at xom

195398
postgresql	mysql
pattern7	
at the load levels where postgresql s better locks overtake mysql s other parts of your platform could be the bottlenecks

195415
postgresql	mysql
pattern5	
you could then compare these with mysql and postgresql

197210
mouse	keyboard
pattern7	
this will not remove the key binding from vmware but you could set the option to grab keyboard and mouse intput on key press in the vmware preferences

199835
vim	emacs
pattern7	
rather like editors do you prefer vim or emacs choice of shell is partly a question of familiarity and partly a question of preference

csla	.net
pattern7	
i would recommend csla .net by rockford lhotka

204778

270764
xsl-fo	xslt
pattern7

288440
salt	md5
pattern7	
get md5 js implementation and compare salt

289841
inherited	properties
pattern7	
to access those properties or methods i need to make them public which defeats encapsulation or re-write them into my class which defeats inherited

291267
lisp	scheme
pattern6	
if you re shaky on recursion at all i highly recommend learning scheme or lisp

294103
bazaar	git	bazaar	svn
pattern7	
i worked on a project for one place that were forced to use a locking system and opted to use no control at all so i set up a secret svn branch even though i much prefer bazaar or git

298978
lxml	libxml2	lxml	libxslt	libxml2	libxslt
pattern7	
gimel and tim recommend lxml which is a nicely pythonic binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries

303480
kate	kde
pattern7	
i recommend kate part of kde as an editor

323429
trac	bugzilla
pattern7

323893
mantis	bugzilla
pattern7	
i ve used bugzilla and mantis but i prefer mantis simplicity

324355
lxml	libxml2
pattern7	
but i prefer libxml2 and lxml for python because it seems to be more actively developed and tested

union	distinct
pattern7	
as other users said union is used to select distinct values from two tables

329742
vim	emacs
pattern7	
as for an editor if you like cli stuff then emacs or vim is the way to go i prefer emacs

330657
post	get
pattern6	
security wise i prefer using post than get as it gives at least some opaqueness as to what is being passed as a parameter and not anyone can just edit the url and play around

330918
min	max
pattern7	
does hibernate hql queries support using select min max count and other sql functions

338537
config	ini
pattern7

348548
codeigniter	kohana
pattern5	
i prefer kohana over codeigniter ymmv

354420

listview	gridview	gridview	detailsview
pattern5	
personally i prefer listview over gridview and detailsview if possible it gives you more control over your html

356602
innodb	myisam
pattern7	
if your application generates a lot of updates you ll prefer innodb storage engine which allows to lock only one row when updating vs all the table on myisam

361372
moq	typemock
pattern7	
so far i found that we can buy typemock to mock the sharepoint objects and then use any free mocking framework moq

369779
entity-relationship	diagram
pattern6	
well a picture tells a thousand words so i would recommend creating entity-relationship diagram where you can view the relationship between tables at a glance something that is hard to do with a text-only description

380757
redmine	trac
pattern7	
i d recommend redmine like the other posters as it is more complete than trac

384083
googletest	cppunit
pattern5	
i prefer cruisecontrol.net with cppunit but i don t have any experience or knowledge of the googletest framework

389824
innodb	myisam
pattern5	
innodb wins over myisam frequently enough that it s clearly not possible to say one is faster than the other

396601
ienumerable	ilist
pattern5	
i would choose between ilist and ienumerable and wouldn t consider array at all

396838
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
pattern7	
you may prefer firefox opera safari because it s safer technologically superior or whatever but you may lose several users that way remember firefox has only recently reached 20 of usage share

404634
freemarker	velocity
pattern7	
i actually slightly prefer freemarker to velocity just in case you re open to exploring other options

406323
google-chrome	safari
pattern7	
in this benchmark safari 3.1 2 actually beats google-chrome despite having a js engine that is clearly much much slower this is basically due to more efficient bindings between jsc webcore the dom rendering etc of webkit and v8 webcore

408853
vim	gedit
pattern7	
normal people prefer gedit instead of vim

411994
postgresql	mysql

google-chrome	firefox
pattern5	
currently there s somewhat of an arms race between google-chrome firefox and webkit s javascript interpreters which has really improved the speed situation with javascript

439818
postgresql	mysql
pattern5	
i have never used postgresql myself but i think it s mostly a matter of taste whether you prefer it over mysql

446962
ati	nvidia
pattern7	
are there any third-party reports that compare ati s stream framework to nvidia s cuda framework ie not from ati or nvidia talking themselves up

448892
mp3	flv
pattern6	
i would recommend using mp3 audio and flash using the free jw flv media player which should do everything that you want except for the low high quality thing but maybe you can just use two players if you need

getdate	dateadd
pattern7	
select dateadd d getdate 8 - dow getdate

456500
freemarker	velocity
pattern7	
i prefer freemarker here over velocity

460360

i also choose grails over simplicity and there are lots of java lib such as jasper report jawr etc and i am glad that now they join with springsource which makes their base solid

462567
equals	gethashcode
pattern5	
if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object

462722
textwrangler	bbedit
pattern7

463954
firefox	safari
pattern7	
firefox is just better for web development and i prefer safari overall

466508
inherited	subclassing
pattern7	
if you still want to favor inherited without necessarily thinking in terms of base class and subclassing you can simply define an interface ex

467418
int	double	int	boolean
pattern7	
the surprising thing is that a single matlab data type may match different java data types logical matches boolean byte short int long float and double in that order of precedence

467696
vmware	virtualbox
pattern7	
it was developed with only various versions of windows in mind and from my experience there s always some sort of problem running any linux distro under it. i would recommend vmware as suggested above or alternatively virtualbox which has worked very well for me in the past it runs certain linux distros best though i can t remember which ones

468724
equals	gethashcode
pattern5	
if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value

471804
rss	feed
pattern7	
i have used it for several years to grab rss feed

475026
crypt	hash
pattern7	
also instead of using crypt you may prefer hash because this allows you to keep the string setting for the hash algorithm elsewhere

476792
cvs	svn
pattern7	
i would recommend svn over cvs although distributed version tracking tools like git and mercurial seem to be very popular among open source projects

476792

480067
ftgl	freetype

id recommend ftgl as already recommended above however i have implemented a freetype opengl renderer myself and thought you might find the code handy if you want reinvent this wheel yourself

491263
union	distinct
pattern7	
depending on the number of rows returned you may be best using union all on the selects with a select distinct query around it

492954
hash	salt

493221
codeigniter	cakephp
pattern7

pattern7	
however dockpaneleftof does not seem to work in this case so you lose docking toolbar next to each other

497967
quicksort	mergesort
pattern7	
i actually just wrote a linked-list comparative sort demo program in c and arrived at a similar conclusion that mergesort will beat quicksort for most uses altho i have been told that quicksort is generally not used for linked lists anyway

500622
komodo	notepad++
pattern5	
if i had to choose between notepad++ and komodo i would choose pyscripter

502658
vim	jedit
pattern7	
personally i would recommend jedit rather than vim

502970
calloc	malloc
pattern7	
just this feature alone would be enough for me to prefer calloc to malloc

503943
bazaar	git
pattern7	
as an alternative to git which has already been mentioned i would highly recommend bazaar

505901
vb.net	vb6
pattern7	
if you want to learn more about tdd and unit testing you should apply it to functions or procedures in vb6 -- although i d recommend vb.net or c# and doing object-oriented development

515501
union	distinct
pattern7	
so there is no need to use select distinct combined with a union

518893
vim	emacs
pattern7	
i am capable of using vim in a pinch but i really prefer emacs

522537
goto	break

a much simpler way of inspecting the code in msvc is to simply set a break point and inspect the disassembly right click on the line and select goto disassembly from the pop-up menu

522964
gif	png	tiff	png
pattern7	
other than that it s up to the uses of the images quality compression etc. in terms of whether you choose png gif jpeg tiff etc

525029
backtracking	greedy
pattern7	
it doesn t show how to do greedy nongreedy matches backtracking matching within a line instead of the whole line and other more esoteric features of state machines that are easily handled by the re syntax

526337
lisp	scheme
pattern7	
ever since reading what paul graham has to say about lisp i ve been intending to go back and pick scheme up again and see if it ll improve my programming in general

534243
crypto++	libtomcrypt
pattern7	
i can recommend crypto++ or libtomcrypt for that

548271
getter	setter
pattern6	
you can create all the variables then right-click in the editor go to source and then pick generate setter getter

pattern7	
if what you want is to compare activerecord rails and datamapper hibernate the data source architectural patterns chapter from patterns of enterprise application architecture is a good place to start

570223
postgresql	mysql
pattern7	
i also greatly prefer postgresql but i think if you re planning to use other peoples php applications forums blogs etc it s just a reality that you re probably going to have to run mysql to support them

572622
ubuntu	debian
pattern7	
i highly recommend debian or ubuntu server for domain-0

575934
opera	firefox
pattern7	
most of opera s features are eventually available copied to firefox as plugins but i still prefer opera at home because the text looks better

595351
stateless	stateful
pattern7	
one thing i ve learned over the years is that stateless trumps stateful for maintainability

595693
for-loop	loops
pattern7	
i would choose for-loop when there is known number maximum number of iterations before loops starts

598774
ant	maven
pattern7	
there are plenty of articles on the net that compare ant and maven so you can look at those but from my experience its always worthwhile to consider how you can improve a project

599070
maven	pom.xml	ant	pom.xml	ant	maven
pattern6	
if your long term goal is to migrate to using maven to manage the entire build process which one might intend to do for new greenfield projects then i heartily recommend using maven pom.xml files to manage dependencies on behalf of ant build.xml files

600969
system.data.oracleclient	odp.net
pattern7	
personally i prefer odp.net but system.data.oracleclient will get the job done

scratch be as close to just a text-editor as possible i use gedit for everything and i d recommend aptana in a heart-beat

1320978
erlang	ocaml
pattern5	
ocaml is a great language -- one of my favorites -- but if your interest is distributed systems than i d recommend going with erlang which is head and shoulders ahead of the other fp languages with regards to distributed systems although there s an offshoot of ocaml called jocaml which has some interesting aspects

pattern7	
first-class-functions functional match lambda libraries

1390035
pexpect	subprocess

pattern5	
i have tried the following select with union distinct but the problem is that the limit 0 10 applies to the whole result set

1418229
quicksort	mergesort
pattern7	
be aware of the real-world impact of the so-called hidden constants too - for instance the classic quicksort algorithm is o n 2 in the worst case and o n log n on average whereas mergesort is o n log n in the worst case but quicksort will outperform mergesort in practice

1422299
macvim	textmate
pattern7	
i would recommend textmate as above and also macvim if possible

1432559
hash	salt
pattern7	
compare salt hash input with stored data to check a password

pattern7	
i prefer dom4j personally but i don t mind other apis such as jdom or even xpp3 which has xpath support

1445294

i guess the question is then why does the compiler choose int instead of double in the first example

1450896

1453713

1469813
apache	lighttpd

e.g select dateadd hh -1 getdate

1487773
nunit	mstest
pattern7

1500490
maven	m2e
pattern6	
i recommend using maven eclipse and m2e

1514244
udp	tcp
pattern7	
theoretically udp should be be 30-50 faster than tcp because it s missing the extra trip for the ack and has a smaller header overhead however in reality there are many cases where tcp would outperform udp just because of congestion control

1517591
ant	maven
pattern7	
instead you should use an external dependency management system such as maven or ivy ivy works if you use ant but maven is both a build tool and a dependency management system so i would recommend maven if you can

1522558
min	max
pattern7	
select min p1.start_time max p2.end_time p1.partition p2.partition

1526793
stateless	stateful

1527694
portrait	landscape
pattern7	
when user selects landscape printing from print setup it is printer in portrait again anyway

1529981
portrait	landscape
pattern7	
but this code give portrait even if i select landscape from setup

1592749
ant	maven
pattern5	
i prefer ant over maven personally

1599461

pattern7	
this actually works fine on mac win firefox safari but on ie6 and ie8 only the first element grabbed by the selector displays the desired behavior

1618019
vim	emacs
pattern6	
i don t know about emacs but i would recommend learning vim for a beginner in a heartbeat

1627072

1633894
postgresql	mysql
pattern5	
if i had to support a huge number users on a reasonably simple application and had the team to build a heavily partitioned and replicated database with eventual consistency i d pick mysql over postgresql for the low level data storage building block

1638861
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
pattern7	
i personally prefer git but some people find svn simpler to use and some people like mercuiral bazaar or darcs

1641091
free	malloc
pattern7	
you also have to ensure that you do not destroy free the old block if the malloc fails - you just return 0

1644071
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
pattern7	
i ve used this in ff2 ff3 ff3.5 safari 4 win opera 9+ google-chrome 2 google-chrome 3 and they all work

1645112
calloc	malloc	memset	calloc	memset	malloc
pattern6	
your core graphics surface should be cleared to all zeroes before you render to it so i recommend using calloc instead of malloc or adding a memset after the malloc

1648619
nexus	artifactory
pattern5	
i can clearly state that while nexus is very simple and operative though i sometimes have problems with the installation process on ubuntu its free version cannot compete with artifactory s community free edition

1650091
int	double
pattern7	
so the question what s the best way to compare double and int

1657538

third i d recommend using junit 4.4 or better yet the testng idiom - annotations

1706281
strcpy	strncpy
pattern7	
usually when people use strncpy they forget to do this which is why i recommend strcpy

1709198
min	max
pattern7	
if this is the case the query could be modified to choose max min etc.

1713083
hex	binary
pattern7	
the biggest problem we ran into was constantly annoyingly having binary data show up in the console everytime you type select you hear a million beeps and you have to always do select hex or insert unhex which is a pain

1722180
innodb	myisam
pattern6	
you should use innodb in such scenarios and most mysql gurus recommend using innodb by default anyway because it s considered more generally reliable than myisam despite being slower under some use cases

1722910
bottle	turbogears
pattern7	
i strongly recommend turbogears or bottle

1723888
aptana	rubymine
pattern7	
if you need an ide i personally recommend rubymine although aptana is a worthy offering as well and free

1725999
versioning	upgrade
pattern7	
strongly recommend upgrade your versioning of memcached

1727859
gdi	directwrite	gdi	direct2d	directwrite	direct2d

i recommend direct2d and directwrite as you get high-quality rendering that s also ridiculously fast compared to either gdi or anything done in the .net space

1729502
phpunit	simpletest
pattern7	
i would recommend phpunit for your testing as it seems to be the most complete package for php imho many are fans of simpletest as well .

1730317
innodb	myisam
pattern5	
if you ve tuned innodb properly for your server and are running proper server-grade hardware innodb should be able to compete with myisam on most queries excluding full table scans but you re not doing many of those right

1737864
pylons	turbogears
pattern7	
others prefer turbogears and or pylons maybe bfg maybe grok maybe zope maybe plone

1746488
apache	nginx

1758133
width	height
pattern7	
var jscommand string window.open win height 200 width 300 toolbar no scrollbars yes

1760867
public	protected

1765712
spaces	delimiter
pattern7	
i prefer spaces delimiter since it works nice with unix text tools and with excel

1769850
min	max
pattern7	
otherwise you couldn t have results for things like select min col1 max col1 .

1779317
apache	lighttpd
pattern6	
long polling that s the way i ll choose using lighttpd under apache to load static files images css js etc.. and just for this type of long-polling

1790008
put	get
pattern7	
just to get closer to the solution write a javahelp.bat or .cmd if you prefer put it on the path and call that from ruby

1790470
jdom	dom4j	jdom	xom	dom4j	xom
pattern7	
there are at least 3 different ways to implement the xml-wrapping part sax xslt and xml libraries like jdom dom4j and xom--i prefer xom but any of them will work

1792196
int	chars

the rails framework is a great setup for doing web development and i would highly recommend radrails as your ide or it s base aptana

1810501
strtol	atoi
pattern7	
also atoi doesn t provide any way to detect errors so prefer strtol and similar functions

1811607
profiling	instrumentation
pattern6	
i recommend using instrumentation performance profiling tool that is bundled with xcode and the developer tools

1813665
postgresql	mysql
pattern5	
i would still recommend checking out postgresql and postgis in comparison to mysql if you intend to do more complex queries in the foreseeable future

1816406
ant	maven
pattern7	
but instead of ant i d choose maven because it will require less work imho and it has a built-in feature called profiles that is perfect to manage environment specific stuff like here

1817949
apache-fop	xhtml
pattern6	
given that xhtml is an extension from xml i d recommend using apache-fop

1819246
hide	show
pattern7	
right-click the cell with the comment and choose show hide comment might do the trick

1825371
udp	tcp
pattern7

1826333
union	distinct
pattern7	
a union essentially performs a select distinct so that it can remove duplicate records

1827397
colorbox	simplemodal
pattern7	
simplemodal has a similar function but i much prefer colorbox s implementation and documentation otherwise i d use the latter

1835023
mako	genshi
pattern5	
or you can choose between mako genshi jinja2 or whatever you like for your templates

1835614
union	distinct
pattern7	
also if you use union all it will be faster if the result you want is all of the rows as opposed to distinct rows and you can still grab distinct rows by selecting distinct from the view if you need it sometimes

1839558
button	checkbox
pattern7	
as i have check box in gridview if i dont select any one checkbox and if i click asp button then i have to show message to user to select checkbox

1840999
postgresql	mysql
pattern7	
the biggest reason why i recommend postgresql to people who have more oracle mssql experience as opposed to mysql is that the sql syntaxes and general feel of the database engine match pretty closely

1847205
switching	screens
pattern7	
the advantage of this dual-natured solution is that the tabbed approach will work the way you want it to work for the majority of cases but for users with say two screens or who prefer switching between browser tabs they will still have the flexibility to work in multi-window mode

1849303
pascal	delphi
pattern7	
i prefer delphi pascal but i can read other languages if the example isn t overly complex

1856019

maven	m2e
pattern7	
once you do that open up the console view and select maven console you should see m2e printing out log messages detailing the index download

1880342

1889564
georss	kml
pattern7	
the amount of data will vary depending on whether you choose kml or json or georss but if you end up with 20 bytes per line segment that would take 50 seconds to fetch on a 1 megabit broadband connection

1892562
hindi	tamil	hindi	french
pattern5	
i have a doubt is it possible to give text other than english in my latest project i need to support hindi tamil and french so if user selects language as hindi or tamil or french so what ever value the user is giving in the textbox it must be displayed in the corresponding language selected

1897818
unix	solaris	unix	aix	solaris	aix
pattern7	
if you really mean unix and not linux i would recommend solaris eclipse does run on solaris and it s much easier to understand than aix

1897910
r-tree	quadtree
pattern5	
your r-tree approach is the best approach i know of that s the approach i would choose over quadtree b+ trees or bsp trees as r-tree seem convenient to build in your case

1902994
min	max
pattern7	
write a loop that goes through every element and compares min max values with your arguments

1906226
udp	tcp

eurekalog	madexcept
pattern7	
how would you compare madexcept to eurekalog as an exception handler for your delphi application

1932229
hex	binary
pattern7	
i ve used both otool and otx to disassemble various binaries and i ve found the easiest way to edit them is to figure out what the assembly of the new code i want is using nasm or similar then just use a hex editor i prefer hex fiend on the binary file

1935994
phpunit	simpletest
pattern7	
if you prefer phpunit i think you can fairly easily use simpletest s browser from within phpunit

1948765
mouse	keyboard
pattern7	
i find most users prefer keyboard data entry as opposed to mouse click data entry - it is a lot faster

1949361
getter	setter
pattern7	
depending on your language you should prefer getter setter up front because you can t introduce them later i m looking at you java if it turns out you do need them

1949368
strcpy	strncpy
pattern7	
not related to the leak but if you know the length prefer strncpy over strcpy

1949368

grab redmine or trac and take on the challenge of getting everyone to standardize

1961894
maven	m2e
pattern7	
this has worked tremendously well and doesn t require any additional support or plugins from any of ides out there which is a great plus - number two reason we didn t choose maven was seeing how m2e basically took over eclipse

1964701
atomikos	bitronix
pattern7	
personally i d choose bitronix or atomikos

1967549
launch4j	jsmooth
pattern7	
launch4j - no new development in over a year supports 64 bit but you can t sign the exe created by launch4j so i prefer jsmooth but it does not support 64 bit

1970176
innodb	myisam
pattern7	
imho you should always prefer innodb over myisam because of the transactional support which is at the heart of every relational database system

also you might take the time to compare postgresql and see if there is something about it that meets your needs as well or better than mysql

2003818
hash	md5
pattern7	
however to answer your original question there is really is no way to compare md5 or any hash against any type of encryption

2006698
swt	swing
pattern5	
if your only goal is to let users choose between swt or swing drawing their ui then swtswing would have been an option

2019939
django	web2py
pattern7	
i think i prefer web2py because it does more for me that i don t have to do but from the pov of say java frameworks django and web2py may as well be the same thing

so i d prefer public or package protected

2023431
public	protected
pattern7	
do prefer protected accessibility over public accessibility for virtual members

2025883
ubuntu	linux
pattern7	
hard to beat ubuntu though i personally use mostly macs that s because mac os x still offers a superior laptop experience and my personal machines are mostly laptops by now -- my workstation at work does run ubuntu -- though i m pretty sure other modern linux distros would be shoulder and shoulder with it

2034228
int	chars
pattern7	
most importantly you would pick int or chars at the language level depending on whether you wanted to treat the variable as a number or a letter to switch you would need to cast to the other type

if you are doing more than three points however i would strongly recommend using interpolation as using guassian elimination scales incredibly poorly o n 3 and splines or another interpolation technique are less likely to fail

2083832
g++	gcc
pattern7	
compare gcc -v file.cpp gcc can work with c++ files and g++ -v file.cpp to see the difference in linker commands that often causes the first to fail for example

springsource	grails
pattern7	
then in springsource tool suite right-click your project and select grails tools - refresh dependencies

2126531
appfuse	spring	wicket	appfuse
pattern7	
so while you can compare spring web flow + spring and wicket + spring the later combo doesn t offer anything comparable to roo out of the box maybe appfuse or appfuse light but you didn t mention them and they are third-party projects

also the regexp only matches tinyint bigint int long and varchar as an example to get you started

2165195
ant	maven
pattern6	
i don t know exactly how your sources are structured under jdeveloper but you best option here to automate the packaging and the deployment of this ear is imo to use ant or maven but if all this is totally new for you i would recommend using ant

2167978
tinyint	boolean
pattern6	
the mysql documentation recommends using tinyint 1 for boolean values so tinyint 1 is probably the best

2171608
prng	random
pattern7	
sqlite contains a high-quality pseudo-random number generator prng used to select random rowids when inserting new records into a table that already uses the largest possible rowid

2172507

we have a list in particular that works on every other browser ie 7 8 firefox 3.0.13 linux and 3.5.7 win mac opera win google-chrome 4.0.249.30 linux and 4.0.249.78 win safari win and mac

2211122

also as sellibitze says an operator is needed to compare key in case of hash-collision

2215853
wadl	wsdl
pattern5	
wsdl 2.0 can be used to describe rest web services and thus competes with wadl

2215853
wadl	wsdl
pattern5	
so while wsdl 2.0 competes with wadl as rest web service description languages wdl 2.0 has more but lets forget that for now xrd is a metadata discovery format for any uri openid discovery being one of the primary use case

2225102
getter	setter
pattern6	
although i much prefer specified getter setter for each property whether that s a proxy to a generalized or not

haskell and f# are statically typed which is a big advantage for real-life projects but imho they have a little too much syntax and are not as easy to pick up as scheme

2248328
put	get
pattern7	
if generated by the matches for this regex was not the whole capture - then a single-call replace would not be possible - and your question would probably be asking why doesn t the whole match get put into instead of the other way round

2254734
javassist	cglib
pattern5	
another similar example is hibernate that lets you choose between cglib and javassist in hibernate-core in the same way

2256282

pattern6	
i would recommend using git bazaar or another vcs which doesn t require you to tell it when you move sources around

2273770
post	get
pattern7	
jsf favors post requests but you can still use get if you want -- it depends on your need and if the page needs to be bookmarkable

2275121

pattern7	
note this example also demonstrates that it is not safe to use select max id +1 or select min id -1 as the next available unique value if we do it under concurrency

2275121
min	max
pattern7	
note this example also demonstrates that it is not safe to use select max id +1 or select min id -1 as the next available unique value if we do it under concurrency

2277387

2354091
udp	tcp
pattern5

2369906
sum	coalesce

coalesce select sum other_field from other_table where ... 0 as p3

2380391

i would also recommend mbunit which has all of nunit s features along with some good support for the integration tests that you will probably be writing by accident as you are starting out with testing

2382565
union	distinct
pattern7	
note in my version of sql union queries automatically select distinct records so the distinct flag isn t needed

2382662
getter	setter
pattern6	
so i think he has a point and it is this every time you press choose generate getter setter in eclipse or your ide of choice you should take a step back and wonder what you are doing

2383447

pattern7	
i prefer charles but any web debugging proxy fiddler included should help out

hide	show
pattern7	
would i just have different user controls for each page and create show and destroy hide them on request

2435935
maven	pom.xml	ant	maven	ant	pom.xml
pattern7	
you already know the answer to the very oriented body of your question there is no ant equivalent to this minimal pom.xml because unlike maven ant does not define a set of standards patterns conventions in other words a lingua franca or shared language for project management that would make it possible so ant can t beat maven on this sample

2468876
profiler	yourkit
pattern7	
now get some profiler with memory profiling capability i prefer yourkit

2470483
crypt	salt	crypt	hash	hash	salt

2500838
google-chrome	firefox

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
pattern7	
compare safari or google-chrome and firefox click the tabs

better is to choose between put and post based on idempotence of the action

2696560

pattern7	
on the generate setter and getter screen you have select getter button on the right - use it

pattern7	
for generic java applications i would recommend amazon-web-services if the costs associated with beanstalk and rds are not too high

5217389

the if statement is necessary because the tooltip function will be called with arguments such as init destroy show hide update which refer to the functions defined in the methods hash

5226064
width	height
pattern7	
the answer given above favors width change over height change so if you adjust the height a lot but because of mouse positioning the width also changes a bit the user will still see pretty much the same window

5226464

i would recommend iirf ionic s isapi rewrite filter which is a rewriter for iis that unlike isapi_rewrite is completely free for the full functionality

quicksort	heapsort	quicksort	mergesort	mergesort	in-place	mergesort	heapsort	heapsort	in-place
pattern5	
of course you just asked for advice about sorting on stack overflow so i feel compelled to ask you if you need an in-place sort what kind of big-o performance you re looking for and then ask you to choose between quicksort introsort heapsort mergesort and stoogesort for what will work best for you

5305482

pattern7	
the faster the better as this function will get called roughly 20 billion times during the execution of the program i m running it is the performance-critical code at the moment. it doesn t need to be written in c it really just needs to outperform md5 somewhere in the realm of the built-in hash for strings

what i ve tried is similar to list of int s to define iterator de-reference it and compare with chars with if and do this for all vowels and that doesn t work

22406540
free	malloc

i would actually recommend ember.js or angular or backbone.js as they provide the exact functionality you re looking for

33002688
portrait	landscape
pattern7	
these are neither portrait or landscape and your code always picks portrait when the orientation is not landscape

33002688
portrait	landscape
pattern7	
hence as you are tipping back it goes to orientation face up and your code picks portrait as it is not landscape but face up

33024747

33292880
hash	md5
pattern7	
well the first thing that would help narrow down problem is the md5 hash of key raw is identical in both cases but the base64 encoding doesn t match md5 hash of key base64 so that kind of narrows down the step where the problem diverges to the code for the base64call

33305350
portrait	landscape
pattern7	
if you have a main report choose landscape or portrait using subreports you can apply for each subreport its layout with property orientation in root tag jasperreport as follow

33313269
