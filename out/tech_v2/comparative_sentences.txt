double	int
4	
personally i prefer int string double etc


633
unmanaged	managed-code
5	
i have been unaware of the issues until now on using managed-code to interface to mapi although the c++ code in the component should be unaffected by this error as it is unmanaged


894
sftp	scp
10	
obviously this is less then ideal but it will get the job done and let you use scp sftp in classic asp


1130
duplicates	sorted
5	
also since the data is sorted given a non-key field the rest of the table doesn t need to be searched for duplicates values once a higher value is found


1528
silverlight	wpf
5	
these classes are all controls that are written to be compiled for either wpf or silverlight 2.0


1971
perl	python
4	10	
i think programmer comfort is my main reason to choose python but i think perl is still better supported


2328
callback	methods
5	
so again i need a way for the page viewstate to be updated on callback after the ajax methods is fired


2360
mouse	keyboard
4	
go to system preferences keyboard and mouse then choose keyboard shortcuts


2560
embed	windows-media-player
5	
other alternatives are quicktime windows-media-player or even silverlight microsoft s flash competitor which can be used to embed several video formats


2562
wmv	flv
0	
i found the production of wmv much better and easier than flv because all windows flv encoders i tried are not really good and stable whereas pretty much every tool can natively output wmv


2767
add-on	plugins
4	
can anyone recommend any good add-on plugins for microsoft visual studio


3290
value	field
5	
you could add some ajax-y goodness that reads a hidden form field value requests a verification key from the server and sends that back along with the response but that will never be populated if javascript is blocked disabled


3318
enumerator	any
5	
the collect method which can be applied to any enumerator object


3455
vmware	parallels
0	
another option is vmware fusion which is much better than parallels in my opinion + windows xp + sql server management studio


3511
multiplication	addition
5	
according to bodmas multiplication should always be done before addition therefore 17 is actually the correct answer according to bodmas and will also be the answer which your calculator will give if you type in 2 + 3 x 5


3829
cmd	xcopy
8	
powershell scripts might be useful too and surely more flexible than xcopy and other dos cmd


4305
shared-hosting	mediatemple
0	
something like mediatemple - which won t host the worlds fastest websites but for the price is far better than shared-hosting


4725
c++	python
5	
also i want to add even if you find places where lisp will make sense you will probably not convince anyone else that it should be used over java c++ c# python ruby etc


5132
java	groovy
10	
just a bit of a question is the reason they are choosing grails because groovy is closer in syntax to java than ruby or because they want access to java


5132
ruby-on-rails	grails
7	
i have never used gruby-on-rails or ruby-on-rails before but i have used groovy and ruby before and as a language i think ruby is much cleaner and more consistent and the team might enjoy production more


5607
set	any
5	
with identity page fill factor is pretty useless as a tuning mechanism and might as well be set to 100 - rows will never be inserted in any page but the last one


5724
command-line	cmd
7	
is there a better windows command-line shell other than cmd which has better copy paste between windows windows and console windows


5949
authorization	authentication
0	
assuming that the web app in question is secure enough to prevent people entering other numbers to view other users without authentication a simple sequentially-assigned surrogate key also leaks the total number of instances older than this one in this case users which might be privileged information


6099
required	checked
0	
the source control tool s diff algorithm probably won t handle it efficiently but it s likely to required less space than checked in an opaque binary database file


6659
easymock	unitils
4	
but i would recommend unitils a great wrapper for junit testng dbunit easymock regardless of which route you take


6671
testng	junit
8	
testng strives to be much more configurable than junit but in the end they both work equally well


6765
spring	wicket
1	
i am really fond of technologies that java offers - particularly spring framework and wicket and i am quite familiar with java from others projects and assignments before


6906
visual-studio	sharpdevelop
7	
pure .net in visual-studio is better than win32 obviously but developing against the mono libraries perhaps using the sharpdevelop ide is probably an even better approach


7018
line	lines
0	
tons more line of code much faster than the awk script


7129
web-inspector	inspector
4	
then from the develop menu choose show web-inspector and click on the console link


7281
sieve-of-eratosthenes	sieve
0	10	
it uses significantly less memory than the sieve-of-eratosthenes and is generally faster for individual numbers


7303
windows-server	windows
5	
this was available in vs 2005 with moss extensions but has to be run off windows-server with a full moss installation and the correct permissions set


9144
c++	python
2	5	
honestly i doubt that you ve got a lot of incoming developers who suck with c++ but would be awesome with python anyway


9160
bug-tracking	fogbugz
1	
but we really haven t had any problems integrating fogbugz into a team that was totally unfamiliar with any bug-tracking software


9304
line	lines
10	
i know this is more a philosophical subjective questions but is there any reason to use these auto-properties except from saving five line of code for each field


9783
sql-server	sql-server-express
10	
i ve used sql-server express on the past projects but time and time again i hear people saying that the product from oracle is faster and more powerful


10232
ant	maven
3	
they do a great job for us and i would highly recommend using maven over ant


11333
asp.net	asp.net-mvc
5	
gpl is clearly one of the most popular open source licenses out there and also one of the few that on the face of it can t be applied to asp.net-mvc applications


11471
sorting	filtering
1	
i m not yet very familiar with wpf but i see this as a question about sorting and filtering collections


12140
set	any
10	0	
this works better in any case much better than having all those objects need some global settings object --- that of course effectively makes unit testing impossible disadvantage can be that you sometimes need to set a dozen of properties or that you need to let those properties percolate into sub-objects


12184
yaml	ini
1	
there s nothing wrong with xml it s reasonably human readable as much as yaml or json or ini files are but remember its intent is to be read by machines


12313
nant	msbuild
1	
we ve gone through so much pain with tfs msbuild using tfsdeployer custom powershell scripts etc to get it to do what we were able to do with nant out of the box


12331
asp.net	asp.net-mvc
5	
from my understanding subsonic and asp.net-mvc can be redistributed for either an open-source or commercial license and you should be fine just as long as you don t use some sort of viral gpl license that needs to gpl everything


12379
line	lines
4	
what i did when i had a similar problem to solve was trying to guess regular expressions to match line


12412
shell	bash
10	
bash is the better interactive shell in my opinion.


12557
arrays	dictionary
5	
lastly lists are not hashable so the type of mapping done with dictionary hash tables in perl associative arrays in php must be done with tuples


12638
ms-access	sql-server
5	5	
so basically i m building an app for my company and it needs to be built using ms-access and it needs to be built on sql-server


12937
haskell	lisp
1	
imperative languages like java and c# solve a certain set of problems pretty well but it also helps to think in a functional manner sometimes such as with haskell and lisp


12961
visualvm	jvisualvm
5	
it s also worth noting that starting with jdk 1.6 update 7 there is now a bundled profiler called visualvm which can be launched with jvisualvm


13210
asp.net	.net
10	
.net 3.0 and .net 3.5 did not change the version of the clr so using asp.net 3.5 is a more complicated thing that it sounds like it should be at first


13541
factors	numeric
5	
it s like having the cake and eating it too the speed factors is there since when using the enter key no unnecessary tabing must be done to get to the correct field and using the enter key next to the numeric keyboard makes it really smooth


14261
actionscript	mxml
7	
if you write your own reusable components then writing them in actionscript may sometimes give you a little more control but for non-reusable views mxml is much better


14515
order	add
5	
we use nunitlite although i think we did have had to add some code to it in order for it to work


15091
lisp	smalltalk
10	8	
technically ruby is more sophisticated than java or c# being closer to smalltalk in terms of oo purity and closer to lisp in terms of meta-programming facilities


15093
row	cursor
0	
if you have a sql statement like the one above that may change data in more than one row you might want to include a cursor to update all records affected by the trigger


15412
srp	principles
5	
now don t get me wrong - i believe srp to be the key to most good oo designs but i feel there are cases where this principles can and should be broken just like database normalization rules


15712
perl	c++
5	
there were some excellent suggestions already but i just wanted to mention that perl can also be called can call to c++


15838
set	any
5	
the practice of programming be improved using any of c s native utilities if i set the i variable to be a register variable


16400
webserver	security
4	
i prefer this anyway because debugging with the integrated webserver can give you a very false impression of how your application will interact with the iis security model


16480
contains	any
0	
if itcontains numbers or any other non-string things dates i d use string.format because it gives me more control over the formatting


16558
nant	msbuild
7	
generally speaking i get the impression that nant offers more flexibility compared to msbuild whereas with my relatively simple needs i ve been fine with the latter so far


16581
nant	msbuild
4	0	
i have used both msbuild and nant and i much prefer msbuild mainly because it requires a lot less configuration by default


16714
value	field
7	0	
if you need to assert for example that the value of the small element is less than the value of the big element or even more complex business rules involving multiple field you probably want schematron or a hybrid approach


16758
submission	submit
5	
i also have been following the thoughts of stephen walther on mvc and i think this post is great to repopulate the fields with the datasubmitted for it to be changed before submission it again


16810
polymorphism	parametric-polymorphism
10	
algebraic data types in haskell support full parametric-polymorphism which is the more technically correct name for generics as a simple example the list data type


16877
svn	visualsvn
10	
apparently visualsvn is much better but costs money


17042
var	this
4	
jeff wrote a post on this saying he favors var


17120
nant	msbuild
5	
before leveraging cruisecontrol to it s fullest extent you need to create an automated build script that can be run by msbuild or nant


17177
processor	processors
7	
with modern compilers and processor i don t think there is really any speed difference so this is more just a matter of style


17365
command-line	cmd
5	
cmd-line options for mutt can be shown with mutt -h


17653
windows-xp	windows
5	
or the would be stay with windows-xp pro


18132
nhibernate	entity-framework
0	
finally what are thoughts on using nhibernate which has been around for a long time and may be more mature than the ado.net entity-framework


18307
php	ruby
10	
php is more well known and used than eruby but i like the ruby language so i tend to like using eruby


18335
ruby-on-rails	grails
7	0	
i truly feel that grails has brighter future than ruby-on-rails


18810
linq	linq-to-sql
5	
it s a lot easier to build data models using visual studio 2008 that can be used for linq-to-sql if there are proper foreign key relationships


18876
ruby-on-rails	django
10	
this isn t any more elegant than what you have stipulated so i wonder if any of the django or ruby-on-rails guys can provide any input


19179
command-line	cmd
10	
calling a cmd-line from a gui spawns external processes for each cmd and is more disruptive to the os


19278
line	lines
0	
i think i was able to pull of our migration with less than 150 line of code


19307
jquery	jqmodal
4	
i would like to recommend this jquery plugin though jqmodal


19481
controllers	controller
7	
relating to point #1 this direct binding makes it harder to isolate each component view model controllers presenter and unit-test


19598
controllers	controller
7	
relating to point #1 this direct binding makes it harder to isolate each component view model controllers presenter and unit-test


19604
asp.net	asp.net-mvc
7	
i m looking to integrate a light texteditor in an asp.net-mvc application and i choosed the tinymce solution and not the classic fckeditor as this seems more lightweight and more jquery friendly


20143
submission	submit
4	
unless some mssql guru comes to the rescue i recommend submission the problem to the vendor


20192
cassini	iis
4	
there are lots of good reasons to prefer iis over the cassini server articles by dominick baier


20478
contains	any
4	
i used an enum contains the sql keywords select insert ... and basically parsed each line iterating over the enum to determine if any sql was present


20489
subclassing	abstract-class
5	
dr interfaces defines a list of methods that need to be followed think api while an abstract-class gives some basic common functionality which the subclassing refine to specific needs


20607
getdate	strtotime
5	
strtotime and getdate are two functions that can be used to get dates from strings and timestamps


20648
valueconverter	converter
0	
i suppose it may be a little more work than the valueconverter but it is another option


20665
aspect	aspects
5	
attributes can also be used in aspects oriented programming to inject manipulate objects at run time based on the attributes that decorate them and add validation logging etc


20752
waitpid	fork
0	
of course shells do more than that like piping input and output but you should be able to accomplish the basics using fork execve and waitpid


20784
red-black-tree	tree
5	
red-black-trees solve that by forcing your tree to be balanced whenever you insert or delete


21137
nunit	mbunit
5	
i would have thought that templates be readily available for nunit xunit mbunit et


21292
linq	linq-to-sql
10	
linq-to-sql is an orm built ontop of the linq foundation but linq is much more


21531
32-bit	16-bit
5	5	
so if the smallest unit is 16-bit long what in x86 would be called a word then a 32-bit word representing the value 0xffff0000 could be stored like this


21609
atomicity	atomic
5	
this can all be automated and can be considered an atomicity action


22074
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
10	
in my mind illegalargumentexception seems more specific than using a nullpointerexception since it s telling me that the problem was with an argument i passed to the method and not with a value that may have been generated while performing the method


22418
binary-tree	tree
5	
finally you can kind of emulate a binary-tree with an array with the potential to have wasted space


22653
webserver	upload
5	
when a file was upload this backend service sync d the data in the file system folders making it available to be served from either webserver


22695
remote-debugging	debugging
10	
remote-debugging is obviously more tricky to get it to work correctly you might have to map the remote url with a php script in your workspace than a local debugging setup which is pretty easy to configure if you are on a mac or a linux desktop


23109
php	python
0	
c# - performance wise its far better than either of the big three p s in lamp perl php and python


23203
haskell	scheme
7	
i really like thompson s haskell the craft of functional programming because it s well written and haskell allows an easier start than other functional languages while being completely pure unlike lisp or scheme


23273
haskell	ocaml
4	
it loses points for being about standard ml when ocaml f# and haskell are seemingly more popular


23287
factors	primes
0	
edit i ve now realised that my approach is futile if there are more than 2 primes factors in play since step 2 fails when the result is a product of two other primess therefore a recursive algorithm is needed


23324
procedural	procedural-programming
7	
this is much harder to do with procedural-programming not easy with functional but still easier


23693
procedural	procedural-programming
7	
there are situations when functional programming is the obvious choice and other situations were procedural-programming is the better choice


23857
inno-setup	nsis
7	
inno-setup or nsis whichever seems easier to you


24035
integer	unsigned
0	
in fact your going to get a value bigger than an integer can hold 4 billion unsigned 2 billion signed before the stack is going to over flow fibbonaci 46


24454
ruby-on-rails	django
4	
i heavily prefer cakephp for php django for python ruby-on-rails for ruby


24455
loops	nested-loops
7	0	
this allows better control over nested-loops


24564
svn	visualsvn
0	
i have found that visualsvn is about 50 slower than running svn as a native service


24645
extends	sealed
0	
quite the contrary i have been in the situation more than once where i want to extends a class but couldn t because it was sealed


24995
java	scala
5	
classes can be written in scala then extended in java for example


25008
derived-class	base-class
5	
also due to lsp liskov substitution principle one can use derived-class where base-class is expected and this is actually imposes the greatest impact from use of inheritance code using base-class may be given an inherited class and it still has to work as expected


25105
linux	bsd
0	
and of course the bsd man pages which are an excellent resource as they are maintained to a far greater extent than your average linux man-page


25171
firefox	safari
1	
i also install safari and opera but mostly just use them for testing and benchmarking since their dev tools aren t as robust as firefox and they aren t as buggy as ie


25275
php	ruby
1	
i am not familiar with ruby on rails but the following is untested php code


25566
big-o	time-complexity
5	
how might i write an even worse big-o sort without just adding extraneous junk that could be pulled out to reduce the time-complexity


25692
controllers	controller
5	
however you may create a kind of validation layer between controllers and model so that most of syntactical validations can be carried out on data before it reaches to model


25701
xom	jdom
4	
i ve worked with jdom as well and there s absolutely nothing wrong with it although i do prefer xom


25853
packets	packet
7	
the data you can send is somewhat less that that because the ip packets size also includes the ip header usually 20 bytes and the udp header 8 bytes


26016
oracle	oracle-xe
4	
i don t recommend oracle-xe


26415
line	lines
10	
since this is more along the line of product support your best bet is probably emailing the support people


27043
selected	cell
5	
if you selected the conditional formatting menu option under the format menu item you will be given a dialog that lets you construct some logic to apply to that cell


27254
extjs	mootools
1	
it could be that prototype or mootools or extjs are as good as jquery


27439
postgresql	mysql
10	
from how i understand it postgresql is a more correct database implementation while mysqlis less correct less compliant but faster


27443
postgresql	mysql
7	
in most regards postgresql is slower than mysqlespecially when it comes to fine tuning in the end


27508
directory	folder
4	
red gate s sql compare product not only allows you to do object-level comparisons and generate change scripts from that but it also allows you to export your database objects into a folder hierarchy organized by object type with one objectname .sql creation script per object in these directory


27529
sql-server	postgresql
4	
better to compare postgresql to sql-server


27622
output	mode
5	
the trace macro can be used to output diagnostic messages to the debugger when the code is compiled in debug mode


27785
http	https
4	
would match http or https just fine


28130
lua	python
3	
if it will be used frequently and if it will be extended in the future i would almost recommend adding either python or lua into your code


28228
command-line	cmd
7	0	0	
once you get over the fact that up-arrow and down-arrow are replaced by esc k and then j you ll see that vi mode offers more than emacs mode for cmd-line editing in bash


28256
operators	parentheses
5	
using this method however leaves me with everything having the same precedence - it s evaluated left to right regardless of operators although precedence can be enforced using parentheses


28276
vmware	parallels
0	
vmware is beefer and sucks more of the system s performance away by default also seems to perform somewhat better than parallels but can have serious graphical problems depending on your setup particularly if you try to use unity mode


28319
csv	xml
5	
output can be exported to xml postscript csv or plain text


28448
default-value	default
5	
note that ant properties cannot be changed once set so you override a value by defining a new value before the default-value


28700
ruby	python
5	
it stands as much of a chance to be installed as python or ruby


28742
authentication	access-control
5	
this means that the standard apache authentication methods can be used for access-control


28947
set	any
5	
when you compile without the debug flag set any call to writedebug will be removed as was assumed was happening with debug.write


29557
mstest	mbunit
8	
i ve read time and time again that tdd test first is more difficult with mstest than it is with other testing frameworks such as nunit mbunit etc.


29777
command-line	cmd
0	
i have a solution in visual studio 2005 professional edition which in turn has 8 projects.i am facing a problem that even after i set the cmd arguments in the project settings of the relevant project it doesnt accept those cmd-line arguments and it shows argc 1 inspite of me giving more than 1 cmd arguments


29852
svn	revision
5	
with that setup the svn revision number of the metarepository could possibly be used for versioning the complete system


29856
32-bit	64bit
4	
in the past i have run apache and mysql to match this install in 32-bit mode even stripping out the 64bit stuff from apache to make it work


29923
bazaar	git
7	
in git you can do the same with playing around in the index staging area but bazaar has a better ui for it


29962
cruisecontrol	cruisecontrol.net
0	
it s highly customizable and imho easier than cruisecontrol.net


30114
command-line	cmd
5	
as for a runs-everywhere cmd-line tool to be used with commit hooks try narrange


30114
command-line	cmd
10	
some people also use artistic style cmd-line tool although it requires perl and works better with c c++ code than with c#


30261
textbox	textchanged
4	
edit textchanged event is only triggered when the textbox loses focus so that can t be the issue


30281
ruby-on-rails	django
1	
is as good as django or ruby-on-rails


30669
category	categories
5	
some software companies create their own category so there may be non official category on some machines


30684
process	interprocess
10	10	
but maybe using another way of interprocess communication is better


31119
getter	setter
10	
static functions often require you to use setter and getter which clutter a class s api and makes things more complicated in general


31332
lisp	common-lisp
7	
programming phase common-lisp development has more of an


31425
postgresql	mysql

the long answer expanding on what the op said is to be more compatible with apache and mysqlpostgresql


31477
asp.net	asp.net-mvc
5	
the brail view engine has been implemented to be used in asp.net-mvc


31611
32-bit	64bit
5	
one word of warning - jdbc - access queries which bridge using odbc do not work on 64bit systems as there exist no 64bit access database drivers the driver is included into 32-bit copies of windows and can only be accessed by 32-bit processes


31665
throw	throws
5	
if the user is not valid the directory entry nativeobject cannot be accessed and throw an exception


31913
visitor	visitor-pattern
10	
maybe it is better to think to some solution without even citing the visitor-pattern and clean our mind


32145
getter-setter	getter
7	
i see a lot of debate about getter-setter class methods and is it better to just access simple property variables directly or should every class have explicit get set methods defined blah blah blah


32404
line	lines
5	
i won t necessarily have to implement this part but i need a rough idea how it would be done in order to decide whether to design along these line


32476
linq	linq-to-sql
10	
it s relatively involved for each but the linq-to-sql is the more flexible solution and also the easiest to implment


32606
textbox	textarea
7	7	
the textarea default font is smaller therefore the textbox is smaller


32675
margins	padding
10	8	
to me padding just sounds more inner than margins


32932
command-line	cmd
1	
unxutils isn t updated as often and isn t as complete as cygwin but runs natively just like any other windows cmd-line utility


32932
command-line	cmd
10	
cygwin acts more like a linux cmd-line emulator


33243
asp.net-mvc	webforms
0	
the easiest way to generate elegant html and css is to use asp.net-mvc framework where you have much more control over html generation than with webforms


33265
operators	boolean-expression
5	
if i understand this right these operators can be used in types which i want to use instead of a boolean-expression and where i don t want to provide an implicit conversion to bool


33403
linked-list	data-structures
10	10	
edit i know my basic data-structures 101 and why a linked-list is better for adding removing and a hashtable is better for random access


33438
key	key-value
1	
but some of the data i have to show on some forms has to come from text files and by text files i mean human-readable files they can be csv tab-delimited or even a key-value pair per line since my data is as simple as this but my preference of course is xml files

i d recommend hpricot for ruby or beautiful soup for python which are both excellent parsers for html


34295
emacs	aquamacs
4	
if it is emacs you want i would recommend aquamacs more mac-like or carbon emacs more gnu-emacs-like


34338
simpletest	phpunit
0	
i found simpletest was even easier than phpunit to set up


34474
simpletest	phpunit
4	
i prefer phpunit now but when i started out i used simpletest as i didn t always have access to the command line


34506
derived-class	base-class
5	
i know this example is trivial but if i have a vector of complex data that is going to be always the same for all derived-class but is needed to be accessed from base-class methods


34566
equals	gethashcode
2	
if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value


34566
equals	gethashcode
2	
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values


34638
aspect	aspects
5	
for column based security we could perhaps have secured to either assist in query generation or perhaps use an aspects to filter the information returned


34941
perl	php
1	
for perl at least the first option is sufficient i m not familiar with php


35409
set	any
5	
the second since it basically says that for given z and first-order property p you can construct x z p x but to generate the russell set you would need z v the class of all sets which is not a set cannot be generated from any of the given axioms


35777
line	lines
0	
it would be fine to use it for stack overflow which has three developers and i guess no more than 30k line of code


35872
line	lines
3	
but instead of making a rectangular grid you can choose dividing line that closely match the line of the voronoi diagram this way you will get fewer areas that cross dividing line


35934
lookup	any
7	
depending on requirements you use the mapped value to point at the result directly or to short list of the candidates which would allow a smaller map but requires greater subsequent processing - you re not in o 1 lookup territory any more


36291
value	field
5	
if it doesn t then the property code queries the database and computes it then stores the value in the _total field so that it need not be recomputed the next time it s requested


36398
hbase	hypertable
0	
since hbase and hypertable are all about performance being modeled on google s bigtable they sound like they would certainly be much faster than hive at the cost of functionality and a higher learning curve they don t have joins or the sql-like syntax


36655
asp.net-mvc	castle-monorail
4	
honestly if you want an asp.net-mvc framework for asp.net i would pick castle-monorail


37024
public	protected
5	
also some tools some o r mappers expect object data to be represented by properties and do not recognize public or protected member variables


37322
derived-class	virtual-functions
7	
i find the c++ behaviour makes more sense since base class c-tors are called first it stands to reason that they should call base class virtual-functions--after all the derived-class c-tor hasn t run yet so it may not have set up the right preconditions for the derived-class virtual function


38097
datamapper	activerecord
7	
this is more of a how-to-implement tip but i started dabbling with creating an activerecord datamapper implementation in php and quickly ran into many hurdles with array-like access


38255
linq	linq-to-sql
10	
i believe linq-to-sql is designed to be fairly lightweight and simple whereas the entity framework is more heavy duty and probably more suitable in large enterprise applications


38553
default-value	default
0	
brian -1 is a good choice for the default-value since no real rows are likely to have identities less than zero


38769
vb.net	vb6
5	
the application can be written in perl vb6 vb.net or c# but must be easily scheduled from a windows based server


38773
ruby-on-rails	grails
7	
i can say that the ruby-on-rails community is much larger i m talking about ruby-on-rails vs grails not ruby-on-rails vs java and very helpful


38839
common-lisp	scheme
5	
common-lisp code can be converted into scheme code with relative ease


39282
php	python
10	
usually flex is more suited for application that need a lot of access to data but for simple things in flash you should use some xml data sources and write the xml source yourself in something like php asp python perl etc


39286
decrement	increment
8	
decrement loops can possibly be more efficient than increment loops depending on instruction set architecture arm given


39343
vba	basic
1	
openoffice has a basic interpreter which is largely compatible with vba


39576
oracle	mysql
5	
the following works in mysqlbut doesn t seem to be supported in oracle


39586
asp.net	asp.net-mvc
10	10	
if you look at the source-code for the likes of asp.net-mvc this is no longer accurate


40117
httphandler	httpcontext
5	
httpcontext exposes the current instance for the request under the httpcontext.current property however the current context can also be passed in httphandler in the processrequest method


40284
default-value	default
5	
it really just comes down to whether or not it is appropriate for you to set these default-values or if your objects should be specced out at construction all the time


40353
ruby-on-rails	grails
8	
for one thing gruby-on-rails is far more flexible than ruby-on-rails


41427
linq	linq-to-sql
5	
if you re dealing with linq-to-sql and the orderby is an expression tree it will be converted into sql for execution anyway


41479
var	this
7	
this is no better than the equivilent foreach var item in somelist .


41720
asp.net-mvc	webforms
1	
so start with asp.net-mvc and you will easily be able to move in to webforms if needed


41774
svn	revision
4	
right click on the trunk folder and choose either checkout if you want to update from svn later or export if you just want your own copy of that revision


41928
line	lines
5	
finally i enclosed and this is dirty my apologies line 1417 to 1474 with a try catch block swallowing the exception


42751
external	host
5	5	
all those details may be specified external either programmatically in a service host or via the config file


42888
tree	nodes
0	
an xpath style api might be better than a dom api in that case - it might you decouple thenodes from the tree a bit more and treat the mutated tree more intelligently


43037
json	xml
0	
if your core requirement is a data-interchange format lighter than xml then you might want to consider using json instead of yaml


43112
jfreechart	awt
7	7	
my two biggest problems are as awt events bubble up through swt there are some erroneous events fired and due to wrapping the awt frame jfreechart becomes substantially slower


43170
category	categories
4	
after this you simply select any products belonging to any of these category


43264
contains	any
4	
if they are on different drives and the drive contains the data fails you can apply the log to the last backup so you don t lose any data


43472
hide	show
5	
if you append a span containing ellipses to the end of each query a simple logical test in javascript with a bit of css manipulation could be used to hide show them as needed


43548
visualsvn	fogbugz
0	
+1 for visualsvn being better than ankhsvn having tried both and +1 for the fogbugz add-in


43743
asp.net-mvc	webforms
7	0	0	
i found some wild remarks that asp.net-mvc is 30x faster than asp.net webforms


44032
command-line	cmd
4	
i also recommend ffmpeg but the cmd-line suggested by john boker has an unintended side effect it re-encodes the file to the default bitrate which is 64 kb s in the version i have here at least


44034
set	any
4	
i set up a little ajax app that compares any number of catalog instances to a master and shows the diffs


44195
union	union-all
0	
union will be slower than union-all because union will filter out dups


44248
linked-list	data-structures
0	0	
might perform better is with data-structures like a linked-list where random access means traversing the list


44347
for-loop	loops
7	
i do this because i still code in the flash ide and its debugger is so very painful to get working most of the time it s easier to just trace variables out so you can either use that for-loops to print the object names of the items currently on your stage or use a debugger program to find the objects as well


44362
lostfocus	lost-focus
4	
lost-focus will trigger when the textbox loses focus


44443
oracle	postgresql
1	
i guess i was wondering if postgresql or mysql have any obvious advantages in these areas i am primarily familiar with oracle


44443
aspect	aspects
7	
another aspects of the question was if either database is easier to work with when using python


44620
controllers	controller
5	
it should also be pointed out that you can specify your controllers action and params to the .form helper and if they fit into your routing rules then no query string parameters will be used


44821
windows-mobile	windows-ce
5	
does this mean that my executable can only be run on windows-mobile devices instead of any generic windows-ce installation


45087
finalize	finalizer
5	
so objects that have to be finalized are moved to a special queue to be cleaned out by a different thread the finalize thread - which if you kill makes all kinds of bad things happen


45383
finalize	finalizer
1	
there is no magic in the clr to call dispose methods automatically other than tracking objects that contain finalize and storing them in the finalizer table by the gc and calling them when some clean up heuristics kick in by the gc


45408
pointers	char-pointer
1	
is it something as hacky as mapping the mnemonic instructions to binary codes stuffing it into an char-pointers and casting it as a function and executing


45417
pointers	char-pointer
1	
is it something as hacky as mapping the mnemonic instructions to binary codes stuffing it into an char-pointers and casting it as a function and executing


45499
push	pull
0	
that code sample tries to turn xmlreader style code into sax style code - if you re writing code from scratch i d just use xmlreader as it was intended - pull not push


45512
quicksort	bubble-sort
0	
i m sure there s a codinghorror article about this. also many algorithms have degenerate cases where the code does more than is necessary using quicksort on nearly ordered data could be slower than a bubble-sort with an early-out check


45650
editor	text-editor
7	
i found that i can get around this by manually opening the project file in a text-editor and modifying the path to something like .. .. .. common source.cs but this is more of a hack then i would like


45886
asp.net	.net
7	
of course asp.net provides much better ways of accomplishing the same thing but it s still a bit of a loss and can make migrating an old site to .net a pain


45963
malloc	free
7	
finding a package that can work with both new delete and malloc free obviously gives you more flexibility


46165
export	report
5	
you can then have ssrs export the report to about 10 different formats and send to the client including pdf excel html etc


46233
generator	generator-expression
5	
furthermore list comprehensions are generally preferred to map thus i d expect generator-expression to be preferred to imap


46296
bazaar	git
1	
i m not familiar with bazaar but git doesn t track file renames


47659
m2e	m2eclipse
0	
about q4e i have been reading a lot of good stuff about it and seems the next versions will do a lot more than m2e with a better dependency management and even visual graphs


47659
m2e	m2eclipse
7	4	
but the general opinion is that m2e is still better than q4e but q4e is getting better each new version and maybe will surpass m2e soon


47674
m2e	m2eclipse
10	10	
in other words m2e is more friendly to the maven way


47827
seo	web-crawler
0	
the seo guy mentioned that semantic valid html gets more points by web-crawler than jumbled messy html


47929
packets	packet
10	
udp is faster than tcp and the simple reason is because its nonexistent acknowledge packet ack that permits a continuous packet stream instead of tcp that acknowledges a set of packets calculated by using the tcp window size and round-trip time rtt


47966
mocking	stubs
10	
sometimes you don t want expectations on every method you re calling so some mocking frameworks will allow partial mocks that are like mock stubs hybrids in that only the expectations you set are enforced and every other method call is treated more like a stubs in that it just returns a value


48012
asp.net	asp.net-mvc
0	
is asp.net-mvc that much better than php with tools like cakephp


48015
emacs	textmate
7	
textmate is a better emacs for macs though that won t help you with solaris


48033
for-loop	loops
5	
a jump table would be used to draw characters because it would take too long to load a bitmap from memory and use a for-loops to shove the bitmap out


48103
division	modulo
0	
a side effect of many division routines is the modulo - so in few cases should division actually be faster than modulo


48103
division	modulo
5	
so in that vein here s a very low level look at the math of modulo for an example of x which should show you how simple it can be compared to division


48259
binary-tree	tree
0	
what s funny here is that the binary-tree search appears a little probably not statistically quicker than the cil switch instruction


48745
packets	packet
10	
for things like video streaming and multiplayer gaming where it is better to miss a packet than to delay all the other packets behind it this is the obvious choice


48772
sql-server	postgresql
1	
i have never hand-coded object creation code for sql-server and foreign key decleration is seemingly different between sql-server and postgresql


48884
line	lines
5	5	
amazon associates web service - used to be called e-commerce api or something along those line


48993
selection	selected
7	
i guess you could probably use javascript to handle aselectedion event my javascript knowledge is a little in disrepair at the moment and switch on the value of the combo box but this seems like more of a hack


49182
md5	hash
10	
based on the documentation on msdn and my experience binary is better since the md5 hash does not vary in size


49282
binary	octal
5	
as noted in answer by joseph pecoraro you might want to watch for strings that are valid non-decimal numbers such as those starting with 0x for hex and 0b for binary and potentially more tricky numbers starting with zero that will be parsed as octal


49290
abstract	extends
0	
abstract classes cannot define mix-ins -- a class cannot extends more than one parent


49562
expression-blend	blend
4	
in other words if i were working with this in expression-blend or mobiform aurora i would be able to select the chart from the logical tree or select any of the individual pens to edit their properties


49732
web-applications	enterprise
5	5	
most of the work i do is with what could be considered enterprise web-applications


49806
mouse	click
4	
if i have several of these windows open at once and i click one with my mouse when they disappear they cause my application to lose focus it switches focus to the app behind the current one


49951
32-bit	64bit
5	
the cpu can be switched from 64bit execution mode to 32-bit when it traps into kernel context and a 32-bit kernel can still be constructed to understand the structures passed in from 64bit user-space apps


49953
java	python
7	0	10	
java has much better performance than python and has way better tool support


49953
java	python
7	0	
sometimes those things matter a lot and java is the better language than python for a task


50180
.net	wcf
5	
the wcf class.netnamedpipebinding can be used for interprocess communication on the same machine


50360
trace	profiling
5	
the long-term difference might be that stored procedures are many many times easier for a dba to manage and tune whereas hundreds of different queries that have to be gleaned from profiling trace are a nightmare


50362
ruby	python
10	
really though this is probably more a perl ruby python job than a pure shell script


50595
pie-chart	charts
0	
flotr ++even prettier charts than flot +-uses prototype which i ve never worked with -no pie-charts either


50632
int	unsigned-integer
7	
otherwise if the operand that has unsigned int type has rank greater or equal to the rank of the type of the other operand then the operand with signed int type is converted to the type of the operand with unsigned int type


50861
malloc	realloc
5	
you can set __malloc_hook __free_hook and __realloc_hook to point to functions which will be called from malloc realloc and free respectively


50909
vimeo	youtube
0	
vimeo will always have fewer users than youtube because the user experience is poor for low bitrate users


51054
line	lines
5	
similar things can be done in bash in just a couple line of code


51069
windows-server	windows
1	
this is possible since the exe is fully compatible between windows-server 2003 and windows xp


51146
subclass	subclassing
0	
does anyone know of a better solution than my subclassing workaround


51244
hosting	web-hosting
5	
the issue before used to be cost but sql server 2005 express is free and there are lots of web-hosting companies which offer full hosting with sql server for less than 5.00 a month


51512
java	python
7	
yeah java has gotten better since 1.5 but for example you can iterate through a string in python with this same construct


51530
aspect	aspects
7	
this is more of a psychological aspects as i prefer to have a neat structure in the repository which makes navigating it much easier mdash


51580
json	xml
8	
also i don t see how xml s angle brackets are less human readable than json s square brackets curly brackets and quotes


51866
having	select
4	
to do this i m using ms vc++ .net 2003 and mappoint europe 2006 to do this but am having problems as when i select insert activex control no mappoint control appears in the list of options


52030
tree	nodes
5	
in order to pull off some of the visual tricks of draging around the tree nodes it has to be copied into this clipboard with its source description


52109
linq	linq-to-sql
4	4	
you do not lose linq you lose linq-to-sql


52179
postgresql	mysql
0	
i just checked the timings using mysql5 and they are slightly worse than postgresql


52225
meta	meta-tags
5	
i wonder if you set the page not to be cached through meta-tags will that fix the problem


52881
ruby-on-rails	codeigniter
1	0	
also i don t think it is so much that asp.net mvc is so much better than cakephp or codeigniter ruby-on-rails etc. the great thing about asp.net mvc and other asp.net-based technologies such as monorail is that developers who are using asp.net now have the option of following the mvc pattern using tools and languages they are familiar with


53056
set	hashtable
0	
if you do this just keep in mind that the hashtable s size needs to be set bigger than your dataset when you start otherwise you are going to rehash the data which will trigger reinserts and more equals evaluations though possibly more realistic


53056
tostring	gethashcode
5	
for some objects not this one a quick hashcode can be generated by tostring .gethashcode certainly not optimal but useful as people tend to return something close to the identity of the object from tostring and that is exactly what gethashcode is looking for


53094
contains	any
7	
this is also easier to deal with than costants as you can put any type of value within the property array string int etc whereas constants cannot contains arrays


53184
32-bit	64bit
5	
this version is for 32-bit ints but the logic can be extended for 64bit or higher


53507
asp.net-mvc	webforms
4	
sometimes webforms and the rich third party control vendor availability will be preferable and in some cases raw simplicity and fine-grained html control will favor asp.net-mvc


53835
interpreter	runtime
5	
interpreter languages have the disadvantage that syntactic or structural meaning calling a method with wrong parameters etc. errors normally will only be detected at runtime if you don t have a separate step in your build which checks for such errors with phplint


53868
sql-server	mysql
1	
i used hibernate in my previous job to connect to both mysqland sql-server but i have since switched over to .net so currently i work with linq and i really enjoy it


54173
assignment-operator	comma-operator
7	0	
the value of a will be equal to b since the comma-operator has a lower precedence than the assignment-operator


54816
key	key-value
10	
.net will throw a system.argumentexception if you try to add an item to a hashtable twice with the same key-value so it doesnt look like there is anything more specific


54827
java	scala
7	0	
scala has much lighter syntax than java has a repl is statically typed and runs on the jvm - you might give that a shot as well


55578
virtualbox	vmware
7	
vmware has more features but costs 80 virtualbox on the other hand is more basic but is free for most users see virtualbox licensing faq for details


55855
textbox	textchanged
0	
is there an easier way than subclassing the textbox and implementing icommandsource to hook up the textchanged event to my viewmodel class


56336
union	union-all
5	
cases union-all will be more efficient and should be used unless duplicates are required in the sub-queries


56371
silverlight	wpf
4	
if you re determined to have rich-client style development and your audience is small for admins only then i d probably recommend wpf over silverlight as it currently provides a richer set of tools and controls


56568
between	sql-in
4	
that beats sql-in a situation where given two dates how many workdays are there between the two dates


57457
base-class	inherited
5	
base-classes can get bloated with tons of behaviours that may be needed by inherited objects


57528
vbscript	jscript
5	
i seem to recall reading somewhere that the command object shouldn t be used in vbscript or jscript because of security vulnerabilities but i can t seem to find that article


57936
contains	any
5	
a compiled c# .execontains platform-independent code that can be run in any .net-compatible environment including mono


58270
ado.net	entity-framework
5	
the ado.net entity-framework has the added advantage that your database tables can be viewed as entity classes inheriting from each other or as columns from multiple tables aggregated into a single entity


58301
directx	gdi
0	
speed is usually faster than gdi and slower than directx and depends greatly on how you do things seen something to work 60 times faster after rewriting in a sensible way


58306
set	any
4	
i want to choose any two records from the set and be able to show all simple paths between the chosen records


58363
apc	memcached
4	
i would recommend memcached or apc


58437
if-statement	loops
0	
it s not as clean as i d like it to be so i d still add comments but it s better than an if-statement or adding the first or last item outside loops


58443
lostfocus	lost-focus
4	
assume the textbox s text property is bound to a property on a business object and the binding s updatesourcetrigger property is set to the default value of lost-focus meaning that the bound value is pushed back to the business object property when the textbox loses input focus


58443
textbox	button
4	
when clicking on a button in a toolbar the textbox does not lose focus


58586
line	lines
4	
use shift + v to go in visual mode then you can select line and delete change them


58801
command-line	cmd
7	
robocopy gui makes it easier to get your cmd-line options right


60075
tree	children
4	
not sure if they keep track of the tree of process spawning i think it depends on what os you use but since when you kill bash or any shell all running children are also killed i think unix like systems do keep track of this


60137
ubuntu	debian
4	
i haven t decided which one yet but my understanding is that they ll give me a base os install i d prefer debian or ubuntu an ip address a root account ssh and that s about it


60283
linux	bsd
5	
on a linux or bsd system this should be vi by default although any editor should work


60482
command-line	cmd
7	0	
this approach is better than editing your .emacs file since it will allow you to have more than one shortcuts with more than one starting directory and it lets you have the normal cmd-line behavior of emacs if you need it


60487
wordpress	mediawiki
5	
have used this for over a year on wordpress ip.board and mediawiki sites and have absolutely zero spam


60910
emacs	aquamacs
7	
however i m not really much of an emacs user and the preferences menu in aquamacs is less than clear on where and how one might make such a change


60950
command-line	cmd
5	
i find working on the cmd-line in windows frustrating primarily because the console window is wretched to use compared to terminal applications on linux and os x such as rxvt xterm or terminal


61029
order	add
5	
in order for the #make and #model divs to sit side by side with out the use of floats they must be displayed as inline elements so add display inline to both #make and #model note that this will lose the vertical margin on those elements so you might need to make some other changes to get the exact layout you want


61138
ruby	python
0	
performance is the main downfall with python being somewhat faster than ruby as i understand it


61192
c++	python
4	
i recommend python as it s not only a sexy language but also very widely used and easy to integrate with c++ through boost.python


61734
ruby	python
0	
ruby will expose you to more concepts than python does due to it being more liberal in how it handles things like lambda functions code blocks eval and so on


61816
virtual-machine	vmware
1	
4 vmware virtual-machines created with vmware fusion are fully compatible with vmware s latest products


61924
set	any
5	
you can set a simple rule described in your header file that any variables to be accessed external to the class must be accessed via the property or by using custom methods on the class to affect values


62097
php	python
7	0	
you should generally know why you re optimizing code as in a specific task in your existing codebase is taking too long not i heard php is slower than python


62198
addition	add
7	0	
personally i feel that you can get pretty far by checking that you get the right results 1+1 should return 2 in a addition function trying out all the boundary conditions you can think of such as using two numbers of which the sum is greater than the integer max value in the add function and forcing error conditions such as network failures


62310
height	font-size
7	7	
if the lineheight was increased same effect though font-size with less words per line this becomes less of an issue


62586
controllers	controller
5	
do put stuff related to authorization access control in the controllers


62659
stl	boost
4	
using the stl or boost are quite good approaches if you don t know beforehand how many entries you will have in each dimension of the array because they will give you dynamic memory allocation and i recommend either of these approaches if your data set is to remain largely static or if it to mostly only receive new entries and not many deletions


63015
command-line	cmd
5	
it can be configured to show what misra rules have been violated and it has a cmd-line interface


63067
security	web-services
5	
the problem we are seeing is that it expects the requests to be formatted using web-services security so we are doing all the correct signing etc


63084
puts	gets
5	
the multiple gets must be replaced by an equal number of puts before another thread will be allowed to get the mutex


63865
c++	lua
5	
it is also possible to expose whole c++ classes to be used in lua


63908
expression-blend	blend
4	
so i highly recommend expression-blend for a wpf programmer


64389
controllers	controller
0	
it is very tempting to try to validate entire hierarchies of models as a whole but as you said the place where that would be most easily done is the controllers which should act more as a router of requests and responses than in dealing with business logic


64535
xml-serialization	xml
0	
the downside is primarily performance xml-serialization will be slower than binary over the wire and web services do not handle large amounts of data well


64574
procedural	procedural-programming
0	
object oriented programming is not inherently better than procedural-programming


64644
vim	emacs
4	
i don t think you would want to wait 10 seconds for your text editor to become ready ...if you are going to spend some serious time coding then spend some time and learn to use vim emacs too but i recommend vim


64682
lua	python
7	0	
lua is more lightweight than python


64853
.when	ready
7	
it s faster the designer is vastly improved split view faster context switching it has better support for javascript and .when you re ready to target 3.5 you ll be ready to go


65183
file-access	filesystems
0	
repositories stored on remote filesystems using file-access are going to be much slower than either svnserve or apache with mod_svn


65873
serialization	marshalling
5	
although serialization is used here it is also common for this process to be referred as marshalling


66072
perl	python
4	
open the file using whatever scripting language you prefer perl python and traverse the file until you find a match for your version


66125
callback	methods
5	
the api then at a later moment sends a callback and that methods might then traverse the table using the key which might be -1 in this example the error code


66508
silverlight	wpf
3	
every industry expert i ve heard on podcasts blogs and interviews recommend learning silverlight first and then gradually moving to wpf which is a huge ui framework


66599
lisp	common-lisp
10	
i ve also read paul graham s ansi common-lisp which is more about the basics of the language but a bit more of a reference manual


66924
json	xml
5	
according to yahoo s documentation for geoplanet requests are made in the form of an http get messages which can very easily be made using python s httplib module and responses can take one of several forms including xml and json


66963
osx	solaris
4	
chartdirector is available for lots of platforms win linux solaris bsd osx and has an api for lots of languages too perl asp .net java php python ruby c++


67213
joomla	drupal
10	
if you have to get under the hood and make modifications i m also a firm believer that drupal is a more friendly and elegant system than joomla


67312
multiplication	addition
0	0	
transcendental functions are always much more slower than addition or multiplication and a well-known bottleneck


67388
tuples	set
5	
tuples are the cheapest kind of containers in python they are also hashable so they can be used as dictionary keys set members etc


67714
http	https
5	
in reality users have been trained at least in theory not to submit pages unless they see the little lock icon so even the form itself should be served via http to get this


67714
http	https
7	7	0	
https traffic is much bigger than its equivalent http traffic due to encryption and certificate overhead and it also puts a bigger strain on the server encrypting and decrypting


67718
perl	python
4	
i prefer cxxtest because it has a perl python script to build the test runner


67798
line	lines
4	5	
works to match any from line but i want it to be restricted to lines in the body anything after the first blank line


67854
linq	linq-to-sql
10	8	
however if you ve got data that doesn t easily normalize the entity framework is more flexible than linq-to-sql but it does take more work to configure


67954
windows-server	windows
5	
this requires windows-server 2003 automated deployment services which in turn can only be installed on windows-server 2003 enterprise edition


68294
pointers	char-pointer
1	
is it something as hacky as mapping the mnemonic instructions to binary codes stuffing it into an char-pointers and casting it as a function and executing


68674
linux	ubuntu
1	
ubuntu is getting closer but there are still numerous things with linux that will keep the grandmothers of the world from using it


69059
line	lines
10	
the problem can be done in a constant number of line of code and whether the code is run on an x86 or an x64 the way i describe is more efficient


69121
controllers	controller
4	
i would suggest using a front-controllers based framework for this refactoring from personal experience i recommend spring and its controllers interface so that each controllers isn t a separate servlet but is rather delegated to from a single servlet that is mapped appropriately


69121
controllers	controller
10	
for the controllers it is better to do database hits all at once rather than attempt them piecemeal


69307
nhibernate	entity-framework
4	
i would recommend either nhibernate or entity-framework


69387
joomla	drupal
4	4	
the general consensus is that programmers prefer drupal whereas mere mortals prefer joomla


69410
elementtree	celementtree
10	
personally i like celementtree which is a faster c-based implementation of elementtree which is a dom-like model


69545
richfaces	icefaces
10	8	
there is icefaces which provides more semantic support than richfaces .also you can try nitobi suite which also provides similar kinda solution.if you are not satisfied with any of these i suggest try to write your own part extending the sun faces


69620
silverlight	wpf
5	
assuming you haven t worked in silverlight or wpf before i d take a look at our showcase 3 applications just to get a sense of what can be done with silverlight


70375
equals	gethashcode
2	
if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value


70375
equals	gethashcode
2	
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values


70392
bazaar	git
0	
is there a distributed version control system git bazaar mercurial darcs etc. that can handle files larger than available ram


70423
quicksort	heapsort
7	0	
but there are many citations of real world tests which show that heapsort is significantly slower than quicksorton average


70486
ruby	python
4	
if i was starting today maybe i would pick python or ruby but i don t know enough about them to make a judgement call


70708
distance	similarity
7	
after finding questions with words from query we might want to calculate distance between words we are interested in in questions so question with phrases similarity text ranks higher than question with discussing similarity you hear following phrases... text


70741
time	subtract
7	
in the second loop you can subtract 1 from the index instead of producing an unnecessary 0th output list element that needs to be shift ed off and where you unnecessarily iterate m n time where m is the number of output lists and n is the number of unique elements iterating over the unique elements would reduce the iterations to just n which is a significant win in typical use cases where m is much larger than n and would simplify the code


70881
multiplication	addition
5	7	0	
precedence rules specify priority of operators which operators will be evaluated first multiplication has higher precedence than addition pemdas


71290
unmanaged	c++-cli
3	
this sample code makes use of the toolhelp32 library from the sdk so i would recommend turning this sample code into an unmanaged c++-cli library with a simple interface like suspendprocess uint processid


71371
children	nodes
5	
the last parameter to builder.node is array list of othernodes to be appended as children according to the wiki


71743
tapestry	sitemesh
10	
i have used sitemesh and it is good for wrapping a set of pages in standard headers and footers but tapestry is better for creating components which are used on many pages possibly many times per page


71878
router	switching
5	
if things like spanning tree protocol are enabled on a switching then you may find that what may have been the router card to begin with may not be anymore


71955
linq	linq-to-sql
0	
i find i can do more with nhibernate and even castle than with the linq to entities or linq-to-sql


72087
conventions	naming-conventions
5	
the problem may be cause by vb.net c# projects using different naming-conventions for project assemblies and how the project namespace is used


72114
nhibernate	entity-framework
4	2	
i have not tried the entity-framework but i definitely would recommend nhibernate over linq to sql


72114
linq	linq-to-sql
0	
linq-to-sql likes to have a lot more control over everything loading the object and maintaining all kinds of tracking information about the object


72214
updates	updating
5	
you can start a replication by creating a database from scratch and you can control either theupdatess will be done by updating the available client database or simply recreating the database


72908
textbox	button
4	
so if the save button you are clicking on takes the focus then it will cause the update automatically because the textbox will lose focus


73236
php	python
4	
i personally prefer python but php will work as well


73305
windows-xp	windows
1	
if its not possible under windows-xp is it possible under vista


73514
linq	linq-to-sql
0	
is linq-to-sql or even ef better than raw sql


73573
thinking-sphinx	sphinx
4	
i recommend thinking-sphinx


73618
thinking-sphinx	sphinx
7	
thinking-sphinx has more concise syntax to define which fields and which models are indexed


74174
itextsharp	itext
4	
i can however recommend itextsharp which is a .net port of the java itext


74327
malloc	free
0	0	
this is also the reason why gc can be faster than malloc free


74337
progress-bar	progress
5	
you could use silverlight or flash or some custom plugin to allow managed uploads where you can display a progress-bar for example


74414
method-signature	signature
5	
what .net does understand is the idea of a delegate - a type that describes a method-signature instances of which represent either bound calls to specific methods on specific objects or unbound calls to a particular method on a particular type that can be invoked against any object of that type where said method adheres to the said signature


74420
delphi	c++
5	
basically you are enabling your .net classes to be called through com activex from your win32 code delphi or c++


74859
command-line	cmd
7	
it has cmd-line options that can be used to create external tools in visual studio but i ve found that the visual lint addin is easier to work with


74931
postgresql	mysql
0	
with correct locking for safety reasons and heavy concurrent use postgresql performed better than mysql


74992
zsh	tab-completion
4	2	
i prefer zsh over bash because of its support for very powerful file globbing variable expansion modifiers and faster tab-completion


75003
stringbuilder	string.format
10	
on a side note string + var is also more performant that the string.format approach generally that uses a stringbuilder internally when in doubt.


75193
vim	emacs
1	
i remember when i first started learning emacs it was after i was already very comfortable with vim and i was in the same or similar boat that you were where i knew how to get a lot done in another editor so as i started using emacs it was always painfully slow


75502
subclass	subclassing
10	
this does even more because it works for each item separately and not on their common subclassing v


75798
ruby-on-rails	django
0	
ruby has similar issues and although i do like ruby much better than i like python i get the impression that ruby-on-rails is roughly in the same boat at django when it comes to managing supporting the app


75892
innodb	myisam
1	
postgres is acid-compliant like innodb and when well-tuned nearly as speedy as myisam


76111
error-handling	exception-handling
0	
after all i think your error-handling process will be much smoother with exception-handling than trigger_error and stuff


76166
scriplets	scriptlet
0	
and if there isn t any re-use happening is a tiny scriplets really that much worse than the taglib xml


76507
copy-paste	paste
7	
faster and easier to get to than a separate cmd and has easier copy-paste support


76811
request	http-request
10	
in practice though most of this falls away and rest usually just refers to simple http-request that return results in json while soap is a more complex api that communicates by passing xml around


76977
submission	submit
10	10	
in this case submission the http request is far more important than the string which is the body sosubmithttprequst x is preferable to x.submitviahttp


77018
json	xml
5	
there is nothing useful in soap that can t be done with rest for transport and json xml or even plain text for data representation


77086
php	python
0	
i know that serving a python base webpage via cgi is slower than php because of its long start up every time


77166
php	python
10	8	5	
since python is far less ubiquitous than php i wouldn t be surprised if hosting developer and other maintenance costs for it long term would have it fit this scenario


77307
command-line	cmd
4	
i recommend gcc because it s designed to be used on the cmd-line and you can compile simple programs and see exactly what s happening


77328
bbedit	textwrangler
0	0	
i really do not get the appeal it s marginally better than textwrangler bbedit s free little brother but if you re spending money you may as well buy the better tool for a few dollars more


77794
version-control	git
0	
they both provide basic distributed version-control as in offline commit and merging multiple branches are both written in python and are both slower than git


77883
bazaar	git
7	
bazaar is imho easier to learn than git


78041
curses	ncurses
7	
for easier development the ncurses gives a higher level of control than simply sending characters to the terminal


78106
ruby	python
4	4	
as your question is tool writing and exploit development i would recommend ruby if you choose metasploit or python if you choose canvas


78217
php	python
5	
must be able to be accessed from any number of web applications on just about any platform windows nix php asp c# python django et cetera


78327
authorization	authentication
7	0	
your second solution of using ldap for authentication and a db for authorization seems more robust as the ldap data is controlled by the user and the db would be controlled by an admin


78462
expectations	assertions
7	
this gives more expressiveness for writing tests and also forces to think about the invariant expectations that your code should fullfill it s harder to write assertions


78498
line	lines
0	
however what you re after is a little bit more than this - you want to know if the latest versions of any files have line written by a particular user


78529
command-line	cmd
5	
the man pages can be found be either using a cmd-line man sh or by searching the web for shell manpage


78536
deep-copy	object
5	
how can i clone or deep-copy an object so that the cloned object can be modified without any changes being reflected in the original object


78892
32-bit	64bit
10	
note it uses x264 assembly syntax which makes it more portable to 32-bit vs 64bit etc


79420
syntax-highlighting	code-folding
5	
it has the stock standard set of features like code-folding and syntax-highlighting features etc but more importantly zeus is fully scriptable and zeus scripts can be written in java script


79522
32-bit	64bit
4	
if for what ever reason you have to use a windows box i would say grab 2003 32-bit the signed drivers are really only a problem on 2008 but even in 2003 i can t really recommend 64bit unless there is a pressing requirement like exchange 2007


79619
line	lines
10	
you can do some extra work to try and compensate for rotation and scaling too -- and in this case since comparing a few line is much less computational work than doing the same to entire images -- it won t be so bad


79628
local-variables	instance-variables
0	0	
i would hypothesize that the amount of effort increases dramatically when we try to understand classes with more than nine instance-variables or methods with more than 9 local-variables


79771
multiplication	multiplying
10	
multiplication is slightly more complex as it needs an integer multiplying followed by a scale back such as 0.72 2 becomes 72 200 becomes 14400 becomes 144 scaleback becomes 1.44


79774
set	any
5	
so for example if i have an expiry set to 08 march 2008 i want that value to be returned to any client - no matter what their timezone is


79857
base-class	inherited
5	
with generics you can create a class that will be able to operate given any of the types that inherited from a given base-class or implement a given interface like so


79867
expression-blend	blend
4	
especially if you have some flash background more interested in the interaction design ux i would recommend you to buy expression-blend than vs2008


79936
pointers	stack
5	
data created on stack can be used without pointers


80043
windows-xp	windows
0	
windows-xp was actually faster than windows 2000 in many respects


80113
pointers	stack
7	
freeing a block from stack is nothing more than adjusting one pointers


80113
decrement	increment
10	10	
the stack is faster because the access pattern makes it trivial to allocate and deallocate memory from it a pointer integer is simply increment or decrement while the heap has much more complex bookkeeping involved in an allocation or deallocation


80157
nsis	installshield
4	8	
on windows i prefer nsis from nullsoft only because it s less objectionable than installshield or installanywhere


80478
constructor	object
5	
when invoked as a constructor a new object will be created and this will be bound to that object


80609
ruby	python
4	
i prefer java or xslt -based solutions ant will do fine but if there s an easy way to do that in rake ruby or python please don t be shy -


80928
curly-brackets	square-bracket
5	
another case where you can see square-brackets or curly-brackets used - is in the special initializers where any symbol can be used like


81082
exit	debugging
5	
then when debugging with vs2003 or greater you will be told of any leaks when your program exit it tracks new delete


81223
malloc	alloca
8	
btw i would discourage the use of alloca since stack tends to be much more limited than heap use malloc instead


81628
set	any
4	
selecting any of the groups is optional so you could pick set a or b or both


81983
datediff	difference
10	
datediff becomes more difficult to use as you have more dateparts in your difference in your case looks like minutes and seconds


82270
annotations	mapping
0	
to the best of my knowledge you can do most of the stuff as annotations but the more complex mapping are sometimes expressed more clearly as xml


82634
java	groovy
4	
grails works because we can mix and match groovy with the existing java solutions


82749
linq	linq-to-sql
4	2	
i would always recommend nhibernate over linq-to-sql


83158
model	datamodel
10	
if i m exposing the same domain model in multiple ways web app web service ria client i ll lean to orm as then datamodel is then hidden behind my orm facade making a robust domain model is more valuable to me


83645
processor	processors
0	
note that for little endian processor that bytes words dwords qwords etc. map correctly to each other in memory main reason that little endian processor are better than big-endian processor ah i feel a flame war coming on...


83952
virtualbox	vmware
0	
also of note vmware forbids any type of benchmarking to be posted on the internet unless if they authorize the data you will not see any benchmarks that show vmware as slower than tech x the rumor mill states that you can see better performance with hyper-v xvm sun s enterprise version of virtualbox and xen


84253
distance	similarity
5	
the distance can be used to gauge the similarity of your tracks


84408
java	python
0	
and as for what makes python easier than java you might check out this question java - python


84504
javascript	dom
5	
as well an element you give a specific id to can be manipulated via javascript and dom commands - getelementbyid for example


84771
shared-objects	.so
0	0	
worse with unix elf linking these names will cause cross-linking between shared-objects .so a fooservice fault might be processed by the .soap_getfault for barservice corrupting memory if the fault detail structures are different


84893
.net	wcf
7	
wcf though has much better server throughput than .net remoting


85010
restrict	shared
0	0	0	
the code is riddled with classes which contain nothing more than public shared attributes variables and methods functions the result of which restrict the application from opening more than one project at a time


85130
backwards-compatibility	compatibility
10	
to support all the fancy syntax that people want in a language and preserve backwards-compatibility it makes more sense to add more languages to the runtime


85193
java	groovy
10	
but i think there are also genuine reasons for introducing new languages to the jvm particularly when they will be run in parallel you can use the right language for the right job a scripting language like groovy may be exactly what you need for your page presentation whereas regular old java is better for your business logic


85267
perl	python
4	
i d recommend python or perl


85386
opera	safari
5	
what may have confused the author of the thinkvitamin article is the fact that hitting enter in the address location bar in safari and opera results in different behavior for urls with query string in them


85414
virtualbox	vmware
2	
i ve been using vmware for a while and am very happy with it but i would like to compare it with virtualbox


85576
command-line	cmd
1	
i m not familiar with ruby but there s almost certainly some function might be called system just a guess that will invoke a given cmd-line


85578
editor	text-editor
1	
a really good text-editor with syntax highlighting textpad from www.textpad.com and sql plus


85641
lan	mac-address
5	
ifconfig can be used to display the mac-addresses of local interfaces but not those on the lan


85846
http	https
5	
and remember the page that displays the form does not need to be fed via http it s the post back url that needs it most


85846
set	any
5	
also you need to take care that any cookies are set to be secure so they will only be sent via ssl


85977
account	administration
0	
you can set it to another user account - for example crystal reports .net requires update and delete access to c temp - so we have a webmaster user with administration access and use that identity for those applications


86325
stderr	stdout
5	
note the abort message will be written to stderr as opposed to puts which will write to stdout


86346
.net	wcf
7	
my personal take is that the wcf approach is more clean as you can do contract-driven services and focus on messages not objects i m making a generalization here based on the default programming models of wcf .net remoting


86346
messages	communication
7	
when all you are doing is sending a messages like you are with wcf it becomes easier to separate your concerns between communication and the classes infrastructure that a single node is composed of


86497
jquery	scriptaculous
1	
we can say that we re stuck with js but is it really so bad with jquery prototype scriptaculous mootools and all fantastic libraries


86614
remote-debugging	debugging
10	
debugging is much more limited particularly problematic for server development is no remote-debugging


86977
unmanaged	c++-cli
5	
i ve read in nish sivakumar s book c++-cli in action among other places that you should use the __clrcall decorator on function calls to avoid double-thunking in cases where you know that the method will never be called from unmanaged code


87006
accurev	svn
4	
i ve used svn cvs clearcase base ucm ccc harvest but none of them can beat accurev s strengths


87271
asp.net	asp.net-mvc
5	
it s used by asp.net-mvc but can be employed in any asp.net application


87668
.net	wcf
5	
if you use a wcf service with a.netmsmqbinding you can receive queued messages without having to poll


87677
line	lines
7	0	
3 the project has more than 5000 line of code


87796
model	datamodel
7	
i m curious what seems to be the point in data size or application complexity that transactions frequently start becoming the source of issues causing timeouts deadlocks performance issues in mission critical code etc which are more bothersome to fix troubleshoot or workaround than designing a datamodel that is more fault-tolerant in itself or using other means to ensure data integrity


88100
udp	tcp
4	
for instance if a preference picks tcp versus udp have your conditional instantiate a tcpprovider or udpprovider which the rest of your code uses with minimal muss or fuss


88183
lua	python
7	7	
the python c api manual is longer than the whole lua manual including the lua c api


88494
project	project-management
10	
that kind of stuff sound like is lies more in the project-management domain instead of software used to track bugs


88798
asp.net-mvc	webforms
4	
it s going to blow webforms out of the water - we ve already seen how valuable a true asp.net-mvc framework can be in the java world


88810
asp.net-mvc	webforms
10	
the purpose and the goal of both solutions are different and aps.net webforms is more like a platform while asp.net-mvc is architecture framework so the question is a bit odd


88862
perl	php
1	
i ve had a lot of success with pdflib it s a very powerful library with php and c c# perl etc bindings


89153
content-management	content-management-system
0	
there are plenty of other content-management systems but moss incorporated the functionality of the previously name microsoft content-management system which itself often cost more than moss alone


89167
moss	wss
10	
moss is probably less popular because its not free and having used it for a year i don t see as much value in it as wss


89488
listener	listeners
5	
i created a vector so that multiple listener can be attached to this event


90010
processor	processors
5	
more queue processor can be added at any time


90039
.net	csla
5	
although the csla framework is written in .net the overall approach can be used in any language


90112
asp.net-mvc	webforms
5	
initially there was some buzz that url routing is totally decoupled from asp.net-mvc and it could be used for webforms


90181
width	display
0	
in the following example the bbar for the panel is display 2ems narrower than the panel it is attached to it s left aligned in ie6 where as in firefox it is display as the same width as the panel


90947
expression-blend	designer
4	
this also means support for wpf with a xaml designer although most people still prefer expression-blend for wpf interfaces


91047
linq	linq-to-sql
3	
if you have visual studio 2008 i would recommend skipping ado.net and leaping right in to linq-to-sql


91317
webrequest	webclient
7	
webclient is sometimes easier to use than webrequest


91718
member-functions	friend-class
5	
in some cases i wanted to test private member-functionss of a class so i made the test class a friend-class to the object to be tested but hid the friend declarations when building in non-test configurations through preprocessor declarations


91888
ref	out
1	
specifically it can be used for variable names that clash with reserved keywords you can t use params but you can use params instead same with out ref any other keyword in the language specification


92135
int	primitive
5	
now if you use primitive types instead like int or float and pass them as method parameters changes in object c cannot be seen by object a because object a merely passed a copy instead of a reference of its own copy of the variable


92324
pascal	object-pascal
10	7	
c++ is more standard you will find more code libraries examples etc. and you may freely use the stl and boost while object-pascal is more of an exotic language


92357
margin	margins
5	
this would be done by having a content container with a top margins big enough to hold the navigation and a right margins big enough to hold the sidebars


92359
common-lisp	smalltalk
4	
just compare let s say average php or visual basic programs and solutions in smalltalk common-lisp haskell and the like


92552
atomicity	atomic
5	
most lock-free algorithms or structures start with some atomicity operation a change to some memory location that once begun by a thread will be completed before any other thread can perform that same operation


92588
httpwebrequest	webclient
7	1	
a second option is to use the webclient class this provides an easier to use interface for downloading web resources but is not as flexible as httpwebrequest


92683
ruby-on-rails	grails
7	
gruby-on-rails is more domain-oriented while ruby-on-rails is more database-oriented


92868
json	xml
3	
the back-end doesn t matter much but i do recommend using json as your protocol of choice over xml


93159
attributes	properties
5	
partial classes are an option but if the properties i want to decorate with the datamember attributes is already defined in the autogenerated designer.cs file then i can t add the same properties definition to the partial class as this means the properties will have been defined twice


93401
http	https
1	
www.google.com is not accessible by http


93515
contains	elements
7	
each list has the same z number of elements so it will be impossible to make lists where z is greater than x and still fulfill the rule that no list may contains the same element twice


93673
suffix-array	suffix-tree
7	
a suffix-tree can take slightly more memory still linear though than a suffix-array but is easier to implement to build quickly since you can use something like a radix sort idea as you add things to the tree see the wikipedia link from the name for details


94042
request	http-request
4	
so what else could be happening that would cause the http-request to lose contact with the asp.net session


94070
datamapper	activerecord
10	
datamapper is potentially more complex then activerecord but it s a lot easier to develop your domain model and database asynchronous then with activerecord


95046
joomla	drupal
8	
in general joomla s admin gui is considered prettier and more user-friendly than drupal s but joomla is in my opinion a less intuitive system at the programming level and makes certain tasks more difficult than necessary


95046
joomla	drupal
4	
bottom line joomla tends to look pretty from an administration perspective but drupal tends to outperform joomla and be a more easily customizable system to achieve many of the things you really want out of a cms


95121
x86	64bit
7	10	
x86 is considerably slower a few clocks plus a clock or so per function argument while 64bit is much less because most function arguments are passed in registers instead of on the stack


95373
perl	python
0	
also python and perl are older than java and c# from the days when it was illegal to export cryptographic software from the us


95821
erb	eruby
4	
i see that it supposedly beats erb and eruby now.


95880
value	field
5	
keeping track of value passed in a form as a user completes a process like a site sign-up well that can probably be kept in hidden form field


96163
packets	ping
5	
it is possible for iptables i guess your suse has iptables firewall to be setup to let trough only ping icmp packets


96220
contains	any
5	5	
any files that are dependent on a particular module will be rebuilt any time the module class structure contains in the .h file is modified


96689
line	lines
0	
from a practical perspective i generally consider any select that ends up taking more than 10 lines to write putting each clause condition on a separate line to be too long to easily maintain


96744
ruby-on-rails	grails
2	
i favor gruby-on-rails over ruby-on-rails but learning ruby-on-rails will give you a more balanced perspective and actually open your eyes to overlooked things that are possible in gruby-on-rails


97114
constructor	object
7	
however we ve now added a dynamic dispatch call where static would suffice the object is larger even in the production version and we ve added a new failure path for foo s constructor allocation can fail


97300
cruisecontrol	cruisecontrol.net
4	
having used both cruisecontrol.net and hudson i can recommend hudson as the easier of the two to config easily done via the web gui though direct configfile editing is also supported


97373
getter	setter
7	
both languages provide it but c# properties provides a better design for it in regards to setter and getter


97375
code-coverage	continuous-integration
10	
a continuous-integration with a high code-coverage is better


97382
line	lines
7	
using python is more than syntactic sugar unless you enjoy writing or having your ide generate hundreds of line of boiler plate code


97401
arrays	linked-list
10	
someone with more knowledge of the underlying arrays vs linked-list implementation and how it ends up looking in the byte code could probably tell you whether appending to a linked-list with a tail pointer or inserting into an arrays is faster my guess would be the arrays


97459
mouse	click
4	
calling .selectall during the click event won t work because the user won t be able to select any text with the mouse


97476
.when	ready
5	
.when the feature is ready to be brought into main review the combined changes


97536
temporary	rvalue
10	10	
but there may be times where using a factory function like this is better for instance if the insert is conditional on some othervalue and you would have to otherwise unconditionally construct some expensive temporary even if it wasn t actually needed


98237
extend	methods
5	
javascript prototype can be used to extend existing objects much like c# extension methods


98244
getter	setter
1	
essentially if you have getter and setter for each and every private field you are making those fields as good as public


98244
getter	setter
0	
getter and setter also encourage users of the class to ask the object for some data perform a calculation and then set some other value in the object better known as procedural programming


98430
erlang	haskell
4	
so if the team want to choose erlang or haskell then management has the responsibility to the company to say no


98915
php	ruby
5	
it also can be used to process documents that are generated in another language php ruby which i imagine is not practical except to help in transitioning existing applications to use jaxer


98938
private-members	private
0	
in short private-members with direct getters and setters are little more than dressed-up public members


99157
.war	war
5	
you can wrap the logic in jython in a ear.war and then the deployment group is just seeing another j2ee bundle to be managed like all the other j2ee bundles


99228
for-loop	loops
5	
i agree that the for-loop should be used whenever possible but sometimes there s more complex logic that controls the iterator in the body of loops


99254
asp.net-mvc	webforms
10	8	
imo asp.net-mvc is much more dry than webforms


99337
getter	setter
10	
this is somewhat more nuanced than simply not exposing internal data - merely placing accessor methods or property getter setter between internal data and the cold outside world is no more information hiding than launching into a conversation about this friend of mine and his herpes problem.


99456
javadoc	doxygen
10	
javadoc or doxygen is more suitable if you want distributable code documentation


99520
contains	any
5	
the basic problem here as i see it is that an interop assembly doesn t actually contains any il that can be instrumented except for maybe a few delegates


99771
error-handling	exception-handling
10	
exception-handling allows more easilly to separate error-handling of normal behaviour


100050
cruisecontrol	cruisecontrol.net
0	
found it much nicer than cruisecontrol.net and for our team size it is free


100234
asp.net	asp.net-mvc
7	
i m primarily an asp.net developer but i find asp.net-mvc is a better way of creating functionally complex websites typically line-of-business type sites since it allows for better separation of business logic and rules from the markup used to display data to the end-user


100350
fxcop	mono.cecil
5	
smokey similar to fxcop and gendarme based on mono.cecil


100544
mobile-safari	safari
1	
i do wish more mobile devices had browsers as powerful as mobile-safari


100698
vb.net	vbscript
7	
if your old site is vbscript it s probably easier to go with vb.net


100741
vb.net	vbscript
10	
since you ve done vbscript migration to vb.net is more natural - you can learn the new syntax then move onto the framework and bcl when you are familiar with those you can learn the c# syntax as weel - being bi-lingual is always good


100937
common-lisp	scheme
0	0	
they are most probably much less mature than any common-lisp or scheme implementation but there are lisp dialects for .net l# and dotlisp


100978
spring	guice
10	10	
as for spring i would seriously check if guice is a viable alternative and then try to show how spring guice makes development better and easier


101194
lisp	common-lisp
5	
and somewhere in between it is likely that all of limp will be rewritten in common-lisp using the ecl interface making limp easier to maintain vimscript isn t my favourite and being easier for users to customize


101239
row	col
7	
row and col at first glance this seems more succinct than row_num and col_num and just as descriptive


101239
row	col
0	
reads as the row num ber is less than the max imum number of col umn s


101239
row	col
7	0	
at best reads as the integer loop counter for the row is less than the max imum number of col umn s


101381
hex	binary
7	0	
that s one reason why going from hex to binary is much easier than from decimal to binary


101612
selection	selected
5	
better to use a list and show people all of the options at once and it s better to not navigate away after aselectedion and or require a different button to be pushed to get to where they want


101673
highlight	cells
4	
refedit lets you select cells without actually selecting them it uses marching ants around the cells that you choose instead of highlight them and changing the excel.application.selection


101969
logging	trace
7	
using this trace method not only would i have to keep adding and removing keywords from in front of variables as i worked on different bugs but i don t think that it would be any real improvement over just adding good logging debugging messaging which is much easier to remove or disable when pushed to production


102146
operators	conditional
7	
vb 9 has the if operators which is much better and works exactly as c# s conditional and coalesce operators depending on what you want


102277
checkbox	button
0	0	
it sounds like you might be better off with radio button or if it s an explicit on off type of situation using a checkbox


102398
priority-queue	data-structures
0	
priority-queues are data-structures that provide more flexibility than simple sorting because they allow new elements to enter a system at arbitrary intervals


102398
key	key-value
7	0	
whose key-value is smaller than any other key in the priority queue


102670
hostname	ip-address
4	
i recommend hosting a cgi-bin which looks up the ip-address of a hostname and access that via javascript


102717
extjs	gxt
5	
i m working on a project right now that uses extjs gwt gxt not to be confused with gwt extjs


102938
bind-variables	procedure
5	
your application shouldn t pass sql into the database access should be controlled through packages stored procedure functions and values that are going to come from the ui and be used in a ddl statement should be applied using bind-variables rather than by creating dynamic sql by appending strings together


103030
submission	submit
0	
there is nothing worse than submission a form and getting back an error using ajax you can pretty much prevent this for everything but file uploads


103591
row	cursor
0	
doing some tests if you connect to a database even with a slow dynamic language like perl and perform some row by row operation on a dataset the speed will still be much greater than a cursor in the database


103754
category	categories
1	
obj-c is also quite fun to use once you learn how it works best delegates very different than .net delegates messages category and all the other oddities present


104139
javascript	dom
1	0	
long story short innerhtml is much much faster than dom even on modern javascript engines


104394
subclass	subclassing
0	
having to subclassing a winproc when you re more familiar with object inheritance is head-splitting and less than optimal


104770
mousedown	mouseup
0	
you can make more than one movieclip dragging at once using eventsmousedown mousemove and mouseup


104939
getter-setter	getter
5	
deletepersoncommand will have the execute and in the execute can check attribute that will be passed by getter-setter previously the call of the execute


105010
oracle	mysql
10	
a novice but competent dba should be able to secure mysqlmuch more easily than oracle just because oracle is inherently more complex


105287
nunit	mstest
7	
although several ci tools such as teamcity have better support for nunit probably would change as mstest becomes more popular


105817
timeout	terminate
5	
if you have solid proof using the query plan that the query can t be executed any faster than that then you should increase the timeout there s no other way to keep the connection that s the purpose of the timeout to terminate the connection if the query doesn t complete in that time frame


105981
authorization	authentication
5	
for example automation of authentication processes within an organization can quickly be developed without any code using sharepoint designer


106179
hostname	ip-address
4	
does anyone have a regular expression handy that will match any legal dns hostname or ip-address


106428
json	xml
10	
this approach would be similar to using json or xml but is more performant since hessian is a binary protocol


106496
omnicomplete	code-completion
5	
what s very neat about ctags is that it can be combined with vim with either the taglist plugin to allow source code browsing or with vim omnicomplete to enable code-completion


106826
json	xml
10	8	
in my opinion json is more human readable than xml and json.net gives the option to write nicely formatted json


107126
cell	cells
7	
this gives you more flexibility allows you to more easily increase the number of ways cell can link to each other and generally more scalable


107159
order	join
5	
the ol rule of thumb was columns that are used a lot in where order by and group by clauses or any that seemed to be used in join frequently


107415
http-post	post
10	
an http-post is more general


107568
http	https
7	
http is much worse


107691
perl	awk
5	
most awk one liners can be achieved with perl one liners - if you choose to get into a perl one liner mindset


107883
quicksort	heapsort
1	0	
for example quicksortaverage cost t n.log n and heapsort average cost t n.log n are both sorting algorithms with the same average cost - yet quicksortis typically much faster than heapsort


108398
.when	ready
1	
the downside is that release planning and velocity estimation is not as accurate as with scrum but this hybrid xp methodology helps developers focus on tasks .when ready and not waste too much time in meetings


108949
http	ssl
5	
and because it also detects ssl you wont have to worry about weather your resources will be sent over http or https if you ever add ssl support to your server


108959
multiplication	exponent
7	
it is probably the best you can do as a general method that works for all exponent values but for a specific exponent value there might be a better sequence that needs fewer multiplication


109038
subclass	subclassing
10	8	
puremvc is more invasive than cairngorm meaning that your code is heavily dependent on the framework you have to subclassing implement the framework classes interfaces but that doesn t mean that cairngorm isn t


109375
c++	c-strings
4	
given the choice there is generally no reason to choose primitive c-strings over c++ strings std string


109735
min	max
0	
if you really need very quick estimation you can do work breakdown structure with every task for 1-2 days or smaller and after this estimate every task by providing min and max estimated values


109861
postgresql	mysql
5	
i ve seen questions for doing the reverse but i have an 800mb postgresql database that needs to be converted to mysql


109879
xml-serialization	xml
5	
to increase performance the xml-serialization infrastructure dynamically generates assemblies to serialize and deserialize specified types


110341
packets	packet
7	
the tutorials i ve found online on using raw sockets all describe how to build a syn flooder but this is somewhat easier than actually establishing a tcp connection since you don t have to construct a response based on the original packets


110453
vmware	parallels
4	
i strongly recommend vmware over parallels as vmware supports 2 virtual cpu s i think it s up to 4 virtual cpu s in v2


110532
sql-injection	dynamic-sql
7	
secondly they both protect you from sql-injection only as long as you don t use dynamic-sql that is sql that writes more sql and then executes it


110845
margin	margins
5	
the current version of vs does not allow changing the tabcontrol s template but it can be done using blend and there is a margins on the template


111329
rsa	private-key
7	7	
other problems like finding a path that crosses every vertex in a graph or getting the rsa private-key from the public key is harder o e n


111329
rsa	private-key
5	
another interresting thing is that a sollution would be harmfull for public private-key encriptions like rsa


112067
authorization	authentication
5	
a mix between authentication users authorization based on reputation not likely to be accumulated through flooding throttling how many you can do a day the occasional captcha and finally community moderation to cleanup the few that get through - all combine to provide a decent solution


112088
tree	nodes
0	
for instance a binary search tree might have the invariant that for every nodes the key of the nodes s left child is less than the nodes s own key


112832
cakephp	symfony
1	
on the other hand there are many php frameworks out there such as cakephp symfony and codeigniter that take a load it as you need it approach


113025
insertion-sort	heapsort
4	
it s easy to see that there s a basic algorithm that matches any 2 of these three insertion-sort matches 1 and 2 merge sort matches 1 and 3 heapsort matches 2 and 3 but i cannot for the life of me find anything that matches all three of these criteria


113331
wxpython	pyqt
4	
wxpython has a very good demo and it can do pretty much anything which pyqt can do i would anyday prefer pyqt but it may bot be free for commercial purpose but wxpython is free and is decent cross platform library


113525
finalize	finalizer
5	
also assuming you re working in .net 2.0 or later it s unlikely you ll ever need to implement a finalize because typically safehandle can be used to wrap your unmanaged resources


113660
tail	logfile
4	
so i run a tail on the logfile and pick out the lines of interest


113879
c++	python
5	
edit i can t think of a c++ library with the type of pluggable persistence mechanism you re describing but i did something in python that could have had this type of facility added


113895
scp	ssh
10	
but using scp or rsync over ssh is probably better than ftp if you can


113908
width	display
5	
if you call getimage too early your component will not have been display yet and will still have a 0 width and height


114310
request	http-request
4	
i would recommend jmeter for making threaded calls to the http-request that your gui is making


114477
sql-server	oracle
10	
oracle s connect by is somewhat more flexible as it doesn t impose nearly as many limitations on the query structure as cte s do but if you re using sql-server this won t be an option


114549
contains	any
0	
any width less than the contains will work


115620
google-chrome	firefox
0	7	
until people have more experience with google google-chrome i would think firefox is a better choice


115838
png	gif
7	7	0	
as a general rule png is never worse and often better than gif because of superior compression


115838
png	gif
10	10	
there might be some edge cases where gif is slightly better because the png format may have a slightly larger overhead from metadata but it s really not worth the worry


115898
lisp	common-lisp
10	
there are bigger issues for example common-lisp has a more powerful object system so you can t map it 1 1 to object in the runtime no mi for one


116010
install	deployment
10	
2 on projects where svn is not install my deployment script is more complex it creates the version.php file locally zips the code uploads and extracts it


116038
std	ostringstream
5	
a fully correct standard-compliant and portable solutions could be constructed using std ifstream s rdbuf into a std ostringstream and from there into a std string


116063
tex	mathml
5	
tex can be converted to mathml for browsers which support it thus


116068
innodb	myisam
10	
you didnt mention which engine you were using which might be relevant in this case count is much faster in myisam than in innodb for example


116177
std	istream
7	
there were some reports that this method is slower than preallocating the string and using std istream read


116210
png	gif
0	
indexed png less than 256 colors is actually always smaller than gif so i use that most of the time


116326
solaris	opensolaris
1	
i think it is hard to quantify software compatibility but i d say code written for solaris is quite forward compatible with opensolaris kernel


116338
cell	cells
7	
the cells can be of different colspans so when the cell is dropped into the middle of another cell which is bigger the following steps should be performed


116347
csv	xml
4	
you really can t compare xml to csv because csv is an extremely limited way of representing data


116461
png	gif
0	0	
if your png files are coming out larger than equivalent gif files it is almost certainly because your source image has more than 256 colors


116490
solaris	opensolaris
1	
kernel modules in particular will be very compatible between solaris and opensolaris


116578
scons	autotools
1	
scons has a configuring mechanism that will do a lot of what autotools do without as much complexity and is pretty darn portable although not as portable as autotools


116739
md5	hash
8	
sha-256 uses 64 characters in the database but with an index on the column that isn t a problem and it is a proven hash and more reliable than md5 and sha-1


116864
contains	any
4	
taken from regexbuddy s library will match any line that does not contains boon.ini and or http


117321
generics	reference-type
0	
they also claim generics provide better performance than casting between reference-type which seems to be untrue no one can quite prove it


117340
heuristics	a-star
10	10	
be mindful that with the a-star algorithm at least you will need to figure out a admissible heuristics to determine whether a possible next step is closer to the finished route than another step


117370
logging	trace
5	
the logging application block has a instrumentation event that can be used to trace events you can find more info on the ms enterprise library docs


117440
config	app-config
10	
of course if you have very little config and are not concerned with multiple environments then app-config is more standard and is probably the best way to go


117533
export	report
7	
i strongly recommend working with a reporting tool that provides native support for export to pdf it is much easier for management purposes if you can start with a single format and report to handle both the printing and archiving of information


118016
min	max
10	
in addition the second syntax is more flexible if there are further aggregates which may be added in the future in addition to count like min some_scalar max avg etc


118460
command-line	cmd
5	
database migrations should be straightforward - dump the database on the server either at the cmd-line or through an interface such as phpmyadmin and export it back in similar ways phpmyadmin is recommended if you have no experience with the mysql cmd-line


118609
baud-rate	parity
0	
depending on the device you are trying to communicate with there may be more parameters than the baud-rate number of data bits type of parity checking and number of stop bits to consider


118904
throw	throws
5	
as an example the following code snippet will save the results of a call to perldoc into a scalar avoids the shell and throw an exception if the page cannot be found since perldoc returns 1


119132
32-bit	64bit
5	
also a library may be compiled under x86 with 32-bit ints and you may be comparing its components on a 64bit process would would give you a different result if you were doing this by hand


119414
unit-testing	assertions
8	
my experience is that assertions even if complex and time-consuming traversing the whole free list to check invariants are much less work and are more reliable than unit-testing esp


119458
line	lines
7	
by breaking up the statements onto many line it becomes easier to identify the culprit of a bug in your query


119538
32-bit	64bit
5	
the lua version posted above is faster but relies on the truncation of double to a 32-bit result therefore it requires the x87 unit to be set to double precision and cannot be adapted for double to 64bit int conversion


119892
markup	xhtml
4	
if you choose xhtml as a standard your markup will be more likely to be useful in an ajax environment


120140
ant	checkstyle
10	
on the other hand i think so many people use the same tools eclipse and often it is much better to have some things standardised at design time instead of build time - for example checkstyle is far more useful as an eclipse plugin than as an ant or maven task - that it is better to standardise on the set of development tools and a common set of plugins


120146
aspect	aspects
5	
virtually every other aspects of your system is more likely to be compromised than aes


120168
basic-authentication	http-basic-authentication
2	
dhh has implied that he prefers namespaces with http basic-authentication but that has remained a simple implication and not one of the official rails opinions


120278
8bit	128bit
1	
cracking an aes encryption is already impossible with 128bit key length


120345
checkbox	button
5	
you can then manually add servers that should be treated as intranet by clicking the sites button then advanced or tell ie not to automatically detect your intranet and selecting the other checkbox as appropriate


120530
vmware	parallels
0	
i never found parallels to be much faster or slower than vmware - it often would be a case of the state of the vm i was running the host machine itself and the app s i was running within the vm


121069
touch-event	touch-events
5	
although your development computer may not simulate complicated touch-events such as multifinger touches the simulator lets you perform pinches


121731
ruby	python
10	
i know of reia - a language that is based on erlang but looks more like python ruby


121765
account	administration
0	
but it would be great to have a resource with administration capability that does more than setup configure sites but the ftp account email account disk quota management etc


121855
.war	war
0	
this kind of question is more about religion.war than objective aspects


121929
controllers	controller
4	
i would tend to recommend this pattern be used for applications because it gives you a single place to handle things like authentication and often you ll need to integrate things at a tighter level where having new features be classes that are registered with the controllers via some mechanism makes a lot of sense


122033
ruby	python
7	0	0	
i wasn t trying to imply that linq is better than ruby python


122286
expression-blend	blend
1	
i don t mean to push my own questions but this might help you a little especially if you are not familiar with expression studio or expression-blend what exactly is microsoft expression studio and how does it integrate with visual studio


122410
selected	checkbox
4	
the user can select any rows desired by checking the checkbox on the row and you can get all the selected rows easily inot a collection to process


122424
git-repo	repo
1	
both of which are perfectly possible with perforce but the git workflow has some advantages. so although tributary development would be distributed and not refer to a common revision sequencing we d still maintain a master git-repo that all changes would need to feed into before a build was created


122571
jndi	jdbc
5	
edit sorry i should ve specified jndi to lookup the db connection and jdbc to perform the operations


122869
line	lines
0	
i suspect this has already been done but a simple implementation would be less than 100 line of code in your favorite scripting language


123002
constructor	object
5	
now before i started using an inversion of control container i would have created a factory and maybe even a simple objectsettings object for each of the objects that requires more than 1 setting to keep the size of the constructor to the recommended less than 4 parameter size


123030
subclassing	abstract-class
5	
i m more likely to build an abstract-class if i think there should be a creational contract specifically that a specific type of constructor should always be supported by subclassing


123076
metaphone	soundex
0	
edit double metaphone was specifically designed to be better than soundex and work in languages other than english


123307
elementtree	lxml
5	
as i understand it elementtree code can easily be ported to lxml


124248
aes	rsa
0	
algorithms like rsa are much less user-friendly than aes


124248
aes	rsa
10	
that is actually not the case with rsa which is --- more so than aes --- just a math equation


124248
aes	rsa
10	10	8	
block crypto algorithms like aes do suffer from this problem too but without a pki aes is no less safe than rsa


124347
base-class	subclassing
10	
this is downcasting and there is no sane down way to handle it for exactly the reason you described subclassing provide more than base-classes - where does this more come from


124357
processor	processors
0	
the difference become bigger with more processor


124444
line	lines
0	
rules like every function should be less than 25 line just don t work


124612
perl	python
7	0	
perl is generally better than python for quick one liners especially involve text regular expressions


124797
perl	python
5	
there is no advantage to be gained by switching from perl to python


124797
perl	python
5	
there is also no advantage to be gained by switching from python to perl


124822
sequences	unique
10	
create sequences which is more or less the equivalent of an orrible function that generates unique numbers when selected from as opposed to serial which generates the unique number when the row is inserted


124861
value	field
0	
if you honestly have more than 64 value in a single field your field might be getting more complicated


125467
controllers	controller
0	
using rails v2.1 lets say you have an action for a controllers that is accessible from more than one location


125569
updates	updating
4	
making any change to a row probably takes just as much i o as writing the entire row except of course updating indexed columns also requires index writes so you lose out by making severalupdatess which hit lots of rows


126056
public	protected
5	
some methods will be left private and tested implicitly as part of unit tests for the public protected methods


126199
sql-server	oracle
10	10	
oracle people will tell you oracle is better sql-server peopele will tell you sql-server is better


126267
sql-server	oracle
7	
imho oracle has better vldb support than sql-server for the following reasons


126267
sql-server	oracle
10	
oracle has better table partitioning facilities than sql-server


126267
sql-server	oracle
0	
oracle can be run on somewhat larger hardware than sql-server although one can run sql-server on some quite respectably large systems


126439
struct	unions
5	
it s trivial to find all the local variables in any given function and the size for each variable can be found either through the c standard for built in types or by calculating it for complex types like struct and unions


126926
.net	compact-framework
5	
edit i should have mentioned that this is specifically for .net compact-framework 2.0 which doesn t support assemblyfileversion


126957
line	lines
0	
writing a couple of line of test is quicker than debugging later on


127017
editing	document
5	
looks like i may just be stuck with downloading editing and re-uploading the document


127922
nunit	mbunit
7	
mbunit has compatible syntax with nunit but has more features especially data driven tests


128024
system-tray	tray
5	
i really feel that the caps lock button should be renamed free parking and oses should make a system-tray utility to quickly change the free parking button from escape to control to anything you need to type over and over again


128055
quicksort	shellsort
0	
if you use shellsort no extra memory is needed at all though shellsort will be much slower than quicksort


128068
set	any
5	
new projects in visual studio 2003 and later have the compile as c++ code tp option set by default so any .c files will be compiled as c++


128221
g++	gcc
0	
unfortunately g++ packed the structs significantly looser than gcc which caused significant problems sharing objects between c and c++ code


128259
tuples	set
7	
second if the set type is the better answer how do i key it to look at just the first element of the tuples instead of the whole thing


128488
magic-methods	getter
4	
php offers a myriad of ways to handle this including magic-methods __get and __set but i prefer explicit getter and setters


128488
getter	setter
5	
validation can be placed in setter and getter for that matter


129005
inner-join	join
4	
i prefer grouping my join conditions with my joins hence i use the inner-join syntax


129369
attributes	properties
5	
the system.componentmodel.typedescriptor stuff can be used to add attributes to typesproperties and object instances and it has the limitation that you have to use it to retrieve thoseproperties as well


129401
command-line	cmd
5	
the stdinparse utility can be used to call it from the cmd-line


129689
key	key-value
1	
structured configuration files use declarative syntax as simple as key-value pairs to identify what a string or value of data means


129944
union	union-all
5	
how about union-if you are using it can it be changed to union-all


130230
ssh	telnet
7	
ssh encrypts all communications does everything telnet does and more


130264
account	credentials
0	
amazon doesn t support more than one set of credentials per account


130678
base	zero
5	
when decoding the letters a truncated final block can be filled out with zero letters and converted to a 47-bit base 2 representation


131401
visualsvn-server	visualsvn
4	
i recommend visualsvn-server once you re ready to install.


131954
32-bit	16-bit
0	
16-bit arithmetic was faster than 32-bit arithmetic though the cpu could handle a logical memory space of up to 4 gib


132295
glassfish	weblogic
5	
my question is how this can be done in weblogic webspehre glassfish etc.


132729
command-line	cmd
5	
this would be the default scenario if you haven t done any tweaking of cmd-line options


132757
perl	python
4	2	
what are your own reasons to prefer python over perl


132776
line	lines
0	
so if you have a function that is called many times but only has a limited amount of code - a couple of line - you could benefit from inlining because the function call overhead might take longer than the execution of the function itself


132829
try-catch	exception-handling
5	
i m from the school of thought where try-catch blocks should be used and exception-handling not rethrown


132841
solaris	bsd
4	
personally i prefer solaris or a bsd for stability


132898
extend	methods
4	
at the very least you will lose stack trace information - the stack you will see will only extend to the methods in which the new exception is thrown - you potentially lose some good debug info here


133247
perl	python
7	0	
how to convince people python is better than perl


133271
inline	inlining
0	
if a function is static thus not exported anyway and only called once within your code and you never use a pointer to the function chances are good that gcc will decide to inline it automatically as it will have no negative impact the binary won t get bigger by inlining it only once


133461
perl	python
10	
show them how python oo is a better integrated to the language compare to perl


133789
tree	nodes
5	
next understand that if you have added or removed a nodes you may have unbalanced the tree


134149
constructor	object
5	
when invoked as a constructor a new object will be created and this will be bound to that object


134276
json	xml
4	
c# business layer - deals with taking user request submitted via http recived by an aspx page gathering the correct response based on the state of the database and returning it to the client via xml although i would recommend json


134331
error-handling	exception-handling
5	
i m familiar with some of the basics but what i would like to know more about is when and why error-handling including throwing exception-handling should be used in php especially on a live site or web app


134346
md5	hash
7	
using a non-reversible hash such as md5 is much more secure and you can store the hashed value as clear text


134359
popup	button
4	
if the program loses focus for any reason call comes in user switches programs user hits the windows button then i want a popup dialog box to cover the puzzle and the timer to stop


134374
element	document
5	
for example when an element is appended by anything to the document i would like to be passed that element to act on it like


134629
category	categories
4	
in a unit test file i m trying to grab this url using django.core.urlresolvers.reverse instead of just copying category dry and all that


134705
javascript	dom
0	
one key is to understand that javascript dom call are way slower than html parsing


134713
contains	elements
1	
by default html elements are as tall as required to contains their content


134934
zero	digits
0	
i want to display a leading zero for all numbers with less than 2 digits


135159
category	categories
3	
i d recommend setting category for the crashes blocking security php error warning vs exception etc


135198
perl	python
7	
perl has constants multi-line anonymous functions and autovivification but python has better default object orientation


135543
upgrade	versioning
0	
the subversioning versioning on the server is older than the versioning on my notebook so i guess my newer versioning somehow upgrade the working directories so they are incompatible with the old versioning on the development server


135545
inline	function-call
10	10	
you could argue that the iteration process is less efficient but a for _ each also introduces a function-call at each step which might be mitigated by trying to inline the function but remember that inline is only a suggestion to the compiler - it may ignore it


135577
linked-list	nodes
0	
adding to the end of a linked-list is o 1 but the constant multiplier is larger than arraylist since you are usually creating a nodes object every time


135656
php	python
3	
the everything-is-an-object model in python is what made me oo programming really click for me - and as a former php programmer and doubly-certified zend engineer i strongly recommend exploring python s oo if you want to understand what oo is all about


135834
shared-libraries	entry-point
0	
in python under what circumstances is swig a better choice than ctypes for calling entry-points in shared-libraries


136544
margin	margins
7	
this approach works if your subset is smaller than your total size by a significant margins


136858
duplicates	elements
0	
if however you cannot modify the input list at all and k is much less than n like 5 from 100 it would be much better not to remove selected elements each time but simply select each element and if you ever get a duplicates toss it out and reselect


137022
controllers	controller
5	
if you have followed a design pattern like mvp then it might be easier but if not then much of your business logic is likey going to have to be moved to controllers classes and much of it re-written


137232
command-prompt	cmd
5	
more details about managing the registry in powershell can be found by typing get-help registry at the powershell cmd-prompt


137812
templates	variadic-templates
5	
this makes things a lot easier and allows c++0x templates to be treated like a perfectly functional language using variadic-templates


137901
editor	text-editor
5	
and since they re simple text files they can be generated by any program such as scripting languages and if necessary even a text-editor


137962
getter	setter
0	
if my memory serves correctly the private keyword is the only way to create a privately scoped property getter or setter when its opposite has greater than private accessibility


138034
linux	opensolaris
0	
you also might want to consider opensolaris as it is from the same company which developed java in the first place and i ve heard rumours that it supports threading better than linux does and in java threads are quite important


138306
32-bit	16-bit
7	0	0	
even in scalar code loading 8-bit or 16-bit values is no slower than loading 32-bit since movzx movsx is no different in speed from mov


138423
line	lines
7	
fewer line means fewer bugs


138596
controllers	controller
5	
controllers methods should be as small as possible and all business processing should be done in model and view logic processing should take place in view


138650
command-line	cmd
4	
i always recommend darcs for this situation here s my answer to a similar question as its cmd-line user interface is a joy to use and joy is what i want from my own development


138944
json	xml
10	
json is a more compact object notation than xml so if you re looking for high volumes it has the advantage


139070
line	lines
0	
pypng is a single pure python module less than 4000 line long including tests and comments


139077
command-line	cmd
5	
it seems that for your situation it might be simplest to get pdftotext the cmd-line tool then you can do something like


139120
cakephp	codeigniter
0	
i suspect codeigniter doesn t have quite as flexible a structure it s smaller and lighter than cakephp but a quick look at the cakephp manual to see how behaviors components helpers and the vendors folder may be helpful


139218
double	int
5	
while you might find a solution that works for strings for numerical predicates you need to also make sure they re only passing in numbers simple check is can it be parsed as int double decimal


139478
sorteddictionary	sortedlist
3	
i recommend using sorteddictionary string tvalue or sortedlist string tvalue


139484
line	lines
5	
now line entered in shell 2 will be written to shell 3 and vice versa and the traffic logged to shell 1 something like


139546
vb.net	vb6
1	
the vb.net language is related but not compatible with vb6


139633
commit	rollback
5	
truncate can therefore not be rollback and a failure in the truncate process will have issued a commit anyway


139884
postgresql	mysql
5	
mysqland mssql both provide this functionality iirc so i would be surprised if postgresql didn t


140039
serialization	serializable
5	
imageicon implements serialization and it can be used to wrap an image class


140248
selenium-ide	selenium
5	
not every event will be recorded by selenium-ide


140283
asp.net	.net
7	
if it s a client app that doesn t use asp.net etc you may be able to use the .net client profile install which is much smaller c


140359
bugzilla	mantis
0	
it certainly looks nicer and has better usability than mantis or bugzilla but it s not open and it makes some tradeoffs for a simpler interface


140415
xsd	xml
10	
hopefully xsd is not the only way to validate a xml a much more simpler approach is to use relaxng and especially its compact syntax which is really more readable than what you could ever imagine with xsd


140469
ant	maven
5	
i think hudson can even be used to call ant tasks though a maven wrapper might be in order


140471
java	python
4	
for generic possibly malformed html there are libraries to handle that kigurai recommends beautifulsoup for python i know also tagsoup for java there are others


140501
height	width
7	
if the width is greater thenheight 3 4 screen.width then


140502
dialog	pop-up
7	
i think it s a better idea to show a div as dialog in the middle of your website because the chance that this is pop-up blocked is smaller and it s imo less annoying


140596
value	field
7	
i ve made a few assumptions as follows there are no overlaps of date ranges there are no null value in any of the field and the start date for a given row is always less than the end date


140655
constructor	object
5	
dependencies can be injected into object by many means such as constructor injection or setter injection


141184
tcp-ip	tcp
5	
more information about the original 1981 tcp-ip specification can be found in rfc 793 and the many other rfcs involving extensions or modifications to the tcp-ip protocol


141211
tcp-ip	tcp
4	
in the enabled protocols list select tcp-ip then click properties


141394
assign	add
5	
i don t know if anybody with enough rights to edit the answer will see this but while the answer is correct i would like to add that without specifying the collation explicitly the default collation of the database would be used in this case since it is implicitlyassigned to every varchar-variable without a collation statement


141747
cruisecontrol	cruisecontrol.net
1	
i ve had very bad experiences with cruisecontrol.net instability - going down randomly - so i like the simplicity of phing


141873
integer	short
5	
all of these operators can be applied to integer values int long possibly short and byte or char


142100
asp.net-mvc	webforms
4	
that being said i greatly prefer asp.net both asp.net-mvc and webforms myself - but i left asp development about 7 years ago


142156
set	any
4	
just remember that if you have a warehousing strategy of dropping indexes before updating a table then recreating them you will have to set the index up for monitoring again and you ll lose any monitoring history for that index


142165
entity	poco
5	
if you remove the generic constraint above where t entity you could make this a generic rules engine that could be used with any poco


142240
processor	cpu
10	
some fancy compilers understand the un interrelatedness of instructions to a limited extent and will automatically interleave instruction flows probably over a longer window than the cpu sees to better utilise the processor


142427
upgrade	versioning
7	
using compatibility as the central point in the versioning number makes it easier for users especially if te product is a library to judge whether or not they can expect a smoothe and safe upgrade or not


142565
contains	any
4	
the groupcontains w which means non-word character and - so the regex should match any non-word character or any hyphen


142666
calling-convention	extern-c
5	
you can also get this if you re loading c++ functions that need to be declared extern-c - c uses cdecl c++ uses stdcall calling-convention by default iirc


143714
double-quotes	single-quotes
5	
in php a string enclosed in double-quotes will be parsed for variables to replace whereas a string enclosed in single-quotes will not


143808
command-line	cmd
10	
for some reason using nmake from the cmd-line is slightly faster and linking the same application on linux with gcc is much faster


144467
stderr	stdout
5	
and use a component that has a prompt to show the prompt and enable input and a also follows the usual shell abstraction of having stdin an inputstream that reads from the prompt but can be bound to let s say files or so and stdout and possibly stderr outputstreams bound to the textarea s text


144610
pointers	stack
2	
since system.valuetype s children live on stack there is no reference pointers to the heap and thus no way to do a reference check you must compare objects by value only


144771
set	contains
5	
and just as a complete set of tax forms includes not just the main tax form but others that may need to be filled out additional schedules for example so a packagecontains not just the main classes but other classes it may need to interact with


145075
glassfish	weblogic
4	
that said one of the pluses of developing a web application in java is that the interface for working with the http is standardized the servlet specification so that you can pick any servlet container you want be it glassfish tomcat jetty or weblogic


145087
processor	cpu
0	
if its mainly cpu bound then i would create no more than 1 worker thread per processor core on the box


145151
managed-code	native-code
0	
in some cases managed-code can actually be faster than native-code


145153
ruby	python
7	
i d say the python community is larger and more mature than the ruby community and that s really important for me


145348
arrays	loops
10	10	
but the most efficient general way i could find is to use a foreach loops on the arrays shortcircuiting whenever a hit is found at least the implicit loops is better than the straight for


145433
maven	buildr
0	
and even though everybody says ruby is slow buildr was 2-6x faster than maven


145451
atomicity	atomic
1	
another interesting pattern is the presenter first pattern by atomicity objects


145544
hostname	ip-address
5	
in iis this will require you to either add each hostname manually however this could also be archieved through scripting or have a dedicated ip-address only for you site


145559
tree	nodes
1	
c# readonly and java final are nowhere as useful as c++ s const there s no way you can expose readonly complex data a tree ofnodes for example in c# without tremendous work while it s a built-in feature of c++


145881
submission	submit
5	
the content type multipart form-data should be used for submission forms that contain files non-ascii data and binary data


146336
contains	elements
5	
note that it is possible in principle to extend an immutable class and change the base fields if the base classcontains a reference to an array the elements within the array cannot be declared final


146463
java	python
5	
i d have to check up on how annotations work in java though but this stuff could easily be done with python annotations.


146627
ruby	python
8	
python s windows-support is much more mature than ruby s


146871
common-lisp	scheme
4	2	
i have decided that i prefer scheme over common-lisp so that narrows it down a bit


147392
vim	emacs
0	
emacs or vim is not significantly better than vim or emacs


147589
throw	throws
5	
when the constructor throw no destructor will be called in this case you don t show a destructor that frees the dynamically allocated objects but lets assume you had one


147636
request	http-request
7	0	
the onunload javascript event doesn t work every time the http-request takes longer than the time required to terminate the browser


147732
line	lines
0	
looks like the new line are having a much greater affect than the spaces


147889
splash-screen	splash
10	
the wrapper also provides better user experience through an application icon a native pre-jre splash-screen a custom process name and a java download page in case the appropriate jre cannot be found


148152
project	project-management
0	
think about project-management bug reports and it all adds up to something more than just cruisecontrol svn and nant


149028
http	ssl
7	7	
you should use tls ssl https so that eavesdropping on the http traffic is harder to perform


149122
oracle	mysql
1	
i m not familiar with oracle but in mysqlyou can use use|ignore|force_index see here for more details


149164
excel	worksheet
7	0	
your web server should use compression for this extension and your code should check if the number of rows returned is greater than what excel can display in one worksheet


149397
http	https
0	
in my experience servers that are heavy on dynamic content tend to be impacted less by http because the time spent encrypting ssl-overhead is insignificant compared to content generation time


149409
aes	3des
10	8	
3des is more expensive than aes for example


149445
http	https
0	
bottom line making lots of short requests over https will be quite a bit slower than http but if you transfer a lot of data in a single request the difference will be insignificant


149449
windows-server	windows
8	
you don t say what you want to do with the resulting data but if it s general queries for development maintenance then i d have thought remote desktop to the windows-server and then using the actual sql server tools on their would always have been a more productive option over any hacked together solution on linux itself


149913
openssl	cryptography
1	
for cryptography purposes you should use one of the standard cryptography libraries out there instead such as openssl which will indeed use dev urandom when available


149996
fso	filesystemobject
10	
but if you only want to copy and not zip filesystemobject or wmi is better

this means that from the user s perspective pages with plenty of static content will appear to load slower after the browser is restarted and from your server s perspective the volume of requests for static content over https will be higher than would have been over http

ruby-on-rails	rspec
10	
i ve just started reading the art of ruby-on-rails which covers some more advanced topics such as meta-programming api design and rspec


150489
private	instances
7	
i happen to like leading underscores for private instances variables it seems easier to read and distinguish.of course this thing can get you into trouble with edge cases public instances variables not common i know - either way you name them you re arguably breaking your naming convention


150798
line	lines
10	
regarding maintenance imho is better to change a single line of code the regular expression pattern than understand lines and lines of parsing code or whatever the regular expressions purpose is


150902
value	field
5	
how can an object be loaded via hibernate based on a field value of a member object


151079
firefox	safari
5	
this seems to be broken in firefox and ie but work in opera safari and chrome


151399
platform	system-requirements
10	
irrlicht has a cleaner api lower system-requirements and works better across platform than ogre in my opinion


151609
for-loop	loops
4	
i prefer having the option of using short local variable names especially for-loops variables


152099
dialog	pop-up
0	
currently we pop-up a confirmation dialog to prevent accidental deletes but we need something better than this


152159
controllers	controller
0	
its a good practice -- especially when you get to a point where the controllers will need to do more than simple delegation to the underlying dal


152228
controllers	controller
0	
hence you will probably be better off by using non-static methods for the controllers


152562
mouse	click
5	
the reason is that the one of the other border elements with a templatebinding of borderbrush was further down in the visual tree and was capturing the mouse click that s why setting the borderbrush to null allowed the checkbox to correctly receive the mouse click


152764
category	categories
4	
you may want to consider looking through all the documents that match category using a termdocs iterator


152777
minimized	minimize
5	
each child window can be maximized minimize closed inside this container but you wont find any of these in the taskbar


152867
line	lines
0	
line that are longer than the width of the screen


153155
attributes	properties
4	
you should be able to use a combination of labels and id attributes to pick out the correctproperties for your edit-in-place implementation to work


153164
messages	communication
5	
as much as 40 of your communication on the wire can be control flow messages and chat between clients asking for pieces


153299
space	input
10	
as you can see the form input takes up more space than plain text


153419
cairngorm	flexunit
5	
asynchronous testing cairngorm events can also be done with flexunit but is not as elegant as with dpuint


153588
textbox	checkbox
0	
from the user perspective a form that just does the right thing by figuring out what i want makes me much happier than having to understand a stack of textbox checkbox and dropdown lists


154616
line	lines
4	
i believe the aspstate database creates and destroys temporary tables as needed it does not have permanent tables you can query take a look at the stored procedures and you should find one along the line of tempgetitem you can either use this sproc directly or examine its source for more insight


154763
expression-blend	blend
4	
you can t buy expression-blend and design for anything but the highest level on the license and that just ticks me off


155612
processor	processors
1	0	
10 years ago disks were so much faster than processor that you didn t have to worry about it so much


155662
cos	radians
5	
that said javascript s sin and cos aren t quite as picky so you must have halved your radians or something


155711
glut	freeglut
7	
glut hasn t been updated for awhile but you can also try freeglut which is a newer open source replacement of glut and is included by several linux distributions out of the box


155852
serialization	serializable
5	
the rulescollection seems to have to be marked as serialization otherwise it does not retain its members


156009
perl	c++
5	
because of the more tedious way of adding hosts to be monitored in nagios it requires defining a host object as opposed to the previous program which only required the ip and hostname i figured it d be best to automate this and it d be a great time to learn perl because all i know at the moment is c++ and java


156188
line	lines
4	
if you do choose this it seems like you d need to draw thin polygons rather than regular line to get any kind of interesting look as in the crayon example


156198
command-line	cmd
1	
personally i m fairly comfortable interacting with mysql s cmd-line interface and haven t used their gui tools very much but i just downloaded query browser and it seems like it does exactly what you re looking for


156467
expression	brackets
0	
to me this is a lot clearer than the equivalent using repeated if else or a composite ternary conditional which gets very messy for non-trivial expression - brackets galore


156684
webserver	security
5	
can be used for security - pass in some kind of value to identify the client - from their the webserver will either deny or grant access to the client dependant on some criteria - maybe a lookup list


156818
.war	war
5	
btw jax-rs can be run inside any servlet engine - you just build a.war and deploy it there are examples in the jersery samples - though jersey also comes with a small lightweight web server you can use too which is a little easier to use - again there are examples in the distro of this


157151
png	ico
5	
furthermore setting the icon of the form from a png is an unessecary performance hit it should have been an ico in the first place


157238
jogl	lwjgl
10	10	
jogl is more java-like whereas lwjgl provides more gaming functionality on top of opengl access


157636
tuples	any
0	
you can programmatically build a select statement to see if any tuples point to more than one row


157636
tuples	any
0	
if that returns any rows your index is not unique since more than one row maps to the given tuples


158120
addition	modulo
7	
the .net framework includes math.ieeeremainder x y in addition to the standard modulo


158462
syntax	syntax-error
5	
if you don t enclose the json string in parentheses property names can be mistaken as labels resulting in unexpected behaviour or a syntax-error


158519
records	procedure
4	
in other words how can i find records that match any of the flags in my mask that i m sending to the procedure


158537
look-and-feel	user-interface
5	
communication between your user-interface code and your service can be implemented using any rpc mechanism named pipes work particularly wellook-and-feelor this purpose


158657
request	http-request
0	
alternatively for greater control over the http-request you can use winhttp.winhttprequest.5.1 in place of msxml2.serverxmlhttp


158853
progress-bar	progress
5	
this would return the size to the ajax and then a progress-bar would be sized and maybe display the uploaded size to the user


158997
actionscript	mxml
5	
that is rather than dealing with time and frames in flash one is dealing with describing where components should be placed with mxml and how those components work with actionscript


159002
actionscript	mxml
5	5	
so yes everything that can be done with mxml can be done with actionscript but not the other way around


159972
sequences	unique
7	
int is the better choice for the id column and better suited if you should use a sequences to generate the unique ids


160085
model	datamodel
0	
other sql engines provide a better separation between the datamodel and the storage retrieval system allowing for quicker changes of data and schema


160165
required	checked
5	
i checked the ..xoml.wfconfig.xml file and set the properties for required to true i set the content type to required and i used share point design to mark them as required


160592
java	groovy
5	
if you d be allowed to move to something java compatible yet has a syntax that s at least closer to perl than java check out groovy


160616
inner-join	join
3	
i would also recommend using inner-join instead of table multiplication select from foos bars


160631
authorization	authentication
1	
generally the frameworks won t do authentication by default you either have to enable it by creating some form of acl or by extending some kind of security manager type interface


160645
invoices	invoice
4	
it s sort of a hybrid control...what i do though is add a combobox right before the text box with options the user then selects invoices and then enter the invoices number...more a user friendly ui but some of my peers says it s an extra click


160834
ruby	python
5	
we have a couple of small subprojects in other languages java and ruby specifically as well as numerous python extensions that have to be compiled natively lxml mysql drivers etc


160942
division	modulo
7	0	
this is faster than using division or modulo


160996
throw	throws
10	
it feels like sometimes my throw clause is more voluminous than my method content


161061
pointers	stack
7	7	
stack allocation is much faster since all it really does is move stack pointers


161201
linq	linq-to-sql
1	
at that point i d thoroughly recommend playing with linq to objects for quite a while before you start using linq-to-sql or the entity framework


161332
asp.net	.net
1	
it aims to be totally compatible with .net so you d end up using c# and asp.net just the same


161559
cvs	git
4	2	
nowadays i prefer git over svn but it takes a while to get over the threshold if you come from cvs svn land


161572
version-control	git
10	
for that reason git gives individuals better local version-control


161630
line	lines
4	
but it will not show you the differences in the structure of xml file - it will just match line that look the same


161772
line	lines
10	
if you spread the parameters over multiple lines but have several on each line it makes it more difficult to find particular parameters when reading the code


161780
windows-server	windows
5	
however exchange server 2007 sp1 can be installed on windows-server 2008


161808
braces	curly-braces
1	
maybe not as bad as where to put your curly-braces but it s up there


161821
push	pull
1	
i am really comfortable with svn but for the current e-commerce project i am doing on django i decided to work on git i am using git in svn-mode that is with a centralised repo that i push to and pull from in order to collaborate with at least one other developer


162107
selenium-ide	selenium
5	
first off the selenium-ide is rather limited you should consider switching to selenium rc which can be driven by java or perl or ruby or some other languages


162312
inner-join	join
0	
the estimated query plan indicated that the basic inner-join would be 3 times slower than the nested sub-queries however when actually running the query the basic inner-join was twice as fast as the nested queries the basic inner-join took 297ms on very minimal server hardware


162991
swing	swt
4	
i will probably choose swt swing or qtjambi for the ui controls but i am wondering what to do with the graphical part of the simulation


163045
set	contains
5	
assuming you are using .net you can set up a .settings file to store your configuration data - the data contains there will be stored as default values for those config entries so even if there is no app.config file your application will run with those defaults


163188
subtraction	division
10	
we could leave them out since the priority is higher for division and multiplication than of subtraction but this gives us more readable code


163254
integer	short
10	10	
if i am writing a c c++ application that uses many numeric values that will always fit within the provided range of a short integer is it more efficient to use 4 byte integers or 2 byte integers


163265
linq	linq-to-sql
5	
the linq code has to be converted by linq-to-sql into a sql command for the remote data pulls - anything that has to be done locally cannot be included


163280
line	lines
0	
if you have more than 6 lines wihtout a blank line then that group is probably not a cohesive thought idea operation


163294
copy-paste	paste
0	
when a user copy-paste a line from a file however that is bigger than my textarea the overflow-x property does not work instead the textarea wordwraps the long line


163341
32-bit	16-bit
0	
if you are cpu bound 32-bit operations on a 32-bit cpu will be faster than 16-bit


163395
opera	safari
7	
when you don t set a font mozilla uses monospace by default ie uses courier new opera courier new with quotes safari lucida grand with single quotes


163411
cell	cells
4	
this icon allows you to select cell in the workbook to pull the data from


163414
adapter	adaptor
1	
the ruby simpledb library is not as complete as activerecord the default rails db adaptor so many of the features you re used to will not be there


163765
llvm	gcc
4	
if i wanted to publish the results as a doctoral thesis i would make a bigger deal about this and i would probably compare gcc tendra ten15 llvm watcom borland visual c++ digital mars icc and other compilers


164073
innodb	myisam
1	
i know with myisam tables you can get the table def update time but thats not so true with innodb and i ve found its not even reliable to look at the .frm file for an idea of when the definition might have been modified..


164414
line	lines
4	
i want to match line where there is a string of 6 letters but only if these six letters are not andrea how should i do that


164652
error-handling	exception-handling
7	
i m guessing your consultant is suggesting use a status variable instead of exception-handling for error-handling is a better practice


164691
getattr	setattr
10	10	
python introspection is more flexible you have access to an object s internal dictionary of attribute values and you have first class functions like getattr and setattr


165031
lvalue	return-type
7	
this is even more of an issue when the desired return-type is not void especially when used as an lvalue


165102
linq	linq-to-sql
4	
i want to hear about why you would not choose linq-to-sql for a particular project - including what project parameters make it unsuitable


165916
authorization	authentication
5	
the relationship between the user table and the roles table works exactly as it would with form-based authentication and should be utilized to grant appropriate permissions to users that you trust


166058
windows-server	windows
5	
sleep.exe is included in most resource kits the windows-server 2003 resource kit which can be installed on windows xp too


166196
aes	des
10	
i know you said you don t care about how secure it is but if you chose des you might as well take aes it is the more up-to-date encryption method


166440
aspect	aspects
7	7	
the repository aspects is easier because it groups all the repositories into one url for easier settings.xml configuration


166572
aspect	aspects
0	
well a camera is nothing more than where it is placed again a 4x4 or 4x3 matrix or a position and orientation plus some projection parameters field of view aspects ratio ...


166664
model	datamodel
5	
that can be used by any of the business classes in the library but the front-end ui has no way of directly accessing the datamodel ensuring that the business layer always acts as an intermediary


166754
asp.net	.net
5	
i installed mono on a gentoo server a couple of weeks ago just to find out that it can t run precompiled asp.net sites you be warned linux ain t made for .net


166787
var	this
10	
of course if you stop using var then you get around the whole problem and your code becomes more readable ok thats subjective but for something like this it s more readable by other people


166949
static-class	inherited
5	
in your question you are using static-class methods b.foo d.foo this cannot be accomplished using inherited because the static methods do not have a dynamic nature they do not take part in the lookup system


167392
linq	linq-to-sql
5	
lambda expressions can be converted to expression trees which allows for a lot of the magic like linq-to-sql


167871
cocoa	carbon
5	
the next release of eclipse should be based on cocoa rather than carbon which is the current but that won t be until next june


167905
sortable	scriptaculous
0	
mootoolssortables are actually better than scriptaculous because they are dynamic


167905
sortable	scriptaculous
4	
when a new item is added to a scriptaculous sortable you have to destroy recreate the sortable to make the new item sortable


167909
kinematics	particle
5	
i m interested in command-line applications even those that i can just execute and have spit out an answer without needing inputs for things like kinematics planar motion newton s laws gravitation work energy momentum and impulse systems of particle rotational kinematics and dynamics angular momentum static equilibrium oscillatory motion wave motion sound physical optics electrostatics gauss law electric field and potential capacitance resistance dc circuits magnetic field ampere s law and inductance


167922
mouse	keyboard
4	
the net effect of this was that it was very difficult to get two machines to boot up and work on the kvm switch and the switch would lose keyboard or mouse input on one or both machines every few days


168012
oracle	mysql
5	
for example mysqland oracle allow multiple nulls in a unique column or set of columns because null is not a value and cannot be considered unique null


168056
backwards-compatibility	compatibility
1	
one catch is that the jvm does not unload classes by default the reason is backwards-compatibility - that people assume wrongly that static initializers would be executed only once


168371
perl	php
0	
i work in php in the lamp stack so i don t have to handle bunches of external libraries the way i probably would if i was using perl and the projects i develop on lamp are usually simpler than my windows development


168628
json	xml
5	5	
json becomes a javascript object pretty quickly and doesn t have to be parsed like xml does


168692
project	project-management
10	
there s also agile project-management with scrum which is more for the scrum master and product owner roles specifically


168752
output	cat
5	
assuming that doesn t result in too many files for the shell to handle these will all be passed as arguments to cat and the output will be written to out.txt


169083
font-size	width
7	0	
instead of testing the width see if the height of the element is more than one line measured in ems since you ll be changing the font-size around


169234
unix	bsd
5	
mono can be run on linux bsd unix mac os x solaris and windows operating systems


169405
ant	maven
1	
if you re already familiar with ant and want the dependency management that comes with maven you might take a look at ivy


170008
put	get
5	
here s an example of how you can get that information using python and here s an example of it being put to use as a django form field which allows you to easily validate an image s existence filesize dimensions and format given its url


170452
atomicity	atomic
5	
an english sentence would be encoded into ...language-neutral atomicity elements of meaning ... which could then be reconstituted into any language with a structured syntactic form and grammatical structure


170479
value	field
7	
the problem is you can t really tell the user how many characters are allowed in the field because the escaped value obviously has more characters than the unescaped one


170669
apache	squid
7	7	
apache itself can be configured to function this way although if you are on linux or unix squid is the better option as it is specifically designed to do this very job


170938
request	http-request
5	
for php what is the default time after which an http-request is deemed to have timed out


170948
common-lisp	scheme
0	
here is a solution in scheme because i know that better than common-lisp and have an interpreter for checking my work


171213
linux	unix
5	
if it cannot be done platform-independently linux unix is a priority for me


171436
timeout	response
7	
as for the read timeout that is trickier you need it to be low so you don t exhaust your pool of workers who are waiting for the remote service to return but you also don t want it so low that it closes the connection before reading a response


171876
commit	rollback
5	
it is my understanding that when the crashed node comes back its transaction will have been rollback since it never got the commit message


172177
apache	lighttpd
10	10	
the benefit of both apache is more powerful and extensible useless if you don t need that power but anyway... and lighttpd is faster at static content


172225
.when	ready
7	
.when you re ready to submit use the check consistency file | more option to create a changelist on the basis of the modified files


172239
http-post	post
10	
actually changing the content of the image to a binary response from an http-post is much more involved - although you could look into base64-encoding the response stream and using the data url scheme to display the resulting image in your page


172363
set	any
4	
you can match any number of nested parens through brute force but you can t ever match an arbitrarily long set of nested brackets


172525
logging	trace
7	
log4net is a richer and more flexible way of tracing or logging than the in-built trace or even asp health monitoring


172721
processor	processors
5	
for instance one of the recommendations is to use elements when your data must not be normalized for white space as xml processor can normalize data within an attribute thereby modifying the raw text


172727
sql-server	mysql
4	
the microsoft stack does favor sql-server when no other spec is given and lamp favors mysqlbut i don t see it as being that strong of a bond


172734
processor	processors
0	
i had a nice 4 processor machine that wouldn t use more than 1.2 processors at a time


172933
binary-tree	tree
5	
join operations can be translated to binary-tree operations by merging trees


173193
packets	packet
5	
it does not control which interface will be used to send the packets the kernel s routing table will be consulted to determine which interface has the lowest cost to reach a particular destination


173236
default-value	default
5	
i agree with many of the answers above and also believe that null can be used where appropriate in a normalized schema design - particularly where you may wish to avoid using some kind of magic number or default-value which in turn could be misleading


173276
value	field
5	
for example if i have a single-bit field isready it may make perfect sense for this field to have a default value of false and null not be allowed but this implicitly asserts that we know that the whatever is not ready when in fact we may have no such knowledge


173548
accurev	clearcase-ucm
4	
we evaluated it alongside with plastic scm svn and clearcase-ucm that we already owned and used and decided to dump clearcase and svn both were used in two different groups and to purchase accurev


173638
wordpress	wordpress-plugin
4	
i prefer syntax highlighter implementations i m using wordpress-plugin implementation for my blog


173718
profiling	instrumentation
0	
however even with rdtsc you will be including the time your code was switched out of execution while a better solution than using time clock if you need an exact measurement you will have to turn to a profiling that will instrumentation your code and take into account when your code is not actually executing due to context switches or whatever


173765
managed-code	native-code
10	
i would have thought that it would be clear cut whether memory allocation is faster in managed-code than in native-code - but there seems to be some controversy


174016
procedural	procedural-programming
7	7	
there are many cases where procedural-programming makes more sense than oop an converting for the sake of converting could be as you said overkill


174197
controllers	controller
5	
if you re truly using mvc then your controllers should intercept the particular action that should be taken invoke any data-related requests and shove the data into your model objects so that the model can then be placed into the view


174331
shell	bash
7	
will work fine in bash if you re aiming for portability across various unix environments where you can t be sure that the default shell will be bash and whether it supports the -z test condition it s safer to use the form if x some_var x since that will always have the intended effect


174348
http	https
5	5	
will content requested over http still be cached by web browsers or do they consider this insecure behaviour


174577
code-coverage	gallio
4	
i would highly recommend gallio formally mbunit for unit testing and unfortunately not free ncover for code-coverage


174902
command-line	cmd
10	
especially git is much more efficient but you ll probably need a little more time to wrap your head around the concepts of distributed source control and you have to live without fancy gui tools for now also the cmd-line tools have become much more usable lately


174920
width	frame
7	
are you sure the frame fits completely within the screen and contentsize s width is not greater than the scroll view s width


174959
erb	eruby
1	
you do need a ruby enabled server such as apache running eruby erb


175161
sign	signing
4	
in visual studio open your project s properties and go to the signing tab select sign the clickonce manifests and create test certificate


175182
line	lines
7	
in general when i keep line short it makes better decisions as to how to format the code


175266
getter	setter
0	
in this case i would argue that using functions to perform the action and update the state is better than having a setter getter that performs an action as a side-effect of updating the property


175422
background-image	background-position
0	
it s pretty simple the core principle is that you create an image larger than the element set the image as a background-image and position it using background-position so only the bit you want is visible


176043
unsigned	short
10	
the arrays module is more like a thin wrapper over c arrays which give you kind of strongly typed containers see docs with access to more c-like types such as signed unsigned short or double which are not part of the built-in types


176110
min	max
5	5	
for a more complicated answer there is such a thing as sample counting clipping detectors that require x consecutive samples to be at the max min value for them to be considered clipping where x may be as high as 7


176144
firefox	safari
10	
third in my experience going from safari to firefox is usually less problematic than the other way around


176465
space	input
1	
that being said output buffering might be just a tiny bit faster as the space allocated for the input is fairly large by default 40k according to this


176644
google-chrome	firefox
5	
my understanding is that this was an ie-only property that the other browsers picked up and isn t currently in any standards so i d be surprised if firefox and google-chrome support it but ie stopped


176913
integration-testing	testcase
5	
the method getunittestclasses should be rewritten to add all project classes extending testcase except if the class name ends in integration-testing


177346
hide	show
7	0	
however slapping labels on methods is faster than building logic to show hide buttons or do security validation in code


177375
driver	kernel
5	
most of the stuff can be done in interop but you need a driver to get the filename cause it lives in the kernel s address space


177532
verilog	vhdl
4	
do you prefer vhdl or verilog and why


177565
verilog	vhdl
7	
vhdl is more popular in europe and verilog is dominating in the us


177844
ruby	python
1	
as far as i can tell vhdl vs verilog gets just as religious as ruby vs python or java vs c#


178111
.when	ready
5	
i guess that will be released .when it s ready


178535
upgrade	versioning
5	
to build business objects there is a lot of leg work that needs to be done and this should be tackled by a code generator. i m not using one though as i still want to get a grip of the framework the latest versioning of csla 3.5 cuts down the amount of code in properties and we have upgrade because of this


178555
verilog	vhdl
4	
once you re ready to choose an hdl i heartily recommend verilog having learned vhdl first


178555
verilog	vhdl
0	
yes vhdl was once much more feature-rich than verilog but later revisions of the language verilog 2001 verilog 2005 systemverilog etc.. have cherry-picked most of the interesting features and there is far more robust toolchain support for verilog and its variant these days in addition to it being the dominant language in use in the us in my experience vhdl is only used here when dealing with extreme legacy blocks and in academic contexts partially due to the tools support mentioned previously


178620
int	unsigned-integer
5	
if the creation of orders customers will always be centralized an unsigned int would be fine


178700
adapter	adaptor
7	
this is rather easier to program to and easier to read since you don t have to write empty implementations of listener callbacks that you re not interested in and yes i know about listener adaptor superclasses


178815
.net	compact-framework
1	
note that the assemblyfileversion attribute is not available under .net compact-framework


179002
logging	configuration
5	
logging behavior can be controlled by editing a configuration file without touching the application binary


179056
adapter	adaptor
7	0	
why this is better than subclassing an adaptor i have no idea


179119
windows-xp	windows
5	
what i found annoying is that ctrl-space input will be stolen by windows-xp to switch the language bar instead of setting the mark in emacs


179466
command-line	cmd
5	
it s cmd-line and will eventually be run on mono


179520
google-chrome	safari
7	
google google-chrome also uses an earlier version of webkit than the current safari so pages should be checked in both browsers


179634
virtual-machine	vmware
7	
unsavvy users might get caught by behaviors like vmware s player that changes mac and other ids of the virtual-machine when you move it presumably in a nod to this kind of issue


179655
compatibility	binary-compatibility
10	
why binary-compatibility is better or...why you shouldn t do what we do


179699
google-chrome	safari
1	
this would be a similar question to does google-chrome render the same as konqueror and altho the webkit html renderer versions may be different the java script engines are very different between google-chrome safari and konqueror


179843
sql-server	oracle
1	
while this is going back many years at a time when the cost of entry into a sql-server installation was as prohibitive as oracle one of my clients was using access to try to manage an inbound call center


179849
unix	solaris
5	
the tools need to be accessed from windows linux various unix s vms and solaris


179942
linq	linq-to-sql
10	
coming from a rails background castle project ar will feel closer to what you re used to but linq-to-sql is better integrated with the whole microsoft ecosystem and you may find this is worth the extra effort to learn it


179971
command-line	cmd
7	
or and if you do not have access to the source or if this is easier you can simply pass the system properties above into the jvm by adding these options to the cmd-line


180099
json	xml
7	0	
json is smaller and simpler than xml


180112
json	xml
8	
xml has a bit more overhead than json because of the angle brackets and extra information and what not


180119
base-class	inherited
5	
so for this i decided to make a base-class which all other objects that will need to be rendered will inherited called gameobject


180358
delphi	vb6
10	0	
i like the vcl gui stuff delphi seems more suited to windows api calls than vb6 i really like the fact that it s much better at oo than vb6 and i like the unit-testing framework that comes with the ide


180411
delphi	c++
10	10	10	
of course java sintax is more like c++ than like delphi but i think that the object model is more similar to delphi


180488
linq	linq-to-sql
5	
the following approach a inner join works in linq to objects but can not be translated to sql with linq-to-sql


180497
delphi	c++
4	2	
even if you don t use that garbage collecting memory manager i would still recommend delphi over c++


180497
delphi	c++
4	2	
for excel add-ins as you mentioned in your comment i would recommend delphi over c++ builder because it has better com support which i believe you need for excel add-ins


180528
c++	python
5	
python has for example a wonderful solution with jpype that automatizes the process although the same solution cannot be applied to c++ due to c++ and python different natures


180542
sequence	numbers
5	5	
for anything more complex i would worry as mocks generated from mocking frameworks can be given precise expectations about how they will be used the numbers of methods called the precise sequence and the parameters expected each time


180633
base-class	inherited
5	
dag bruck proposed this extension calling the base-class inherited. the proposal mentioned the multiple inherited issue and would have flagged ambiguous uses


180706
linq	linq-to-sql
5	
local collections can be used in linq-to-sql with the contains method


180724
delphi	c++
10	10	10	
although superficially the syntax of c++ looks more like that of java delphi s object model is actually closer to that of java


181153
firefox	safari
5	
edit olliej sigh nevermind this only works in safari and ie and i can t be bothered downloading a firefox nightly to see if it exists in trunk -


181200
progress-bar	progress
0	
when a bank account transfer of a large sum of money takes longer than a transfer of a small amount as indicated by the progress-bar showing increasing amounts being transferred


181274
line	lines
0	
its syntax is quirky and it wasn t created with the abstractions necessary for projects of more than 100 line or so in mind


181279
tcp-ip	tcp
10	
how then is tcp-ip supposed to notify the developer if packet delivery fails permanently the destination host is no longer reachable


181341
http	https
1	
a big fat open proxy is not good over http either but with authentication required it feels fine to me


181341
http	https
5	
http goes through a proxy -- i m not too concerned about my traffic being sniffed as it s ssh that ll be going plaintext through the tunnel -- but it s a lot more likely to be mangled than https which fundamentally cannot be proxied


181401
arguments	default
4	
go into window - preferences then select java - installed jres clone the jre used by tomcat and add the following to the default vm arguments


181698
selection	cells
5	
if you only wanted to trap selection of a single column of cells you could insert a hidden column to the right extend the selection to include the hidden cell to the right when the user clicked and this gives you an editable cell which can be trapped every time it is clicked


181920
moss	wss
8	
moss considerably more expensive than wss which ships as part of microsoft server licensing


181973
commit	rollback
1	
happily you can use sql dcl begin transaction commit transaction rollback transaction etc to acomplish things not possible with dao nested transactions


182008
apache	lighttpd
5	
yes lighttpd can also be used as frontend to apache and or fastcgi


182447
environment	configuration
10	
in practice i ve found that even when developing something that you do have control over the environment it will be run on over time it is better to give someone else the capabilities to change the configuration


182822
rounding	currency
5	
however if you are multiplying your currency numbers by floating-point types or dividing your currency values the rounding does need to be worked out one way or the other


183173
oracle	mysql
7	
specific performance tuning methods vary by database but in general avoid returning more records or fields than you actually need make sure all join fields are indexed as well as common where clause fields avoid cursors although i think this is less true in oracle than sql server i don t know about mysql


183209
unmanaged	managed-code
5	
anyone have pointers for properly handling this situation so that the resources in unmanaged-code can be cleaned up and a usable exception can be thrown out to the managed-code which initiated the whole call stack


183290
ant	maven
10	
as you ve already said ant is more a replacement for gnu make while maven is primary a buildout dependency-management application


183657
sql-server	oracle
10	8	
i ll state my bias upfront - oracle is far more complex than sql-server


183660
serialization	serializable
5	
exceptions should be marked serialization


183667
runtimeexception	checked-exceptions
0	
similarly error should throw further than runtimeexception and runtimeexception further than checked-exceptions


183846
braces	curly-braces
3	
so i m trying to match balancing curly-braces where some of the opening curly-braces have an optional word followed by a colon


184027
atomicity	atomic
5	
basically the design we have says that all such changeds have to be made in atomicity complete operations that are called do their work and return


184056
ant	maven
4	
i find it most disturbing to see so few people around here are actually using maven or at least ant though i prefer maven for the dependency handling.


184293
line	lines
10	
on the other hand if one project is 10 000 line of code and the other is 1 000 000 line the second project is significantly more complex in general


184371
line	lines
5	
i heard that microsoft used to fire 5 of people every 6 months i always imagined it would be based on line of code written which is why windows is so bulky slow and inefficient


184501
windows-vista	windows
4	
i personally recommend truecrypt for thumb drives and other portable media and windows-vista now include bitlocker which provides a different level of protection


184861
value	field
5	
these field may be stored either by value or by reference a pointer to a value


185281
request	http-request
5	
otherwise depending on your system encoding the request line and headers of your http-requests might be malformed wrong encoding


185315
logging	shutdown
8	
try finding out more info by logging asp.net application shutdown events


185825
public	protected
5	
in flex and many other languages a function method of a class can be declared private or protected or public


185836
method-signature	signature
5	
however unlike anonymous types tuples have names and can be used inside public method-signature


185997
symlink	hardlink
5	
any symlink to the file in bin would be broken by this but a hardlink being a link directly to the inode for the file wouldn t care


186099
for-loop	loops
7	
this looks like more of a limitation in the size of the arguments programs can receive because the in the for-loops works alright


186661
order	add
5	
jobs consist of a series of steps to be executed in order and when you add a new step to your job you can choose various types of step including transact-sql script


186788
sql-server	oracle
5	
as others have suggested there is some significant difference in things you would do compared to sql-server if you just apply what you know from sql-server to oracle you ll likely kill performance


186794
short-circuiting	condition
5	
mathematically let s be cost of short-circuiting condition f cost of full condition and p be percent of cases where short-circuiting happens full condition is not necessary


186990
configobj	configparser
7	
i ve heard that configobj is easier to work with than configparser


187079
.net	wcf
5	
it seems that you are expecting internal classes used in the wcf service which you have marked as datacontracts to be exported as .net objects to your client code the silverlight ui


187227
linux	solaris
0	
from memory solaris kept the mtoolkit as the default longer than on linux


187601
cygwin	gnu
4	
if you want to use win32 ports of some unix utilities rather than installing cygwin i recommend gnu utilities for win32


187713
int	unsigned-integer
5	
if a 8-bit unsigned int were to be used for fixed-point math then the fractional part would be split into 256 evenly divisible parts


187939
arguments	default
7	7	
if creating constructors with arguments is bad as many would argue then making them with default arguments is even worse


188242
oracle	postgresql
5	
i can understand why not all data types would be supported from mysql oracle postgresql sql and so forth


188415
line	lines
8	
the situation where the two line have different behavior is when your script is not running in bash but some simpler shell in the sh family dash which i believe is used as bin sh in some linux distros because it is more lightweight than bash


188871
contains	any
5	
it generates random words sentences using determinated rule you choose the sitecontains very funny things but in italian only the rules can be written in any language.


189058
ms-access	sql-server
10	
an in-process db like sql-server compact or ms-access is much more appropriate


189154
line	lines
0	
personally i think it s very difficult to adhere to these types of requirements sometimes you just really need a method with more than 20 line but in the spirit of your question i ll mention some of the guideline used in an essay called object calisthenics part of the thoughtworks anthology if you re interested


189526
osx	linux
4	
if you do i would recommend mono which is a .net free implementation or java both platforms work well in windows osx linux


189604
inner-classes	anonymous-inner-class
7	
choosing between anonymous inner-classes and these named inner-classes is a largely a matter of style but i think this version is easier to understand and clearer when there are lots of actions


189644
linq	linq-to-sql
5	
the application will be built on asp.net c# linq-to-sql server


189811
data-access	business-objects
5	
if this is a factory on your data-access layer which will be used to populate business-objects with data from the database then yes this is the place to do it


190304
command-line	cmd
1	10	
keep in mind that there are not many differences between sqlmetal and the designer the designer is a more pretty ui for sqlmetal and hides many of the cmd-line switches


190603
line	lines
0	
lines longer than 200 characters will appear in more than one line


190913
subclass	subclassing
0	
making abstract classes before i had more than one subclassing in mind for them


190929
triggers	insert
5	
you can either do it at runtime by getting a list of uuids from tableina and tableinb and working out which entries are new or you can have a table of items that need to be synced populate with a triggers upon insert update in tableina and run from that


191091
project	project-management
5	
after this time the only way strings were allowed to be changed was with permission from a very senior member of the project-management team


191318
.when	ready
10	
in some cases that s exactly what you want in others you might find that listening for .when the dom is ready is more appropriate - this event is similar to onload but fires without waiting for images etc


191440
line	lines
4	
this is probably a bit better then grep -c as it doesn t try to match line to a pattern


191465
processor	cpu
7	
on my dev machine i use a quad core cpu and although our project has more than 1200 files it is still easily processor limited during compile time although a faster hard drive would still help speed things up


191806
windows-vista	windows
5	
temp in windows-vista are different from windows xp which should of course be taken into account when developing software that will have to run under windows at some point


191824
windows-vista	windows
2	0	
a lot of companies are ignoring windows-vista and are planning to upgrade to the next windows version when it comes out in the hopes that it will suck less than windows-vista


191899
line	lines
0	
it may be of some use it s pretty short - should be less than 100 line of code in total when done..


191909
backwards-compatibility	compatibility
4	
this is fine for existing customers but new ones would see this hierarchy as needlessly complex and if i were designing it from the beginning i would not opt to implement it this way -- i have to or else i will lose backwards-compatibility


192156
coalesce	isnull
4	
other rdbms would prefer coalesce instead of isnull


192254
set	any
5	
assign the property to an initial value which can be distinguished from any other value that it might be set to null for reference types


192409
contains	elements
4	
thing2k s answer is pretty good but i d seriously recommend having code to contains child ui elements in the base uielement class


192409
textbox	button
0	
if you don t support this in the base class you ll run into major problems when you try to implement anything more complex than a textbox and a button


192694
ruby	python
10	
in general monkey patching is less used in python than in ruby


192806
set	any
5	
if you want a keyboard shortcut to be used from any control on the form without using a toolbar set


192960
selection	selected
4	
this really causes a problem if all the items are selected or the next item the user wants to select was part of the current selection


193887
perl	ruby
7	
i think the biggest difference is that ruby is much more similar to perl in terms of useage


194130
ant	maven
0	
it is much better than ant because for most common tasks you don t have to write a complicated build.xml maven has very good defaults and it s all convention over configuration


194159
windows-server	windows
4	
i recommend downloading the windows sdk for windows-server 2008 and .net framework 3.5 but if you don t have the network bandwidth or just want the samples then the last option should be the most suitable


194197
elementtree	lxml
4	
i actually prefer lxml as it has api like elementtree but has also nice additional features and performs well


194306
ruby	python
0	
since it will take a while to work out the nuances you ll probably be happier with a dynamic language like python or ruby than with a static language like java or c#


194596
java	python
0	
is your own dsl and vm better than java or python


194982
line	lines
0	
if you ve already done all that and more it s certainly possible you ll get to a point where you think i wonder if these few line of code right here could be optimized better than the assembly that i m looking at in the debugger right now


194999
static-class	static-classes
5	
i would have expected static-classes to be unique to each request but it doesn t seem like that is the case


195075
code-coverage	cobertura
5	
cobertura - an open source code-coverage tool that can easily be coupled with junit tests to generate reports


195140
integer	long-integer
4	
you should compare decimal to long-integer performance not floating point


195398
postgresql	mysql
10	
that s why it s usually said that mysqlis best for webapps while postgresql is more enterprisey


195693
constructor	object
5	
this is the section of code that describes how the object should be instantiated on deserialization - it sets the constructor arguments to three string values


195696
contains	any
5	
the buffer being freed by wavecompleteheader is not the one contains the pcm data the responsibility to free the pcm buffer lies with the application and there s no requirement that it be allocated in any specific way


195795
integer	short
7	
for example if the integer is less than shrt_max you can assume it s a short


196053
scrollbars	scrollbar
7	
four potential scrollbar are bad enough but if the overall page height is fixed higher than the browser window then it ll end up with five


196070
line	lines
8	
i generally find new line more important than indentation


196241
zend-debugger	xdebug
5	
so xdebug is known not to work with many zend tools i know zend optimizer for certain i don t know about zend-debugger but i wouldn t be surprised if xdebug has a built-in check for that


196656
cell	cells
0	
i guess this might actually be a deeper problem with having to actually render html the contents of table cell but just to keep it simple - plaintext html table as an image


196663
cell	cells
5	
html table rendering is non-trivial due to the various ways that the sizes of the cell may be specified tables nested within tables etc


196705
pylons	django
7	0	0	
anyway the most important issue is that web2py is easier than django pylons php and rails


196962
windows-server	windows
4	
note that it will also match windows-server 2008


196980
editor	text-editor
5	
the rich text-editor must be implemented in java provide swing support and preferably be open source


197210
mouse	keyboard
4	
this will not remove the key binding from vmware but you could set the option to grab keyboard and mouse intput on key press in the vmware preferences


197430
line	lines
0	
corfman finds that it is difficult to reduce his solution to less than 142 line of c++ stl


197760
perl	php
1	
i m not overly concerned with the core-language of the package unless i d need to hack on the code for the system itself in which case i m reasonably comfortable with php perl and .net though i could probably pickup an other language s as needed


198148
commit	rollback
7	0	
in general a commit is much faster than a rollback but in the case where you have done nothing they are effectively the same


198624
dfa	nfa
7	0	
because representation of a given problem with a nfa is far easier than the equivalent dfa


198780
svn	revision
4	
my team only ever needs to browse our svn repositories via a web browser and compare revision and for that we use websvn


199168
dedicated	dedicated-server
1	
i m not familiar with this error but have you verified that your security permissions are set correctly on the dedicated-server


199289
public	protected
8	
if you re using an oo language then i d suggest it s essential to validate the arguments to public methods but less important with private and protected methods


199290
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
0	0	
decoding nullpointerexception is going to take a bit longer than illegalargumentexception filepath must be supplied or whatever


199331
command-line	cmd
7	7	
all my scripting is done in perl i can execute one liners at the cmd-line and perl regex seems way easier


199368
line	lines
0	
i ve been using unix since 1988 and have probably written less than 1000 line of shell script


199481
checkstyle	javadoc
7	
for example checkstyle has stronger support for checking javadoc and finding magic numbers to name a couple


199499
radio-button	button
5	
when radio-button are being used the mandatory label won t be displayed form validation will complain if there s no value selected anyway


199793
contains	any
5	
they can be included with any assembly and the most basic way to install components related to an assembly is to use installutil yourassembly.dll which would contains your code and custom installers


199835
vim	emacs
4	
rather like editors do you prefer vim or emacs choice of shell is partly a question of familiarity and partly a question of preference


199835
linux	unix
4	
another problem for those using linux is that the gnu tools have more options than the classic unix versions and you can lose portability not because of the shell programming constructs that you use but because of the command options you use


199984
line	lines
0	0	
anything longer than zero line can be unit tested - usually to good effect


200092
perl	php
5	
there are bindings for ming in perl via the swf module and i believe it can be used with php as well


200138
serialization	deserialization
7	
wcf also allows more fine-grained control over the json serialization and deserialization if you desire it


200718
32-bit	64bit
0	0	
doing de-referencing of memory pointers in the jvm can take a longer time with 64bit pointers than 32-bit


200768
acrobat-sdk	acrobat
5	
i think you can do this using the adobe acrobat-sdk a linux version of which can be downloaded for free from adobe


201030
.net	csla
4	
i would recommend csla .net framework by rockford lhotka


201171
quicksort	mergesort
0	
quicksortis worse complexity than mergesort in the worst case.


201354
logging	trace
7	0	
i created a test application to compare the performance of both logging methods in several scenarios and i m finding that log4net is significantly slower than the trace class


201442
windows-vista	windows
0	
windows drivers are under higher scrutiny under windows-vista and pretty much require certification imho


202050
serialization	deserialization
5	
regarding serialization there is also a performance problem that i reported to microsoft connect the keyedcollection maintains an internal dictionary as well as a list and serializations both - it is sufficient to serialization the list as the dictionary can easily be recreated on deserialization


202106
silverlight	wpf
5	
in addition silverlight supports a subset of xaml and the same control classes as wpf so your application can be ported as ria with minimal efforts


202225
line	lines
7	
it s implementable in a few line of c and at runtime does little more than a couple test branches a little addition and bit shifting


202854
arrays	loops
0	
edit a for loops on list t are a bit more than 2 times cheaper than foreach loops on list t b looping on arrays is around 2 times cheaper than looping on list t c looping on arrays using for is 5 times cheaper than looping on list t using foreach which most of us do


203074
windows-vista	windows
1	
i m not familiar enough with windows-vista to know if it programatically fakes out a harvard architecture for security reasons


203256
maven-plugin	maven
4	
i personally prefer this approach most of the time because you have more control over when the maven-plugin updates are done


203426
doc	rtf
5	
i think i can use the rtf generation to create a doc-readable file that can then be edited using doc and re-saved


203897
vba	macros
5	
thus if you record a macros the best way to find these problems in 2003 and then run it in 2002 you will have run time errors relating to the new arguments that simply do not work in the 2002 vba editor


203924
xml-serialization	xml
8	
from the use case you ve described xml-serialization is the obvious choice datacontractserializer being more flexible than xmlserializer if you don t mind the dependency on .net 3.x


204068
sql-server	oracle
5	
if you are targeting a business corporate market you ll find that some shops are strickly oracle or strictly sql-server and that your app might be ruled out in the early rounds of the competition based on the technology it uses


204664
set	any
4	
the following will match any matching set of tags


204778
web.py	django

also this post by the web.py author is a very good explanation of why i much prefer web.py over django


204794
ant	maven
5	5	
so the first thing i do with a project is establish how it will be built java ant or maven


205251
sequence	numbers
5	
when multiple items are queued for the same group numbers they are guaranteed to be queued in sequence numbers order and will have the same priority


205251
sequence	numbers
5	
in addition to this type of selectivity higher priority items should be processed first and items that contain the same group numbers must be processed in sequence numbers order


205364
postgresql	mysql
0	
mysqli am told can be optimized to do faster reads than postgresql but both are pretty ridiculously fast in terms of # transactions sec they support and it doesn t sound like that s your problem


206024
selected	highlight
7	
when i select a node the label gets updated as expected and the treenode that i clicked on becomes highlight and the previously selected node is no longer highlight


206134
dialog	pop-up
8	
from a practice standpoint - excluding accessibility - modal windows provide an alternative that are less startling as say dialog boxes and feel less intrusive than pop-up windows


206377
linq	linq-to-sql
1	
if you have columns that are very large such as binaries and images then it can make a significant difference which is why linq-to-sql allows you to specify delay loading for certain columns so that you can still select entire objects without performing select new projections


207104
order	add
5	
i d also add that a .net assembly has to be strongly named which requires it to be signed in order to be added to the gac


207290
braces	curly-braces
4	
maybe restricting the syntax of expr is likely to be a worthwhile compromise in terms of simplicity or execution time or cutting down on external dependencies -- for example maybe all i really need is something that matches any expr that has balanced curly-braces


207418
adapter	adaptor
10	
these commands should do the same things as the diagnose and repair for the network adaptor but is way faster


207682
unmanaged	managed-code
7	
regarding memory issues .net makes it easier not to make the common mistakes of unmanaged-code but it is still far from immune


208601
getter	setter
10	
this style of notation is more useful when you mix acessibility for the getter and setter


209147
google-chrome	safari
7	0	0	
according to some - browser - statistics ie6 market share is still bigger than google-chrome safari and opera together nearly as much as ie7


209430
http-get	get
0	
for a restful web service in which requests are submitted via http-get you really don t need anything more than a web browser


209463
command-line	cmd
5	
on os x this information is stored in directory services which can be accesed either through the apis in directoryservice.framework or by using the dscl cmd-line tool


209791
attributes	properties
8	
once you re more comfortable with xml you will probably start to define rules that you ll use to determine whichproperties become attributes and whichproperties become elements


210265
line	lines
4	
you might want to ask another question along the line of how do i use regex to match this pattern


210388
element	document
5	
the usual way is to loop over every element in the document for efficiency use a specific tag name if you know the class will only be applied to elements of a certain type and test the classname property of each noting that the property contains a space separated list of class names not a single class name


211049
subclass	subclassing
5	
but if the reopening and the definition are in reverse order you ll get that error because the class will already have been defined as a subclassing of object but is trying to be redefined or reopened with a different superclass


211117
command-line	cmd
1	
i m not familiar with scons so i don t know the best way to get these settings configured for that tool but for standard makefiles there s usually a line in the makefile which sets a macro variable with the include directory path and that macro is used as part of a cmd-line parameter in the cmd that invokes the compiler


211135
windows-server	windows
5	
unfortunately according to msdn the scm s security can only be modified on windows-server 2003 sp1 or later


211198
line	lines
0	
currently i document all public methods and anything more than 10 line


211961
gtk	glib
4	
if you want to use a library for this i d recommend glib the utility library that lies underneath the gtk ui toolkit


212152
silverlight	wpf
7	8	
what do you need to have in mind is that silverlight uses a smaller thus more limited library than wpf


212565
selection	selected
7	
if you can only teach one sort and have to do it quickly or the audience isn t really interested at all i would tend towardsselectedion because this is harder andselectedion could be taught quickly


212591
line	lines
10	
the real rule is something more along the line of how readable it is


212669
inline	function-call
5	
the basis of this book is that object oriented programming is highly wasteful memory-wise and that most source-code should not be written this way rather that you should use all inline function-calls and procedural programming


212671
line	lines
0	
for reference i have code in a commercial app that can encode decode wma to from wav files in less than 100 line of c++ all wrapped up in a friendly .net class


212798
order	join
10	
there are some tricks like knowing that the order of the join does matter but i believe you ll just pick those up on the way


212851
selected	cell
0	
the items in the cell are wider that the cell width so the dropdown list is also wider than the cell so the user can see what top selected


213020
firefox	safari
10	
this includes the more recent firefox and safari and opera browsers


213092
linq	linq-to-sql
0	
the thing that gets me about the whole orm debate is that the same people who claim that using an orm will be too hard slow whatever are the very same people who are more than happy using linq-to-sql or typed datasets


213300
line	lines
0	
often the functional code will be less than 100 line of code whereas the imperative implementation can be many more line of code


213844
set	any
5	
its not guaranteed to make any difference and if the dll is not used then it will have been swapped out and isn t part of the current working set


213917
command-line	cmd
5	
use | or | to protect it from shell interpertation and allow it to be passed to awk on the cmd-line


214060
linq	linq-to-sql
5	
can the same thing be achieved with linq-to-sql


214060
having	select
4	
i d like to get sql to do the heavy lifting and only return data matching my criteria rather than having to select transfer and then process a potentially massive chunk of data


214088
ruby-on-rails	django
2	
it competes with django and ruby-on-rails for rapid development but has a more flexible backend


214382
put	get
5	
put your startup.m in any of those directories and it will be found whenever you start matlab startup.m is also found if it is in the directory from which matlab is started but the technique above allows you to start matlab from an arbitrary directory and still have startup.m get run


215184
set	any
0	
with some exceptions hungarian notation i think consistent usage may be more useful than any arbitrary set of rules


215347
search-engine	google-search
0	
so i understand that the scalability of the web tier of ebay and amazon should be much harder than the scalability of the google-search-engine where everything can be encoded restful into the url


215457
window	titlebar
5	
my guess is that this would be accomplished by having the modal window as a user control which is loaded into a panel when displayed and that this panel is the one which would be animated somehow from the titlebar


215494
windows-server	windows
5	
for intance your fancy ecms might run on windows-server be written in .net you can t touch the core code but you can write scripts and plugins in vb c# and use an oracle database but publish a mixture of html and php pages to a cluster of linux apache web servers while you have a google appliance or lenya or some other product handle search


215572
linq	linq-to-sql
0	
that there is more than just linq-to-sql and the features are more than just a sql parser embedded in the language


215603
line	lines
5	
you could get fancy and allow additional subdividing of lines so a single line could eventually be broken into any number of sub-lines


215778
kohana	codeigniter
7	
as a result several people took up a huge interest in getting their contributions in and while kohana is based on all the same principles and ideas as codeigniter the implementation is much better and much easier to work with


215794
internet-explorer	firefox
1	
it drives internet-explorer but is also functional with firefox and safari to some extent


216179
drivers	filter-driver
5	
a good article about writing filter-drivers is here i think you will need to register to read but if you want to write driver you should be registered on this site


216869
asp.net	.net
0	5	
and of course mono can be a great replacement for web services that you can create them on .net and you can host them on apache because linux hosting nowadays are more cheap than windows ones web services and other asp.net apps will work under apache with a mod_mono module that must be included in apache


217145
hashmap	map
7	0	
if you need to be able to traverse the matrix row by row you can make the row map type a treemap and same for traversing the columns in index order but if you don t need those cases hashmap is quicker than treemap


217208
command-line	cmd
10	
the extglob shell option gives you more powerful pattern matching in the cmd-line


217495
quicksort	bubble-sort
0	
eventually with a large enough input set the quicksorton the slow hardware is going to be faster than bubble-sort on the fast hardware


217511
login	authentication
5	
when user will tries to login if we he failed to login n times captcha will be displayed so authentication will be using three parameters username password captcha


217543
ruby-on-rails	django
5	5	4	
perhaps i could have given python django further consideration but it was time to make a decision and i choose ruby-on-rails


217799
line	lines
0	
of course if you are a lightweight freak you can write your own routine for this should be less than 50 line


217879
configuration-files	config
1	
also see config general which claims to be fully compatible with apache configuration-files


218067
conventions	naming-conventions
5	
i would expect the method to be called public string getvalue according to sun s naming-conventions


218266
command-line	cmd
7	
i have broken down the utility calls into smaller statements and tested manually using the cmd-line and all seemed to be well until i incorporate the sed statement


218490
linux	ifconfig
7	
on linux ip from the iproute2 package behaves more predictably and gives easier-to-parse output than ifconfig route


218544
solaris	aix
7	7	
and i do as much work as possible on our linux centos 5 system simply because the tools on it are still newer than anything i can find readily packaged for aix solaris is somewhat better


218662
line	lines
0	
just for grins...you can also do this with streams just slightly more than 2 line of code


218699
asp.net	asp.net-mvc
5	
possible tendency towards wider acception jquery to be shipped with asp.net-mvc


218699
jquery	dojo
4	
an interesting comment in another thread compares jquery dojo prototype mootools sproutcore and cappuccino the question was removed


218766
serialization	serializable
5	
it converts between normal expressions and editableexpressions which are mutable and fully serialization so can be used with json xml binary etc


219458
cruisecontrol	cruisecontrol.net
1	
i m also very familiar with cruisecontrol.net and it s relatively horrific configuration format setup


219506
mouse	keyboard
0	
some elements require more than simple mouse keyboard interactions due to the complex rendering carried out by extjs


219929
getter	setter
0	
having a setter and getter isn t really any better than having a variable at that level of visibility


220108
webserver	nginx
3	
if not i recommend trying nginx another lightweight webserver that runs php in a separate process via fastcgi


220253
licensing	enterprise
5	
edit as of 2008 2009 under the sap enterprise licensing agreement repaired objects may still be supported by sap


220840
linq	linq-to-sql
10	
perhaps the linq-to-sql query is better optimised


220922
elf	coff
0	
it runs on a number of platforms and supports more than just elf files i believe it also supports coff and a few others


221024
arrays	hashmap
0	
a preinitialised arrays would be faster than a hashmap


221066
nant	msbuild
1	10	
msbuild vs nant is slightly different as msbuild is bundled with either the framework or the sdk i can t remember which now - but i think nant is a more pleasant environment to work in


221066
nant	msbuild
10	
msbuild is clearly better for doing the raw build the solution bit - but you can invoke it from nant


221267
perl	python
5	
a python or perl solution would be preferred but any solution would be a help


221273
json	xml
1	
i d rather not have a proliferation of web services or helper pages returning xml json so if there s a way to use client callbacks or page methods can t you tell i m not particularly familiar with either - buzzword bingo


221639
malloc	free
1	
after all not just gc is not deterministic free is as little deterministic as malloc is


221749
command-line	cmd
5	
these can be rerun whenever you like via a cmd-line tool


221909
for-loop	loops
5	
i should have mentioned that this is all already nested in a for-loops


222157
category	categories
3	
they recommend separating out into a few main category including some you listed type layout color but going further to include various tricks to keep older browsers happy


222370
vb.net	vb6
5	
with this in mind should someone who is approaching .net for the first time using vb.net and with a vb6 background be encouraged to get into the mindset of having to work with compile-time type checking because that s the best practice in the clr


222415
bluetooth	usb
5	
live data can be read from ethernet ieee 802.11 ppp hdlc atm bluetooth usb token ring frame relay fddi and others depending on your platfrom


222415
csv	xml
5	
output can be exported to xml postscript csv or plain text


222513
kate	kde
4	
i prefer kate part of kde as it features a built-in terminal as well as many features you would expect from an editor inside an ide like code folding and regex search replace


222513
vim	emacs
4	
many people also recommend vim or emacs both of which are probably available through your distro s repositories


222544
zend-debugger	xdebug
3	
i tend to prefer using zend-debugger for debugging and would love to find something like this that doesn t depend on xdebug


222619
asp.net-mvc	webforms
7	
this is debatable because both of them have different performance pros and cons for example asp.net-mvc gives you control over the html js that gets to the browser so you can minimize the amount of data on wire to make the whole application weight less however asp.net-mvc routing have so much dependency on reflection which is relatively slower than fetching a file from the disk which webforms is doing


222659
category	categories
10	
if you have a small number of category it s better to use solution a in bogdan maxim s answer


222902
perforce	git
5	
and similarly what weaknesses does git have compared to perforce


223138
commit	rollback
5	
in any database system i ve worked with there is no harm in doing a rollback right after the commit so if you commit in the try block and rollback in the finally things get committed whereas if an exception or early return causes the commit to be missed the rollback will rollback the transaction


223253
install	deployment
7	
the projects share some assembly references the file systems are all structured to use the same bin folder making deployment of changes to those assemblies problematic since the ms installer will only overwrite assemblies if the currently install version is older than the one in the msi


223387
nant	msbuild
5	
keep in mind that anything you can do in nant can probably be done in msbuild as well


223737
yacc	bison
5	
interesting question - i have a parser that can be compiled with bison byacc mks yacc or unix yacc and i don t do anything special to deal with resetting the grammar whether it fails or succeeds


223762
isapi-rewrite	isapi
0	
you can do this and more with isapi-rewrite for iis


223774
selection-sort	bubble-sort
7	
if you can ultimately only teach one algorithm at all i think selection-sort is even easier to teach and implement imho as bubble-sort


223793
compatibility	legacy
5	
as per the wikipedia article on gb18030 gb18030 can be be considered a unicode transformation format an encoding of all unicode code points that maintains compatibility with a legacy character set. that is all unicode characters can be encoded in gb18030 but they will be encoded with different byte sequences than would be generated with utf-8 or utf-16


223809
postgresql	mysql
5	
i am limited to an open source solution so it ll be mysqlor postgresql if that helps at all


223842
submission	submit
1	
there s nothing horribly wrong with having a simple post method for submission a file just the detail of tying the file upload to any pertinent meta data the other parameters to the method if it were bundled with the method


223983
video-streaming	streaming
5	
how can i create live video-streaming to be used for live video conferences chatting in a php application


224013
grouping	filtering

filtering thegroupings bygroupings that have more than 1 element


224044
cell	cells
4	
has to provide an image of the spreadsheet that users can drag a select box around to select cell then click an import button and have the right thing happen


224049
http-post	post
5	
edit i think that cookies should not be sent on http-post in the above case


224223
innodb	myisam
7	
a better solution is not to use myisam for tables where the data is constantly changing - innodb is much more bulletproof and as paul correctly points out you can use transactions on innodb tables but not on myisam


224223
triggers	insert
10	
of course if you are insert a very large number of rows then the risk would be that all of your live data is unavailable for as long as the insert takes to complete but overall this approach is far less destructive to indexes triggers or anything else that may be linked to the tables in question


224658
self	instances
5	
the instances to be passed self


225108
contains	any
5	
some of these panels contains jtables which i would like to be resized in line with any resizing of the jdialog


225115
command-line	cmd
5	
i have looked at few other vcs free and commercial and found most of them seems be made for linux guys and you have to use cmd-line for many admin work i know i m windows guy p


225123
asp.net-mvc	webforms
5	
a lot of things that people mentions for asp.net-mvc can be done in webforms but with some additional effort


225169
32-bit	64bit
0	
and the 64bit address space is four billion times larger than the 32-bit address space


225486
javadoc	doxygen
1	
i d only use doxygen with java if you re new to java and you ve used doxygen before reducing the learning curve you d experience with javadoc


225664
sorted	lookup
1	
also if you handle collisions in a sophisticated way each node is again a sorted table and you can perform binary search within these your lookup might still be fast enough if the table is loaded to 200 so you have twice as many items as capacity


226009
key	key-value
0	
the only time it might help is if your key-values were much longer than the hash


226515
multiplication	division
7	10	
multiplication is faster division is more accurate


226593
cruisecontrol	cruisecontrol.net
7	
for a one man shop teamcity is far easier to setup and configure than cruisecontrol.net


226708
upgrade	versioning
5	
the microsoft.visualbasic.compatibility namespace is exclusively for use by the vb6 upgrade wizard may be removed in future versioning and should not ever be used for new development


226887
asp.net	asp.net-mvc
5	
i m building a cms in asp.net-mvc and want to allow users to pick which page they want to be displayed by default when the user first visits the site


227067
inner-join	join
0	
the above should be quicker than the equivalent sub-query and if you re referring specifically to exists - well where structure allows an inner-join will always be the preferred option


227095
default-value	default
5	
also permits default-values for unused parameters to be expressed closest to where they are actually used


227460
hosting	web-hosting

in a live web-hosting environment it makes life easier both in terms of dns configuration and server configuration


227708
category	categories

in this example my checkboxes match category of a blog post


227710
sql-server	mysql
0	
total cost of ownership of mssql-server is touted to be less than mysqltoo .net environment but maintaining an open mind could someone point out any killer features of mysql


227959
controllers	controller
5	
consequently when the behavior of these functions need to change only a small part of the application needs to be changed the controllers and its helper classes


228642
perl	python
1	
python is quite cool but unfortunately its debugger is not as good as perl -d


228750
innodb	myisam
7	0	
also innodb is slower than myisam unless myisam is blocking for a huge select


229167
optional-parameters	named
5	
in vba i can call it using named parameters for the required parameter the optional paramter can simply be omitted in vba unlike in c#.net for which type.missing must be used for all omitted optional-parameters


229536
line	lines
8	
uml - nothing more formal than line and boxes on whiteboards


229545
gprof	valgrind
5	
i use gprof and valgrind quite heavily you don t seem to have mentioned this class of tools


229606
spaces	double-quotes
5	
note that spaces in the needle string need to be placed between double-quotes and the wildcards should be outside


229736
for-loop	loops
10	
somehow the for-loops is mostly designed to run a number of times know in advance you can still use break to terminate early so the dynamic evaluation of the stop term is more annoying than useful if you really need dynamic evaluation you use or


229743
while-loop	loops
5	
on x86 for loopsing can be done on assembly level without making a while-loops


230140
asp.net	asp.net-mvc
7	
- for using ajax with asp.net-mvc it s better if you take a look at jquery or other frameworks


230394
message	messagebox
0	
if you pursue this the messagebox will jump to the new position which is generally worse than not having it centered


230878
feed	feeds
5	
carriage return line feed sequences will be translated to line feeds on input


230949
tree	nodes
0	
forwarded types allow you to have more than one service implemented by a single implementation for a concrete example say we have two interfaces for working with treenodes of some sort


230966
tree	nodes
5	
to be balanced every nodes in the tree must either


231286
sphinx	django-sphinx

i d recommend sphinx for full-text search and aggregation and django-sphinx is good enough for production use


231329
updates	updating
5	
feature activation code deactivation code and feature stapling should be used when updating any contentupdatess


231586
attributes	properties
5	
xml is somewhat subjective in terms of design - i don t think there are exact guidelines for how the elements and attributes should be laid out but i tend to go with using elements to represent things and attributes to represent singular attributesproperties of them


231801
for-loop	loops
5	
for more insight as to what s happening behind the scenes the for-loops can be rewritten to this


231930
signals	sigaction
7	0	
the sigaction function specifies more information than the signals


231982
set	any
7	
i worked on j2ee projects on health care systems that deal with enormous amount of stored data literally millions of patients visits forms etc and the general rule is not to show more than 100 or 200 rows for any user search advising the user that those set of criteria produces more information that he can understand


232041
put	http-patch
7	
as i commented near the bottom of his blog it isn t clear how using http-patch is any better than using a patch document against http put


232089
signals	sigaction
3	
one should prefer using sigaction to signals if possible as the signals has implementation-defined often race prone behavior and behaves differently on windows os x linux and other unix systems


232345
eclipse-rcp	rcp
0	
the first thing i looked at was sharpdevelop which does both #1 and also #2 in a basic way no insult to sharpdevelop which is admirable - i just mean more basic than eclipse-rcp


232487
web	web-deployment
5	
web-deployment projects can be used with either the asp.net web site or asp.net web application project options built-into vs 2008 and provide a few additional build packaging and deployment options for you to use


232488
hosting	windows-hosting
5	
it uses a plug-in based architecture and gives you the ability to create anything from tool windows-hosting whatever code you want to actions items which can be tied to keyboard shortcuts and context menus and refactorings with an extremely rich context system and a language agnostic code generation engine


232500
http	https
5	
also data needs to be passed over http


232545
for-loop	loops

i can do this with a for-loops of course but i m hoping .net has a more elegant way built in


232616
ienumerator	idisposable
5	
if they d worked out that it s useful for foreach to dispose of iterators in the first place i m sure ienumerator would have extended idisposable

gregor kiczales once gave an interesting introductory talk on aop at google tech talks which i recommend watching aspects oriented programming radical research in modularity


233314
processor	processors
0	
no using pointer arithmetic is not faster and most probably slower because an optimizing compiler may use instructions like lea load effective address on intel processor or similar on other processor for pointer arithmetic which is faster than add or add mul


233453
version-control	git
10	
it is a distributed version-control system like git but integrates far more neatly and easily with windows


233871
asp.net	.net

this is not possible under windows 2000 or windows 2003 running asp.net 1.x or asp.net 2.0 even with .net framework 3.5 installed


234591
toupper	tolower

it is suggested in this so post that c# is more efficient with toupper because microsoft optimized it that way. but i ve also read this argument that converting tolower vs

i can t say whether toupper or tolower is faster though

the difference is that you must handle the switches manually whereas polymorphism is more natural once you get used with inheritance method-overriding


235045
windows-server	windows
5	
you must assume your application will only be deployed on windows xp or windows-server 2003 or later and then you can use what is called registration free com to make this happen


235061
.when	ready
5	
optimization should only be addressed .when the entire project is unit tested and ready for instrumentation


235116
hashmap	map
7	
this causes more hashmap collisions which hurts performance but you are hitting a memory bottleneck and need to do so


235246
c++	python
5	
so 80 of the cpu might actually be spent in c++ code anyway despite the fact that most of your project is written in say python


235449
perl	python
7	
study moose mouse - it is modern oo system for perl it is much better that old oo system that was copied from python


235463
nmock	rhino-mocks
4	
there are several open source mocking frameworks out there i personally recommend rhino-mocks or nmock


235472
progress-bar	progress
0	
i perceive a wrong progress-bar slightly worse than no progress-bar at all and there would be many people for who it would be wrong all of the time


235553
attributes	properties
5	
this can be specified by either setting the global build.compiler properties which will affect all tasks throughout the build or by setting the compiler attributes specific to the current task


236126
copy-paste	paste
5	
the header is only a file whose aim is to be included copy-paste by the preprocessor into true source files


236340
double	int
5	
edit realized that if you are comparing integer parts of double casting to int values first runs the risk of overflows should your double be outside the range that could be represented as int


236359
subclass	subclassing
5	
in this example i want to make it clear that subscribe is a method to be used by external users of the class object while event is a method that should not be called from the outside but rather by subclassing implementations


236550
serialization	deserialization
7	0	10	
this is designed to be side-by-side compatible with regular .net approaches such as xmlserializer datacontractserializer but is much smaller than xml and requires significantly less processing cpu etc for both serialization and deserialization


236665
linq	linq-to-sql
7	
don t know if this possible - right now i write my own stored procs to do all the work plus i am desiging my database in a way so my use of linq-to-sql is easier


237070
average	median
0	0	
however the constant factor will be huge and if worst case performance is your primary concern use a merge sort instead which is only a little bit slower than quicksort on average and guarantees o nlgn time and will be much faster than this lame median quicksort


237225
contains	any
5	
another possibility could be to create a log table that stores this information and it could be made to contains keep track of updates for any entity


237472
vim	emacs
4	
also whichever editor you prefer vim or emacs learn it back forth


237698
cruisecontrol	cruisecontrol.net
0	
though it s more than just svn it also includes trac cruisecontrol.net and mingle


237868
xml-serialization	xml
10	
elements centric xml is more interoperable format in xml-serialization


237880
login	authentication
5	
of course this method can only be used if authentication is carried out by sending the actual user password to the server at login since database only desirably contains the hash of the password


238053
contains	any
5	
it s too small to be of any size concern and doesn t contains any useful secrets that you might be concerned about sharing


238267
sql-server	oracle
5	
large collections of sprocs can be segregated into oracle packages or management studio sql-server solutions and projects or sql-server schemas


238323
defined	declare
5	
in java interfaces can only be used to declare methods not the defined implement them


238767
put	get
5	
my preference would be that the username password only be accepted via post so that it doesn t appear in the url at all but you could conceivably encrypt and encode the password so that it could be put in a get request


239137
base-class	subclassing
5	
for example if you had something like a shape base-class you could have some built in implementation that could be used by subclassing as well as interface methods that you want the subclassing to implement


239138
http	ssl
5	
aside from keeping out eavesdroppers having authentication operations be carried out over ssl allows you to use the secure http cookie flag


239167
c++	python
10	
if python is much more natural to you than c++ it might be a good idea to learn pygame first


239190
fieldset	labels
0	
assuming you have more than one field in the fieldset then doing what you suggest doesn t semantically make sense -- you need to create separate legend text that describes the fieldset then a labels for each field


239434
cruisecontrol	cruisecontrol.net
4	2	
i d recommend hudson over cruisecontrol.net any day of the week


239676
haskell	python
8	
further to the other answers note that the equivalent head tail operation in python including python3 s extension of the syntax is generally going to be less efficient than haskell s pattern matching


240033
conventions	naming-conventions
7	
i m embarking on a project now for an entity that has a fuzzier connection to the unviersity a student group that runs a charity event that has the potential to be sold outside of our university and thus it doesn t really fit into my normal naming-conventions the department is only the first customer of potentially many that might use the project


240244
line	lines
0	
but i get e16 invalid range though i am certain that foo.c contains more than 1000 line


240326
environment	execution
5	
environment variables could work however we could be running parallel tests via a single test assembly so i wouldn t want settings to be overwritten during execution which could break another test


240674
c++	python
5	
i d prefer something that can be developed on linux using c++ java python scala


240741
osx	linux
0	
if anyone wants to do the osx or linux versions of the jni part of jintellitype i would be more than happy to add those to the jintellitype library


240793
line	lines
4	
a somewhat less na ve approach would be to use a polygon fill algorithm and then select points from the fill line randomly


241558
jaxp	dom4j
5	
install an instance of this custom configuration class as the com.sun.org.apache.xerces.internal.xni.parser.xmlparserconfiguration property so it will be instantiated when dom4j s saxreader class tries to create a jaxp xmlreader


241575
turbogears	django
1	
django could be an option but doesn t seem as flexible as turbogears


241621
nstableview	nssplitview
0	
a pattern i also use is to make the nstableview slightly shorter than the nssplitview and have buttons at the bottom add delete etc


241691
arrays	loops
7	
according to the description in the link above loops should be broken out of when the squareroot of the last element in the arrays is greater than the current prime - mine does this one before


241813
.when	ready
5	
i would like to know .when java 6 can be considered ready for prime time not the choice of ui library


241908
integer	unsigned
0	
so when i saw you taking 64 bit integers the unsigned long long is often 64 bits and multiplying four times that means you need 64 5 or a 320 bit integer to store your answer you were trying to put that answer in a 64 big result which quite often depending on the compiler and computer will happily do and will truncate the upper bits leaving you with the lower 64 bits of the result which can easily look smaller than any of your operands which is what i had thought you might have done at first


242308
attributes	properties
0	
the way to do this is to set the object s wmode to opaque and use the css z-index properties to set it to a z-index lower than the z-index of whatever elements you want to float over it -- you can do this in css or just with inline attributes


242336
set	any
7	0	
first set a user variable to zero assuming this is less than any rowid in your table


242546
kerberos	ldap
0	
one might want to define kerberos access to more than one ldap server


242744
editing	document
5	
another feature is that for these kind of functional document it should be locked while editing


242815
braces	curly-braces
0	
curly-braces required if you have more than one step of indentation


243145
login	authentication
5	
the other thing is if you are able to loginto the machine running sql server with an account in the administrators group you will be mapped to sysadmin when running management studio using trusted authentication


243240
operators	conditional
7	7	
i don t immediately jump to if - else because a lot of the time the conditional operators makes more sense contextually


243573
selection	selected
10	
one can reasonably argue that methodology is more important than the platform although there are principles like simplicity andselectedion and control of dependencies that might preclude the use of certain platforms


243687
double-quotes	single-quotes
5	
server-side language vb.net people might choose to use single-quotes for java-script so that the scripts can be built server-side vb.net uses double-quotes for strings so the java-script strings are easy to distinguished if they use single-quotes


243694
arrays	loops
1	
for in loops on arrays is not compatible with prototype


243740
pointers	stack
5	
a function may be called from any other function and stack pointers value may have any un-aligned value


243783
hex	binary
7	
generally the use of hex numbers instead of decimal it s because the computer works with bits binary numbers and when you re working with bits also is more understandable to use hexadecimal numbers because is easier going from hex to binary that from decimal to binary


244005
controllers	controller
0	
while somewhat more lightweight than its java counterparts it has the basic concepts of a model holding the data a view rendering the data in response to events propogated from a controllers


244099
http	https
7	
this is more to do with smart card aspect of the architecture and not http though


244138
lua	python
1	
i keep getting an itch to make my own on-chip basic interpretor but i wonder if there s need for basic now that lua and python are easily embeddable and just as approachable as basic


244815
set	any
5	
and once you have a decent set of web services these can be used for any new development which provides a way of moving away from cobol in the longer term


244928
arrays	dictionary
0	
imho the dictionary approach will be much faster than linq so if you have an arrays with a lot of items you should rather use dictionary


244930
meta	meta-tags
0	
is what you want to use because it stands out more than meta-tags to most search engines


245069
constructor	object
5	
java constructor are special functions that can only be called at object creation


245078
overlapping	overlap
7	
whenever the set has more than one rectangle you have overlap and if you make sure to add remove all rectangles that have the same top bottom coordinate you re currently looking at multiple overlapping rectangles would not be a problem


245222
default-value	default
0	
wcftestclient tool doesn t seem to work if the size of maxnametablecharcount is greater than default-value 16384


245298
atomicity	atomic
10	7	7	
subversion has the ability to rename and move files without losing history supports atomicity commits has a more robust repository format has more modern access methods has better third party tool support and the list goes on


245786
submission	submit
0	
if this isn t scaling well enough for you you need to consider major design changes like perhaps tracking those whosubmitted more than 10 submission in a separate table that you update through applications that populate the submission


246036
linq	linq-to-sql
5	
it s a parameterized query generated by linq-to-sql so that the query plan can be cached by sql server for later reuse


246136
textbox	button
7	
if the content of the textbox is smaller than the content of the textbox the window is as big as it needs to be to display the content of the button


246803
internet-explorer	firefox
5	
preferably in javascript and in internet-explorer although it would be nice if it could also be done in firefox safari etc.


247098
32-bit	64bit
7	
my understanding is that this means yes it is compiled only as far as il no it s not limited to either 32-bit or 64bit but i m not entirely clear


247182
asp.net-mvc	webforms
4	
i prefer asp.net-mvc to webforms so i would choose that but you need to work out as a team where your core skill set is and whether or not choosing mvc will


247211
asp.net	asp.net-mvc
4	
choose asp.net-mvc if you.


247216
line	lines
0	
the only downside is that it will be necessary to keep reading lines from the netstat output until the right line is found since there ll be more than one line of output


247357
required	checked
2	
this is important because if you need to have your stored proc use indexes postgres required that the types match exactly between join conditions edit for equality checked too i think


247574
set	any
0	
any sessions older than the timeout period are set to status timed out


247985
builder-pattern	builder
4	
that said rather than explicitly changing the state of one instance i would recommend builder-pattern to produce a new object


247985
set	hashtable
0	
this can work like a set and actually it gives better performance than set implementations which are implemented with hashtables or balanced trees


248041
set	any
7	0	0	
ignoring how well a browser may or may-not handle a gb-sized xml file the only real concern i can think of off the top of my head is if the execution time to generate all the xml is greater than any execution time thresholds that are set in your environment


248268
malloc	free
5	
i m not sure about how this can be done portably except of course for using malloc and free


248302
asp.net	.net
10	
actually asp.net mvc is more a port from other succesfull framework to the .net platfrom


248373
subclass	base-class
5	
bottom line is if you want to change behavior based on which subclass an instance is then the methods should have been virtual methods on the base-class not static methods


248538
gridbaglayout	boxlayout
5	
i used to do build a lot of uis using gridbaglayout but for years i ve never seen an office-environment ui that couldn t be built with nested borderlayouts gridlayouts and the occasional boxlayout or flowlayout


248590
arguments	optional-arguments
5	
do allow null to be passed for optional-arguments


248688
json	xml
4	
just wondering if there are any good server-side libraries for ajax prefer json rather then xml but anything is good for classic asp vbscript .


248992
perl	php
10	
ftp is much better suited for large data transfer and can be automated easily via php or perl


249007
cart	shopping-cart
5	
for instance i am building a shopping-cart system and i think that allowing the adding removing etc of items to from a cart could very easily be exposed via gets since even though you can change data you cannot do anything critical with it


249110
category	categories
5	
each name will be treated like a category to return subsets of the model instances where the categories match


249545
windows-xp	windows
0	
is it possible to run more than one website on iis 5.1 windows-xp


249617
bazaar	git
4	
for many of the cases where subversion trumps perforce many people seem to prefer the distributed systems like git bazaar mercurial these days


249757
asp.net	.net
5	
the application is planned to be built using asp.net .net remoting ms sql server


250136
base-class	inherited
5	
generally it ll be used around orm s - older and some current ones require you to inherited from a specific base-class which ties you to that product


250265
packets	packet
4	
speaking personally i use remoting because i prefer amf to soap xml for the simple reason of speed and packets size


250419
.war	war
1	
upgrading is as simple as downloading the new.war file and restarting


250593
constructor	object
7	
approach 2 of passing a global information object through your various constructor is easier to control


250630
sql-agent	msde
8	
otherwise you ll have to get more creative as sql express does not have the sql-agent that comes with the full versions of sql 2005 as well as msde


250733
adapter	adaptor
7	
you can make your code independent from template engine just by writing simple adaptor that uses magic methods


250761
line	lines
7	7	
while using the linux toolbox takes more line you only have to know the basics of a few commands to do just about anything you want


250764
jogl	lwjgl
8	
i have had more joy with lwjgl than jogl but they should both satisfy your needs


250819
elevated-privileges	privileges
10	
this additionally makes more explicit the need for elevated-privileges in your script instead of hiding it inside popen


250937
line	lines
0	
it just runs the procedure and shows the output using a gridview control less than 40 line of total code including aspx markup


250945
json	xml
2	
i prefer working with json than xml for my data layer


250945
json	xml
7	
ajax + json is much lighter and faster and easier to deal with than soap + xml


251356
controllers	controller
5	
knowing that methods with lots of parameters are considered a code smell that ought to be refactored out i m wondering if there is a different way to accomplish this or if i m stuck with a controllers method that has a one-to-one mapping between form parameters and method parameters


251372
ruby	python
0	0	
it s also lesser known than python perl or ruby


251438
priority-queue	queue
7	
i know i could use a multiset but its big o notation performance is worse that why i want to use the priority-queue


251615
windows-xp	windows
4	
well i m using this library in delphi 7 on windows-xp but the component inside is just a wrapper around some win api calls createfile writefile etc


251619
equals	gethashcode
10	
as the dictionary adds and checks existence of each item it uses bothequals and gethashcode functions but has to rely on theequals function when the hashcode is less unique


251683
login	authentication
5	
a login authentication service may be centralized ldap based


251726
connection-pooling	pool
10	
it will leads to a really bad situation where it is both hard to manage transactions throughout the application and too many connections are opened and closed i know about connection-pooling it is still more expensive to look up a connection from the pool than it is to reuse an object


251995
getter	setter
10	
a getter without a setter is more like a public final member variable--but at that point why not just use a public final member variable they do no more harm.


253046
selection	selected
4	
once theselectedion is shown in the html of firebug right-click on the html element in my case a div class yrsjge and choose copy html


253316
error-code	hresult
0	
error ranges can be of help here because if the only thing we are interested in is if we are in the presence of an error or not it is simpler to check an hresult error-code greater or equal to 0 is success and less than zero is failure


253424
linq	linq-to-sql
7	
the entity framework has turned out to be quite contreversial but i think that is partly due to the fact that linq-to-sql has a better programmer experience today


253424
linq	linq-to-sql
4	
entity framework will catch and surpass linq-to-sql because it is the orm mapping tool of the future from microsoft

contains	any
4	
this will match any string such that if itcontains page it must be followed by a number not consisting of only zeros


253636
subclass	subclassing
5	
often it makes sense to subclassing but often it can be avoided using categories


253636
category	categories
5	
these category define and implement methods that can be added to any class you want


253675
command-line	cmd
5	
most importantly cmd-line programs can be automated and chained together in scripts much more easily than guis typically


253695
lostfocus	lost-focus
0	
immediately i began wishing that updatesourcetrigger allowed more than just lost-focus because if you click the tab without tabbing off of a control the linq object is not updated before validation


253755
lua	python
7	0	
lua has fewer libraries than python


253823
tree	nodes
0	
if i watch the progress tab a nodes is added to a tree for each iteration thousands total and this gets slower and slower as the process goes on


254088
installation	building
0	
instead of the installer approach i think a better way than having a single script that does it at install time is to have a building system which generates .deb or .rpm files suitable for installation on each system you have to support


254161
.war	war
4	
i also recommend this book because despite his net-famous flame.war with linus torvalds few of his biases come through in the book


254579
inner-join	join
0	
7 inner-join of less than 7 join in depth certainly isn t unheard of but sometimes people hear 7 join and think the no-no is 7 join not depth


255067
windows-xp	windows
5	
on most modern computers windows-xp sp2+ vista dialog what do you want to do will be displayed for security reasons but what you have in autorun.inf will display as the selected default with as icon and as description


255780
platform	target-platform
5	
i guess gcc version will be depend on vxworks version and probably on target-platform


255978
tic-tac-toe	pong
5	
graphical programming is the most fun and even a fairly large program like calculator tic-tac-toe or ping pong can be explained to children


256201
environment	configuration
4	
develop in your local machine with the same exact configuration as your development environment that is apache mods php extensions and so on using a version control system i prefer svn to keep track of modified files and what not


256203
linq	linq-to-sql
4	
scott guthrie told me they would not kill linq-to-sql


256245
json	xml
7	0	0	
json is much better than xml for browser application and the size is smaller than xml as well


256591
public	protected
10	
using reflection it is further enforced that child object has no public methods nor any package or protected methods except those inherited from isolatedobject nearly all of which are final


256674
quirks-mode	doctype
4	
official w3c doctype without the correct url the second string in the tag selects quirks-mode


257132
cruisecontrol	cruisecontrol.net
4	
i ve personally tried cruisecontrol.net and hudson and prefer hudson


257242
haskell	scala
1	
no way is scala going to bend your mind anywhere near as much as haskell will


257242
haskell	scala
4	2	
the main reason to choose scala over haskell when learning fp is to give yourself a more gentle introduction to the dangerous wilds of monads functors and higher-order goodness


257248
line	lines
8	
this results in cleaner code since it is now less cluttered with dispose calls 10 fewer line of code in this case


257489
set	any
5	
and once you have a decent set of web services these can be used for any new development which provides a way of moving away from cobol in the longer term


257550
line	lines
5	
4 is it possible to have a json image with all the image details regardless of numbers and use no 3 above to load 10 of those images is it possible to use ajax to only read 10 line and keep a pointer of the last one it read so the json file can be loaded fast short refresh and images either side are cached via the browser


257565
derived-class	base-class
5	
the base-class can be used to execute a function of the derived-classs and it will be properly call the correct function


257776
java	groovy
0	0	
i ve done some python programming but being more familiar with java groovy comes a lot easier to me


257852
textbox	button
4	
basically you update the button alt tag every time the textbox loses focus


257853
message	messagebox
5	
simple messageboxes and input boxes can be created using easygui a small library using tkinter which python comes with


257944
trace	profiling
7	
you now have a sql script that creates a trace that has much less overhead than running through the profiling gui


257953
height	width
7	
safari will expand up to a width of 800px unless the width is already greater than 800 in which case it maintains that width and only modifies the windowheight


258093
swt	awt
8	
i know for certain that swt can t and it s a far more sophisticated toolkit than awt


258221
binary-tree	tree
10	
dictionary is faster for insertion as far as i know whereas sorteddictionary is built on top of a binary-tree search algorithm and is faster for reading back


258294
abstract	implements
5	
if a class implements an interface and does not implement all its methods it must be marked as abstract


258696
line	lines
8	
it s a bit more complicated than this in practice you have to deal with potential overflow values for example and some types of delay line have to be run in reverse which is always a pain in c-style coding of course


259072
json	xml
4	2	
is there any reason why i should pick json over xml or vice-versa if both are available


259080
bluej	greenfoot
7	0	
i think greenfoot is better than bluej for 8-years old


259091
cell	highlight
4	
specifically when i pasted into the spreadsheet i had to select paste special and choose the format text. otherwise it tried to paste everything into a single cell even if i highlight the whole spreadsheet


259109
json	xml
4	2	
when it comes to php the one reason i choose xml over json is because even in php 5 there is no officially supported api for traversal


259230
raw-sockets	packets
0	
in the worst case scenario you could go one level lower raw-sockets where you have better control over the packets sent but then you d have to deal with all the nitty-gritty of tcp


259460
postgresql	mysql
10	
postgresql is more compliant but if you re comfortable with mysqland you re using an orm you should probably use that


259517
oracle	postgresql
10	8	
i cannot propose any db not knowing your specific needs but if you want to use a free software which excludes oracle and you re not already experienced with mysql you should try postgresql which is more powerful than mysql


259770
joomla	drupal
2	
the cms still lacks the vast amount of plugins and modules if you compare it with joomla or drupal but their code seems more advanced


259931
serialization	serializable
5	
for example serialization isolation level will prevent lost updates when the code runs concurrently but read committed the default in sql server management studio will not


260148
libxml2	libxslt
10	
libxml2 libxslt also come with their own much lower-level python bindings but lxml is much more straightforward and pythonic and it seems to have great performance as well

c++	python
4	
qt either on c++ or python is fully portable between mac win linux


260485
directx	direct3d
0	
since managed directx is not being supported any longer by microsoft this is a good way to use managed code with direct3d


260768
ruby-on-rails	grails
0	
i m not sure gruby-on-rails fits that bill though because it is java perhaps the enterprise will warm up to it moreso than ruby-on-rails


260839
aspect	aspects
10	
but from performance aspects i must say json is better to use with iphone application


261107
set	any
5	
server backend can be programmed in any technology you want just set common data format at server and browser side json format may be suitable


261292
height	width
5	
i will probably be bashed by css purists here but using a table with 100 width andheight works in any browser and does not require browser-specific css hacks


261435
getter	setter
5	
prior to that it used a slightly different naming scheme for getter and setter which naturally can still be used with properties or for plain old attributes


261522
vim	emacs
4	
what is the command to match brackets in emacs the equivalent of the command in vim


261938
actionscript	mxml
5	5	
if everything that can be accomplished in mxml can also be accomplished in actionscript and many things are easier to accomplish in actionscript loops conditionals etc why take the time to learn mxml


262124
linq	linq-to-sql
8	
it s less sexy than linq-to-sql but more widely applicable imo.


262131
controllers	controller
0	
my assumption was that i didn t need to do any more overriding as the parent treeview controllers would handle the postback events


262174
hide	show
5	
a combination of css and javascript can then be used to show and hide portions of the hierarchy of the tree or menu


262798
innodb	myisam
7	0	
i know innodb is heavier than myisam but just how much more


263305
cell	cells
7	
i should emphasize that those artifacts will be completely invisible on the final contour rendering since the difference in magnitude between any two adjacent interpolator cell is less than the bit depth of the rendered image


263441
administration	credentials
5	
because of this it becomes necessary for either the administration s session to be hijacked or for their authentication credentials to be captured in order for someone to ever exploit the hijack function within the application


264026
ruby-on-rails	codeigniter
0	
codeigniter is a significantly smaller framework than ruby-on-rails as far as features go


264095
editor	text-editor
5	
ideally suited for programming scripting html writing etc. the raize font can be used in any ide or text-editor


264861
arrays	dictionary
0	
alternatively you could throw them into a dictionary but this doesn t help the caller any more than an arrays does


265455
controllers	controller
5	
the controllers layer can be made to get the data for the view in either way that you choose whichever is more efficient


265573
soft-references	weak-references
0	
if you want to implement a cache soft-references are definetly a better idea than weak-references but it puts your entire cache removal policy in the hands of the garbage collector


265620
jquery	dojo
10	
jquery is more popular but dojo allows you to declaratively define widgets in html which sounds more like what you re looking for


265695
asp.net	.net
4	
depending on your language of choice i would recommend asp.net webservices it s excellent for easily creating and consuming webservices particularly if you re using .net actoss your platforms


265832
tree	nodes

nodes of a tree that has child nodess


265857
editor	text-editor

if you d rather be using a light text-editor instead of a heavy ide then i d highly recommend going with gedit with some additional plugins

267357
linq	linq-to-sql
0	
i did some tests and my tests seems to point to linq to entities performing better than linq-to-sql


267357
linq	linq-to-sql
0	
i believe the overkill statements that i ve heard are made because linq to entities can do much more than linq-to-sql and it does require more configuration about 1 more line in the web.config


267357
linq	linq-to-sql
10	
also there are small things that linq to entities does differently from linq-to-sql that might make someone feel as though linq to entities is more complicated


267357
linq	linq-to-sql
10	8	
but once you learn how to do things it seems linq to entities is no more complicated than linq-to-sql


267526
value	field
4	
i prefer null unless the field is not nullable then i prefer zero unless zero is a valid limit then i prefer -1 unless -1 is a valid value in which case you need another field say a bit field to signify unlimited


267682
32-bit	64bit
0	
the exceptions to this are functions returning types larger than 32-bit specifically 64bit integers long long double s and structs or classes


267864
oracle	oracle-xe

another method involves 10 steps and would have to be adapted to oracle-xe

the controllers is halfway built into the browser ui but can be extended with javascript


267988
radio-button	button
4	
things like choosing your sex where there ll only be two options in the foreseeable future i much prefer radio-button since it s quick for you to see your options


268113
cross-join	join
7	
i think this basic concept is actually easier to understand in the old sql syntax so for example we cross-join tables a and b


268176
iostream	boost
7	0	0	
i would also suggest memory-mapped files but if you re going to use boost i think boost iostream mapped_file is a better match than boost interprocess


268692
selection	selected

these should be triggered whenever a selection is changed no matter how it is selected


268824
api	web-services

we re working now on the design of a new api for our product which will be exposed via web-services


269117
swing	swt

swt is more simple to use than swing especially if this is your first ui


269134
order	join

for these purposes i ll use the following definition makes effective use of indexes and join in a sensible order which is probably as good as any


269180
error-code	hresult
5	
i think we inherited our exception classes from comexception and set the correct error-code which should be translated as hresult in unmanaged code


269314
linux	solaris
0	
on linux or solaris is there a better way than hand parsing proc self maps repeatedly to figure out whether or not you can read write or execute whatever is stored at one or more addresses in memory


269801
restart	shutdown
7	
this is more work than my other solution but is theorectically a better one since as part of your restart your jar may want to do other things as well clean restart other resources log the fact that it s being shutdown stuff like that


270094
tree	nodes
7	0	7	0	
in a binary tree each nodes can have 0 1 or 2 subnodess where in case of a binary search tree the key of the left nodes is lesser than the key of the nodes and the key of the right nodes is more than the nodes


270095
tree	linked-list
5	
a binary search tree can be implemented in any fashion it doesn t need to use a linked-list


270099
tree	children
0	
you can use bst to represent a data such as family tree but that ll become n-ary search tree as there can be more than two children to each person


270764
xslt	xsl-fo

you can also use apache fop if you prefer xslt and xsl-fo


270944
.when	ready

3 .when a client wants a connection give them one of the ready ones making it active then immediately open a new one if there s now less than n ready but don t make the client wait for this to complete or you ll lose the advantage of pooling

4 .when the client finishes with an active connection return it to the ready state if there s less than m ready connections

271752
subclass	subclassing
5	
for a.getclass a.clone .getclass to return true super.clone should be called instead of simply new subclass since super.clone presumably would correctly instantiate the class of this object even in subclassing and copy all internal state including private fields which couldn t be copied by subclassing using a copy constructor due visibility rules


272032

272674
key	key-value

when the number of items in the hash reaches the size limit a culling function should be called to get rid of the least-retrieved key-value pairs in the table


273281

granted this is more geared towards using their rates serviceselectedion service as opposed to worldship


273571
perl	python
8	
it should be noted however that perl s changes are much more extensive than python s and likely will be harder to detangle


274215
integer	numeric
0	
if you have various bits differing you still may have largish differences but if you re more likely to have large numeric differences that correspond to usually one or two bits differing you may be better off with a scheme where you create ahebyte array - use the first 4 bytes to encode the first integer and then for each subsequent entry use 0 or more bytes to indicate which bits should be flipped - storing 0 1 2 ... or 31 in the byte with a sentinel say 32 to indicate when you re done


274282
http	https
10	
following your link the user helios makes an excellent point that using 100 http is far less confusing to the user


274325
controllers	controller
5	5	
whenever the user enters text and dismisses the text field the controllers will be sent this message


274359
line	lines
4	
i highly recommend this book if you re interested in understanding how to rasterize line fill polygons writing 3d code without the benefit of using directx or opengl apis


274621
screen-orientation	screens
5	
incidentally you can set this property so it can be used to set your screens-orientation also


274984
contains	any
5	
is there any setting that can be configured in wcf application s web.config or in iis in order to customize the wsdl generated contains host address and put public address instead


275300
pointers	stack
4	
you may have trouble if you lose stack pointers alignment and mix external objects generated with other tools


275410
while-loop	loops
0	
another possibility although messier than either of these two is to set up a while-loops that calls std string find and updates the position of the last found token to be the start point for searching for the next


275459
asp.net	.net
5	
has anybody come across an elegant and efficient .net spam filtering component that can be used in asp.net applications


275759
sequence	numbers
7	7	
as explained in the rfc the uid is the same and the sequence numbers is one greater so i expect outlook to update my previous event entry but all it does is insert a second one


275828
public	protected
5	
the custom method can be written in the code behind file but has to be declared public or protected


275928
controllers	controller
1	
unfortunatly iis 6 needs a file extension to map the request to the right handler which means you will have to use the .mvc suffix on your controllers names such as controllers .mvc action


275962
java	scala
5	
note that this aggravates specially in java where the syntax is not as terse as it could be compared to scala for example


276067
minimized	minimize
5	
the component will need to be repainted every time that the panel is obscured ie frame minimize another window put on top


276211
asp.net	asp.net-mvc
7	
other than the fact that asp.net-mvc web application has more clarity in its implementation of the mvc pattern and that it strictly follows the mvc pattern how is it different from asp.net web application


276433
linq	linq-to-sql
5	
i ve personally found ef to be very clunky and hard to use compared to linq-to-sql which feels very natural


276597
value	field
5	
if the query tries to insert a pre-existing value to a field you php will be notified about this constraint breach


276668
line	lines
0	
simple solutions can be found for complex problems and are typically better than just throw enough line of code at the problem and it ll sort itself out


276718
line	lines
5	
so i have two guys one has written 20 more line that the other one but those 20 more were unnecessary complicated line loop-unrolling and otherwise useless stuff that could have been refactored out


276776
set	contains
5	
files can be considered to contains a set of records each either of a fixed length or ending with a delimiter


276834
margin	margins
0	
for ie you need to do the same with the left margins - either completely remove it set to zero or make it something smaller than the default


277306
stl	boost
10	10	
i ve used both for the same project boost is better integrated with the stl and especially c++ exceptions


277306
c++	python
10	8	
also its memory management mechanism which tries to bridge c++ memory management and python gc is way more flexible than swig s


277306
ruby	python
7	
however swig has much better documentation no external dependencies and if you get the library wrapped in swig for python you re more than half-way there to getting a java perl ruby wrapper as well


277460
encoding	encode
7	
here is a common scheme used in most search engines store deltas of values and encode the delta using a variable byte encoding scheme if the delta is less than 128 it can be encoded with only 1 byte


277511
innodb	myisam
7	0	
innodb is slower than myisam for most uses but can perform faster in certain conditions due to a better locking mechanism


277527
vba	macros
5	
i think that if you a programmer taught your boyfriend vba he would develop some understanding of programming and also have to hand an extremely useful tool for work far in advance of anything that can be achieved by recording macros


277596
environment	building
0	
i found the learning curve on websphere to be considerably steeper than weblogic and our building deploy test life-cycle was so time consuming that we used tomcat in the development environment


277823
ruby-on-rails	django
10	
in ruby most use ruby-on-rails so thats what you hear and django for python is mentioned more then not


277985
driver	kernel
7	7	
vista still has bsod s but they re less frequent because the new driver model has less drivers in kernel mode


278517
arguments	default
5	
if you mean that you want to start eclipse with some command line arguments there is no file where you can add those to be used as default


278896
csv	export
5	
what we have done is export the data from our native format to a csv file which can be opened in excel


278929
csv	export
8	
for one customer we even had to export data from sql stored procedure into csv-like tab-separated format but named file like xxxxx.xls - this way excel opened that file in more correct way than csv file


279366
output	spaces
7	
it is fantastic to be able to see the output breakpoints error list object browser and resharper windows at the same time without having to make them tiny and dock them in the main window which leaves less spaces for code


279665
asp.net	asp.net-mvc
5	
how can this be done in asp.net-mvc


280208
vba	macros
5	
i m not sure if a macros can be run on double click but my vba experience does not come from visio


280689
category	categories
7	
and last you re asking what we think of this ui and i think that a comma separated list of category is easier to code an to fill in


280730
line	lines
0	
currently we treat all warnings as errors fail the build if any fxcop rules fail except a small subset that we disabled fail the build if simian detects any code duplication of more than 5 line across all projects


281300
line	lines
10	
the interface i m thinking of would need to know that kind of thing so the user-defined attributes suggestion is more along the line of what i m thinking


281479
swt	look-and-feel
10	
however if a simpler api is more important to you or if your users demand the ultimate in platform look-and-feel fidelity swt is the best choice


281668
process	interprocess
10	8	
i think it all depends on the coupling typically inter thread communication and synchronization think mutexes thinkg shared memory is much more simpler than interprocess communication think sockets think networking think pipes think mailboxes so when you re logically grouping functionality i would go for threads


281877
glibc	glib
7	7	
the glib manual provides more information


282164
mta	sta
5	
i have messages coming in on mta threads that need to be serviced on sta threads


282409
controllers	controller
10	
forms are handled like models they have their own class so their field list validation rules and display logic is no more scattered throughout the view the controllers and the helper


282643
cakephp	codeigniter
4	2	
on the other hand i ve never played around with codeigniter so i can t recommend cakephp over codeigniter


282725
perl	c++
5	
also perl has a lot of inline classes that allow you to write code in other languages to be called in perl including one for c++


282904
api	account
0	
quick update on this turns out the problem was on twitter s end--the account in question had tighter than normal api limits imposed for some reason


283151
coalesce	isnull
4	
you also could read an article which compares coalesce and isnull


283250
ruby	python
7	
does ruby has bigger appeal to you than python


283465
line	lines
3	
so my question is without getting into the issue of preventing a code of line from getting too long in the first place how would you recommend wrapping lines of code


283674
couchdb	mnesia
4	
i would recommend couchdb instead of mnesia


283713
generator	generator-expression
4	
if you prefer generator-expression to the map function


283840
controllers	controller
4	10	
this means that hitting the website root correctly results in the error the incoming request does not match any route. and any other requests no longer get routed through to your controllers classes so result in a 404


283920
command-line	cmd
5	
no but the cpp preprocessor or m4 can be called on any file on the cmd-line or using a building tool like make or ant


283959
set	contains
0	
note also that the padding set on the contains divs should be no less than the width corner radius of your images though it can certainly be greater should you wish


284104
for-loop	loops
5	
this can be done in any language using for-loops


284128
asp.net	webforms
4	
if you are using asp.net webforms then for handling user authentication verification i d recommend asp.net membership services because it does some of the heavy lifting for you and also helps you from making any elementary security mistakes


284437
line	lines
10	10	8	
a few line that are generic for any object is more efficient than having to manually create a clone that involves possibly private constructors field assignments etc


284481
arguments	default
5	
if it bothers you you could use default arguments to use given arguments first then search for get post values if none are provided though that might be a security risk


284576
perl	python
4	
perl might be able to do a lot of things awk can do but offered the choice in this day and age i would choose python here


284641
java	python
5	
additionally there is pdftextstream which is a commercial java library that can also be used from python


284741
java	python
5	
i know that resorting to java on the server side would be a solution but i just can t imagine that this can t be solved with apache + python


284746
editor	text-editor
5	
i also recommend textexpander which makes the process a little more intuitive and generalized such that the same snippets can be used across text-editor


284948
line	lines
10	
my reasoning is more along the line of removing a lot of software installation and configuration hassles especially when working between different languages platforms frameworks projects


285023
quicksort	radix-sort
0	
i was just going to say radix-sort however that could be a bit above what you were looking to implement introsort is generally the accepted sorting solution for data it s a variation of quicksortthat switches to heapsort when it reaches smaller sets as it s faster on smaller sets than quicksort


285034
set	any
0	
the improved support for mvc is linked to this as you can set ii7 to route requests without extensions to .net so you can have urls which are cleaner such as without having any extension visible which reveals what type of server technology you re using and is very untrendy these days


285174
gtk	pygtk
3	
i would recommend using gtk which binds to python via pygtk and has the glade gui designer


285210
platform	target-platform
7	7	
this step verifies the bigger questions of do we still have a deployable product for each of our target-platform


285440
constructor	object
0	
it was a good enough solution but i don t like the fact that the time needed to convert the stream into an image object with the bitmap constructor is far far far larger than the time needed to download the stream


285632
asp.net	.net
5	
like lubos hasko outlined above with asp.net mvc linq and the new features in c# and even the ability to write .net web service that can be consumed by silverlight i have gotten excited about it again and think you could do well getting into it


285681
line	lines
7	
what s especially annoying about this is that when you change the left part of a line that is longer than all the other lines you need to line up all the other lines all over again


285908
ruby	python
7	0	0	
ruby is slower than perl python and lua


286323
extjs	mootools
4	
i prefer jquery so that is my first recommendation but i worked with yui mootools prototype and extjs before making my decision


286624
line	lines
5	
when there isn t a particular line to be found lines are taken out of the start of the queue one by one to be processed


286692
factory-pattern	abstract-factory
10	
i used ioc quite heavily but dynamic object creation is still better dealt with using an abstract-factory-pattern


287507
having	select
5	
that s why predicate conditions on aggregate values must be placed in having clause not in the where clause and why you can use aliases defined in the select clause in a having clause but not in a where clause


287791
curses	ncurses
10	
while i haven t used either of them in python and it seems ncurses is better supported in c at least i m switching my code to s-lang because of those issues and because deep down i never really liked the ncurses api


288074
java	groovy
10	
thanks everyone for all the answers most of them make the same point groovy integrates slightly better with java then jython or jruby


288615
md5	hash
1	
even though there is a known collision attack against md5 intentional malicious collisions are currently impossible against hash urls


288885
set	any
5	
this is currently how mainstream browsers do this - it s necessary to ensure that example.co.uk can t set a cookie for .co.uk which would then be sent to any other website under .co.uk


288918
quicksort	insertion-sort
7	10	
for example insertion-sort has worse algorithmic complexity than quicksortat least in the average case but in almost all implementations insertion-sort is faster than quicksortfor small n and so quicksorts break out to insertion-sort towards the end


288918
tree	nodes
7	
iirc the balance characteristic of a red-black tree is that the deepest nodes is no more than twice the depth of the shallowest


289163
cassini	iis
7	
the other thing that s a pretty big gotcha is debugging web services is much easier using iis and vdirs rather than separate cassini instances


289258
ogre	irrlicht
1	
now if you want something like this for a free project and you know c++ you may try any of the many open source engines out there such as ogre or irrlicht


289468
contains	elements
4	
i am working on an algorithm that will try to pick out given an html file what it thinks is the parent elements that most likelycontains the majority of the page s content text


289468
tree	children
10	
i have come up with a few ideas such as traversing the html document tree to its leaves adding up the length of the text and only seeing what other text the parent has if the parent gives us more content than the children do


289527
command-line	cmd
4	
is there a way to quickly delete in the server all directories that match this pattern using the cmd-line


290103
asp.net-mvc	webforms
5	
you could also look into the routing library that was built for asp.net-mvc in one of the previews they split those classes off into the system.web.routing namespace and from what i ve heard it can be used with webforms now


290139
screen-orientation	screens
5	
does anyone know where in which event handlers should setscreensorientation int angle be called to set the screens-orientation on application start restore orientation on minimize set the orientation on maximize and restore the orientation on close


290882
callback	methods
2	2	
on one call to the sort methods you might pass a callback function that compares by object name and another time pass a function that compares by object weight or whatever.


291020
account	administration
5	
it s this last step that can be circumvented by administration by returning true to basically all account verification requests but in most cases if the user has intentionally entered a bad address it s already been caught


291039
web-applications	desktop-application
4	
for me the number one reason to favor web-applications over desktop-applications is that they are so easy to distribute


291086
sql-server	sql-server-express
0	
it s a very light database -- much lighter than sql-server express or otherwise and it is easy to implement


291267
lisp	scheme

the guy proposing to base all other numbers on a rational-numbers primitive has never heard of transcendental numbers like pi for example which cannot be represented in this manner


291453
subclass	subclassing
5	
one person on cppunit s sourceforge page claims to have written a subclassing of testcase that will run a particular test an arbitrary number of times although in a slightly different manner than the repeatedtest class offers


292267
linq	linq-to-sql
5	5	
while i m intrigued by it i m also worried that it will be overused like generics and linq-to-sqlclr etc


292343
sql-server	oracle
1	
i must admit that i am not familiar with oracle but i am more or less beaten by sql dialect of sql-server


292944
platform	target-platform
10	
this depends entirely on your target-platform which is more or less a business decision


292975
domdocument	domxpath
10	
for this kind of task reading the document into a domdocument and using domxpath is probably more suitable


293012
boost-asio	boost
5	
it doesn t appear to be built into boost-asio as of current boost svn but if you re willing to write your own classes to simulate the boost asio detail socket_option ones you can always follow the examples in boost asio socket_base.hpp and do the following


293097
contains	any
5	
generally this shouldn t be modified by any user code so expect it to contains the standard functions and nothing else


293236
php	python
0	
python is making oo click much better than php ever has and i m reading more and more on oo principles to enhance this better understanding


293264
project	project-management
5	
i gives a nice briefing about what scrum is all about and how it can be used from project-management


293293
quirks-mode	doctype
5	
also your example doesn t have a doctype - a valid doctype is essential for getting browsers to correctly interpret your code without one you ll be stuck in quirks-mode


293378
json	xml
4	
in which case do what cade recommends and pass the data as xml for example or whatever format you choose json binary etc.. then build your sql right before you actually run the command


293647
postback	ajax
3	
i would recommend using ajax to postback silently every 10 mins or so to keep it alive or increase the timeout of the session as you suggest


293918
denormalized	denormalization
10	
denormalization data is much more often found at places where not enough normalization was done


294026
downcasting	downcast
5	
if you mean that the compare in class b or c should always be passed an object of class b or c no matter what the signature says you can work with pointers to instances instead of instances and try to downcasting the pointer in the method s code using something like


294103
bazaar	git
4	
i worked on a project for one place that were forced to use a locking system and opted to use no control at all so i set up a secret svn branch even though i much prefer bazaar or git


294144
asp.net-mvc	webforms
7	
make sure you read the basics of the two types of asp.net webforms and asp.net-mvc and pick which makes more sense to you


294725
controllers	controller
5	
as the questioner pointed out there are many more urls that should not be routed through this controllers than otherwise


294752
m2e	m2eclipse
1	
unfortunately i m currently using rad rational application developer - ibm s commercial version of eclipse and it is not fully compatible with m2e and i can t use q4e as i m using maven 2.0.7 with no way to upgrade to 2.1


294773
itextsharp	itext
1	
is anyone out there familiar enough with itextsharp s or itext itself barcode components or with code 128a barcodes to tell me how to make the itextsharp one look exactly like the barcode.4net one


294978
set	any
5	5	
however if you allow the size to be inferred like this and you recycle the parameter object in a loop you did say you were concerned with performance then the size will be set by the first value and any subsequent values that are longer will be clipped


294978
double	int
7	
if you assign an int to a double there s no loss of precision because double is wider


294979
sqlite-net	sqlite.net
3	
as to the client side implementation i would recommend investigating sqlite-net or another embedded db


295248
static-class	static-classes
5	
java doesn t have static-classes which don t have any instance constructors and can t be used for variables parameters etc


295300
value	field
7	
so you can say you only want to set a value to an integer field if the value is greater than x otherwise throw an exception


295380
ref	out
5	
fields may be used for out ref parameters properties may not


295487
java	groovy
7	
as everybody said groovy has tighter java integration


295657
order	join
10	
sorting is often faster on the db as well because the db can often do the join in such a way that records are already sorted in the order you want them


295705
php	ruby
4	
personally if forced to make this choice i would choose either php or ruby on rails but there s no valid reason for that outside of a random and subjective choice


295758
business-objects	olap
1	
once you have built a star schema and if you have chosen your dimensions well named your columns wisely and especially chosen your granularity well using this star schema with olap tools like cognos or business-objects turns out to be almost as easy as playing a video game


295795
timeout	terminate
0	
i ve seen in the past that the psi project server interface within microsoft project didn t override the timeout and so the default of 100 seconds was applied and would terminate anything talking to it for longer than that time


295828
margin	margins
4	
i don t know how much faith to put in those types of articles and iirc it beat out lamp by some really small margins


295913
gzip	zip
8	1	
amongst other things it means that people could use the cpio program for packaging the files instead of tar and then use the compressor of choice once upon a time the preferred compressor was pack later it was compress which was much more effective than pack and then gzip which ran rings around both its predecessors and is entirely competitive with zip which has been ported to unix but is not native there and now bzip2 which in my experience usually has a 10-20 advantage over gzip


295945
account	credentials
10	10	
i understand that windows authentication is more secure because you don t have to store credentials in web.config and send them over the wire when authentication to sql server but is that a secure configuration for production environments where the network service account is a db_owner


295977
export	report
4	
the export does this to try and match alignment in excel with the original report


296349
data-structures	map
7	
thrift has richer data-structures map set


296784
backwards-compatibility	compatibility
5	
and can t be changed for backwards-compatibility


297050
memory-management	shared-memory
7	0	
apr is a larger library than glib with lots of useful stuff in it hash tables argument parsing file i o stuff memory-management shared-memory routines signal handling etc.


297155
c++	python
10	
although calling c++ libs from python is more normal - you can call a python module from c++ by bascially calling the python intepreter and have it execute the python source


297221
value	field
5	
if you want to change it from nullable to not-nullable you must provide some value that can be assigned to rows with null value in that field


297228
line	lines
7	7	
i think you need a rule along the line of if the next event is x higher priority and the gap between now and the earliest time is less than y seconds wait and then start the higher priority event


297796
adapter	adaptor
4	
if we compare xml-rpc and soap the latter will give you better data types handling for the former although you will be dealing with simpler data types but you will have to write a layer or adaptor to convert them to your domain objects


298232
markup	xhtml
5	
the goal of xhtml strict is that the xhtml markup should be used to describe the structure of the content


298267
editor	text-editor
0	
it does more than a text-editor which is what i ll carry on using for perl until i find something better


298384
platform	target-platform
0	
while you can get more fine-grained than this if you choose you need to be aware that any greater detail will likely be lost on the target-platform


298405
controllers	controller
4	
when you right click on your controllers action you can choose add view at the top of the context menu


298560
value	field
7	
then when fetching a record from the database if this field s value is more than 5 minutes old you can re-cache the data from the restful api you re not using couchdb are you


298648
excel	worksheet
0	
do you know how to add define more than one worksheet in excel file written using html


298854
contains	any
4	
i recommend lxml over xmlproc because the pyxml package contains xmlproc is not being developed any more


299172
element	document
0	
in practical terms id attributes should only be used one per document class attributes can be used on more than one element on a document


299194
lostfocus	lost-focus
3	
i would recommend using either the lost-focus event on the textbox es that set the acceptbutton or create a gotfocus method that all of the controls that don t use a specific acceptbutton call


300304
javascript	dom
7	0	
that way you can directly work with a javascript object which is friendlier than navigating xml dom


300729
controllers	controller
4	
another approach is that you put a constraint on the default route so it only matches methods you know exist on the controllers


300771
decrement	increment
10	
this library provides more flexible increment and decrement


300775
cell	cells
5	
it could be related to wpf eliminate transparency between grid cell which we never really resolved


301007
priority-queue	queue
0	
i think there is no trivial solution to this problem and my approach is likely no better than the priority-queue approach


301376
selected	button
5	5	
so i am specifically looking for a selectedor to selected a class button to does have img -child elements and another to selected a class button -elements that do not have img -child elements


301516
dependency-injection	facade
7	
please note that when using dependency-injection patterns usage of the facade pattern is far less common than earlier


301535
shell	subshell
5	
as an aside the profile-type ones are run for a login shell only whilst the others tend to be run for any subshell created


301597
sniffing	traffic
5	
even a server side solution can be bypassed by sniffing the traffic


301704
sql-server	oracle
5	
there is an almost equivalent way to do what christhomas123 suggested in sql-server but not oracle which is to say


302019
sql-server	postgresql
1	
i am not familiar with postgresql but is there a database like master in sql-server that you could initially connect to and then later use a different database


302736
java	python
10	
null dereference is handled more gracefully in java c# python etc


302753
denormalized	denormalization
0	
i have been looking into better solutions than the denormalization table i mentioned above


302753
json	xml
5	
it could be stored in xml json or some serialized format that could be read by your application


303192
command-line	cmd
7	7	
for me the shortcut in the windows start menu worked better than running startx from a cmd-line because the default configuration is much closer to what i used in the past


303480
kate	kde
4	
i recommend kate part of kde as an editor


303552
updates	revision
7	7	
basically if the repository revision is larger than your working revision someone has committed changes to that file and perhaps you shouldupdates your version or you may end up with a conflict if you try to commit your own changes at a later time


303593
ruby-on-rails	django
7	0	
ruby-on-rails has many more options than django but has no standard user model


303644
binary-tree	tree
5	
the binary-tree would be structured like a 1-d version of a quad tree


303842
windows-xp	windows
5	
i m wondering if there is any way to create a user account on a windows-xp machine that can be done through scripting from an activex control on a webpage


303945
element	document
7	
the solution is to modify another element that s earlier in the document and has been loaded completely where browser already saw closing tag for it


304026
constructor	object
5	
you can also pass an object array as a second parameter to getbean which will be used as arguments to the constructor or factory


304389
default-parameters	function-overloading
10	
in vb.net which is better to use function-overloading or default-parameters


304474
moq	rhino-mocks
4	
though i m not a moq guy i prefer rhino-mocks the idea behind mocks is interaction testing.


304492
ant	maven
10	
however this is more like ant or nant rather than maven - it is an xml based scripting language designed for software builds rather than using the convention over configuration approach of maven


304706
json	xml
1	
must i only interact with xml json services


304905
c++	python
5	
it s written in c but it has wrappers that allow it to be used in c++ php python ruby and perl


305216
ant	maven
0	
i think that inventing something better than both ant and maven wouldn t be that difficult but that tool doesn t seem to exist yet


305260
m2e	m2eclipse
4	
i choose m2e since it is stable and have all that i need


305434
having	select
5	
secondly i don t know in advance what kind of query might be run this form lets me just type select count name from dbusers against a dozen databases without having to first think about replicating the dbusers table to a master db


305464
cell	cells
5	
someone seems to have had success rendering th cell but did not appear to disclose details - any other suggestions would be gratefully received


305473
linux	unix
0	
if you ve never worked with unix or linux then i d say that learning to deal with rails on windows would be easier than learning unix linux from the ground up


305750
controllers	controller
5	
current support for spring.net controllers dependency injection can be found in mvccontrib


305960
tree	nodes
7	0	
the depth of a multiway tree is much less than a binary tree for the same elements meaning that few seeks on disk are required to locate a nodes


306027
default-value	default
4	
i generally prefer where possible to use the default-value of value types to determine whether they ve been set


306060
line	lines
5	
i had to track a problem with such a query that was using inherited classes and i found out that my pidly-little esql of 4 line got translated in a 100000 characters monster sql statetement


306222
atomicity	atomic
5	
after registration the atomicity class can be used with isinstance and issubclass


306241
logging	trace
5	
2 if we are talking about logging an exception thrown in code for sys admins and developers to read then the matter becomes more of taking the exception s message and stack trace to be recorded in either a log file an e-mail or the event viewer so that it can be handled differently depending on how urgent is it that someone looks into this


306276
constructor	copy-constructor
5	
on the one hand the copy-constructor should create an instance that is as close as possible to the original instance so that it can be swapped out in the display context


306281
aspect	aspects
7	
i think this is more of a question for an aspects oriented programming approach


306467
bazaar	git
4	
some people prefer distributed version control systems such as git mercurial or bazaar


306489
authorization	authentication
5	5	
my guess on that aspect is that the id file stored on the server will still be used for authorization but the successful active directory authentication will be used to unlock access to it


306904
selection	selected
5	
the jquery constructor accepts a 2nd parameter called context which can be used to override the context of theselectedion


307170
.when	ready
5	
is it so small that you could end up with the system still working on the first batch .when another version is ready to be sent out


307238
getter-setter	getter
7	0	
from a performance and design perspective using annotations on getter is a better idea than member variables because the getter-setters are called using reflection if placed on the field than a method


307248
model	datamodel
5	
if the product owner is from the business unit there has to be guidance as to what amount of time should be spent on datamodel etc


307415
line	lines
0	
shouldn t take more than 10 line of code


307673
model	datamodel
5	
there has to be guidance as to what amount of time should be spent on datamodel etc.


307899
sorting	filtering
5	
calculated fields on forms can t be used for sorting filtering and can be annoying in how slowly they display in some situations


308450
linux	solaris
0	
i m currently working on a pet project and need to do c++ development on windows mac linux and solaris and i ve narrowed it down to netbeans and eclipse so i was wonderig which is more solid as a c++ editor


308558
project	project-management
4	
personally i prefer netbeans - the project-management is excellent and i was up and running quicker than with eclipse


308659
login	logout
5	
if i login twice then logout and login again i don t need two login i seem to have traced this to the fact that the cookie exists


308698
asp.net	.net
5	
that combination can also be used in asp.net if running on .net 3.5 and windows desktop apps again .net 3.5


309378
superclass	inherited
4	
unless you can fulfill the entire superclass contract and i know only of several classes that can prefer composition rather than inherited


309610
decrement	increment
5	
a const_iterator is an iterator that points to a const element so while the iterator itself can be updated increment or decrement for example the element it points to can not be changed


309703
checkbox	button
0	
even worse you can have more than one radio button and checkbox with the same name.


309711
line	lines
5	
to clarify i recognize that ib can be used for basic di but i m looking for a framework with more complete functionality including separate production and testing configurations along the line of groovy or springs


310289
32-bit	64bit
0	
if you need larger than 32-bit you could consider using 64bit integers long long or use or write an arbitrary precision math library gnu mp


310354
linux	ubuntu
7	
linux is no better at this either i have a default ubuntu install with dual-booting and it takes about a minute


310435
element	document
10	
harder to line up with other elements since the positioned element is no longer in the document flow and also because of the level of precision required


310514
contains	elements
5	
therefore if the value expression references such an object then the table will be considered to contains just one elements - the collection itself


310548
sequence	numbers
5	
the numbers of times this sequence has to be repeated before this problem happens is variable


310913
vb.net	vb6
5	
as you may have discovered vb6 does not have a ctype function like vb.net does


310913
vb.net	vb6
5	
however the other conversion functions those that have names beginning with c which you may have encountered in vb.net code such as cint and cstr do exist in vb6 and you can use them to convert to and from non-object types


310932
forwarding	port
5	
setup a ssh key so that you don t need to use passwords and tweak the .ssh authorized_keys file on the mysql system to only allow it to be used for port forwarding


311093
postgresql	mysql
5	
measure transactions per second or even better requests per second with a web server stress tool like the grinder which can be scripted in jython with both mysqlbackend and postgresql and afterwards see if that makes a difference


311534
asp.net	asp.net-mvc
10	
the primary difference is that asp.net-mvc is more like regular web development that the rest of the programming world uses whereas standard asp.net was designed to make it brain-dead easy for windows developers to become web developers


311534
asp.net	asp.net-mvc
10	
asp.net-mvc is much more oriented around standards compliance unobtrusive javascript and separation of concerns than regular asp.net


311896
lisp	scheme
0	
i think architecture with sockets was chosen for better portability between different lisp btw slime also supports clojure and mit scheme and os-es slime works on windows too


312000
spreadsheet	openoffice.org
5	
alternatively if you ll have ms office openoffice.org star office or some other compatible office program available at every site a spreadsheet works splendidly for this type of thing


312065
category	categories
0	
labels are better than category


312065
category	categories
7	
that is to say allowing an item to belong to several categories is a better approach than assigning one category to each item


312231
put	get
0	
don t get me wrong it s not that easy if you want to learn programming you need to put a lot of effort into it but in my own experience rails can bring you some instant results while letting you get deeper and deeper over time


312562
line	lines
1	
now if your program still consumes too much memory with tstringlist you can always use tstrings or even istrings in you program and write a class that implements istrings or inherits tstrings and does not keep all the line in memory


312594
ms-access	sql-server
7	
don t think that moving to sql-server is going to improve performance of your queries ms-access often does a better job of optimizing the queries for you it knows what needs to be displayed and does lots of caching and optimization


313083
perl	php
1	0	
the reason i chose perl in the first place is i m very familiar with perl more than php


313188
windows-xp	windows
1	
i am running into a very strange issue with php 5.2.6 w iis on windows-xp have tried both cgi and isapi


313230
nhibernate	ado.net
4	
i would prefer spring.net framework transactions available for both ado.net and nhibernate versions because i believe they support better aop-based aspect oriented programming separation of concerns you will not have to couple your code with transaction code and mostly because these guys have been doing transactions in java for many years and i just trust them that they know what to do


313656
silverlight	wpf
7	
silverlight is more of a subset of wpf and it s missing a few things which means your design style needs to be slightly different


313692
autotest	testunit
10	
for ruby and rails autotest provides much faster and responsive execution of the tests -- when i save a rails model app models foo.rb the corresponding unit tests in testunit foo_test.rb get run


313766
state-machines	petri-net
5	
workflows can be modelled using state-machines petri-nets or various other constructs including plain old scripting languages


313823
xml-serialization	xml
4	
you have 2 options or binary serialization as pirx said or xml-serialization for performance the better is binary but i prefer xml-serialization for its readibility


314215
controllers	controller
4	
keep a reference to each of your action sheets as an instance variable in your controllers class and you can compare this to the actionsheet parameter in your delegate methods to decide what actions you need to perform


314296
java	python
4	
so as to whether you should use the regular python implementation or jython i d say it s a matter of whether you prefer having all the java libraries available or all of the python libraries


314580
boolean	variables
5	
one way of doing the latter is by having a per thread status variables boolean statuses and have statuses i false mean that the thread failed this could be extended to capture more information


314717
command-line	cmd
7	
i do this all the time on the cmd-line where i pipe a regex that gets a superset into another regex that ignores stuff i don t want


314837
line	lines
5	
to clarify for those who may not have understood - this is what i am looking for in publishing it is quite common to layout an inset picture table figure etc. so that its bottom lines up with the bottom of the last line of text of a block or page with text flowing around the inset in a natural manner above and to the right or left depending on which side of the page the inset is on


314865
having	select
7	
if you select a word it will highlight all of those words in the current document makes it easier to find misspellings without having to hit ctrl + f


315407
cos	sin
0	
using a-star instead of brute force pathfinding will be faster just like how bresenham circles are better than using sin cos


315863
project	project-management
7	
in my opinion this is much easier than trying to figure out the overly complicated visual studio project-management scheme


316195
ruby	python
5	
the parrot is an upcoming virtual machine that will be used for perl 6 along with other dynamic languages such as ruby php python to name a few


316701
vmware	virtualization
5	
afaik jar files can be run on any platform that can run java and i would like to use a windows compiled java program on mac without using any extra virtualization wine vmware


317093
lisp	tcl
4	
if you have no problem with a very sparse syntax and assigning variables with set that take tcl ich you want a richer very powerfull syntax with lots of metaprogramming power and you don t mind to put everything in round braces and always begin with the operator like + 2 3 and not 2 + 3 than you should choose lisp


317536
tree	nodes
4	0	
i would also recommend triggers to prevent more than one root nodes null parent per tree and to keep related nodess from belonging to different treeids but those are a little more trivial than the above.


317950
put	get
5	
to get functionality similar to what i was used to i needed to put in the revision that created the branch-head


317990
md5	hash
7	7	
my sense is that encode and decode are probably good solutions when you want the data to be recoverable but that unrecoverable hash using crypt md5 is a better approach for stored passwords


317992
decode	encode
0	0	
without an external perl module you can use instead the built in sha1 function not as good as sha256 but better than encode decode


318067
pack	unpack
1	
i m assuming there is a way to pack unpack the string using the struct package but unfortunately i am very unfamiliar with this process


318100
contains	elements
0	
your query will be a projection so what you ll get back will be an arraylist of tuples contains the results the content of each elements of the arraylist will depend on the query but for more than one value will be


318461
set	contains
5	
also every time you start a try block setjmp has to be called to set up the buffer contains the saved registers while when using dwarf2 the compiler already provides all necessary information at compile time


318668
silverlight	wpf
0	
regarding your second question - in my opinion the programming model of wpf and silverlight allows for a clearer separation between designer and coder microsoft expression design is for designers .net 3.5 is for coders and microsoft epxression blend is somewhere in the middle


318998
set	any
10	
since i don t need to set any of these properties at design time the hidden attribute is probably more appropriate


319645
asp.net	asp.net-mvc
0	
actually it sounds like you would be happier with asp.net-mvc since this is easily doable there by simply setting the form method to get in the view


319758
adapter	adaptor
5	
the adaptor functions as a kind of translator to implementations that could be considered legacy


319803
ref	out
0	
cases where you would absolutely need to define your delegate types include methods that accept more than 4 arguments methods with out ref or params parameters or recursive method signatures delegate foo foo foo f


320429
jquery	lightbox

another perhaps far more complete than lightbox even if it ok i recommend overall if your not using jquery or any other library


320503
operators	conditional
3	
i prefer using conditional and or operators when needed instead of nested ifs


320834
ironpython	ironruby
1	
there are other .net languages which are amenable to scripting - there are the dynamic languages such as ironruby and ironpython and also boo mostly static but with duck-typing where you want it


320928
svn	revision
0	
presumably you could also use the svn etc revision to flag a build error is an instance file is older than a base file but we haven t implemented anything that clever yet


321351
contains	elements
5	
question 2 if a constructor must be specified on the base structure how can a union be implemented to contains that elements and ensure a 0 initialized base elements


321540
ruby	python
5	
phing can do everything shell python ruby scripts can do and can be extended in php which is its major draw for php developers


321844
ssh	telnet
0	
the beauty is that if you later decide to swap it out to ssh or anything more secure than telnet you can with little pain


322214
set	any
0	4	
i personally haven t used dielevel but apparently when it s set to a value greater than zero it can force stack unwinding and tends to hopelessly destroy any program that takes its exception handling seriously. quote from here


322331
line	lines
5	
if something causes the block to be exited early longjmp the debugger can hook that and figure out how far it got into the blocks when it happened and increment only those line


322386
silverlight	wpf
5	
i think that silverlight adoption will eventually drive wpf adoption back on the desktop - or maybe there won t be a desktop as much of what can be accomplished with silverlight will replace many previously desktop applications


322560
caching	browser-cache
5	
no there is no way to force a file in a browser caching to be deleted either by the web server or by anything that you can put into the files it sends


322610
integration	bpm
10	
if the integration is more human oriented documents approvals etc app workflow will do or bpm used as workflow if they already have the tool


323088
feed	feeds
0	
i haven t added anything more than a folder to the views folder called feed


323387
line	lines
5	
it can be used to draw all kinds of shapes line rectangles circles etc


323397
controllers	controller
4	
is it possible to construct an mvc route that matches this so that i get the path in its entirety passed into my controllers


323429
bugzilla	trac
4	
i have used both and didn t like them at all i prefer trac thou if you really need to choose between those two i d go for bugzilla


323542
trac	mantis
0	
i think you ll find that your team will like either trac or redmine more than bugzilla or mantis


323542
trac	redmine
0	
the authors of redmine are trying to create a better trac than trac


323660
compile-time	conditional-compilation
5	
on the other hand if you specify a particular endianness for your files only applications on platforms with non-matching endiannes will have to do additional work and it can be decided at compile-time using conditional-compilation


323893
bugzilla	mantis
4	
i ve used bugzilla and mantis but i prefer mantis simplicity


324025
children	nodes
5	
in any case the adjacency lists can be built in time o number of nodess by simply adding each nodes to the children list of its parent


324047
payment	checkout
5	
in an asp.net 3.5 site we have a relatively standard payment checkout progess that contains a number of pages that need to be visited in sequence shopping basket payment details etc


324114
osx	linux
0	
it will require a little more work than uptime on osx linux since you would have to total the numbers from the first column or omit the process name and simply total the value form each line of output to get the total in cpu usage


324355
lxml	libxml2
4	
but i prefer libxml2 and lxml for python because it seems to be more actively developed and tested


324603
encoding	encode
5	
since no encoding was specified imho this method with no argument should have been deprecated long ago the current system default encoding is used which is usually not utf8 and then the array is again converted as being utf8 encode


324662
expression	brackets
5	
i d recommend using a regular expression to capture all of the variants of how 0 can be specified with double-quotes without any quotes with single quotes with extra whitespace outside the quotes with whitespace inside the quotes how you want the square brackets handled etc


325330
braces	curly-braces
0	
like curly-braces should be on a new line if something spans for more than one row


325542
constructor	private
5	
edit note that the code here could easily be abbreviated by having a private constructor taking the tax rate and the name


325588
hosting	web-hosting
7	0	
php is supported more by web-hosting companies if you re looking for cheap low requirements hosting


325652
turbogears	web-frameworks
7	
turbogears is easier to use grails gives you access to the vast space of java web-frameworks hard to beat


325769
declarative	imperative
5	
however some systems also implement a petri-net or state change based markup system for workflow which might reasonably be described as declarative but they still have an imperative mode of interaction with the underlying system


325770
declarative	declarative-programming
5	
it is definitely not what people usually mean when they talk about declarative-programming even if it some sense can be called declarative


325908
derived-class	subclassing
5	
can it be done without having to create many derived-classes of event i don t want to create so many empty subclassing


326083
widget	button
5	
say you have 2 views that both have a button for edit this widget both of them would have to have logic to get a widgeteditorpresenter and show the associated view


326229
throw	throws
7	0	
im using a fileupload control for my asp application and it throw a httpexception when the file upload size is bigger than the max request length


326294
pointers	stack
5	
unlike c# where you don t need any syntax to denote managed heap objects c++ cli differentiates between stack objects picturebox pb pointers to heap objects and handles to managed heap objects picturebox pb


326421
operators	bitwise-operators
5	
as for the data type smallint is as small as you are going to get sql server really isn t designed to hold individual bits of data and manipulate them but it can be done via bitwise-operators in binary columns but even the smallest of those is much larger on disk


326440
line	lines
7	
the second method reading line is usually more memory efficient because the input byte buffer for decoding doesn t need to contain the entire file


326522
asp.net	.net
7	
having done a rename asp to aspx and change until it compiles port of an application to asp.net i would say that even asp classic style programming in .net is better than asp classic


326624
line	lines
0	
debugging 100 line of code is a lot easier than debugging 100 000 line of code


326689
jar	properties-file
5	
my .class and properties-files and the contents of my meta-inf directory are showing up in the . build directory but my web-inf lib directory seems to be referenced in-place and the jar dependency doesn t get copied in to it to show up as part of the web app library


326747
.war	war
5	
the additional final step is to establish a java ee module dependency between your dynamic web project and the shared library which causes the utility s classes to be placed in web-inf lib during deployment and even during export of the.war


327081
perl	python
5	
you could do the whole job in perl or python - indeed the cut work could be done by awk


327145
cruisecontrol	cruisecontrol.net
4	
you may also need to change the asp.net version you can do this on the asp.net tab -- choose either v1.1 or v2.0 whichever cruisecontrol.net requires


327248
oracle	oracle-xe
5	
if you are looking for an alternative oracle application express is a fairly powerful web based app that can be run on oracle-xe


327482
controllers	controller
7	
i am not sure if having twice the number of controllers is better than those if-else statements around a single controller but i guess it s a question of personal preference


327525
asp.net	webforms
1	
i would like something as simple as security trimming of the web.sitemap that i have tried with asp.net webforms


327586
arrays	loops
1	
yes the compiler may optimize it away but it s generally very conservative with floating-point optimizations and it may treat fp values read from memory differently from ones read from a register which means it can t eliminate your arrays lookups from loops conditions so it s often best to do even simple optimizations manually


327746
asp.net	asp.net-mvc
4	
also asp.net-mvc is built so you can mix and match the view engine orm javascript framework although i recommend jquery and what not to the one more of your liking


328075
ruby	python
1	
if you don t have a preference start with python as it is easy to learn and use and if it is too slow with python perl and ruby probably won t be able to do any better


328225
getter-setter	getter
7	
in my experience with hibernate it s safer and more flexible to annotate getter-setter methods instead of fields anyway so i suggest sticking to that design if you can


328228
8bit	16-bit
5	
for example if int is only 16-bit wide in a particular implementation then jan can t be represented anymore like you intend it char must be at least 8bits while a character literal is always of type int


328433
command-prompt	cmd
5	
to logon as the console user the one to be used for logging in locally then you use a parameter for mstsc.exe from a cmd-prompt type in mstsc h to see the help


328441
set	any
5	
in this case you re never resetting the font size so once you set that font size on a cell it will be used on any row after it that re-uses the cell


328461
server-side-includes	include
0	
many webservers support some form of ssi server-side-includes this feature lets you add some tags into the html as a very limited form of scripting much simpler and faster and older than php


329073
ienumerator	ienumerable
5	
it is a matter of seperating responsibilities ienumerable is a class that can be iterated over ienumerator is a class that does the iteration


329388
vim	emacs
5	
this can be used with any decent editor such as vim emacs or many other editors and ide s


329581
asp.net	asp.net-mvc
5	
how can this be done with asp.net-mvc


329742
vim	emacs
4	
as for an editor if you like cli stuff then emacs or vim is the way to go i prefer emacs


329851
packets	packet
5	
once a packets is received its data can either be copied out or thrown away


329947
controllers	controller
5	
if that page was a form the form may then be submitted the controllers handles validation creates the necessary model and uses it to save the data


329975
margin	margins
7	
i find this difficult because you can test the layout on your screen and not know how it appears on someone else s and for ex. a 20px margins has more of an effect on a 768px or 960px fixed-width layout than it does on a 1280px-liquid computer screen


329979
adapter	adaptor
0	
even if uuidcreatesequential does work for this it s a pretty obscure way to get the info and hides potential issues like a computer having more than one adaptor


330267
md5	hash
5	
opens source code for crypto hash implementations md5 and sha can be found at mozilla code


330358
md5	hash
5	
if hash functions such as md5 were reversible then it would have been a watershed event in the history of data compression algorithms


330370
linq	linq-to-sql
4	
if you can use .net 3.5 and sql server 2005 or 2008 i would recommend linq-to-sql


330491
lisp	common-lisp
10	
common-lisp seems more about integrating good ideas from oo fp and other paradigms than about pure fp


330762
silverlight	wpf
7	
the missing piece in silverlight that affects more to the model-view-viewmodel pattern is that it doesn t implements commands like wpf


330950
mouse	click
4	
draw a string on a control then match mouse click to the character positions on the form


331345
linq	linq-to-sql
5	
that compiles however i get a runtime error local sequence cannot be used in linq-to-sql implementation of query operators except the contains operator.


332078
persistence	hibernate
7	
database persistence is much easier with frameworks such as hibernate and ibatis than with entity beans even in the new java ee standard


332254
min	max
5	
i can change the field settings on the time data to return grouped values such as count or max but am struggling to see how this can be setup to show max time - min time for each id hence why i m thinking about heading to sql


332266
oracle	mysql
0	
we had a number of applications that were tiny one or two tables no more than 50k rows and instead of using oracle which at the time wasn t allowed due to licensing we developed on mysql


332459
postgresql	mysql
7	
i m currently considering which is a better choice for my php application - mysqlwhich i m more familiar with or postgresql which has less php support no object-oriented wrapper but seems tried and tested


332577
line	lines
0	
it does not appear to support more than 12 line


332602
superclass	subclassing
5	
a in true object-oriented fashion it s possible that the superclass can exist by itself and need not be modeled in any subclassing


332663
set	any
0	
many compilers accept more than this character set at this time but there isn t any guarantee


332674
postgresql	mysql
5	
another list of reasons why mysqlis bad can be found at this excellent comparison versus postgresql


332703
set	bag
5	
the xml needs to be changed from bag to set for all collections and the entitities themselves were changed to implement icomparable which is a requirement of a set for uniqueness to be established


332815
subclass	subclassing
1	
if you wanted to subclass the list type in python code you were out of luck and so various workarounds were used instead such as subclassing the pure python implementation of lists in the userlist module instead


332960
postgresql	mysql
10	
this is much less prevalent now mysqlpostgresql sqlite etc


333144
ado.net	entity-framework
5	
methods and calculated fields anything in the partial classes are not transmitted over ado.net data services - if you are also using ado.net data services anything you expand the entity-framework objects on in partial classes will not be transmitted over ado.net data services


333320
pthreads	openmp
4	
i prefer openmp or pthreads also known as pthreads


333364
generics	subtyping
5	
which needs to pass known subtyping of icommand to an apropriate handle specificcommand command method implementation and do some generics handling of unknown types


333419
inner-join	join
5	
to retrieve a single item tables must be joined one-to-one select from items inner-join pictureitems on items.id pictureitems.id where items.id n


333440
rabbitmq	activemq
10	8	
activemq which is way more popular than qpid or rabbitmq - or indeed any jms provider would work just fine


334052
md5	hash
7	
as the number of possible input files is larger than the number of 128-bit outputs it s impossible to uniquely assign an md5 hash to each possible


334355
unmanaged	native-code
1	
native-code is often synonymous with unmanaged but is not identical


334592
ruby	python
0	0	
you d be better off with ruby python perl java or even php


334817
xslt	xsl-fo
7	0	
xslt apply-templates is much richer and deeper than xslt for-each even


335276
asp.net	webforms
1	
also since sometimes i work with asp.net webforms how is this done with webforms as well


335379
administration	integrated
5	
however the column can be managed just like any other blob column in sql server so administration can use the manageability and security capabilities of sql server to integrated blob data management with the rest of the data in the relational database without needing to manage the file system data separately


335542
element	document
5	
better you use the w3c dom api which is standardized and provides a clean way to build up a element tree which can be appended to any child element into the document tree


335796
accurev	svn
0	
but from my experience it just can t beat the commercial alternatives especially accurev but also clearcase perforce etc. which will give you much more than what svn is capabale


335866
multiplication	addition
5	
and the three new points can be found using scalar multiplication and vector addition


336275
oracle	mysql
2	
i have fond feelings for mysqland their being able to compete with oracle and sql server


336275
sql-server	sql-server-express
10	
first i do not like sun and second sql-server express is significantly more robust and enterprise than mysql


336275
sql-server	sql-server-express
7	
it seems that for db simpletons like me sql-server express is easier to setup and use and is faster and more stable


336295
sql-server	mysql
4	2	
personally i prefer sql-server over mysql


336309
line	lines
5	
particularly i want to not be tied to mysql a database or preferably any given software i d really like it to be trivial to wright a program that can read it back in something like a few dozen line of c or perl


336361
asp.net-mvc	webforms
1	
deployment is very easy with asp.net-mvc and with the changes coming to visual studio 2010 for easier deployment of web sites via packages. i currently maintain 2 asp.net-mvc sites and find it with bin-deployment to be just the same as a regular asp.net webforms site


336745
elevated-privileges	privileges
5	
if there are custom actions involved requiring elevated-privileges they need to be configured as deferred in system context


337137
packets	packet
0	
the maximum packet age is dictated by network properties an example being that satellite lifetimes are higher than lan lifetimes since the packets have much further to go


337201
ruby	python
4	
it does depend on what type and size of application you re building but i think there are good reasons why many people choose php ruby and python for their personal projects where they get to choose what language they build web apps in and not their superiors


338292
contains	any
5	
you could also look for any record contains e or or any other character that could be interpeted as numeric according to the sources already given


338385
http	https
4	
trying to make a web service call to an http endpoint in my silverlight application results in this error could not find a base address that matches scheme http for the endpoint with binding wshttpbinding


338504
32-bit	64bit
0	
a 64bit binary will be larger than a 32-bit binary due to code side differences static data etc


338537
adapter	adaptor
4	
i am using zend_config_ini config adaptor i prefer ini for base configuration


339544
windows-xp	windows
7	
virtualbox also seems much faster at launching a vm and much better at translating the graphics keystrokes to and from the vm both on ubuntu desktop and on windows-xp


339610
required	checked
10	
you might be running afoul of uac which is more stringent about checked the security permissions required for various actions


339745
category	categories
5	
once the student outcomes and their parent category have been added there is very little reason for them to be modified in any way


339794
linq	linq-to-sql
5	
this can be done in linq-to-sql but it s a manual process that s far from the default configuration


340054
height	width
7	0	
add a new row untilheight is greater than width


340054
height	width
7	
add a new column until width is greater thanheight


340250
hotmail	gmail
5	
i should have mentioned that this is for an internal application and i expect 99 of users to be using outlook or other client but never hotmail or gmail etc


340626
request	http-request
1	
however this will only last for the lifetime of the current http-request so i m not sure how you make it work - the request for the bugzilla page from your browser frame will be considered completely separate by apache


340819
32-bit	64bit
5	
in windows x64 a process may be started as 32-bit or 64bit process


341026
mouse	keyboard
4	
if constantly jump between mouse and keyboard you lose this advantage


341077
unmanaged	managed-code
0	
but none of those is something you want programming languages are different and the only way people have found to unify them is by compiling them to a common machine model that s the idea behind microsoft s clr even more than behind the jvm because the clr is really broad you can do unmanaged-code compile c++ to it efficiently.


341113
content-management	content-management-system
4	
the nice thing about this is if you have a boss who prefers excel or a content-management system that uses html its not too difficult to change this format into some other output destination format


341761
order	add
5	
i had a parametrized insert statement that was working well and i needed to add a select statement and wrap it all in a transaction in order to get data for one of the fields for the insert


342016
java	groovy
1	5	
this was frankly painful in java because closures were so wordy starting with java 8 lambda expressions can be implemented like in many other languages c# lambda expressions or groovy and this special case is handled since java 7 with try-with-resources and autoclosable streams


342065
margin	margins
10	10	
notice that it can be done top answer but also notice that the second-place answer by a short margins says more or less the same thing as i mention above


342289
lostfocus	lost-focus
4	
if it s set to lost-focus then it checks whenever the control loses focus


342293
execute	declare
5	
if i declare them with recompile anexecuteution plan will be generated each time


342492
movie	player
7	
maybe there s a better way to do it but in my experience loading the movie player takes time


343318
project	project-management
7	
ultimately any project-management plan is better than none and the sooner you realise there is a problem the less impact it will have


343319
value	field
5	
define serialized field starting value of 1 increment by 1 insert leading zeros


343574
agile-processes	agile
0	
moreover scrum and agile-processes are more than a set of practices there are underlying principles


344086
contains	any
4	
the reason it s safe is that the string it returns will only contains the digit characters 0 through 9 not any fancy unicode digits so the conversion to ansistring will not lose any information


344281
directory	folder
7	
the problem is that i ve now accumulated a bunch of backup folder in each project directory which makes it harder to find the specific change i was looking for


344327
integer	zero
0	
in this case populated is defined as not null having a length greater than zero if a string or not equal to 0 if an integer


344506
command-line	cmd
0	
indeed i do the above plus deactivating zip support regsvr32 u zipfldr.dll activating the underscore on alt shortcuts advanced appearance replacing courier new by andale mono replace with your favorite font in all program settings after installing it of course installing my favorite utilities unxutils sysinternals scite filemenu tools which has cmd-line here and lot of other goodies etc. and so on


345339
winpcap	libpcap
5	
packet capture functionality requires kernel mode support hence you will at the very least need to have your application require or install libpcap winpcap as will dean pointed out


346117
command-line	cmd
7	
one reason for this is that git exposes the lower level functions that most users will ever need as cmd-line tools


346921
controllers	controller
0	
edit for any view controllers combo not sure you ll find anything simpler than this


347317
atomicity	atomic
1	
putting it alone in its own transaction is probably unnecessary as updates are atomicity


347355
32-bit	64bit
0	
most recent newer than 2.5.68 32-bit linux systems use vdso page aka linux-gate.so.1 and 64bit systems will soon start as well 64bit vdso was introduced in kernel 2.6.24


347506
margin	margins
5	
and the result is a perfectly centered pair of tables that responds fluidly to arbitrary widths and page re sizes and the align center table attribute could be hoisted out into an outer div with margins autos


347919
m2e	m2eclipse
5	
for me the quality of m2e can be judged by this simple example if you run eclipse on a jre instead of jdk m2e shows a warning that some of its features rely on a jdk


348306
wordpress	phpbb
7	
a typical lamp application like wordpress or phpbb runs more than 10 queries per pageview without problems


348548
kohana	codeigniter
4	2	
i prefer kohana over codeigniter ymmv


348652
integer	long-integer
5	
in access 2007 it can be changed from long-integer to replication id


349254
lookup	any
4	
first they use some fairly general search pattern to pick out everything that could be an address and then they use their map database to lookup that string and see if they get any matches


349313
32-bit	64bit
7	
while not big enough to be an issue it proves what we were already seeing from the previous benchmark results 32-bit code runs slightly slower in a 64bit environment than it does in its native 32-bit habitat


349791
packets	packet
4	
can anyone recommend any programmer-friendly extensible frameworks or systems for performing network level packets fuzzing


350050
ruby	python
7	
however if you use apache it is probably easier to use php ruby or python whereas if you use iis or weblogic or domino it will be easier to do it in java c#


350074
key	key-value
5	
property file if the data can be represented as key-value


350720
http	https
0	
secondly you can have more than request-replay messaging patterns including asynchronous notifications from server to client impossible with pure http and thirdly abstracting away the underlying transport protocol from xml messaging and thus elegantly supporting http https tcp and other


350749
set	any
5	
if a html page could set the file to be uploaded using javascript for instance an arbitrary html page could upload any file from the client computer form submission can be triggered via javascript


351349
php	ruby
0	0	
php ruby on rails are optimized for crud and both perform slower than java java ee or c# which are both common enterprise standards


351349
ruby	python
4	
once you ve used all this advice to convince your boss that you won t lose out on anything by using lamp if you crunch the numbers and show your them that it is going to take 6 man-months to build the site in java and only 3 to build it in ruby python then that s really what it comes down to


351438
asp.net	.net
2	4	
after all if you couple a project with linq 2 sql ef asp.net mvc and potentially dynamic data if you need that sort of thing i really can t think of any compelling reasons to choose rails over .net however i can choose reasons to select .net over rails - after all hands down the rich debugging experience with vs.net rich intellisense and watcher quickwatch support plus the asp.net mvc framework supports html action helpers model binders support and encouragement for unit testing and now with the inclusion of jquery and json results you re virtually unstoppable


351548
compression	streaming
4	
actually i recommend boost serialization and boost iostreamings which includes a compression streaming that transparently can compress your data too

row	cursor
0	
if you want to select more than 1 row you can use either an explicit cursor


351929
line	lines
4	
that feels cleaner to me than trying to shell out to a process and working with that plus it only will pick out the exact line with clientlogin email that you re looking for


352049
feed	feeds
5	
all rss feed can be read with silverlight


352124
boolean	variables
8	
bear in mind that the clr isn t going to try to pack multiple variables into a byte so having one on its own would be no more useful than boolean


352128
boolean	double
1	
however if you don t find one in the flea market or happen to have on in the attic i d recommend bit-arrays because with the incredible advent of 64-bit your boolean will become as big as double the horror


352605
stored-procedures	ado.net
5	
now using print statements that can then be read from ado.net by implementing a handler for the infomessage event i can simulate a trace for stored-procedures


352982
oracle	mysql
4	
i prefer oracle and consider mysqlto be a toy database although mysqlhas got few useful features that don t exist in oracle


353110
linq	linq-to-sql
4	
in my current case i have a bunch of classes generated by linq-to-sql which cause a lot of fxcop issues and obviously i will not modify all of those to match fxcop standards as a lot of those modifications would be gone if i re-generated the classes


353305
sql-server	oracle
1	
but don t expect to see anything as big as sql-server or oracle in that area anytime soon


353467
system-tray	tray
5	
how do i create a system-tray component in vb.net that can be used to monitor the progress of the service


353493
controllers	controller
5	
make sure favicon.ico points towards the webroot rather than the local directory or else requests will be generated for controllers action favicon.ico rather than favicon.ico - and thus trigger your action


353751
security	single-sign-on
10	10	
i would say use open id for single-sign-on where the security isn t vital blog forums etc and something more like microsoft cardspace for things where security is more important ecommerce


353892
login	authentication
5	
conventional website authentication performs a comparison with data held in a private database so your username and password can be used to login to this website only


353918
virtualbox	virtualization
4	
there are turnkey wamp packages out there or you could install to a linux box vm i recommend virtualbox for virtualization


354023
line	lines
5	
i agree w the accepted answer by craig h however i d like to add that in school i was taught that white space comments and declarations shouldn t be counted as line of code in terms of measuring the line of code produced by a programmer for productivity purposes - ol 15-line-per-day rule


354305
integer	digits
0	
does that mean the sql database will reserve two bytes for each integer or that each integer can not have more than two digits


354352
sql-server	oracle
0	
this would probably be better than oracle or sql-server as it is specialized for this type of work


354420
gridview	detailsview
4	2	
personally i prefer listview over gridview and detailsview if possible it gives you more control over your html


354954
csv	xml
4	
change this to save to a file in whatever format you prefer csv tab delimited xml etc.


355030
atomicity	atomic
5	
just in case anybody wants the larger context i am building get and put operations for an atomicity queue that can be called from shell scripts


355124
contains	any
4	
your regex will essentially match any part of the string that ends in and does not contains another for instance in it matches and in it matches


355274
count	difference
5	
to work around difference when classes don t share the same inheritance tree using helpers makes it possible to have have generic count and items properties for example


355940
request	http-request
4	
you configure the program using a text file containing rules that match http-request and then write actions to perform once a rule is matched


356394
ruby	python
0	
php perl ruby python i have worked with perl and to a lesser extent with python


356502
adobe-indesign	indesign
5	
i often get a pdf from our designer built in adobe-indesign which is supposed to be sent out to thousands of people


356531
command-line	cmd
5	
setting up async operations on your wcf service can be done as ninja posted by setting asyncpattern true or it can be done on the client side by telling svcutil to generate the async end points by setting the correct cmd-line argument or by checking the generate asynchronous operations option in the gui version of svcutil


356548
http	https
5	
is there anything special that needs to be done in order to respond back over http in this way


356584
asp.net	webforms
2	
if you re starting a new project now i d recommend sticking with asp.net webforms and make use of a the built in asp.net ajax the toolkit and jquery as needed


356602
updates	updating
4	
if your application generates a lot ofupdatess you ll prefer innodb storage engine which allows to lock only one row when updating vs all the table on myisam


356676
delphi	c++
5	
this example is in delphi but can very easily be converted to c++ it s all win32


356727
windows-vista	windows
5	
before windows-vista you could have configured your service to interact with the desktop


356852
fixed-point	arbitrary-precision
0	
is there a specific reason you re using floating-point for currency or would things be better off with an arbitrary-precision fixed-point number format


356941
margin	margins
5	
here you haven t given either div a new width or any additional instruction about where in the layout they should now go so it pins itself to the left margins and it s top margins finds the nearest block element to pin to still the body


358335
http-redirect	postdata
4	
as long as you are only using an internal rewrite not an http-redirect you should not lose postdata


358749
selected	checkbox
5	
one of the features of a radio input is that an item in a radio set once selected cannot be deselected except by another member of the set being selected unlike a checkbox set


358849
c++	python
1	
our source code is mainly c with python c# and gnu makefile and a little c++ and bash


359242
windows-xp	windows
5	
the same can be achieved from windows-xp on with


359261
c++	python
5	
i see in the sidebar of your question a similar question converting pdf to html with python which points to a library poppler which is apparently written in c++ perhaps can be accessed with jni jna and to a related question which offers even more answers


359720
distance	polygons
0	
to prevent overlapping you can test each new polygons against each existing polygons and reject the new one if the distance between the centers is less than the sum of the radii


360494
processor	cpu
7	
passive loadbalancing if a physical cpu is running more than one task the scheduler will attempt to run any new tasks on a second physical processor


360788
windows-vista	windows
5	
before windows-vista you could have configured your service to interact with the desktop


361072
superclass	inherited
5	
side note the objective-c language does not support multiple inherited a class can only derive from one superclass but much of the same functionality can be provided by protocols because a class can conform to several different protocols


361372
moq	typemock
4	
so far i found that we can buy typemock to mock the sharepoint objects and then use any free mocking framework moq


361607
drawrect	draw
5	
you can assign click event handler to control whose surface will be used to drawrectangle


361956
packets	packet
7	
udp has less overhead for headers so that one packets can carry more data so the network bandwidth is utilized more efficiently


362023
quicksort	insertion-sort
0	
theoretically quicksort should work faster than insertion-sort for random data of medium to large size


362024
quicksort	insertion-sort
0	
unless you ve hit one of quicksorts pathological cases often a list that is already sorted quicksortshould be o n log n substantially faster than insertion-sort s o n 2 as n increases


362089
dedicated	dedicated-server
0	0	
update 2 since this was posted back in 2008 i have switched to dedicated-servers from serverloft where i get dedicated hardware for less money than shared vps at serverintellect.


362607
windows-vista	windows
5	
windows messages can still be used in windows-vista


362640
static-class	static-classes
0	
besides all of this in any given application there s likely to be a much bigger bottleneck than processor caches for shared data in static-classes


362643
radio-button	button
7	
i agree with annakata that this question needs some more clarification but here is a very very basic example of how to setup an onclick event handler for the radio-button


363285
http	https
4	
the exception message is could not find a base address that matches scheme http for the endpoint with binding basichttpbinding


363899
contains	any
4	
there is a dropdownlist in one of them and when user selects any item from dropdownlist it can pass the selected value to the other user control which includes gridview to show related data of selected item value from the user control whichcontains the dropdownlist


364021
readability	code-readability
5	
the second option should be preferred for code-readability


364282
itext	apache-fop
10	
itext is more feature rich than apache-fop as far as pdf is concerned you can add annotations create acroforms digitally sign a pdf document


364438
editor	text-editor
0	
but the intellisense still makes it better than most text-editor


364735
category	categories
5	
to minimize the amount of time the user needs to wait you could also consider implemented two category of classes those that need the entire dataset to function and those that can function once a subset of the data has been loaded


364824
generator	generator-expression
0	
if you need more than one value you can also use a generator-expression and grab a few at a time


365424
dlopen	dlsym
1	
i had taken a look at apache s guide and am fairly familiar with dlopen and dlsym and dlclose


365556
category	categories
0	
each user only has one blog each blog has many categories each category has many posts and each post can belong to more than one category


365638
line	lines
8	
it s more simple than javascript and just a few line of code you can use jquery calendar on your page


365804
dlopen	dlsym
0	
given that i know little about apache modules i would try to remove apache from the equation try writing a simple c program that does little more than a dlopen and possibly the subsequent dlsym then exits


365834
innodb	myisam
7	
innodb has more overhead but uses row-level locking so that reads and writes can happen concurrently without the problems that myisam s table locking incurs


365945
firefox	safari
8	
but i haven t yet figured out whether it s me writing sloppy code with firefox perhaps being more forgiving than safari or if it s safari or if it s jquery


365985
delphi	c++
5	
if plugins will be developed in delphi or c++ builder use packages + interfaces


366003
jquery	dojo
0	
also i think dojo and mootools have faster animations than jquery at least in my experience


366151
asp.net	asp.net-mvc
5	
if that s it then all asp.net web controls depending on viewstate postback cannot be used in asp.net-mvc right


366206
asp.net	.net
10	
postback is a term that gets introduced very recently by asp.net programming as dreas explained whereas callback is more generic and has been used way before web development exists


366544
perl	awk
5	
that could be done using tail or awk or perl depending on the commands you have available


366574
line	lines
5	
that being said i agree with everyone else that the method should be broken out into single responsibility methods instead of hundreds of line of code


366717
svn	visualsvn
4	
i d recommend visualsvn server to get set up and running quickly


366868
contains	any
4	
your first regular expression will not select any links that contains other tags such as img or b


366876
linq	linq-to-sql
5	
the insertx updatex deletex methods are called after linq-to-sql has determined which objects will be included in submitchanges


367082
perl	python
5	
everything sed and awk do can be done in python or perl often more simply and sometimes faster too


367082
perl	python
7	
by doing things in python or perl your implementation depends on fewer languages with a resulting increase in clarity


367387
upgrade	versioning
10	7	0	
this code is more for an example and in this example below it is checking to see if the versioning of notepad.exe needs to be upgrade that means the versioning stored in the property table value notepad_verson is greater than the versioning of notepad.exe on the system


367396
subclassing	inherited
5	
in a language like java or c++ which conflate subtyping with inherited your use of polymorphism may be restricted to subclassing of a particular class


367627
linq	linq-to-sql
5	
there were supposedly some classes in the linq-to-sql provider model that were sealed--but i never really figured out exactly which classes need to be unsealed in order to use it


368172
controllers	controller
0	
put semantic violation in a separate validator class this date field has to be after that date field this can be null if that is greater than zero and call the validator from the controllers passing errors back to the view for display


368309
decode	encode
5	
be warned that this returns you an object which may be encode use decode to get a body with usable data


368415
directx	gdi
10	
wpf uses directx for rendering which is much faster instead of the native windows gdi


368466
directx	gdi
10	
to say directx is faster than gdi is also something of a simplification - wpf and gdi-based rendering technologies just have different performance characteristics


368700
profiling	debugging
5	
i found that it was much easier for me to develop code in eclipse compile it with ant using etaras rapc ant tasks but they seem to be gone -- blackberry ant tools seem to be a suitable replacement and use the jde for debugging profiling etc


368713
identity-column	cursors
4	
even if you kept the cursor which i do not recommend cursors are a very bad way to do inserts as they are very slow compared to the set-based solution that pete gave your code could not do the insert to the first table if column d is the identity-column which i would guess it is since you later try to assign d to the identity value


369115
windows-server	windows
10	10	
in a windows-server 2008 domain with fine grained password policy this get s more complicated though since you can have different password policies for different ou s


369283
cell	cells
10	
i d guess if you need a thousand or more cell values this is probably faster than just looping through different cells and polling the values


369295
denormalized	denormalization
5	
you are trying to be normalized and denormalization at the same time


369779
diagram	entity-relationship
3	
well a picture tells a thousand words so i would recommend creating entity-relationship diagram whentity-relationshipe you can view the relationship between tables at a glance something that is hard to do with a text-only description


369817
zero	difference
0	0	
if any two consecutive buckets have more than zero elements each maximum difference between them is


370199
encoding	encode
5	
basically unicode can be encode with many encoding and encode strings can be decoded to unicode


370595
asp.net	asp.net-mvc
5	
how do you think objectcontext should be managed in asp.net-mvc to both avoid lots of opening disposing and prevent race conditions


370799
attributes	properties
5	
pfattributes meansproperties will be stored as attributes of xml elements


370996
atomicity	atomic
5	
if the structure is intended to be thread safe then the methods should be made instance methods only if they do atomicity operations else static methods should be chosen


371363
line	lines
0	
both quoting and mis redirection are my main gripes and that s why i moved to sh scripting staying as close as possible to posix sh and for scripts with more than 20 line roughly i move to a real language ruby in my case


371491
sorted	lookup
0	
but lookup in a sorted list may be faster than any of these others structures i ll explain this shortly so you may come out on top


371491
tree	linked-list
0	
as in linked-lists and binary tree each entry is a node storing more than just key and value also separately-allocated in some implementations so you use more memory and increase chances of a cache miss


371491
key	key-value
0	
you d still have a slightly higher possibility of a cache miss though since the node objects would be necessarily larger than the key-value pairs


371778
8bit	128bit
10	
indexing a text value guid in textual form or a 128bit binary value which a guid is is far more expensive than an integer


371821
apache	lighttpd
10	
for instance in some benchmarks lighttpd is even faster at serving static resources than apache


371885
asp.net	asp.net-mvc
4	
i recommend having a look at asp.net-mvc stackoverflow is built with it


371911
category	categories

it s not old hat by any means but your example takes the use of category to a rather bizarre extreme


372170
line	lines

a few years ago someone challenged me to do a delphi port of a tiny ray-tracer less than 200 line of c code


372258
throw	throws
5	
the problem occurs when the result of method geta which at runtime actually returns an is assigned to a reference of type - this statement throw the classcastexception because object cannot be cast to double


372308
throw	throws
10	
this becomes more important if you have more than one method call in your method that throw the same exception


372701
c++	python
5	
if you don t want to use c++ than it can be done in python


372709
http	https
7	0	
i ve been on lans where the performance of svn is worse than http connections to the internet


372821
atomicity	atomic
5	
if the structure is intended to be thread safe then the methods should be made instance methods only if they do atomicity operations else static methods should be chosen


372821
x86	64bit
5	
note that this behavior can t be observed with double values on common processor as most x86 instructions have a version working with 64bit chunks such as movl


373085
glibc	glib
5	
i use glib and as such know that i will be spared having to deal with this nonsense as ulrich drepper lead maintainer for glib said about the topic


373288
attributes	properties
4	
there are other libraries with possible different properties ignore attributes name i personally prefer this one since it s very flexible in json converter extensions etc + it can easily serialize anonymous objects


373574
value	field
5	
the combination could be used to populate a table with an appropriate set of value for the date time field and then do the loj against that table or more precisely from temp_table left outer join main_table ...


373607
reflection	runtime
4	
i personally prefer reflection instead of code generators but i agree that code generators are more flexible and resulting code obviously faster during runtime


373615
controllers	controller
10	
this is much more palatable than my original solution where one controllers updates all views -- and thus has to know which views need special care and feeding to avoid loops


373663
line	lines
7	0	
i have the flowdocument turning blank when i add a paragraph that is more than 450 line to the paragraph


373794
order	join
0	
i m not sure whether to consider topics like fork join wait notify lock order memory model basics just the basics and so forth to be part of what every reasonably seasoned developer ought to know or whether these are topics that are more for semi-specialists developers who have made a conscious decision to know more than the average developer about concurrent programming


373935
backwards-compatibility	compatibility
4	
forget about proprietary apis such as jdom or apache ones apache xerces xmlserializer because will tie you to a specific implementation that can evolve in time or lose backwards-compatibility which will make you change your code in the future when you want to upgrade to a new version of jdom or whatever parser you use


373983
sip	sdp
0	
internet telephony is a lot more than sip - rtp rtcp sdp on-device audio handling etc.


374073
latex	miktex
5	
this can then be converted to pdf although you ll need to install a latex distribution such as miktex


374203
login	registration
1	
it ll require registration and login to leave comments but guest access just to read and i d like it to be pretty excuse me while i remember damning customers for providing similarly vague requirements specs - but not necessarily infinitely-configurable with skins themes etc


374282
public	protected
5	
i still can t figure out how to cleanly make some of these mixin methods private or protected though only the display and number_of_displays method should be included as public methods


374295
perl	c++
3	
git is probably the most popular but i would recommend trying darcs - as it is compiled into a portable single binary file unlike git which is a mess of shell-scripts perl scripts libraries and c or c++


374322
sdl	allegro
1	
i ve been doing c c++ for a long time but never really pegged myself as either win32 mfc directx wxwidgets qt boost sdl allegro etc etc


374357
http	https
10	10	
if you rely on codebase to distinguish code a http url is better


374430
asp.net	asp.net-mvc
4	
this is sort of off topic but having been down the route of creating a cms with xsl t and the pain that caused i d recommend asp.net-mvc for other reasons than intellisense


374539
sequence	numbers
5	
so yes the integrity of the sequence will be preserved and numbers will not be reissued


374598
line	lines
0	
on the other hand what if there are more than two line in text


375052
midi	osc
5	
when an audio or midi clip is played triggered its name needs to be sent using osc to another application


375160
getter-setter	getter
10	
if the getter-setter is any more complex than that i would use get_x and set_x


375163
ruby	python

so either opt for oss apache + php perl python ruby etc or choose iis + .net


375272

0	
having been a hobbyist programmer for 3 years mainly python and c and never having written an application longer than 500 line of code i find myself faced with two choices


375371

dynamic-linking .so can be much much faster than static-linking .a


375672

i would pay attention to script loading time more than line of code


376107
unique-index	unique-constraint

i agree with dave that the desired result probalby can and should be achieved using built-in constraints such as unique-indexes or unique-constraints


376127
oracle-service-bus	osb
7	7	
i have limited knowledge of java-based technologies and for business enforced reasons i may need to decide whether weblogic integration wli or oracle-service-bus osb is the better choice for integrating a small number of standalone systems together


376127
integration	business-process
10	10	
both products seem capable of similar tasks though in one case wli the integration is more technically driven where the other osb is more business-process driven


376326
inner-join	join
10	
when doing an inner join it is better to use sql-92 explicit inner-join than cartesian products


376738
default-value	default
5	
because object-type parameters cannot be given a default-value in php i have to do it inside the constructor


376828
types	strong-typing
5	
strong-typing generally means that there are no loopholes in the types system whereas weak typing means the types system can be subverted invalidating any guarantees


377241
java	groovy
4	
what is really nice about it is you can mix and match groovy classes and java classes


377393
listview	radiobuttonlist
5	
since i use a repeater could have been a listview or any other templated databound control i can t use the radiobuttonlist


377519
double	int
7	
i d guess that when calling mymethod 5 5 could be a double or an int as well and double has higher priority


377650
set	any
5	
this approach can be extended to include the ability to set up a new database based on a full dump file and then applying any necessary patches to it to upgrade it as well


378816
value	field
5	
i also want this to be recalculated whenever the value of trigger changes so i select the refresh field on keyword change option on the trigger field

nobody has ever accused git of being easy-to-use no tortoisegit for example although i hear it s coming so you might be better off with svn beanstalk
384367
asp.net	asp.net-mvc
0	


either move to asp.net-mvc if you want more control over the markup or consider not using asp.net server controls this way you can include multiple form tags without having to ensure the controls are within a form tag with the runat server attribute but then you dont get the granular access in the code behind and have to start using the request.form colelction to retrieve the postback values
384485
cruisecontrol	cruisecontrol.net
1	


i have been extremely disappointed by cruisecontrol.net
384580
reflection	runtime

check for any uses of reflection as classes can be loaded and methods can be dynamically invoked at runtime without knowing at compile time which ones they are

it s not very clean and can lead to obscure bugs although my var leads to more in my experience and it sometimes eats a lot of memory but many repeated expensive initialization statements can be avoided this way

lua	python

the c api for python is more complex than that for tcl or lua but isn t infeasible to build by hand
386752
c++	python
5	


as others say - any computation intensive algorithm code that depends on bit-stuffing some memory constrained computation - can be done in raw c++ for cpu memory saving or any other tricks but the whole user interaction logging database handling error handling - all that makes the application actually run can be written in python and it will maintain responsiveness and decent overall performance

a co-worker says there s fewer issues with an ati card at home than with nvidia but i ve been updating my video drivers pretty much monthly for the past few months and it s still not resolved so we can t just release our product and just tell our customers that some day the driver manufacturers may get around to fixing this

asp.net-mvc	webforms

for someone starting on web development coming from the asp.net side i would strongly recommend asp.net-mvc like the guy before me did it is closer to real web development than webforms and it promotes though it doesn t guarantee a more elegant architecture

you don t explain what should happen if more than one result matches any given set of parameters that is reached so you will need to change this to account for those business rules

indexing a field really only works if a your where clause is selective enough that is only selects out about 1-2 of the value
387437
progress-bar	progress

it allows you to update the ui thread with progress notifications so you can update your progress-bar to show realistic values something much more user-friendly than having a marquee style progress-bar

sorteddictionary has faster insertion and removal operations for unsorted data o log n as opposed to o n for sortedlist

if the list is populated all at once from sorted data sortedlist is faster than sorteddictionary
389824
innodb	myisam
7	0	


innodb is actually faster than myisam in quite a few cases so it depends on what your application s mix of selects updates concurrent queries indexes buffer configuration etc
389824
innodb	myisam
2	


innodb wins over myisam frequently enough that it s clearly not possible to say one is faster than the other
390321

now that s not to say that you can t do any of these things with webforms but asp.net-mvc makes it easier
390783
asp.net-mvc	webforms
7	0	


rails s approach is similar although the logic is a bit more explicit and less magic. a view page in an asp.net-mvc app is usually simpler than a webforms page because they don t have to worry as much about routing business logic or data handling
390783
asp.net-mvc	webforms
2	


however it certainly doesn t qualify as an example of good naming or easily understandable code and it is much harder for new developers to pick up than webforms this isn t just opinion i had a summer intern learn webforms last year and asp.net-mvc this year and the differences in productivity were pronounced - in favor of webforms
390783
asp.net-mvc	webforms
0	10	


however if you ll be doing more than crud and or you are reasonably competent with architecture then asp.net-mvc may feel like a straightjacket until you really master the underlying routing model which is considerably more complex than simply routing in a webforms app
390787
updates	updating

then a polling process that is waiting to own access to the field can observe that the timestamp has not updates in some time t which is much greater than the time of the updating loop s sleep interval and assume that the previously-owning process has died

i also read that asp.net-mvc is able to serve up more pages faster than webforms and probably related to this the individual page size is smaller than an average webforms page

so the first time they run this app they won t be able to login because they haven t entered the ad domain name so want i want to do is check the web.config to see if there is an adname value in there if there isn t forward them to the settings page if there is then they should be asked to authentication and then forwarded to the index page

392548
command-line	cmd
5	


in c++ your main function can have argc and argv parameters which contain the arguments passed on the cmd-line
392627
c++	python
7	


it shorter development cycles than compiled languages like c and c++ but is higher performance arguable but i ve always been anti-java p than interpreted languages like python and perl and you don t have to work with unofficial implementations like mono that may from time to time not support all of a language s features

the build-process can very well be managed by maven or any other ant nant tool you want
392753
haskell	lisp

on the other hand programming in haskell is much less interactive than lisp and the tremendous amount of reflection present in languages like lisp just doesn t fit the static view of the world that haskell presupposes
392919
php	ruby
10	8	


additionally my experience in other higher-order dynamically typed languages javascript and ruby yes javascript is a more powerful language than php in terms of language features left me a knowledge with many ways to solve types of problems easily but being restricted in such a way i had no way to use these powerful features
393096
ruby	python
8	


true perl has it quirks but the language comes from an understanding of things that is very close to mine so i m much less comfortable with python and to a lesser degree ruby
393103
generics	reference-type

still the main argument of generics arrays are problematic is still valid in my opinion and collections should be preferred over reference-type arrays

i use a lot of lists and arrays but i have yet to come across a scenario in which the array list couldn t be used just as easily as if not easier than the linked-list
393642
arrays	linked-list

so even if you don t know the number of elements in advance an arrays list may still be faster than a linked-list for adding elements as long as you are adding them at the end
393642
arrays	linked-list

accessing elements in an arrays list is also faster than a linked-list even if the accesses are sequential

ruby has better support for such declarative styles and i am glad the core python language is not going down that route
395960

it may suit your current application however a datamodel that consists of a mapping of roles to privileges is more general and suits most purposes

regarding readability bear in mind that for many languages even one-liners can be broken out into multiple line

if you don t like java s generics at all then you might prefer groovy which is dynamically typed
396491

if you like the idea of generics but find java s implementation of them confusing like i do then you might like scala which handles generics more sensibly
396626
delphi	vb.net

delphi is also much faster than .net you can not notice speed if you develop database applications but if you work on image processing or other intesive algoritams delphi code is faster comparing to c# vb.net
396626
delphi	c++

microsoft c++ is only compatible with previous versions but coding in c++ is horror i know its powerfull but can t be comparad to delphi when time is critical for those who did t use delphi just search google for vcl components and see how big is delphi comunity
396717

adding a scripting language as a component of a larger compiled system is a common pattern the compiled part of the system is optimized for speed of execution but is harder to modify because it must be compiled and reloaded whereas the scripted part of the system is optimized for flexibility it will run slower but can be quickly and easily modified by anyone with a text-editor

notepad++ is based on the editing component scintilla - for which at sourceforge there is a response to a request for this feature no need for this to be included in scite as you can add this command to the tools menu using the parameters dialog. so is it possible to do multi-line replace in files in notepad++

myisam is faster in data warehousing situations such as full table scan reporting etc.. but innodb can actually be faster in many cases with normal oltp queries
405022

i will admit that i ve used python much more than ruby but i wouldn t say that i have any great preference between the two apart from familiarity
405382
perl	ruby
10	


ruby is more flexible in the perl way and you can do a lot of hacks
405382
ruby	python
7	


among the two ruby is syntactically more similar to perl than python
405474
ruby	python
7	


python is a good language and i enjoy working with it too but i think ruby is somewhat more lispy in the degree of freedom it gives to the programmer
405474
ruby	python
10	


python certainly isn t more perlish ruby is essentially a smalltalk perl mashup some of its less-used features are pulled directly from perl whereas python is only distantly related to either
405543
sql-server	oracle
10	


however i believe the relational model provided by sql is infinitely more powerful and useful and products like oracle and sql-server deserve their success in the marketplace
406029
login	logout
4	


i personally prefer login logout but i know lots of software that uses login logoff
406124
tcp-ip	tcp
5	


with tcp-ip we use mss-clamping to protect against large packet issues but this cannot be applied to any udp transmissions or anything secure protocol that uses an authentication header
406230
line	lines
4	


however i d like to know if it s possible to match line that don t contain a specific word hede using a regular expression
406288
getter-setter	getter
10	


i feel like the getter-setter example is more clear and hides the implementation details of what name and description are
406408
contains	any
4	


the regex above will match any string or line without a line break not contains the sub string hede
406426
lisp	prolog
0	


i also checked prolog and it seems a pretty cool language easy to do relations between data and easier than lisp but i d like to hear what you think
406470
asp.net-mvc	webforms
10	


moving from webforms to asp.net-mvc is more difficult
406833
ruby	python
5	


or an easy way to run for example lua python in a sandbox no filesystem access no creation of objects etc and be called from ruby rails 2.2
406852
json	xml
7	0	


dealing with json is much easier than xml from the javascript side.
406907
ruby	python
10	


please avoid discussions of whether ruby or python is better which is just too open-ended to answer.
406971
line	lines
0	


if a web framework is crafted properly a re-usable core should probably not be more than 100 line
407182
line	lines
0	


there are also several 6-pixel wide x11 fonts that are less than 13 pixels high often named clear so you can get more line on the screen
407260
ruby	python
7	0	


rails dominates ruby - there is no single application that dominates python mainly because the python community is somewhat bigger than the ruby community
407395
asp.net	asp.net-mvc
0	


silverlight just by nature is a little less secure than an asp.net-mvc application
407537
gwt	swing
10	


gwt is conceptually similar to swing but is more a replacement for jsps than anything else
408013
private	instances
5	


for instances a mix of public private and protected member variables could be laid out such that each access type is contiguous
408013
base-class	inherited
0	5	


things get worse with virtual inherited where the virtually inherited base-classes can be layed out anywhere in the memory allocated for that particular instance
408116
haskell	python
3	


i prefer using this approach instead of using python perl haskell java etc
408146
ruby-on-rails	django
10	


a lot of people would probably agree that the django ruby-on-rails cakephp approach is better than the older approaches but as the older language python has a lot more legacy frameworks that are still trying to evolve and stay relevant
408257
try-catch	exception-handling
7	


i believe the use of try-catch exception-handling handling is worse than the use of simple return codes and associated common messaging structures to ferry useful error messages
408532
logging	configuration
5	


so my thoughts are that big dividends will be seen during maintenance when you re needing to change the way you re handling logging exceptions by having the flexibility to change configuration easily and still have the same one line of source code
408588
ruby-on-rails	django
10	


while most of the structure and flow of asp.net mvc is more or less identical to django and ruby-on-rails the one part i m not sure about is the apps methodology django employs to make code reuse easier
408820
swing	awt
10	10	


are there any cases where awt is more useful advised to use than swing or vice-versa
408853
vim	gedit
4	


normal people prefer gedit instead of vim
408937
.net	wcf
1	


the code has #if blocks based on different symbols to control logic - so for example binaryformatter isn t available on cf wcf is only available with .net 3.0 delegate.createdelegate isn t on cf 2.0 etc
408973
line	lines
1	


if you want to rewrite several line there is nothing so portable as ncurses there is libs for it on practically every operating system and you don t have to take care of the ansi-differences
408981
pyglet	pyopengl
10	8	


i d say that pyglet is actually more evolved than pyopengl
409082
editor	text-editor
5	


the solution explorer can t be configured like the text-editor
409201
line	lines
7	


changing a one page document is easier than changing 5000 line of code
409563
boolean	int
7	


returning boolean or an int is more of a c mindset than a java in java you would just handle the exception one
409688
atomicity	atomic
4	


int s are atomicity good but ints aren t necessarily ordered which could destroy any lock-free algorithm including my above scenario
409750
processor	processors
8	


we have run into the problem albeit on itanium processor where the instruction reordering is more aggressive than x86 x64
410045
haskell	python
5	


can be seen in haskell and python for example
410176
photoshop	fireworks
7	


i find fireworks has an easier time dealing with vectors because they re first class objects while in photoshop they re actually a combination of a vector mask and a colour fill
410254
asp.net-mvc	webforms
4	


assuming you prefer asp.net-mvc to webforms it s worth it for a system that s in active development maintenance
410394
asp.net-mvc	webforms
10	


imo asp.net-mvc is better for web sites while webforms are better for web applications
410399
min	max
1	


the reason i ask is because every e-mail that i get with a link attached i keep getting platform version 1.9.0.4 not compatible with min version 1.9.0.5 max version 1.9.0.5
410465
profiler	perf
7	


a profiler gives you more detailed information which can help to diagnose and fix perf problems
410778
value	field
5	


note because a readonly field can be initialized either at the declaration or in the constructor of a class readonly field can have different value depending on the constructor used
410797
controllers	controller
7	


other than the fact the controllers has more power than the logic layer
410837
controllers	controller
10	


i would not say that the controllers is more powerful than the logic layer
410901
ruby-on-rails	django
4	2	


in the overall i prefer django over ruby-on-rails because of the django apps
410966
csv	xml
5	


when an object has various formats xml csv it can be represented in where should one store knowledge of those formats
411065
asp.net	asp.net-mvc
5	


however all of my new asp.net projects will or should be developed using asp.net-mvc as it is a much better and more flexible framework
411161
c++	python
3	


i would go so far as to recommend learning python pygame and start building games with that tool rather than c++ which complicates the design and implementation process
411250
32-bit	64bit
0	


when it comes to floating-point types in the iphone processor arm11 with vfp hardware floating point 32-bit floats are somewhat faster than 64bit doubles
411351
haskell	ocaml
1	


f# is first class .net language and it s the first functional language that comes with really big foundation not that i say that lisp haskell erlang scala ocaml do not have lots of libraries they are just not as complete as .net is
411478
throw	throws
0	


furthermore if the file is greater than a few kb the reader throw an exception stating the stringbuilder capacity argument must be greater than zero presummably because the size is greater than int32.maxvalue
411523
set	any
7	


edit having one set of property files per dialog etc makes it easier to see where any particular string is coming from but it makes it harder to reuse the same messages etc
411544
linux	unix
5	


how can that be done in linux unix systems
411774
put	get
5	


people don t do that necessarily to be able to put the product in a box at any day sure there may be routines that have to be done before release but the idea is that any developer can get the latest code in the server and it will build in their machines
411962
getter	setter
5	


is your only problem that your view components feel cluttered by getter setter and constsructors with many parameters
411980
swing	javafx
7	


instead javafx script makes swing easier to use
411994
postgresql	mysql
4	


with that said if you are worried about sql server licensing costs i d recommend postgresql first or mysqlsecond as your database of choice
411996
postgresql	mysql
1	


mysql5.x has a feature set that supports a reasonable cross section of capabilities but it is not as feature-rich as postgresql
412278
virtual-machine	vmware
10	


i ve run websphere for zseries on a vmware virtual-machine with no problem and websphere is more resource intensive then any php stack
412314
ruby	python
0	


it occurs to me that this is a common issue with all dynamically compiled interpreted languages since the runtime will have a lifetime longer than any particular application that the runtime runs ruby or python and applications will share the same library load state
412704
category	categories
4	


under category select swing gui forms and under file types select japplet form
412884
serialization	deserialization
0	


it comes with xml serialization deserialization of graphs for wcf and also its own binary serialization for remoting much faster than the default binary formatter and also much more compact
413237
eager-loading	eager
10	


the actual model is much more complicated then the example and the classes have many references between them using eager-loading or adding joins to the queries is out of the question for performance reasons
413752
ant	maven
0	


i d definitely use ant or maven - my preference is ant because it s more flexible and i think it would suit your development style more than maven as well
413752
code-coverage	cobertura
3	


i would recommend using junit in conjunction with a code-coverage tool such as cobertura which is easy to set up - it will help you to understand how much code your tests are covering and is an indicator about how effective your tests are
413775
short-circuiting	condition
0	


if you have more than one condition though then the short-circuiting rule apply
414151
mouse	keyboard
0	


it would be extremely natural to use and much more lightweight than having to deal with a keyboard and mouse
414323
.net	wcf
5	


wcf is a communication stack that allows services to be exposed over http like asmx and tcp like remoting as well as named pipes which is really an intra-machine cross process call msmq and with .net 3.5 rest
414404
ssms	redgate
5	


i know redgate has such a product but i d rather not have to pay for something which in my opinion should be built into ssms
414606
asp.net-mvc	webforms
1	


asp.net ajax however is based on asp.net webforms and as such it is not compatible with asp.net-mvc
414763
subtraction	modulo
0	


as you can see modulo is about an order of magnitude slower than subtraction
414945
category	categories
5	


it s a typical scenario of a hierarchy table of category that can themselves be divided into category that db experts tell me is called the adjacency model
415319
finalize	finalizer
5	


dispose method can be executed in finalize but it is safer to call it yourself
415532
typechecking	static-typing
4	


i generally prefer static-typing due to compile typechecking better documented code etc
415536
base-class	inherited
7	


multiple inherited is much harder - in that case in order to case between base-classes other than the first you need to manually adjust your pointers based on the proper offsets which is really tricky and error-prone
415639
nunit	mbunit
1	


mbunit is totally compatible with nunit so you could still use tests you ve already written with nunit
415687
default-value	default
5	


was there any reason why the designers of java felt that local variables should not be given a default-value
415687
local-variables	instance-variables
5	


seriously if instance-variables can be given a default value then why can t we do the same for local-variables
415846
spring	seam
10	10	


i myself like seam but for lightweight remoting spring has more viable solutions and support
415924
boolean	int
5	


it seems that the types int boolean and string will be good for just about everything i ll ever need in terms of variables except perhaps float could be used when decimal numbers are needed in a number
416317
line	lines
7	


i think a name like trustedsourceint32parse or guaranteedint32parse or something along those line is a better name
416570
listener	listeners
5	


all of these can be done with listeners but in coherence for example listeners have to be cheap which leads to things like a map having a listener than writes something to another map and this can chain on for awhile
416601
asp.net	asp.net-mvc
5	


this is also can be used in asp.net-mvc s outputcachedpage
416670
olap-cube	data-warehouse
7	


olap-cubes usually originate from a data-warehouse which is nothing more than another database - but typical warehouses contain data that came from more than one and often dozens of other application databases
416696
asp.net	.net
5	


is it possible to build components in c# using .net which can be reused in asp.net
416782
category	categories
5	


so what actually happens is three category essential and expected to remain essential if this is not done on time we will be forced to release late treated as essential for now but we may change our minds as the release date approaches and treated as not for this release for now but we will pull it forward if time permits
416915
line	lines
4	


that will make it a lot faster no converting to unicode string no splitting the strings in line no splitting the line in substrings no parsing the substrings but you re going to lose maintainability
416947
swing	awt
0	


i mean by light weight i thought maybe the swing components occupy less memory than the awt components
417342
subtract	multiplying
8	


adding and subtract logarithms of factorials then taking the exponential at the end is more reliable than multiplying and dividing factorials directly
417361
asp.net	asp.net-mvc
4	


if you just want to get started i would recommend asp.net-mvc because it has more people and resources behind it and go for fubu if you don t like what you see
417492
linq	linq-to-sql
0	


in view of recent news from microsoft i believe it is a better choice than linq-to-sql
417607
atomicity	atomic
0	0	


due to the need to keep an atomicity counter they re a bit slower than auto pointers
417926
c++	python
10	5	5	


culture around c++ is more varied than relatively newer languages used on web such as python ruby newer versions of php notable exception is perl which is about doing things differently thanks to its general scope and age there is not an obvious it should be done like this way which a newbie can pick up quickly and get started
418196
updates	updating
4	


i would recommend dynamic view for those initialization phases where you need to import a lot of data you can quickly see what your view looks like without making anyupdates like without updating your workspace
419011
binary-tree	tree
10	


if you check out the great language shootout you ll find that for some benchmarks like binary-tree the ocaml version is faster than c
419204
build-process	continuous-integration
5	


continuous-integration says that this build-process should be repeated every time there is a significant change event to the code like a check in if at all possible
419292
if-statement	loops
0	


in day to day programming you probably won t use more than algebra and logic for if-statements and loops conditions
419600
lossless-compression	lossless
10	


it also uses a lossless-compression that is more effective when large areas have a single color and ineffective for detailed images or dithered images
419617
png	gif
5	


web browsers at the moment only display jpeg png and gif files - so those are the ones that can be shown on web pages
419696
drupal	django
4	


for example it doesn t make much sense to compare django to something like drupal because django is something you use to create things like drupal
419890
environment	configuration
7	


then you only have to maintain the one configuration file and a file of environment settings - i think this makes maintenance easier and clearer in the long-term
419933
height	background-color
10	


for example if the picturebox is more widescreen in relation to the image see screenshot it means the picturebox will stretch the image to its ownheight and center it horizontally showing its background-color in this case red to the left and right of the image
420471
inner-join	join
10	


even if an inner-join is faster you wouldn t use it if you needed the results of a left join which includes even the records which don t match the second table in the join
420744
default-value	default
5	


default-value or be left out altogether
421119
category	categories
5	


so is there a clean and simple way to solve this problem in c# akin to how it could be solved with objective-c category
421448
set	contains
8	


the result set is always a single row which has the datetime value equal to user max_date that is it returns the row thatcontains max date if no more rows have been added with more recent dates than max date
421566
max	minimum
0	


the plugin dll itself also does not expose anything more than the minimum interface required by max for adding a few top level scripted classes
422046
line	lines
0	


i always make very short methods never more than 6 line of smalltalk code automatically formatted so i really don t have any trouble saying what this method is about
422196
silverlight	wpf
5	


if you go with wpf silverlight then there s a slightly different paradigm to pickup called mvc model-view-controller which is starting to become the next big craze
422313
asp.net	asp.net-mvc
7	


at this point asp.net-mvc is more mature and has had more testers and eyeballs looking at it
422672
command-line	cmd
7	


you will find that sympy is much easier to explore since you can use it interactively from the python cmd-line
423031
controllers	controller
5	


so don t create a massive controllers file where only a small portion of the code will be executed per request
423223
stax	sax
0	


if you want more dynamic handling stax approach would probably work better than sax
423462
linq	linq-to-sql
5	


sql server compact edition can be used with linq-to-sql or entity framework
423910
integer	short
7	


so in short it does much more than convert a string to an integer applying specific rounding rules to fractions short circuting unecessary conversions etc
424385
lookup	any
5	


that saves running all the way around the houses creating custom attributes and attaching them to your enums or using lookup tables to marry an enum value with a friendly string and best of all it s self managing and can be used on any pascal case string which is infinitely more reusable
424422
build-server	msbuild
5	5	


i want to use msbuild for my build-server since everything is already set up that way thanks to vs but i m also looking for tips on how files should be laid out how projects should be laid out in a solution etc
424517
set	contains
7	


should my test fixture contains tests for every possible validation error that can occur in the validate methods or is it better to leave that for a separate set of tests
424781
controllers	controller
5	5	


i have got round this by having an enum viewtemplate associated with the category and then return the view with the same name but this doesn t feel right firstly because i m not sure i should be logic like this in the controllers action and also i am still making the same database calls which is fine for some stuff but if a category has 500 products i am still pulling them out the database even for the category2 when they won t be used
425058
png	tiff
4	


tiff can beat png by about 2 1 43k vs
425329
asp.net	webforms
1	


i haven t seen a single platform for web development as easy as asp.net webforms and this is only because of great webcontrol support which requires viewstate
425329
asp.net	webforms
10	


but i think asp.net webforms will remain a great technology where it s more applicable
425329
asp.net-mvc	webforms
7	0	


specifically about data access asp.net-mvc usually requires more code than webforms counterparts
425329
asp.net	webforms
7	7	


for presenting tabular data i.e where gridview is applicable i think asp.net webforms is the easier way to accomplish things
425467
settimeout	setinterval
5	


like settimeout setinterval returns an integer which can be passed to clearinterval to cancel the processing
425682
set	contains
7	


to do that the css property overflow can be set to scroll and it will scroll if the contains elements size is larger than that of itself
426260
set	any
5	


if you set ld_preload to the path of a shared object that file will be loaded before any other library including the c runtime libc.so
426271
order	add
4	


in order to do this you will have to click on the down-arrow on the right side of the add button and choose add as link
426723
sql-server	mysql
7	


i m guessing that sql-server has a better optimizer and they might be close to equivalent there but in mysqli expect a significant performance advantage to distinct
426740
set	any
4	


but for a large data set the number of indexes required to match any possible combination of queries would make the index grow exponentially
426764
pointers	stack
5	


if you don t create the foo object on the heap and the internal array of foo isn t a pointers to which you allocate memory with new in foo s constructor then that internal array will be created on stack
427040
syntax	syntax-error
5	


clearly there is plenty of scope for ambiguities in such a language but if it is statically typed with type inference then most ambiguities could be eliminated and those that remain could be considered a syntax-error to be corrected by adding brackets where appropriate
427209
malloc	alloca
2	


the alloca routine like malloc but uses the stack automatically frees itself and also blows up with sigsegv if it s too big
427503
copy-paste	paste
5	


in other words it paste pure text from the clipboard without any of the markup that might have been copy-paste onto the clipboard with the text
427518
set	any
0	


for housekeeping purposes you should include an expiry datetime field which is set for much longer than any realistic logon period a week for example
427830
malloc	free
5	


you should make sure that memory acquired by malloc should be freed with free so delete your instances like this
429085
hide	show
5	5	


the beforesend handler can be used to show a hidden div containing your loading text or image while complete handler will be used to hide it no matter whether the call succeeds or not
429163
line	lines
7	


it s a little more verbose than the linq example and some of my line could have been combined but to my eye this is easier to parse
429366
packaging	building
0	


also the tools can actually be used standalone to perform the various functions scripting building comparing upgrading and packaging if you want it s just that using them all together provides a full end-to-end process thus making the overall value greater than the sum of it s parts
429394
core-animation	catransform3d
5	


the uiview folding can be approximated using core-animation perhaps by adding perspective to the catransform3d of the uiview s underlying layer to distort the uiview into a trapezoid which gets sucked into the trash can
429774
api	web-services
1	


if you are relatively inexperienced with rest you haven t built a full scale web api yet i would recommend that you buy or better get your boss to restful web-services by richardson ruby
429808
32-bit	64bit
2	


also note that modern cpus use the same fp unit for both single 32-bit and double 64bit fp numbers so unless you are trying to save memory storing a lot of floats there s really no reason to favor float over double
429838
getter-setter	getter
5	


i could ve used the getter-setter method approach but i don t use them anywhere else in my code so this would be out-of-style
429896
key	key-value
5	


items of secondary importance can be added as key-value pairs
430233
ruby-on-rails	grails
2	


gruby-on-rails still feels so rough around the edges that it s almost a joke to compare it with ruby-on-rails
430324
ruby	python
5	


a little more context i m writing an email to the professor asking if the course can be switched to ruby or python from perl
430690
editor	text-editor
5	


it can be written in any text-editor
430828
json	xml
3	


i would recommend trying out rabbitmq amqp and using protocol buffers xml or some other data format such as json to taste
430858
rubygems	gem
5	


updating gem can cause you to run out of memory but this can be solved by downloading and compiling rubygem from source
430883
testng	junit
10	8	


testng is more flexible than junit and have multiple advantages like support for parallel testing for example
430898
throw	throws
1	


but the project uses a ajaxcontrolkit which i guess is not available by default in asp.net 2.0 and hence it throw an error that a reference library is missing on conversion and compiling it in 2008
431296
asp.net	asp.net-mvc
5	


i realise that my problems could be solved by either relaxing my constraints using post and not caring about the surplus parameter or by using asp.net-mvc but are my requirements really unreasonable
431302
32-bit	64bit
7	7	0	


by promoting the nsinteger to the long long type and using the lld specifier you make sure that you won t have truncation issues in the future if you compile for 64bit and your nsinteger value requires more than 32-bit to store
431594
compression	streaming
5	


on a modern system can local hard disk write speeds be improved by compression the output streaming
432079
malloc	free
0	


believe it or not it can be faster than using malloc and free
432089
model	datamodel
4	


the documentation describes this in more detail but the short answer is that you can select your attributes in the datamodel designer and choose copy obj-c 2.0 method declarations from the design menu
432128

python pygame seems much more advanced than sdl bindings to any other language and one huge advantage compared to c++ is that don t have to compile code and with some simple hacking can even modify a running program and see the feedback live

you always need to know the magic number here 0xaaaaaaab and the correct operations after the multiplication shifts and or additions in most cases and both is different depending on the number you want to divide by and both take too much cpu time to calculate them on the fly that would be slower than hardware division

in-place	radix-sort

i ve never seen an in-place radix-sort and from the nature of the radix-sort i doubt that it is much faster than a out of place sort as long as the temporary array fits into memory

firefox is just better for web development and i prefer safari overall
464251
silverlight	wpf
7	10	10	


my personal expierence is that silverlight is easier to work with wcf than xbaps as the security model is better defined than the sillyness of running xbaps why not just use click once + wpf and you get the exact same as xbaps without headaches - i ll get off my soap box now

it was developed with only various versions of windows in mind and from my experience there s always some sort of problem running any linux distro under it. i would recommend vmware as suggested above or alternatively virtualbox which has worked very well for me in the past it runs certain linux distros best though i can t remember which ones

470595
popup	button
5	


if you re looking for the behavior where when the user clicks attach file and the file browsing dialog automatically popup that can be done via javascript but doesn t work in firefox which has the security precaution of requiring the user to invoke the browse button directly rather than programmatically through script

quicksort has worst case time-complexity of o n 2 but it is usually considered better than other sorting algorithms which have o n log n time-complexity in the worst case
471632
processor	processors
7	


however in the context of current and future computing platforms an algorithm which can make use of a few think multicore few hundred think gpu or few thousand think supercomputer processing elements will beat the pants of the sequential version in wall-clock time even if the total time energy spent by all processor is much greater for the parallel version
471637
cruisecontrol	cruisecontrol.net
5	


you should be able to create a simple batch file to run qtp which can then be invoked via nant and or cruisecontrol.net
471660

472379
pthreads	fcntl

move the checking for site and also the assignment to owner to before_filters if this is done more than once inside the controllers
473965
request	http-request
5	


but it might have worked except that afaik virtualhost can only be identified by the host header in the http-request - so only works for the real request
474140
time-complexity	radix-sort
10	


radix-sort has time-complexity o n for fixed-length inputs but quicksort is more often used despite the worse asympotic runtime because the per-element overhead on radix-sort is typically much higher
474231
set	any

i would recommend svn over cvs although distributed version tracking tools like git and mercurial seem to be very popular among open source projects

this question is very similar to when to prefer json over xml
478944
union	union-all

they ask for api key because you could have more than one api under same account - in case you have more than one site which are use same api
481776

this is because you re more constrained by the dbms than you are with your own code - building a compromised datamodel is more likley to cause you pain
481939
model	datamodel

i strongly prefer git with its elegant and powerful datamodel but mercurial offers functionality similar to git and it is written in python so it might be easier for you
481988
iteration	enumerator
10	


in addition iteration via foreach on an list rather than ilist is faster due to the arraylist s enumerator requiring a heap allocation

admittedly this is easier to throw together in xml because it s free-form text and there s no real validation unless you write an xsd schema but in those cases you re doing the same kind of work as defining types and relations in code classes
488055

cutting lines at boundaries of tiles so you can render individual tiles results in less than perfect results - often what is done is lines are rendered beyond the tile boundary or at least the data of the line end is kept though rendering stops once it finds it s fallen off the edge - this reduces error that occurs with lines looking like they don t quite match as they travel across tiles

since that particular constructor is only supposed to be called when loading a particular object after selecting it from the results of a search procedure not finding it is either a bug or a race condition which would mean another user deleted the object by key

today this approach is far harder as the compilers are far better and it is so much harder for humans to improve the compilers code - since processor got so complicated and fast code has become about keeping the caches and pipelines full

asp.net	webforms
4	


we decided to choose php instead of asp.net in part because we didn t want to get stucked in a unflexible paradigm webforms everything-automatic-but-not-so-flexible but i believe a php framework could put us in the same situation

perl	python
5	


if you insist on doing this yourself this can be done in either perl or python - use the one you know best
492772
perl	python
1	


both can do it but python requires an oop approach and it just isn t as easy as perl s inline regex syntax
492859
perl	awk

strings in .net cannot be coerced into any other type in the way perl awk and many other dynamic languages allow they can only be treated as string or as their parent class object

similarly pointer operations can be made atomicity on most platforms so they can often be your savior in multithreaded code

wcf tries really hard not to be coupled to .net

how every it would have been nice to just make a simple control adaptor that would just step in at the right place and just tell the control not to render the default styling

but cakephp is really an exercise in futility its authors wrote it so they wouldn t have to learn ruby even though learning ruby and ruby-on-rails together is probably easier than figuring out the monstrous mess that is cakephp
494503
cakephp	ruby-on-rails
1	


since y all asked my biggest complaint about cakephp is how it manages to totally butcher the conveniences of object-oriented programming sure it implements the active record pattern just as much as ruby-on-rails does but it makes you pass around data structures
494503
cakephp	ruby-on-rails

people say ruby is slow but my own ruby-on-rails apps run faster than their cakephp equivalents last i checked

even thought the canonical use-case for the dto is more serialization object that can be passed over the wire in this case you are really referring more to presentation-transfer-objects or view-models

when writing code in jscript as i am wont to do as i have never been a fan of asp.net and jscript is infinitely more elegant than vbscript you can call upon the arguments collection

i like your naming-conventions and i agree entirely with using content such as your example in property getters if you re delivering an api to be used with binding

however dockpaneleftof does not seem to work in this case so you lose docking toolbar next to each other

one of the more subtle differences between the two is that the as keyword can not be used for casting when a cast operators is involved

so if you are using these to compare base-class and derived-class which inherits from base-class then

497819
quicksort	mergesort
0	


previously discussed on so why is quicksortbetter than mergesort
497849
in-place	mergesort
7	


another reason is that mergesort needs more memory because it s hard to implement it as an in-place sort
497916
arrays	linked-list
5	


fifos can be built using doubly-linked-list an array vector with a begin and end pointer with circular arrays etc etc.
497933
quicksort	in-place
5	


on arrays quicksortcan be done in-place meaning that you re reading from and writing to the same area of memory
497967
sorted	contains
7	0	


the biggest difference that can be produced between the two of them will always be to quicksort s detriment and it involves lists that are already largely sorted or contains a large number of ties when quicksort does better than mergesort the difference will not be nearly so great

socontains is likely a wee bit slower than calling indexof directly but i doubt that it will have any significance for the actual performance

in a more complex case it may still make sense to sort by one of the halves of the pair if the pattern is such that locality for those values is more important if for example these are key-value pairs and you are doing a lot of searches locality for the key is infinitely more important than for the values

the following type designates an unsigned int type with the property that any valid pointer to void can be converted to this type then converted back to pointer to void and the result will compare equal to the original pointer
502963
32-bit	64bit
1	


usually sizeof void depends on memory bus width although not necessarily - pre-risc as 400 had 48-bit address bus but 64bit pointers and int usually is as big as cpu s general-purpose register there are also exceptions - sgi c used 32-bit ints on 64bit mips

just this feature alone would be enough for me to prefer calloc to malloc

it has to be either fully manageable with text-editor or already have rock solid tools for editing and managing on these platforms

you might also consider partitioning your table according to the id field especially if older records with lower id value become less relevant over time

xmlhttp-request must be initiated by external service

all in all t4 to me is more of a inside vs code-generation tool to quickly create c# or other files while xslt is more of a data-processing data-transformation tool to turn data from xml into another format typically html or pdf using xsl-fo

edit to answer the comment that volatile guarantees the atomicity of the read write operation that s well true in a way because the volatile keyword cannot be applied to fields that are larger than 32-bit in effect making the field single-cpu-instruction read writeable on both 32 and 64bit cpu s

zsh	bash
8	1	


it s much less comprehensive than cygwin but is mature and stable and has a good cross-section of the basic unix commands sed etc. it will play nicely with windows command files you can do piping and redirection and there is a port of zsh with it so it will also run shell scripts although zsh is not totally compatible with bash

maven may be the choice for you as it is java centric and more high level than ant

putting commas at the beginning of the new line makes it easier to build dynamic queries

pexpect	subprocess
5	


if you re familiar with how a href rel nofollow noreferrer expect a allows passthrough to interactive subprocess with specific key sequences from the user or strings received from the child process triggering matches and sending control back to your program the same thing can be done from python with a href rel nofollow noreferrer pexpect a

you can see what libraries need to be compiled by boost jam and what libraries don t by looking at this page - if a library does not need a lib file and therefore does not require you to mess with boost jam first it will say build link header-only whereas if a library does require you to precompile a lib file it will say build link automatic linking

which of those is preferred depends in large part on whether you are dealing with chemistry in which case the symbol is the hands-down winner or sub- nuclear physics in which case the atomicity number is probably more important

even though a standard conversion sequence converting from int float double to long double is better than a user-defined conversion sequence converting from myclass to long double your operator version is not chosen because your other parameter long double requires a conversion from the argument which is worse than what the builtin operator needs for that argument perfect match

8bit	16-bit
0	


actually i think some 8bit controllers will have a longer lifetime than their 16-bit counterparts

pros and cons ruby is a little cleaner language-wise than python
551666
required	checked
7	0	0	


this works for finding the distance from each endpoint to the other line segment constraining the calculated parameter u to be no less than 0 for a line segment or ray and to be no more than 1 for a line segment but it doesn t handle the possiblity that an interior point on one line segment is closer than either endpoint because they actually intersect thus the extra checked about intersection is required
552144
constructor	copy-constructor
5	


maybe i want my super large struct to be passed by value so that i can do something in the copy-constructor
552861
sql-server	mysql
5	


if you already have a solid understand of the sql-server database engine then i would look to develop this level of understanding with mysqlstarting off by looking at the different database drivers that can be used to drive the mysqlengine such as inodb and myisam etc
552873
private-members	private
1	


this is purely a coding standards question but for what it s worth i always explicitly mark private-members as private
553086
caching	browser-cache
5	


if you put styles in external css file and set a caching expiry of say 1 month then during this time all users will have very low start delays because only the content that has changed will be downloaded the styles will be reused from your browser caching
553405
asp.net	asp.net-mvc
5	


this way your filter will not even be tied to asp.net-mvc and your attribute is merely a piece of metadata - the way it is actually supposed to be
553928
nurbs	3dsmax
1	


i d like to slice the nurbs surface with a slicing-plane thats on-axis not as advanced as 3dsmax
554534
inner-join	join
7	0	


outer join usually perform slower than inner-join
554538
while-loop	loops
0	


you can use a while-loops which will likely be faster than a logarithm because this uses integer arithmetic only
554629
silverlight	wpf
8	


i m more familiar with silverlight than the full wpf
554640
sequence	numbers
0	


as long as the prime is greater than the numbers of values in the list then you create a sequence which runs through all of the numberss 0...n where n is the numbers of values - 1 but in a pseudorandom order
554762
line	lines
0	


i would first try to make sure that all the methods are relatively small not more than 50 line
554949
backwards-compatibility	compatibility
1	


it looks like this is another case of backwards-compatibility wisely nobody wanted to risk breaking something as fundamental as let
555111
condition	break
4	


i think this isn t quite what you are after however i m guessing you want to find the line of code which makes st7 inf for this you will need to place such break points on every line with a condition st7 inf it will then be easier to pick out where the change is being made
555141
constructor	copy-constructor
10	


either will work though the copy-constructor is technically more efficient though the copy assignment operator is often optimized to do the same thing
555568
svn	fossil
5	5	


fossil may be used like svn or a dvcs
556030
progress-bar	progress
0	


wxcocoadialog is a multi-platform port of the cocoadialog application for os x that allows the use of common gui controls such as file selectors text input progress-bars yes no confirmations and more with a command-line application
556092
iterator	unordered
10	


unordered map tr1 is similar to map except it supports better iterator
556295
export	report
5	


this bug report seens to suggest that my issue can be resolved by export to a file writen in binary mode
556367
affinity	cpu
5	


gets the opportunity to be cached near affinity cpu
556491
arguments	return-value
10	


xml as arguments and return-values have uses in a few specific cases with structured data but in general a flat tds stream grids is far more efficient
556549
reflection	runtime
7	


you can do the latter without bytecode weaving look at dynamic proxies for arbitrary runtime implementations of an interface and if you re doing the former i don t see how having a class and mechanically calling the getfoo method through reflection is better than just calling resultset.getstring foo - it will be slower more clunky and less type-safe
557446
linux	unix
5	


there are already .net ports to unix linux and there is no reason that ms access can t be emulated there either
557524
cakephp	django
1	


3 i m not familiar with cakephp but adding a process_request middleware is definitely a good django way of preprocessing each request
557675
cell	cells
10	


the actual number of cell updated in model update is significantly less though - perhaps only a few hundred
557728
var	this
4	


this causes the page which relies upon the session var to select either asp session id at random from the two that have been created - one with the session var set and one without
557979
webserver	web-services
5	


we have a web service that we will be hosting on a public web server and it will be contacted by web-services hosted on webserver within the walls of a hospital
558269
constructor	object
5	


the object you pass to the constructor or set can be implemented with factory
558777
key	key-value
1	


edit return array of key not new array with key-value
558869
linq	linq-to-sql
4	


i would also recommend this for any other varchar 1 fields you are representing in linq-to-sql if the field is nullable as you cannot have a null char
558943
line	lines
7	


as i request less rows the line blur more
558957
expression	evaluation
0	


i don t know what the overhead is for a try catch but i suspect it s far greater than evaluation a boolean expression
559183
reflection	runtime
8	


for all other controls just use normal code expressions inside a data-binding expression - it s much faster and more intuitive than eval which relies on runtime reflection
559225
svn	cvsnt
7	


just a wild guess here but if you re using cvsnt on the server this observation might be based on the fact that cvsnt simply is much better at merging than svn because it has the notion of mergepoints
559285
command-line	cmd
5	


it understands the c and c++ syntaxes among others and can be searched for variables and functions using cmd-line tools emacs and vi among others
559555
build-process	msbuild
4	


on the other hand i would choose msbuild as while the tasks are very procedural it gives you the flexibility to extend this build-process later on to handle more complex tasks
559718
trace	debugging
5	


the conditionalattribute that is applied to the trace and debugging class methods causes all calls to the methods to be removed if trace or debugging are #undef d including the expensive parameter evaluation
559722
aspect	aspects
0	


aspects oriented programming is so much more than just logging reporting et cetera as you will see if you have a look at postsharp s web site
559937
bugzilla	trac
0	


i would suggest something more modern than bugzilla such as trac or lighthouse although bugzilla may fit your bill
560176
generics	primitive-types
0	


it helps that .net generics cope with primitive-types better than java does.
560242
backwards-compatibility	compatibility
1	


php5 is pretty good with backwards-compatibility and you should not run php4 on any publicly facing webserver if security is even a little bit important to you
560738
binary-tree	tree
0	


i don t literally think that you should have heard of them but i do believe they re an interesting example of what kind of complexity you can achieve with bit tricks --- namely o log log n exponentially better than binary-tree
561079
malloc	realloc
5	5	


memory allocation every pointer new ed should be deleted malloc free should not be mixed with new delete when to use delete instead of delete why the c functions are still useful expand realloc
561197
authorization	authentication
8	


the redirect they will see is quite similar to experiences that they are more familiar with like credit card or paypal authentication so should be easy to explain in these terms
561213
php	python
10	


php is more specialized you hardly do anything else than web apps with it so if you wish to expand your knowledge with more practical languages i would suggest python and for web apps boosted with django
561213
java	python
5	


python is quite general purpose and useful language to anyone s toolbox - and if needed it can be combined with java using jython
561241
spring	grails
1	4	


since you re already familiar with java and probably spring i would recommend grails
561537
listener	event-listener
10	


use calllater or an flexevent.creation_complete event-listener -- this is less reliable but it is definitely not a hack
561754
.war	war
1	


i m working with netbeans and i m not very good with ant and my deadlines don t give me time to figure it out so i made a little shell script that cp s all my files into the exploded.war directories
561773
entity	repository
4	


i recommend entity framework for your dal repository
561951
editor	text-editor
7	


i also think yaml is easier to read and work with in a text-editor but that is really kind of subjective and it wouldn t really matter if this is not a normal usage scenario
562304
lisp	common-lisp
0	


also for learning common-lisp you d better start with practical common-lisp as an excellent and free book
562537
tree	nodes
7	


heaps a tree where the parent of a nodes always maintains some relation to the children of the nodes for instance the parent of a nodes is always greater than each of it s children max-heap
562559
submission	submit
10	


however on submission the form i get a error 500 no getter method for property. when i add the following to my form object i no longer get that error
562671
32-bit	64bit
5	


apparently oracle installers for 32bit and 64bit don t recognize each other so if you first install 32bit version and then install 64bit version the 64 bit version will be installed by default to the same directory as 32-bit version
562699
java	groovy
0	0	


the team went with groovy because it was somewhat more familiar-seeming than jruby but offered more flexibility than java
562703
subclass	subclassing
5	


i would have designed this differently making public bool persistchanges call a virtual method that is overridden in each subclassing
562729
substring	ends-with
4	


this matches any correctly parenthesisedsubstringing as long as it begins and ends-with parentheses
562905
assembly	inline-assembly
5	


this is why most video games continue to be written in c++ and inline-assembly
562990
stl	boost
0	0	


.net library support is way better and cleaner than stl mfc and boost
563016
duplicates	elements
5	


in a merge or heap sort indeed when the sort is completed you will have compared every duplicates pair unless both elements were already in their final positions which is unlikely
563094
asp.net	asp.net-mvc
5	


but luckily many javascript libraries came out with new cool controls to be plugged into asp.net-mvc
563097
notepad	notepad++
4	


for windows i would recommend notepad++ or programmers notepad
563282
category	categories
7	


you might be able to convince your supervisor that what you really need is one wiki using multiple category as it sounds like that is more what he actually wants
563309
linq	linq-to-sql
5	


the backend written is using linq-to-sql but can be adapted with linq to nhibernate
563363
for-loop	loops
5	


this is also reflected in the language the range-based for-loops in c++0x next c++ version released very soon will be based on free function calls
563453
openlayers	google-maps
4	


i admit i ve not really given this problem much attention except to compare openlayers to google-maps after i had already chosen google
563472
common-lisp	scheme
2	


you don t just have to pick between common-lisp and scheme
563472
common-lisp	scheme
0	


it s popular it s actively developed it has many libraries offering the features of a modern programming environment and scheme is somewhat simpler not to say better just simpler than common-lisp
563489
controllers	controller
7	


since it s an update to the model it s easier to go through the model s controllers
563490
oprofile	gprof
0	


i use oprofile to try to find hot spots in optimized code i find that it often works a little better than gprof and it can do things like look for data and instruction cache misses
563490
oprofile	perf
10	


update i ve found that perf works way better than oprofile
563847
clearfix	sticky
5	


it should be noted that clearfix can get a little sticky with ie.
564210
tree	nodes
7	


to maintain the tree as a heap you need to ensure that each nodes is smaller than or equal to its children
564256
sql-server	mysql
4	


would really prefer sql-server as the backend - or a webservice interface if it has to be mysql
564392
arrays	loops
5	


in particular can this be done without having to create a new arrays and loops through the contents
564408
ref	out
4	


but returning an array ref can be handy if you re going to pick out individual elements
564418
arrays	loops
5	


in particular can this be done without having to create a new arrays and loops through the contents
564448
revision	rcs
5	0	


using git for your own locale revision control for the same kind of things you would have used rcs is i would argue easier than using rcs
564453
declarative	declarative-programming
5	


in real world applications xaml should only be used for declarative-programming
564641
element	document
5	


in this situation the xml document might be viewed as infinite with chunks being processed as the appear long before a final end tag for the root element has been seen
564737
lisp	common-lisp
7	


i like common-lisp better than clojure because the syntax is more regular and it s not tied to the horrible imho java apis
564857
constructor	object
5	


that way memory is saved the construction of the square object in app can be delayed to whenever needed or they can be done in the constructor of app default or otherwise
564860
kde	kdevelop
0	


eclipse is far better than kdevelop but eclipse do not have support for developing kde application
564887
set	any
5	


note that you can lose data which you put on the local disk if an instance goes down - if you re running a database you should use ebs which is very easy to set up and gets you persistent fast storage which can be attached to any ec2 instance
564911
line	lines
5	


step 3 above can be achieved if line contain pointers to existing points
564982
rule	rewrite
7	


the rewrite rule change is probably best but you may find rel tag is quicker
565190
union	select
4	


then of course you ll have to select max id from union of these two tables
565441
login	authentication
5	


this check will be limited to the time of login as the authentication ticket will be stored either in session or as a cookie on the user s machine
566014
binary-search-tree	tree
1	


it took enormous time as bad as binary-search-tree skewed
566065
asp.net	asp.net-mvc
7	


this question is older and i just started recently with asp.net-mvc when the rc was already out but for those who find this question later like me this might be interesting
566093
cvs	perforce
5	


i have a legacy cvs repository which shall be migrated to perforce
567276
arrays	map
5	


an object can be treated like a map or associative arrays with strings for keys - i believe that s what you want to do
567434
http	https
5	


i am developing a number of forms which should only be accessed via http
567643
uninstaller	prerequisites
10	


as a consequence any prerequisites must be installed by a separate bootstrapper by the way the installation is no longer transactional - the prerequisites won t get uninstaller if your msi installation fails
567923
line	lines
5	5	


the differences here with optparse and your spec is that now you can have command line like
568048
zero	digits
0	


trim leading zero then if it s longer than 10 digits it s too long
568093
spring	grails
7	


grails 1.1 has a newer version of spring s web-flow which solved a lot of these problems
568202
value	field
5	


identify modified rows by using a datetime timestamp column or by comparing all field value
568230
packets	packet
5	


while i m not certain if the library would work on wince or whether it directly provides what your looking for it may serve as a framework for any packets analysis that would need to be done in order to facilitate bandwidth use measurement
568581
line	lines
7	0	


so while i m not expecting something the size of scriptaculous it s certainly more than 6 line of code
568598
fonts	embedded-fonts
7	7	


if you have any dynamic or text fields with embedded-fonts be careful you are embedding only the subset of characters you need if you are using bitmaps make sure you are using appropriate compression lossless is actually better for computery images lots of solid colors or simple gradients
568607
contains	any
5	


this work folder as its name sayscontains classes used for work sometimes access to some of these files can be blocked for any reason
568684
sieve-of-eratosthenes	sieve
5	


i could have used sieve-of-eratosthenes but you said
568712
request	http-request
7	


the only legal way is going through their javascript-api which as you found out is harder to do in cocoa than to simply send an http-request
568981
parsing	comma
5	


it should be pointed out that split is a questionable approach for parsing csv files in case you come across comma in the file eg
569231
authorization	authentication
10	


application security is more demandind when it comes to access control authentication
569467
processor	processors
4	


you can t compare this with learning processor or assembly language first
569500
height	width
0	0	


there is no automatic clipping performed so you have to ensure that parameters top and left are not smaller than 0 zero and left + as well as top + are not greater than the width orheight of the destination image respectively
569931
constructor	copy-constructor
5	


share of ownership can be implemented by having a copy-constructor
570223
postgresql	mysql
4	


i also greatly prefer postgresql but i think if you re planning to use other peoples php applications forums blogs etc it s just a reality that you re probably going to have to run mysqlto support them
570247
postgresql	mysql
7	


you re right postgresql has much better support for sql and other advanced features so there s a very good case for why postgresql is superior to mysql
570283
c++	lua

lua is currently the fastest scripting language out there and its not so much slower than c++ for some sort of programs on par when doing pidgits 1 1 however lua scores really bad in a few benchmarks against c++

asp.net-mvc	webforms
7	


asp.net-mvc is harder to code initially but is so much easier to develop than webforms
570808
asp.net-mvc	webforms
4	2	


the flip side of this is that you can t use all of the handy out of the box controls that you get with asp.net webforms and you ll probably end up doing more client side javascript development so the initial development budget would probably need to be greater if you choose asp.net-mvc over webforms but you would have a superior solution for the long term
570923
dev-c++	visual-c++

scrollbars	scrollbar
7	


for accessibility purposes i need to make the scrollbars for all scrollable controls lists list views wider and the scrollbar arrows bigger
573426
command-prompt	cmd
5	


as suggested by tomalak this can be used to detect if the script was started from the cmd-prompt or by double clicking in explorer
573493
trace	profiling
0	


profiling s trace files or trace tables by themselves won t say here s what you need to fix in order to avoid this error any more than a dump file will tell you here s the bad line of code - you ll still need an experienced dba to interpret the results
573634
upgrade	versioning
7	7	


there are several different algorithms for comparison so if the default doesn t work for you try syntax aware or some of the other algorithms now i am using versioning 8 and haven t upgrade to versioning 10 so ymmv but i doubt that the xml diff has gotten worse
573668
ruby	python
0	


for your predicament you might be better off with a scripting language that others could get behind perl like you mentioned or others like ruby or python
574007
sql-server	sql-server-express
7	


sql-server express does not require licensing but has a smaller set of features
574022
selection	selected
5	


just treat your point selectedion or rectangle selectedion if you draw a bounding box to selected multiple items as another rectangle to be compared as overlapping to the others
574106
listener	mouselistener
5	


depending on the threading model if you leave yourself as a mouselistener then you will still be notified if mouse events occur
574300
cut	xargs
8	


another thought if you re going to use the xargs formulation offered by other posters cut might well be more efficient than awk
574327
sbcl	clisp
7	10	8	


i ve heard that clisp is easier to install and is more portable than sbcl which has lots of processor-specific optimizations but if you re using linux they re both easy enough to fetch from the package manager
574331
tcp-ip	tcp

if you do not specify the network library in the connection string a connection to the database will be established using tcp-ip by default

575136
nhibernate	ado.net

i don t really care what underlying technology will be used nhibernate ef ado.net linq etc. i just want to see what some calling code might look like in this admittedly contrived example of an all or nothing operation
575139
stored-procedures	ado.net

will stored-procedures be faster than plain ado.net insert statements
575454
forwarding	port
5	


most routers also expose a universal plug and play interface upnp which can be used for port forwarding and nat traversal
575934
opera	firefox
4	


most of opera s features are eventually available copied to firefox as plugins but i still prefer opera at home because the text looks better
576296
skip-lists	binary-search-tree
0	


so as you can see the random binary-search-tree was rather a lot better than the skip-lists
576419
margin	margins

i should imagine that setting a 1-px all-round margins will make sure that no div is less than a pixel from another
576431
operators	conditional
5	5	


in perl and other languages a conditional ternary operators can be expressed like this
576489
logging	trace
4	


the reason that i prefer log4net to using trace one of targeting - with log4net i can independently instrument different layers of my application data access services business logic etc and different subsystems authentication processing etc and turn on off the logging of each subsystem independently
576531
required	checked
5	


we have a local 1-click build that is required to be run before checked in an integration build also runs in a separate environment every checked in...
576954
tuples	set
0	


writing queries like this where implicit tuples unpacking is used to work with the result set has typically been more effective for me than trying to worry about matching python variable names to sql column names which i usually only use to drop prefixes and then only if i m working with a subset of the column names such that the prefixes don t help to clarify things anymore and is much better than remembering numerical column ids
577030
semantics	question-answering

dimitrov above you ll have a good beginning at getting some semantics into your system since prolog gives you a very simple way of maintaining a database of knowledge and belief which can be updated through question-answering
577271
asp.net	webforms
5	


it s a term which can be used to describe a variety of things it is commonly used by critics of asp.net webforms where if you are making heavy use of pre-built webcontrols you have little control of the generated html which in many cases appears bloated large and unclean messy etc
577439
double	int
5	


or if you have to use double in the order array you need to decide how to round any non-integer value that may be found in order to a int
577866
static-linking	dynamic-linking
4	


if possible i would prefer dynamic-linking not static-linking as used above
578072
environment	building
1	


under building environment such as code blocks you can use those commands in the project settings however i am not familiar with xcode - but worst case you just need to copy the compiler and linker options that the wx-config script lists
578081
hosting	web-hosting
5	


first thought was to have installed the main intranet system on company local network and have subsystem for members access on remote web-hosting provider side
578523
key	key-value
4	


if you need to parse text files that are more complex that simple key-value pairs i highly recommend boost spirit
578663
http	https
5	


this is also true to some extent even if they get your intial software via http or digitally signed - as most users can easily be persuaded to click ok on almost any security warning they see on that

582388
model	datamodel
5	


the other way i was thinking of doing this was having a row in the products table correspond to the regular product entity single and then have the related table with other package levels for that product and on the ui which i haven t given any thought to yet as i m trying to architect a proper datamodel do an auto suggest type of deal where if you type acm1234 it will display that along with the bx and ct variants and you can choose the one you want and get the appropriate values populated by it

some of these elements contains a lot of data to be passed as arguments to subreport

on the other hand if your program is a shopping-cart it s probably better to simply fail completely rather than potentially send the wrong item or charge the wrong amount of money to the wrong individuals

honestly for vertical centering issues and well any vertical alignment issues with the items aren t fixed height it s easier just to use tables
586559
contains	elements
10	


in some cases p tags should contains other elements such as anchor a image img and other in-line elements because they relate directly to the content of the rest of the paragraph and it makes sense to group them that way or the text of the rest of the paragraph provides a more in-depth description

on the other hand if the options themselves differ by only a few words and lose meaning if they are truncated a list of options like peanut butter and grape jelly sandwich with carrot sticks and soy milk and peanut butter and boysenberry jelly sandwith with carrot sticks and 2 milk maybe you would be better served by displaying all the options sequentially accompanied by a checkbox or radio button as appropriate

of any table we are able to generate a checkbox list containing fields of the selected table and allow user to select field s of his choice.on pressing show data button we are able to show the corresponding data in grid view.now my question is how can i am able to display this data in crystal report using asp.net c#

593853

casting to int should be fine so long as it s within the appropriate range - but be aware that a double can t represent all 64 bit int exactly so you may also end up with errors when you go beyond the point at which the accuracy of double is such that the difference between two consecutive double is greater than 1

strncpy	memcpy
7	


but for the example you give it doesn t matter - if it s going to fail it will be in the initial strlen so strncpy doesn t buy you anything in terms of safety and presumbly strncpy is slower as it has to both check bounds and for nul and any difference between memcpy and strcpy isn t worth changing code for speculatively
610277
strcpy	strncpy
1	


but yeah strcpy is as good as strncpy in any situation where you are allocating memory for the destination buffer and have already used strlen to find the length
610478
linq	linq-to-sql
5	


this is not an issue in linq-to-sql because linq-to-sql does not support automated updates from the database at all
610494
strcpy	strncpy
7	


of course you might still ask whether to use strncpy or strcpy in implementing that abstraction strncpy is safer there provided you fully grok what it does

png is a newer format and often better than either jpeg of gif - especially for screenshots
610565
png	gif

if png isn t smaller than gif then your software may be saving it poorly - look for png optimisation progams like pngout and pngnq
610573
png	gif
0	


jpg and png work well for most applications but the files will be larger than gif for very simple graphics
610597
png	gif
0	


if you find png files are larger than the equivalent gif files then you re saving the png in 24 bit color and the gif in palette mode because a gif is always in palette mode

domain-object	gorm

and frankly there are quite few differences between gorm and ar eg in grails you model your domain-objects and gorm will infer the database structure whereas in ar you have your table on the one hand and your object on the other

i don t know your platform but look into connection pooling - there must be a library or utility available either in the base system or as an add-on or supplied with the database drivers that will provide the means to pool several active connections to the database which are ready and raring to be used .when you obtain one from the pool

i find that working on documentation or reading long web pages is easier on the portrait screens
611158
line	lines
10	10	


there are some applications where portrait is still better though if you have to show a document in large resolution or if you have some monitor as in network monitor running and want to see more line at once
611185
line	lines

this is also very useful is far better than having 100+ line on the screen

none of the studies that reported decreased cost decreased error rates or both with larger routines distinguished among sizes larger than 200 line and you re bound to run into an upper limit of understandability as you pass 200 line of code

4	


can i downgrade the version level of tortoisesvn to match subclipse or upgrade subclipse
611542
strncpy	memcpy
0	


memcpy can be faster than strcpy and strncpy because it does not have to compare each copied byte with 0 and because it already knows the length of the copied object
611993
llvm	gcc
5	


also you may use a llvm backend to gcc to compile to lowlevel bytecodes which can then be interpreted in java
612302
fopen	fread
5	


starting with php v5.3 you can use ini_set to restrict the open_basedir to a specific folder so that files outside of that folder cannot possibly be read with fopen include fread etc
612718
domain-object	repository
7	


doing all assignments in repository seems easier but now the distinction between my database and domain-objects is not apparent
612824
gzip	zip
5	


that being said short pdf files should be pretty impervious to most compression methods - images should be compressed during rendering and jpeg zip in this case - but if you have a lot of text gzip can help
612861

it may be a lot of work but if it s an important form users may prefer that over manual text entry orselectedion from a list
613282
decrement	increment
5	


i suspect what really needs to happen is that guiregionvertical add guibutton should increment the ref count of the guibutton and then guiregionvertical s destructor should decrement the refcounts of all of its contents though i m not sure how this should be done with swig
613325
finalize	finalizer
10	


once the finalize of the object has been called the object is no longer in the finalize queue so it s just a regular managed object that the gc can remove
613406
memmove	memcpy

memcpy memmove are compiler intrinsics and will usually be inlined to rep movsd or the appropriate sse instructions if your compiler can target that

i heard that .length property of array in javascript engines in fact uses invisible setter and getter to achieve functionality of ecma-s standard that says whenever the length property is changed every property whose name is an array index whose value is not smaller than the new length is automatically deleted
614495
upgrade	versioning

either upgrade the versioning of svn you re using on the command-line i prefer macports or use an older versioning of subversive that uses the 1.4-era working copy layout

this is all done with outer webserver which listens to the world i recommend nginx or lighttpd

it sounds like you do not want the methods that you have to override because you are implementing serialization to be made public

so if evaluating using sin and cos lookup tables for two coordinate-set pairs distances yields a certain ranking one distance appears greater than the other based on the approximation and the difference s modulus is greater than the threshold above then the approximation is valid
615408

5	


in conclusion although a sloppy implementation of operator delete may required explicit null checked in the client code this is non-standard behaviour and should only be tolerated in legacy support if at all

so in the example below the rows would be considered duplicates if we only sorted on the first field
619098

global-variables	call

the hasownproperty call can be added to this function to refine it a little by only allowing direct properties of window which act as global-variables including the ones you set explicitly and not of any of its prototypes
621363
temporary	copy
4	


although one could in such cases recommend having the forward migration automatically save the data or keep it around in the eventuality of rollback as an alternative to outright failure save to yml copy move to a special table etc. you don t have to as the time required to test such an automated procedure could exceed the time required to restore the data manually should the need arise. but even in such cases instead of just failing you can always make the reverse migration conditionally and temporary fail pending some user action test for the existence of some required table that has to be restored manually

you can try to create your own hash it would probably not be as good as md5 and security through obscurity is likewise not advisable

often creating an overload which takes fewer arguments is a more flexible and cleaner solution so c# s designer simply did not see a reason to add the complexity of default parameters to the language
624082
min	max

this is more efficient as you only have a worst case of two if statements checking the angle whereas the other approach has a worst case of twelve 6 for each component when checking the other three corners to see if they are greater than the current max or less than the current min i think

at the end of the day though you can make good web applications with all 3 but if you are dead-set on dropping php to try something new i would recommend python and the django framework

existing systems if you re a .net shop asp.net is probably going to be chosen over php for example

quite flexible with configuration allows multiple projects source code management integration for svn git cvs all the common ones integrated wiki forums files etc

for me this means python-code is much easier to maintain which on the long run makes python much more attractive than perl

in general you will find that the entity framework supports many more complicated mapping scenarios than linq-to-sql
629842

i know twisted much more than django or pylons
635683
execute	declare

if you declare the instance as a normal static member or as a normal global variable in the source file you ll probably have an easier time because the constructor will be called before main execute before you have a chance to start other threads

treemap	linkedhashmap
1	


maps contains similar factory methods for instantiating other types of maps as well such as treemap or linkedhashmap
636972
line	lines

here you go - less line than any misuse of table tags can provide
637446
ruby	python
0	


the strongly typed languages themselves also tend to be more verbose than the python ruby where you can take advantage of functional programming techniques such as clojures and lambdas
637613
subquery	in-subquery
0	


this works if i do either the first or second query but when i add them together with the and it starts complaining about more than 1 row in-subquery
637744
pointers	stack
5	


space for the pointers will be allocated on stack but it will be popped off at the end of every iteration so you don t need to worry about it
637824
arm	powerpc
5	


i m currently working on a multi-threaded application that would be deployed on arm and powerpc architecture
637883
ant	maven
5	


it provides the logic described above and can be used from java ant or maven
637994
hosts-file	hosts
5	


the etc hosts-file can be used to override dns definitions to point an hostname to a different ip
638034
feed	feeds

generally i prefer http pull feed but what weaknesses does using http have
638124
trace	debugging
5	


the failure should easily be traced either through some sort of debugging output or stack trace
638160
ruby	python
4	


so it is not really sensible to compare ruby on rails vs python
638186
model	datamodel
7	


since your datamodel is not properly normalized this is uglier than it would need to be
638446
udp	tcp
10	10	


in some applications tcp is faster better throughput than udp
638446
ethernet	packets
0	


for example i read an experiment in which a stream of 300 byte packets was being sent over ethernet 1500 byte mtu and tcp was 50 faster than udp
638650
progress-bar	progress
10	


i would like to do the same in wpf but i can t find a way to pull it off short of hosting a winform progress-bar which seems counter productive
638721
controllers	controller
5	


in this case your application controller would still be responsible for initializing and managing the relationships between the data controller and view controllers but it wouldn t be cluttered with model object specific code
638844
margins	padding
0	


i ve had this before and making the box bigger with margins or padding makes it work ok
638971
windows-server	windows
5	


about the client profile it can only be installed on x86 client machines that don t have any version of .net installed so it won t install on vista it already comes with .net 3.0 any windows-server version nor any x64 ia64 os
639172
atomicity	atomic
5	


on a decent file system writes can be made atomicity by writing to a temp file and then renaming the file
639243
throw	throws
5	


unfortunately ikvm s graphics2d implementation throw a notimplementedexception in drawglyphvector it needs to be fleshed out with a .net implementation or by reducing it to calls of other ikvm graphics2d methods which are implemented
639495
braces	curly-braces
7	


one reason to use curly-braces becomes more clear if you don t have an else
639650
pylons	turbogears
0	


ruby gets more attention than python simply because ruby has one clear favourite when it comes to web apps while python has traditionally had a very splintered approach zope plone django pylons turbogears
639671
php	python
5	


it makes it hard to embed python in html files to make templates in the way that php or c# can be embedded in php or asp.net pages
639707
ruby	python
10	


if you re in a small company that s more entrepreneurial i can see where it s more likely that they re taking a chance on a technology like ruby python etc
639797

on similar line is it possible to have some engine which takes natural language input describing about the pattern one needs to match replace and gives out the correct almost correct regex for that description
639844
inner-join	join
10	8	


do not use includes if you want to achieve an inner-join includes implies a left outer join which is less selective and less efficient than inner-join .
639860
sql-server	oracle
5	


i know in sql-server you can drag the columns over from the object browser wouldn t be surprised if oracle had something similar
639945
atomicity	atomic
5	


in a managed wrapper over a native library i have to accomplish certain operations which to the user of the high level objects should be considered atomicity and consistent
640303
google-chrome	firefox
7	


using the same data google-chrome does in less than 5 seconds what took ie and firefox 10 to 15 seconds to accomplish
640672
checkbox	datepicker
1	


there are a couple of things missing like a datepicker and having checkbox on tree controls you can actually template this out but it s not as simple as winforms in that regard
640964
backwards-compatibility	compatibility
7	


this philosophy produces a better all-round toolset but at the risk of instability - because it means throwing away backwards-compatibility if and when better libraries appear
641013
asp.net	asp.net-mvc
5	


except these all other features can be used in asp.net-mvc
641215
delphi	c++
8	


delphi s exception handling is also much more advanced than c++ s
641231
lisp	common-lisp
5	


clozure cl is a fork from macintosh common-lisp but has be changed to unix conventions pathnames ... and does not include the special graphics code of mcl
641330
required	checked
1	


now you would think that it would be as simple as checked for the presence of these three properties and in particular the appisolated property because that s the property used to indicate the application isolation type in-process 0 out-of-process 1 or pooled 2 - and every application required this property
641494
selected	button
0	


more flexibility from uinavigationcontroller such as the ability to push pop views thatselectedively don t display the navigation bar but using the same animations and stack or more customizability over the navigation bar button labels and behaviors
641612
serialization	serializable
5	


the class needs to be serializable so it can be sent over web services and the data exposed by the get set methods needs to be serialization too
641690
selected	highlight
4	7	


when i selected another control the treeview loses focus it is no longer highlight
641813
vb.net	vb6
10	


i agree with franci - vb6 is no longer sold or supported so vb.net would be the way to go for compiled code
641840
progress-bar	progress
0	


so better to give some kind of percentage completion or something to enable the end user to develop much better application with progress-bar and all
641869
asp.net	asp.net-mvc
0	


you may wish to consider using asp.net-mvc as it gives you much more control over the final html rendered
642000
updates	updating
5	


in the ideal case the deprecated objects would be marked while updating the schema but then during the nextupdates our backup script would simply not select the objects which have been marked in this way allowing us to eventually phase out these parts of the schema
642081
tcp-ip	tcp
10	


a if yes then definitely a raw tcp-ip socket is more elegant solution
642177
contains	any
5	


the code snippet will fail if any of the rows contains objects that can t be converted by int
642224
processor	processors
1	


ideally you will have as many threads as processor
642381
key	key-value
5	5	


this is a bug in the microsoft c++ compiler - in your example std map iterator might not be a type you could have specialised std map on key-value so that std map iterator was a variable for example
642496
sftp	ftps
5	


note that sftp should not be confused with ftps
642653
asp.net	asp.net-mvc
10	


asp.net-mvc is much more in tune with the technology on which it is layered
643064
oprofile	gprof
5	


it can be used to visualize several different formats this is a python script to convert the output from prof gprof oprofile shark aqtime and python profilers into a dot graph. this is what the output look like
643215
sql-server	postgresql
1	


i am not familiar with postgresql but i would think that like sql-server it has meta-data tables views that describe the schema of the database for sql-server 2005+ i d be referring you to sys.tables and sys.columns
643497
windows-server	windows

this could be done in javascript if you know the aspects ratio of the image
643628
line	lines
10	


maybe phrasing the problem so that the actual algorithm is unclear - by describing the paths as single-rail railway line so the person would have to infer from domain knowledge that backtracking is more costly
643810
encoding	encode
5	


in theory those encoding could be used to encode any number within the range the encoding supports - but of course these encoding were made to encode unicode code points
643864
windows-vista	windows
7	7	


windows-vista security is quite better than earlier versions of windows
644457
32-bit	64bit
5	


if you specify 32-bit then it will be compiled into 32-bit and then converted as if it was 32-bit machine code running on a 64bit os
644834
aspect	aspects
5	


preferably such a tool would be comprehensive enough to deal with all relevant aspects of the protocol client server so that the high level protocol description could be serialized out to an xml rdf file where it could be used to dynamically create application code to implement the protocol in python
645075
function-pointers	member-function-pointers
7	0	


c++ provides better constructs than member function-pointers for your purpose
645914
double-quotes	single-quotes
5	


they can be declared with single-quotes double-quotes or in certain circumstances with no quotes at all
646086
aes	rsa

from what i could gather so far people either recommend aes or rsa for this
646358
net.tcp	nettcpbinding

about ado.net data services - as i understand ado.net data services can t be configured over remoting net.tcp binding
646461

i d recommend vim if you are going to learn one or the other but i know emacs users will strongly disagree
646610
trac	mantis
4	


i d recommend mantis or trac
646691
put	get
5	


it could be said that perhaps you should have spent more time designing but a key element in an agile process is that coding is part of the design process and in most cases having put some reasonable effort into design it s better to just get on with it
646789
undefined	return-value

objc messages which are sent to nil and whose return-values have size larger than sizeof void produce undefined values on powerpc processors
646794
line	lines
5	


for example a method is a first class programming construct because you can do xyz with it xyz is not what the method does but what a method in general gives you i can t remember what xyz was now but in .net 1.1 delegates were not able to be passed into methods because they were not first class programming constructs i read something along these line
646817
asp.net-mvc	webforms

in .net 1.1 delegates were not able to be passed into methods because they were not first class programming constructs i read something along these line
647128
platform	licensing
7	


joseph.ferris obviously works in a large organization where the cost of switching platform is going to be very very expensive so the cost of paying the licensing costs is much less that the cost of switching
647213
public	protected
5	


if you declare a method public protected then it can be overridden by children outside of the package
647664
count	difference
10	


now the big difference with a static object is that the control-point count is no longer a class-level attribute but an instance level one
647871
java	groovy

i know several people who graduated from cs without ever writing more than 50 line of c c++
648109
throw	throws
5	


to handle exceptions you could implement ierrorhandler which will be used whenever one of your service methods throw an exception
648568
javascript	dom
7	


this is more out of curiosity that a real requirement but i m wondering if it s possible to treat javascript as ideally a first-class .net citizen or secondarily have some way of invoking interpreting pure javascript functions that don t require the dom in a desktop setting
648684
tree	nodes
5	


the parent tree seems not to be updated for any changes once a nodes has been expanded
648824
dllimport	calling-convention

my statement isn t 100 true as there is a thiscall calling-convention which can be used with dllimport as an aid in calling c++ methods
648843
x86	32-bit
10	


int is more efficient to use because the cpu on x86 has 32-bit registers
648960
constructor	copy-constructor
5	


i ve diagnosed some of the reasons it s partly due to std string being mis-used the author should have used const std string wherever possible - don t just use std string s as if they were java strings but it s also because copy-constructor were being constantly called each time the vector outgrew its bounds which was exceedingly often
649000
vim	emacs
1	


or do vim or emacs have auto-completion as good as xcode
649138
constructor	copy-constructor
0	


unless the copy-constructor is complex it is normally very efficient - after all you are supposed to be doing little more than merely copying the object and copying memory is very fast these days
649148
tripledes	des
0	


i would stick with rijndaelmanaged or tripledes as those are stronger than des
649394
selection	selected
5	


the use ofselectedions we didn t implement this as it was a text mode editor that used vi-like commands such as 3d to delete 3 lines or 6x to delete 6 characters could be implemented by having a tuple to mark positions in the text and use two of those tuples for aselectedion range

the redefined getcopytooutputdirectoryitems can be created by copying the line 2 438 ndash
649817
unmanaged	managed-code

if c++ code is usedfor these functions c-wrappers are required for jni unmanaged-code around and this makes things more complex than solely using c
650603
set	any
7	0	


the potential function y assigns a number to every vertex in your complete bipartite graph in such a way that the sum of potentials of any vertex from s the set of all people and any vertex from t the set of all jobs is smaller than the value of the edge connecting these vertices so smaller than the cost of the person doing the job
650862
calloc	realloc
5	


mystring is not allocated with malloc or calloc so it can t be reallocated with realloc or freed with free
650886
serialization	marshalling

if you re using c# you can also marshalling it to a native buffer yourself to have better control over serialization
650913
fopen	fclose

650928
oracle	mysql

in my totally noninformed view i d guess that the first definitions favor sqlite or mysqlwhile the last few favors oracle
651229
internet-explorer	firefox
10	


i have noticed that internet-explorer is more aggressive at caching ajax calls than firefox is
651650
try-catch	exception-handling
0	


if the exception-handling are only thrown in rare circumstances then you re better off with a try-catch to avoid the overhead of branching in a tight loop

652325
boost-serialization	boost
5	


the boost-serialization archives can be constructed with any stream

windows-server 2008 is the first one for which using rdp directly is as secure as ssh
652817
udp	sctp
5	


i found that sctp can be tunneled over udp with the only problem being tunneled sctp is not interoperable with untunneled sctp
653203
login	authentication

i m not familiar with any such convention in python perl java php javascript or bash shell scripting
653407
ms-dos	windows

it can be saved via notepad for example in a file with the extension .com and it can be run on ms-dos most clones of ms-dos and even in the ms-dos compatibility mode of the windows command prompt including on vista but not on any 64-bit windows since they decided that compatibility with 16-bit real mode was no longer a priority.

if they are only familiar with asp.net webforms drag-and-drop-with-some-code-behind then they will have a whole new paradigm to learn which will take time
653799
ref	out

i m writing a bit of javascript and need to choose between svg or vml or both or something else it s a weird world
654281
glibc	glib

well i ve always preferred c and or c++ because there are multiple flavours msvc glib etc it runs on many different platforms mobile devices windows linux and devices and it can be written cross platform different processor architectures and even for high end graphics directx
654723
comma	concatenation

in general divisions are usually slightly more costly than multiplication on most processor
655564
multiplication	multiplying
10	


if you re dividing or multiplying by a variable then it s likely that multiplication is slightly faster because the logic is generally more simple
655569
processor	processors

with most processor it s faster to multiply than divide
655581
multiplication	division
0	


division algorithms are slower than multiplication algorithms in most cases
655584
multiplication	division
0	


which one is faster is indeed a cpu-specific issue or at least how much faster is cpu specific yes division is typically seen as slower than multiplication
655596
buffering	streaming
10	


even though streaming are buffering it s usually more efficient grabbing a chunk at a time
655754
nhibernate	entity-framework
10	


nhibernate is certainly more robust in many ways and there s also the whole entity-framework migration going on
655805
value	field
5	


leaving off initializer for a field could either mean that the coder knew it would be initialized to default value or that he knew it would not be initialized and didn t care or else he didn t think about it and his code just happens to work
656377
diagram	entity-relationship
0	0	


it s the only conceptual modeling tool available for relational data the others - erwin and its ilk - being at best logical modeling tools with nothing much better than entity-relationship diagram and ddl synchrnoization which are also provided by object role modeling tools

finally some thoughts on what should be made fibers typically your mainupdates loop is one fiber updating and drawing all objects and then calls yield
656559
jks	keystore
4	


command summary - to compare jks keystore to pem file
656716
numeric	digits

another thing you can do if you go all out is to only allow digits to be entered in numeric fields only allow digits and - in credit card or phone number fields and so on
656852
eclipse-rcp	rcp

this may be too late for you but i needed to migrate from a sharepoint 2003 site to a sharepoint 2007 site and keep not only versioning but also the file metadata from all of the document libraries
657418
ruby	python
1	


erlang as a functional language can be very concise beyond ruby or python
657528
line	lines
1	


since you can t control the spaces between letters and words nearly as much with css as you can with indesign it s a lot harder to justify text and not have rivers of whitespace run down your rows which happens when the spaces between words exceeds the spaces between line
657713
associations	model

i specify an order in the activerecord finder or in the model associations because sorting using sql is faster
657738
selection	selected

659787
throw	throws

type hinting throw e_recoverable_error which can be caught by simpletest since php version 5.2
660452
packaging	package-management

as a rule of thumb it s better to have one package-management in the system so you ll be better off packaging everything in rpms and managing it via yum
660467
arguments	default

by default the sun jvms will not run garbage collection in permgen but this can be enabled with optional java command arguments
660704
trace	debugging
7	7	


a crash dump with an exception that says you violated threading rules by doing this along with stack trace is much easier to debugging then a report from a customer on the other side of the world that says every now and then the app just freezes on me or it spits out gobbly gook
660920
processor	processors

i m not aware of a processor that takes any longer to do negation than to do any bitwise operation - and that includes some 30 year old processors
661126

the routes will match by default left-to-right so domain home index will match first to lang domain controllers index action default to index id default to 0 null
661205
asp.net	asp.net-mvc
7	


in asp.net-mvc gives you more control of the markup or at least more easily gives you control of the markup
661205
asp.net-mvc	webforms

also i d like to add that you can mix and match webforms and asp.net-mvc so its not a all or nothing situation
661423
ms-project	workitem

there should have been 4 spaces in the resulting output
662674
mouseleave	mouseenter
7	


if the radius is anything less than 100 when mouseleave happens the from property will make it jump up to 100 and likely cause a mouseenter
663045
xslt	xquery
7	


if storing your data in xml format is important for you since you work with xml maybe it has more sense to use a xml native database such as exist which lets you access and transform your xml data in a xml-friendly way xslt xquery xpath
663080
json	xml
7	


as json is easier to read and write then xml
663262
code-coverage	ncover
5	


some areas you just can t or is pointless to have test coverage thats where nocoverage attributes for ncover come in handy you can mark classes to be excluded by code-coverage

i believe this is more of an asp.net issue and not a jquery-dialog issue
663968
aspect	aspects

also a number of styles appear to be calculated next to the ul when it is show or hidden
664471
delphi	c++

the issue is that function arguments can be evaluated in any order so if your function arguments have any side-effects such as the increment and decrement operations you can t guarantee that they will operate in the order you expect

swing	awt
5	


the main difference between the jsomename classes and their previous version is that the j-ones where designed to be used with swing or any other graphical toolkit while the others are from this time where only awt was available

i would recommend silverlight over wpf when

environment	execution
7	


query execution depends on more factors it s possible to fully customize the engine environment to take advantages of various features like deffered execution future queries queries executed in a future moment multiple queries and last but not least session management involves in this area
666521
silverlight	wpf

silverlight 3 looks great but for this application i would still have chosen wpf

667150
php	ruby
5	


i m thinking about the singleton pattern in php right now and have decided that although the singleton pattern can be coded in php it is not really implemented since the instance is not shared across requests or stored in the process memory which is the case for web server environments like asp.net java and ruby on rails
667646
base-class	inherited
7	


and most classesare not designed to be inherited from - to create a good base-class requires more than making its functions virtual
667683

if all functions are virtual everything can be replaced by base classes - public protected private - everything becomes fair game

on python 2 you might need getcmdlinew to get unicode characters from the cmd-line that can t be represented in windows ansi codepage such as cp1252

i feel that the mvc pattern as a framework for dynamic data driving web applications does seems to require less verbosity and hence less code with dynamic languages like python and ruby which is a good thing

100 asp.net-mvc is better than webforms and it does no matter 2.0 or 3.5

if you just want to filter out line matching some text grep is the better tool for that

technically these are equal but how could it be determined without evaluation the ienuemrable returned in each expression

asp.net	asp.net-mvc
10	


as others have said asp.net-mvc is probably more inline with other web frameworks rails for example
674481

if you can stretch to other languages then lex yacc or flex bison is the standard for c although i wouldn t particularly recommend either of those combinations steep learning curve showing their age a little now

i actually would prefer doing this with linq but i couldn t find any examples that used csv files that had quoted values for values that contains commas in the value itself
674708
operators	conditional
5	


stop conditional is a single test here it s just i and incrementer is an expression to be executed each time after body the comma operators lets you have multiple sub-expressions which all get executed

i strongly recommend using html5lib + lxml instead of beautiful soup

scala allows import aliases so it s always less verbose than java in this regard see for example java.util.date and java.sql.date - using both forces one to be fully qualified
675498
function-pointers	member-functions
5	


member-functions can be implemented as function-pointers in a structure
675644
public	protected
5	


public values should always be accessed as properties rather than variables in classes a private protected backing variable to a property but that is slightly unrelated to your question
675663
version-control	git

if you re concerned about security plain ftp certainly isn t providing it and sftp requires ssh anyway so you could use ssh scp to synchronize with repositories this works much better with git than svn as most version-control tasks do

this way a post can be associated with any number of category and topics

sadly you can only compete with perl php python ruby and i would love to see this problem solved in other not so traditional languages
679963
postgresql	mysql
3	


any orm like sqlalchemy sqlobject or the django orm are implemented on top of db-api and i recommend using any of these over direct db-api because it can give gramps the flexibility to run sqlite in embedded mode for local desktop users and then also share sometime down the road a postgresql mysqldatabase connection with a web based version of gramps

.net	wcf

i d recommend wcf on .net 3.5 if possible though

if this size is bigger than the client size then wx will show scrollbar
680613
quicksort	mergesort

quicksortis also more complicated than mergesort especially if you want to write a really solid implementation and so if you re aiming for simplicity and maintainability merge sort becomes a promising alternative with very little performance loss
680907
delphi	c++

i d also prefer c++ delphi windows libraries because that would make them easier to integrate but .net java .

any other value indicates that three is more than one set of distinct values in the table
683444

if whatever assembly you are referencing were designed well then all the types members that you might ever want to access would be marked appropiately abstract virtual sealed but indeed this is unfortunately not the case sometimes you can even experienced this issue with the base class library
683774
packets	packet

you can t have a single sendto generate more than one packets you would have to iterate over all interfaces and either use raw sockets or bind the socket to a device using setsockopt ... sol_socket so_bindtodevice ethx to send each packets bypassing the os routing table this requires root privileges

double	int

this prints derived.foo double - even though the compiler knows there is a matching method with a parameter of type int and the argument is type int and the conversion from int to int is better than the conversion from int to double the fact that only the foo double method is originally declared in derived means the compiler ignores foo int

yes this ruins the ability to do numeric sorting and you won t be able to do a cast or convert on the column any longer since text will be intermingled with integer values but i think any other method would be too complex to maintain properly

to further nitpick about his solution a set of radio-buttons should be used and within the form a button or some sort of clickable element should be used to send the values to the server via an ajax request and the values sent to the server can be analyzed and the status of the answer sent back to the page

technically this is the task of your view layer though if your application s definition of a view layer is nothing more than an html templating system rather than processing and formatting anything that gets sent back to the client whether it s html or something else like xml then your xml or json generation may need to go into a new little section of its own

linq	linq-to-sql
5	


then any modifications to data in the view object can be saved and linq-to-sql will handle the commit correctly as long as all the relationships are clearly setup defined in both the database and in the data context

does anyone know where the permissions need to be modified in order to be able to allow the restricted account to add remove groups from user accounts
727336
processor	processors
5	


the specific question is how can a set of cell linux gnu compilers for the ppu and spu processor be built on windows using cygwin
727613
authorization	authentication
5	


it could be validation error where validating against db can t be avoided or authentication error we do that in 2 places one of which is db or a sql error
727667
throw	throws
1	0	


at least with oracle and i m quite sure with sql server as well the result of calling a stored procedure which throw an exception is a raised exception which contains far more information than this silly p_error field possibly can
727941
datacontext	submitchanges
5	


the datacontext must keep a list of records to be inserted on submitchanges - can i access that list
727955
erlang	scala
10	


i m sure someone will say that erlang is better but scala is actually usable by normal programmers
728252
tdd	stubs
1	


also it is obvious to me that dependencies are a pretty big deal with tdd as one has to think about how to inject a stubs mock to the said method for tests
728307
textbox	button
5	


i click edit button and can now change the individual textbox not the datagrid and change it to test changed value
728645
erlang	haskell
0	


haskell erlang etc are not options in this case as there is a significant quantity of existing legacy c code that will be ported to the new system and porting c to java c# is a lot simpler than to haskell or erlang
728716
line	lines
7	


unfortunately using nsstring -stringwithfont forwidth linebreakmode doesn t work - which ever wrap mode you choose the text wraps with a width that is less than the current width and the height becomes 0 on any overflow line
728716
height	frame
7	0	


to get a real figure fit the string into a frame that is taller than the one you need - then you ll get aheight that is greater than your actualheight
728903
unsigned	short
0	


if it is smaller than int say short int then the operands are converted to int and you get -4000 but on a 16-bit system uint16_t could be unsigned int and conversion to a signed type would not happen automatically

729349
set	any
5	


it works but there is one major weakness carenumerationinitializer must be instantiated before any reference is made to car enumeration otherwise carproperties are null meaning that car s properties can t be set when car is loaded hence the illegalstateexception thrown to at least make it crashes in a predictable and documentated way
729424
asp.net	asp.net-mvc
1	


by the way can i still use resources with asp.net-mvc
729597
derived-class	base-class
0	


no that s not possible since assigning it to a derived-class reference would be like saying base-class is a fully capable substitute for derived-class it can do everything the derived-class can do which is not true since derived-classes in general offer more functionality than their base-class at least that s the idea behind inheritance
729612
sequence	numbers
4	


our queues are transactional so i don t think that adding sequence numbers and resequencing at the destination is going to work as that would lose out transactionality
729882
jquery	dojo
4	


normally i d recommend jquery for this kind of thing but you re already using dojo so you should probably use that
730184
method-signature	signature
10	


the method-signature for setobject forkey accepts id as both parameter types and is much better suited
730385
try-catch	exception-handling
5	


as soon as an exception-handling is caught for the first time any finally blocks on the stack beneath the try-catch will be executed by which time it s too late - another exception-handling may be generated and this means that the original exception-handling is lost
730480
hosting	windows-hosting
4	


thus it would likely be easier to purchase windows-hosting for any asp.net apps you have
730574
sql-server	oracle
1	


i am not very familiar with oracle so am avoiding sql-server specific approaches other than the table variable for sample purposes but a way to solve the problem as stated would be to create a subquery that unions the four columns and maps column names another subquery that retrieves the max for the 4 values and an outer query that returns the joined result
730628
lisp	common-lisp
5	


you might be interested in having a look at common-lisp s condition system which is a sort of generalization of exceptions done right
730688
key	key-value
7	


a hashtable is nothing more than an array usually sparse one of vectors which contain key-value pairs
730688
set	hashtable
7	


the maximum size of this array is typically smaller than the number of items in the set of possible values for the type of data being stored in the hashtable
730813
output	spaces
0	


usually the output of such a hash algorithm is inside a range of some large number typically much larger than the spaces you have in your table
731199
jquery	jquery-plugins
3	1	


i really recommend learning jquery as it would save you loads of time and it is easily extensible by jquery-plugins
731295
set	any
5	


the set of instructions created as a result of compiling your code can be interleaved in any order
731614
command-line	cmd
5	


even in c there is a need for some code to be run before main is entered if only to transform the cmd-line into the c calling convention
731640
line	lines
0	


we had it in some files that came from cvs and number of line of log statements was on the order of 10x longer than the executable code in file actually was
731657
hide	show
5	


note that i know audiences can also be used to hide show web parts but that is not something i am interested in
731673
embed	external
5	5	


to make it work you must both embed some object type information in data where it is only useful for deserializing and usually use external schema definition which otherwise would not be needed like xml schema for xml
731695
md5	hash
4	


ldap signon should select md5 digest as the authentication type supply the username and then supply the md5 hash of the password
731864
integer	numeric
5	


for instance numbers should be stored using integer or floating-point types not strings because you can do math with numeric types but not with strings although it s easy enough to parse a number into a string that this is not a big deal
731956
json	xml
5	


of course it could be done by json or xml
732051
final	implements
5	


that said i would suggest carefully examining any case where you consider declaring a non-final static variable aside from a singleton instance and see if it can be refactored or implements differently -- moved into a singleton container or use a final reference to a mutable object
732124
line	lines
5	


remember that header must be called before any actual output is sent either by normal html tags blank line in a file or from php
732466
ram	ramdisk
5	


if that is the case get a faster disk but first check that you re getting the most out of your existing one...some linux distributions don t optimize disk access out of the box hdparm stage the data into memory say by copying it to a ramdisk ahead of time or be prepared to wait

controllers	controller

that is all you need to get a hello world up and running while in rails you would need to generate a whole project structure set up a controllers and a view set up routing and so on i haven t written a rails app in a while so i don t know exactly how many steps hello world is but its certainly more than sinatra
732664
listener	event-listener
5	


the only catch is that you will need to add code to manually look up the url in your add-on s overlay startup code as unless you addeventlistener before ff starts loading the first page on new window you will have added your event-listener too late to reliably catch that initial page load
732929
backwards-compatibility	compatibility
4	


ie was forced to choose backwards-compatibility with it s previous versions or to adhere to this new standard they absolutely ruled the browser market so the choice was obvious
733277
gridview	listview
5	


how to create a gridview like view to the wpf listview if i dont know the column names at the design time because the collection will be created at runtime and the collection will be of type datatable and it may contain a no.of columns.i can do it with wpf datagrid but i want to achieve this with wpf listview and i want to achieve this without code behind
733369
ruby-on-rails	django

i like django better because it s less magic with ruby-on-rails i feel they pushed the convention over configuration principle too far so i prefer the more explicit nature of django
733619
category	categories

once you have done that if you re in vs.net 2008 you can click on the windows forms category and then select inherited form
733720
arrays	hashmap
8	


in the extreme case matrix with a billion rows and columns with only 10 cells used a hashmap can be more efficient than any arrays implementation
734462
scala	ocaml
3	


i recommend learning ocaml f# or scala and familiarizing yourself with immutability with those languages
734920
ruby	python
2	


regardless its a tremendous framework and i fully expect that mvc will continue to support it as it allows them to compete with ruby python java in the mvc space
735067
subclass	subclassing
5	


categories can also be used to override a method or two when a subclassing is not needed and wanted but usually if you want to add functionality to a class you make a subclassing
735098
linq	linq-to-sql
5	


i always get local sequence cannot be used in linq-to-sql implementation of query operators except the contains operator
735262

in more recent versions of safari you should also be able to choose show web-inspector command-option-i from the develop menu
735631
webserver	upload
5	


i have a web application .net if it matters where when one of the pages is loaded a file on the users local machine needs to be copied upload to the webserver
735682
tcp-ip	tcp
5	


in any case if you really wanted to do it and you have full control of the client kiosks you could install a windows service on them that can manage file uploads downloads and be controlled via tcp-ip from the web server
736332
controllers	controller
0	


i wanted to have more than one controllers and view for same object model in asp.net mvc but it turned out to be a little complicated than i expected
736332
controllers	controller
5	


create a custom controllers class that overrides the view method or any other ones that needs to be overriden for this purpose and makes sure the correct view is returned
736614
controllers	controller
7	


the controllers takes a larger role in this environment even though the only input it has to deal with are browser requests
737139
subclass	subclassing
5	


child is a subclassing of parent so that means that child can be substituted with parent
737139
subclass	subclassing
5	


child is not a subclassing of parent so that means that child can t be substituted with parent
737304
initializer	setter
5	


but if you would have used setter you would only have to change the setter to initializer the object with the provided string
737404
linq	linq-to-sql
5	5	


in linq-to-sql that can be achieved like this
737409
getter	setter
5	


now in some sense getbalance may not be relevant enough to argue that getter and setters are good because it doesn t or maybe shouldn t have an accompanying setter and speaking of which a function called setbalance float f could be bad in my opinion because it would imply to the implementer of the function that the account must be manipulated out side of the class which is not a good thing
737501
processor	processors

i suppose this was part of what you found whereas this is more targeted towards laptop multicore processor

i add another problem the latency wich may be higher than with a dedicated-server
737576
dynamic-binding	dynamic-dispatch

this is much closer to dynamic-dispatch than dynamic-binding

xslt	xsl-fo

xslt apply-templates is much richer and deeper than xslt for-each even
738001
windows-xp	windows

i have created a wn32 project with visual-studio 2008 and visual c++ language it uses the ws2_32.lib library and then i compiled in release-mode
738723
decode	encode

thing is ultimately anything that s encode has to be decode before it can be shown and any sufficiently-talented hacker can trace their way through your decoding routine and figure out how it works
739293
virtual-machine	vmware
5	


vmware created pocket ace edition for this exact scenario of enabling virtual-machines to be run from usb drives
739306
gedit	gnome
4	


if you re a linux user and you also use gnome then i would have to recommend gedit
739346
enumerate	except
5	


alternatively do a deep copy of your list into a new _displaycollection list and enumerate through this separate collection which will not be written to except being filled before the display process begins
739610
fgets	getc
5	


if an outside constraint requires that the file really be read a line at a time for instance if you need to handle line-oriented input from a tty then fgets probably is your friend as other answers point out but even then the getc approach may be acceptable as long as the input stream is running in line-buffered mode which is common for stdin if stdin is on a tty
739610
buffering	streaming
0	


if the input streaming ends up unbufferinged then using an explicit buffering of some form will always be faster than getc on a raw streaming
739749
line	lines
0	


looking through the source code i find large code files more than 2000 line most of them are generated dialogs with lots of code-behind

then you can switch to eager-loading selectively just for items where that is more efficient when you come to the optimisation stage
740229
error-handling	exception-handling

a misused exception-handling is worse than no error-handling at all as you can grab a crash dump and view the unhandled exception-handling to find the error in seconds

if it contains a syntax-error then that error has to be diagnosed at instantiation
741199
webserver	host
5	


at the web host layer we will create a windows communication foundation service and generate a compact framework client proxy to send the gps tracks to a host webserver - where finally the gps trail can then be viewed using linq silverlight deep zoom and virtual earth
741341
subtraction	addition
8	


although i should warn you for anything more complicated than addition and subtraction and shifts you ll need to use non-trivial algorithms
741454
routes	controllers

you have two routes one is the empty string no parameters which matches controllers home action index
741454
controllers	controller

you will be pleased to know that binary-tree have an interesting property they can be represented as arrays
742095
line	lines
10	


java works better than c or c++ but it still requires many more line of code to implement an application than scala does
742181
unmanaged	managed-code
0	


conventional thinking is that unmanaged-code is marginally faster than managed-code so it s strange that you perceive a performance increase in going the other way around.
742625
tokenize	parsing
5	


that is why when you are trying to tokenize and parse a large file parsing is expected to be used while regex can simply find special pattern s inside the file
742678
category	categories
0	


something can belong to a more than one category subcategories make sense most subcategories people normally create lend themselves to an is-a relationship for example a windows user might have say a folder called resumes in their my documents folder because a resume is a document it would make sense that it s in my documents as well if you think of the folders as categories
743244
oracle	postgresql
10	


remember that oracle s implementation is closer to postgresql than to sybase genesis of ms sql server so performance will be different for each on different tasks.if you can avoid the hustle of tweak for performance on systems that can swap able back-ends go for least common denominator if you need to work with both
743267
command-line	cmd
5	5	


ive been looking everywhere for something that could manipulate animated gif files server-side preferably through php but simple cmd-line tools that could be executed via exec would do also
743445
shell	bash

this started as a fork of cygwin by the mingw developers and it intends to provide a minimal set of unix-like tools with a bash shell so that configure can be used on windows
743491
command-line	cmd
0	


in case your program needs more than positional arguments when the cmd-line usage is important you should consider options and switches
743497
line	lines
0	


in my current project i ve noticed that when writing java most of the classes will be less than 100 line long and often when the size approaches 200 line the class does many unrelated things and it is possible to split it up so as to get more focused cohesive classes

features like publishing are only available in moss so your cms localization requirements may not be satisfied with wss
744068
time	subtract

the built in date class handles overflow very well this can be used to add or subtract time
744308
blacklist	whitelist
5	


any addresses that aren t specified can either be handled per message or just default to whitelist or blacklist again user specified
744394
html5-canvas	canvas
3	


i would recommend using vml canvas via the excanvas library which allows you to write code using the html5-canvas element which is automagically translated to vml in ie trident browsers in addition to the new canvas-text library
744927
command-line	cmd
7	


the text mode takes much less memory and on linux you can easily start a run from the cmd-line and put it into background
745206
local-variables	class-variables

i believe that there was a comment somewhere that implied that accessing local-variables is faster than accessing class-variables
745392
nsoperationqueue	nsoperation

the nice thing about using nsoperationqueue and nsoperation is that they handle the background threading for you so i d highly recommend having a look at the apple docs for those classes and also at the apple threading guide
745461
key	key-value

it can store just about everything so long as each memcached key-value pair is less than 1mb

constructor	object

i set up my true business objects as close to mutator-free as humanly possible then i use a set of dto objects that are designed to be serialized public properties blank constructor etc. it s not an ideal solution but i have found that if you try and mix very rich object sets with serialization it can get ugly
746203
32-bit	64bit
0	


performance was about 10 faster than 32-bit and was nearly identical whether you were just using 64bit types to reverse bits on two 32-bit ints at a time or whether you were actually reversing bits in half as many 64bit values
746253
constructor	copy-constructor
5	


however it cannot be called a copy-constructor
746301
rule	expert-system

which is artificial intelligence a rule engine that uses the rule based approached to implement an expert-system and is more correctly classified as a production rule system
746301
testng	junit
7	


you may want to use junit in the part of unit testing but testng is more than a unite testing framework
746377
security	credentials

from my initial reading of brokered kerberos authentication once the user credentials are provided then a kerberos security token will be returned and authentication is not required for each web service call
746513
thinking-sphinx	sphinx

i recommend switching over to another searching plugin like thinking-sphinx
746926
line	lines
0	


such namespaces are best practice they ll add less than 1 line of boilerplate to any xpath calls which you can turn into a helper method and require about 15 lines of helper code to generate a prefix uri map but that is the only downside and you won t always encounter it

of course as with anything like this your mileage may vary and since i only used joomla briefly i can t say that drupal is necessarily better than it

i mean a shell script or perl python ruby tcl whatever to do that is probably less than 5 lines of code and less than 10 minutes of work

rotation	animation
10	


one thing to be aware if you re animation text dynamic text looks better animated when you ve got the font embedded also if you plan to animate rotation or alpha you will need to embed fonts otherwise you won t be able to animate those properties

gridview has much more bells and whistles than datalist

as far as being out of luck when the cloud is down that was true if my dedicated-server went down - it never did but if there was a hardware crash on my dedicated-server i am not sure it would be back on-line any quicker than rackspace could bring their cloud back up

linq	linq-to-sql

linq is so much more than linq-to-sql
758442


postgresql	mysql
10	
a couple of virtual machines or even a single virtual machine for all the products perhaps an ubuntu box for postgresql mysqland a windows 2008 server machine for the remaining products - i like one or two vm s because this is a more portable environment for running the tests when on the road off-site as my laptop would probably crawl to a halt running 8 or 10 small vm s
758476


tcl	python
4	
the reason i choose this instead of other systems i prefer coding in python for instance is because deployment with tcl tk is close to unbeatable
758501


hostname	ip-address
5	
if you are connecting to other sites besides localhost the host field will have to be updated usually hostname ip-address or www works
758528


editor	text-editor
0	
if you want to run notepad inside your app you would probably be better of with a text-editor component
758754


nant	msbuild
2	
i have a c# project for which i need to automate the build and i am trying to choose between nant and msbuild
758755

operators	conditional
10	10	
if the conditional operators is more efficient than the equivalent if-else assignment why can t if-else be interpreted more efficiently by the compiler
759218


32-bit	64bit
0	
it would be plausible for a non ieee754 double precision 64bit floating point number to have less than 32-bit of precision
759448


controllers	controller
0	
you might introduce a renderer level between controllers and page
759867


.when	ready
5	
that function will be executed .when the document is ready
760536


base-class	inherited
7	
i think the biggest reason why composition is easier to test is that implementation inherited tends to create very coupled classes that are more fragile fragile base-class and harder to test in isolation
760631


line	lines
0	
i m mentioning this because in java you ll probably be able to make a servlet to do exactly the same thing using http get for download and post for upload with less than 100 line of code
760634


asp.net-mvc	webforms
5	
one difference which i am sure will be rectified over time is the expansive amount of reference material and examples online for webforms versus the relatively sparse amount for asp.net-mvc
760643


enterprise-architect	methodology
5	
the federal enterprise-architecture can be viewed as either an implemented enterprise-architecture or a proscriptive methodology for creating an enterprise-architecture

7	
edit even after uncommenting the line to clean up the leaks the leaks utility complains even more than it did when there was leaks
761573


virtual-machine	vmware

i recommend using vmware to create virtual-machines and separate the mysql server from the web server
761596


kohana	codeigniter
10	
and a thing about codeigniter i asked some time ago people about it and most says that kohana based on codeigniter is better
761864


public	protected
7	0	
therefore the only types that should have access to a constructor are its derived types and hence protected makes much more sense than public
762212


mfc	wxwidgets
0	
wxwidgets was fairly easy to pick up had everything i needed and was way easier than mfc
762779


packets	packet
0	
to make it worse packets with push flag sometimes come first so i just pass them along to parser and then packet that preceds it comes and parser just discards it as corrupted
762801


perl	python
4	
if you don t have to use c then i would recommend perl or python
762977


.when	ready
7	
this can be put in an onload ready function if you like but if so the var script must be calculated at include-time and not in the ready function .when that executes more script s will have been parsed
762985


javascript	dom
1	
of course i have only written the tiniest of iphone apps and am not very familiar with javascript or the dom so i could be way off base here
763284


swing	swt
4	2	
i would recommend swt over swing any day as it is very easy for an average programmer to create a responsive and native-feeling swt app while it takes a swing expert to create a decent swing app
763288


default-value	default
5	
the author of deconvolucy appears not to have supplied a default-value that was consistent in type with the inputs.
763366


controllers	controller
10	
adding the required controllers ending makes it less likely that you would accidentally expose an object through mvc routing
763498


windows-server	windows
5	
i know that could be achieved with windows-server 2003 windows-server 2008 or similar
763621


model	datamodel
10	
rather than show you my actual schema which is much more complicated i ll show you an analogous example that illustrates the point without having to explain my whole application and datamodel
763645


silverlight	wpf
7	
this is one area that silverlight is much harder to use than wpf
764074


verilog	vhdl
8	
pacoblaze was written in verilog which like adam said less common than vhdl
764104


caching	browser-cache
10	10	
in my experience the only way to reliably test this process is clearing browser caching closing all browser instances to get rid of the session cookie then opening the browser and going straight to the page you want to test
764116


teamcity	msbuild
5	
i am trying to get gallio to be called from msbuild in a teamcity build configuration
764267


development-environment	platform
3	
we only used the standard nxt software with the kids because of fll contest rules.if you prefer using procedural languages the nxt is still a great platform for learning but you d need to switch to an alternative development-environment like one of these

netbsd	bsd
5	
from this wikipedia page i see the following disk encryption methods that are can be used on bsd freebsd or netbsd
764735


linux	bsd

in what ways is it better than either the kernel used in bsd and or linux
764768


selection	selected
5	
previousselectedion survives long enough to be recorded on click
764879


selected	button
7	
if you had a button you had to name rather than the menu to store this would export is shorter than save as be sufficient criteria to selected one over the other

you can be notified of navigation controllers changes but i don t believe you can prevent them from happening uinavigationcontrollersdelegate protocol
765234


operands	binary-operators
7	0	
in brief all integers are promoted to at least int size which may be 64 bits before any arithmetic operations and to the size of the larger operands for binary-operators if this is of greater rank than an int
765322


c++	python
10	8	
if python is more readable and more maintainable than c++ for your job and you don t need what c++ offers then certainly stick with python
765430


delphi	c++
1	
you ve gotta remember that this article was written for c++ which is nowhere near as advanced as delphi on the memory management front
765727


editor	text-editor
7	
in any case this option works much better for me use visual studio tools menu select options -- text-editor -- xaml -- miscellaneous
765929


upgrade	versioning
7	
as for production side of things upgrading your database in transaction msi-style installation is much better than attempting to upgrade at each app startup since you can potentially end up with desynchronized database-application versioning
766050


message	messagebox
10	
sure this is much more initial work than inserting a confimation messagebox but instead of shifting the responsibility it attempts to solve the problem
766110


inline	function-call
0	
normally when compiler reports use of an uninitialised value -wuninitialized in gcc you check for inline unrolls as your uninitialised value can be declared and not initialised for example 10 levels of inline function-calls or template unrolls higher than actual gcc report
766479


base-class	inherited
7	
multiple inherited makes it easier to compose classes from small mixin base-classes that implement functionality and have properties to remember state
766500


low-level	hardware
10	
the kernel has a more low-level view of the hardware each cpu is a separate object very different than how it looks like for user-space processes in user-space cpus are almost invisible
766521


code-coverage	cobertura
5	
something similar be done with code-coverage tools like cobertura
766621


for-loop	loops
1	
merge sort algorithm aside nested for-loop with iterator s is just as valid as nested for-loops with two variables i and j
767099


if-statement	loops
2	
is it good form to compare against std vector iterators it iter for my last two if-statements if the for loops might change them on its next pass
767220


element	document
1	
suppose i have the following xml document which has no default namespace defined and information element is not prefixed with any namespace prefix
767367


reflection	runtime
5	
custom attributes are meant to be accessed at runtime using reflection

platform	target-platform
5	
also are you sure when you profiled your code the code-coverage was enough to cover all the code-paths which might be executed on target-platform
767534


line	lines
0	
if you need to write much more than 10 line of code to pass one new test you probably are doing something wrong
767540


tcp-ip	tcp
4	
i can t remember the exact steps in 2k8 as i ve only had to do it once but in 2k5 you had to open the sql server configuration manager select sql native client configuration client protocols and enable tcp-ip and named pipes - it s a similar process for 2k8 as i recall
767866


show	next
4	
i ve tried showing a form and loading the image but when the preview form show i lose focus for the listbox which means that when i move the mouse the preview image does not change when i go to the next item in the list
768048


value	field
5	
if i recall correctly linq does not call any property procedures but directly sets and reads all the private field value directly which can only be done via reflection as far as i know
768064


command-prompt	cmd
5	
i m working on a windows application and i want to show some status messages at cmd-prompt while executing the windows application how can i do that cmd.exe can be run through windows code.but i don know how to show some message at cmd-prompt or if there is any way to do something like console.writeline message through windows application
768970


asp.net	webforms
10	
i believe that constructor injection is far more commonly used right now and property injection is widely seen as a fallback for cases where it is not feasible to get the di container to perform object construction for you asp.net webforms
769113


line	lines
1	
if you want to generate a .py file that people will actually use maybe so that they can fill out a form and get a useful .py file to insert into their project then you don t want to change it into an ast and back because you ll lose all formatting think of the blank line that make python so readable by grouping related sets of line together ast nodes have lineno and col_offset attributes comments
769263


line	lines
5	
both line of input should be underlined when printing
769403


integer	zero
1	
else i agree with adam robinson s answer - if you just want to hold the day of a week stick with the dayofweek enum zero is sunday instead of using an integer
769701


minimized	minimize
10	
using javascript is it possible to detect when a certain element is no longer visible such as when the user scrolls down far enough or when the browser is minimize or covered with another window
770504


windows-xp	windows
5	
can the tfs proxy be installed on windows-xp
771094


notepad	notepad++
1	
if you re looking for something as simple as notepad but with some syntax highlighting check out notepad++
771126


while-loop	loops
1	
even if you re not familiar with ruby s c internals it s pretty clear that this function has a for loops iterating upward to check that the type of all the arguments is t_module and then uses a while-loops iterating downward to actually include the modules - so the modules in include x y z would actually be included in the order z y x
771139


linux	ubuntu
4	
i usually prefer linux for programming i program in django on ubuntu
771288


javascript-framework	dojo
4	
i recommend dojo at the current moment it is the fastest javascript-framework on most browsers
771384


command-line	cmd
10	
i find this is less mentally taxing then building cmd-line pipes
771794


quicksort	heapsort
5	
so this comparer can be used with bubble-sort as well as with quicksortheapsort or any other sort algorithm
771819


textbox	button
5	
the view that must be shown contains following controls 2 textbox 3 labels a button and linkbutton
771892


quicksort	heapsort
8	
average asymptotic order of quicksortis o nlogn and it s usually more efficient than heapsort due to smaller constants tighter loops
772011


api	account
7	
we currently have a website that has user account functionality but we are looking to provide an api to allow users to manage their accounts perform actions via other devices websites by providing an api for common tasks
772201


.net	wcf
10	4	
in case you could go only with .net it s better to choose .net 3.5 and wcf framework instead of .net 2.0 remoting the last one is dead and unsupported technology
772202


ruby-on-rails	grails
7	
it runs on the jvm use the groovy language that in many aspects is more close from scripting languages while it s not and the grails architecture will remind you the ruby-on-rails one
772576


asp.net-mvc	webforms
4	2	
aside from that i can t think of any situations where i d prefer webforms over asp.net-mvc at this point
772667


java	python
4	
for the backend i d recommend java or python because they are multithreading and nio-capable
772668


asp.net-mvc	webforms
0	
imho asp.net-mvc allows you to factor code much better than webforms so i think developers with lots of patterns experience will be more comfortable in asp.net-mvc
772710


upgrade	versioning
0	
i am not sure could this be because now the older links after upgrade is been pointed to newer versioning and just linking is not sufficient and need to modify something more on linux
772722


line	lines
4	
v will select line that do not match
772843


32-bit	64bit
5	
the 32-bit version can still be installed on 64bit windows but the functionality doesn t show up in the default 64bit explorer
773052


readability	code-readability
10	
if all you are doing is simple concatenation i d argue that code-readability is more important and i d leave it like you have it
773134


controllers	controller
5	
you can a have a button save it is the controllers has to know which action must be executed insert or update
773225


hide	show
7	0	0	
js for tabs generally does no more than show hide maybe load content
773237


report	subreport
7	7	
i have one group in main report shows header information and pass one parameter - reportid to each subreport
773478


category	categories
4	
since this is a client app i thought about putting a scrollbar in the category section so it can expand without causing the ui to blow out
773664


security	credentials
10	
wcf supports way more transport protocols http in various ways tcp msmq and more has a lot richer security model credentials federated security and offer options for hosting - self-hosting in a windows app or service in iis or was and more
773807


feed	feeds
1	
i m realizing that pulling in a weather rss feed might be the only clean solution but i am not very familiar with parsing rss feeds so it will require a lot of labor on my end since i ll be digging through documentation
774133


value	field
1	
for example if you have a score field that is only meaningful with value between 1 and 100 then you have no business storing it in an int class whose range is -2 147 483 648 to 2 147 483 647
774382


visualsvn-server	visualsvn
4	
in the left pane right-click the visualsvn-server item and choose properties from the context menu
774421


triggers	insert
10	
they should always be written to handle multiple row insert updates or deletes or sooner or later your triggers will cause data integrity problems
774450


line	lines
5	
in ms access the relationships tool shows the db tables as little movable boxes that can be linked with line
774850


element	document
0	
finally select the first link in document order in case any of those node-sets had more than one element
774898


value	field
5	
when i try to define an overriding default constructor that takes 3 field and sets the fourth to a default value 0 i get errors in the instantiation part of the code not the constructor definition complaining that my object must be initialized by constructor not by ...

oracle	oracle-xe
4	
well with oracle-xe if you hit the limits you have to either buy oracle or migrate your entire application to a different database
775121


oracle	oracle-xe
4	
a few things to be aware of if you choose oracle-xe
775313


.net	wcf
7	
completely agree wcf is way too bloated and much slower in comparison to .net remoting which is slower than managed socket code which is again much slower than native iocp code to hand rolled code
775316


oracle	postgresql
4	
you haven t provided much information but unless you re already an oracle expert i see no reason to choose oracle xe over postgresql
775693


atomicity	atomic
7	
also if you re writing a value that s larger than the native word size 32 bits on an x32 processor the writes are not atomicity - so the high 32 bits of a 64 bit write will hit the bus at a different time from the low 32 bits of the write
775781


asp.net	asp.net-mvc
5	
for a bit more info the first chapter of the asp.net-mvc 1.0 book is online and can be downloaded for free
776513


set	contains
5	
where any string thatcontains commas will be bounded by double quotes - things could potentially get interesting if you ve got commas inside quoted strings so you may have to set limits to how clever you want to be what the provided data can contain
776538


postfix-operator	prefix-operator
7	
the postfix-operator has the same priority as the pointer resolution but the prefix-operator has a lower priority
776660


http	https
5	
to be honest though i like the websites i go to to be consistent so i would like your javascript files to be retrieved via http
776684


line	lines
0	
if it is a lot of code say more than 5-10 line of code or more than 50 of the total amount of code in the parent method i would extract it to a private method for code structure and readability
776707


oracle	oracle-xe
1	
sadly this is not possible with oracle-xe as there is no support for java in that free edition
776793


throw	throws
10	
having said that i would argue that the iterator is faster since at does range checking as well it throw an out_of_range exception if the index is out of bounds
776928


javascript	dom
7	
if you are showing 100 records page use json to pass the data from the server as javascript can parse it quickly and then use innerhtml to put the html as the dom is much slower in rendering tables
776990


delphi	pascal
5	
i m new to c# been a pascal lover until i found c# in depth.in delphi there is a try statement that is also implemented in c#
777193


authorization	authentication
5	
if memory serves me well tomcat or the isapi tomcat connector would never be given the basic authentication headers supplied by internet explorer as iis took those away after failing to use the credentials for the windows authentication which i did not ask for when sending the authorization required response in tomcat...
777388


json	xml
7	0	0	
xml imposes more overheads than json yaml
777618


asp.net	asp.net-mvc
10	
using asp.net-mvc it s better to try to go client so jquery or others is the better
777967


line	lines
0	0	
that way you can accept more less than 3 line of data but that s only necessary if the number of line you want to accept is variable
778042


order	add
5	
the problem is that in order to achieve the results i had to include the subsonic source in my solution alter the generation templates for the data objects and add entirely new templates for a super type that could serve paged sorted and filtered strongly typed collections
778053


windows-server	windows
1	
i know it can be done using custom-plugin data source but that is only enabled with windows-server 2003 enterprise edition
778164


sorting	filtering
7	
this is more of a subsonic 3 solution but have you seen rob s screencast using subsonic3 t4 and the jquery grid to do pretty much most of what you are asking above paging sorting filtering
778630


row	cursor
5	
a cursor over the result set so the function can be called one row at a time
778705


value	field
5	
personally i try to avoid using stored procedures as much as i can but for this case i see them as the best option loading all the entities just to increase the value of 2 field seems pretty much an overkill especially if the call is going to be made through ajax
778807


turbogears	django
4	
you ll want some kind of framework i d recommend django or turbogears
778963


cell	cells
5	
i have a datagridview control which i am using and i added my handler below to the datagridview.cellformatting event so the values in some cell can be made more human-readable
779183


linq	linq-to-sql
0	
i find that much more useful than linq-to-sql
779324


line	lines
4	
if it is important to match everything there are other line that would match this you can say
779694


tree	linked-list
7	
as you pointed out the resulting worst case for a tree is worse than o log n and could end up looking simply like a linked-list
779769


category	categories
5	
my code functions can definitely be grouped into category
780111


cin	cout
10	10	10	
scanf is faster than cin printf is faster than cout etc
780152


directory	folder
1	
while it does let the user browse for a directory it s not as intuitive as folder browser dialogues that i ve seen in installers in the past
780156


malloc	free
0	0	
i am wondering if there is a cross-platform allocator that is one step lower than malloc free
780339


extends	implements
10	
but what is really neat is their nature if you are using the latest scr the service component runtime which is anextendser bundle implements the new and improved osgi r4.2 ds - declarative service - specification your classes will not import anything from the osgi model
781191


line	lines
0	
this approach paid out very well resulting in fast development no overhead at all and a framework which actually was mightier than most java frameworks out there but with only a few hundred line of code in a single file plus some simple mod_rewrite rules
781615


instances	destroy
4	
add functions to the wrapper to create and destroy instances of the library
781929


amfphp	zend-amf
4	
weborb is also a very good choice but they are mainly focused on .net that s what i m using it for so you would have to compare amfphp zend-amf and weborb
781948


aspect	aspects
5	
so no i would not be concerned about this aspects at all
782036


gwt	gwt-rpc
5	
i think the recent release of gae meaning that gwt-rpc can be used for free would ve helped
782053


windows-vista	windows
5	
and diskid32 run on windows-vista ultimate 64-bit
782055


selection	selected
0	
if you got into childselectedion or anything more than just root elements and id classes this could get messy fast
782123


ironpython	cpython
5	
can be used with either cpython or ironpython
782290


copy-paste	paste
0	
the time and effort taken to type the attribute name above the method cannot possibly be less than the time and effort needed to write the reset code which should be in its own method as well so you don t copy-paste a magic number everywhere
782841


line	lines
0	
i have already done lot of the work but now i have more than 600 line of code pho only per page and more than 20 database tables only for storing and geting the movie data many-to-many relationships
782997


oracle	mysql
7	
in an orm like mysqlor oracle when you start adding more nodes if you join two tables that are not in the same node the join cost is higher
783240


tree	nodes
10	
if you ve got twonodes with no parent that is more like a forest than a tree
783397


request	http-request
5	
all of the three options you mention seem like perfectly valid ways to do this but registering these hits at the same time as returning either the .swf or the .xml config file seems like a smart thing to do because afaik most browsers have a pretty low limit to the number of concurrent http-request they can make to the same host i think it s two or something like that so if more request have to be made in order to render something in the browser the ones going over this limit will have to wait for the first ones to finish before being initiated
783526


vb.net	vb6
5	
keep in mind that asp websites and vb6 applications can be migrated to vb.net with little to no pain
783534


vbscript	vb6
4	
i m unusual in that i come from a c c++ background know c# but actually prefer vb.net i severely dislike vb6 vbscript
783665


jsf	seam
4	
if you are going the with a java back-end i would recommend hibernate for your jpa jsf with richfaces ajax skinning and facelets view rendering templating for your front-end and seam to put it all together
783711


required	checked
4	
however even if installing firebug does not appeal to you i d recommend checked out firebug lite which requireds no installation into the browser nor in fact does it even required firefox
783825


default-value	default
7	
imo declare a constant with default-value is a better way
783921


processor	processors
0	
if you are doing full-out processing all the time in your threads you won t benefit from having more threads than processor
784125


.net	wcf
10	
i d recommend wcf though as the programming api is more simple imho and wcf will give you more flexibility with regards to.network transports etc
784237


adapter	adaptor
5	
your adaptor would be passed a frame and one of your hashtable-based dtos
784534


svn	revision
5	
so to do this properly the file s revision number should be updated at svn checkout update
784626


ruby	python
10	
no ruby is not better than php or python
784626


php	ruby
10	
on the other hand php is better suited than ruby for writing a one-off short backend for an email submission form
784633


php	python
10	
python has list comprehensions php is much better when embedding and generating html
784685


serialization	serializable
10	
the other advantage of having a view model is that because it is shamelessly tailored to a particular view your real model is more reusable because it doesn t have to make any weird concessions to make it suitable for ui display needs to implement inotifypropertychanged or serialization or any of that mess

32-bit	64bit
0	
note however that due to the larger adresses 32-bit is 4 bytes 64bit is 8 bytes a 64bit jvm will require more memory than a 32-bit jvm for the same task

fiddler	charles
4	
if you use a transparent echoing proxy this can show you all http traffic charles and fiddler are two good example i recommend charles
785009


hide	show
5	
implement the forms as usercontrols instead put them onto the same form and show and hide the controls as appropriate this can also be achieved by loading the forms stripping form borders and such and setting their parent to a panel or something similar
785028


put	get
5	
i think you are going to need to do some user validation and i would be tempted to put keys to the decryption in a separate database and provide some other mechanism to get that out which should require authentication
785106


value	field
4	
the onchange event is only called when you have changed the value of the field and it loses focus
785281


serialization	deserialization
5	
use the xmlignore attribute to mark a property to be ingnored in serialization deserialization
785864


packets	packet
10	
it looks like you are expecting a soap packets with an asmx service and jquery is more suited to hitting a restful service generated from an ashx file or wcf service

set	any
5	5	
as to reading from a named pipe they can be treated like any other file with the caveat that they will block until the other side of the pipe is set up
787022


environment	configuration
7	
this is more of the dry style of configuration assuming the configuration for each environment is pretty similar
787132


sbcl	ccl
4	
my impression is that the fastest but most expensive route to doing application delivery across those three oses is to buy allegro but an alternative more work but cheaper would be to use ccl on os x corman on win32 and ecl or sbcl on linux
787397


set	any
4	
note that this should also match any characters that are alphabetic not just the usual roman alphabet s set and therefore also matches accented characters etc
787540


aspect	aspects
4	
however since these tend to have significant side effects the security aspects trumps this a lot of the time out of fear
787585


config	app-config
4	
while i would not recommend this there is a way to revert back to how clr 1.0 and 1.1 were behaving by setting application compatibility flag in app-config file
787621


asp.net-mvc	webforms
4	
then i discovered asp.net-mvc january 2008 and since then although i still master asp.net webforms i will always prefer asp.net-mvc

quicksort	bubble-sort
0	
and i d use a quicksortrather than bubble-sort
788493


.net	compact-framework
7	
for a installed client application then arguably java has the better portability - but with things like compact-framework micro framework silverlight etc .net is catching up
788763


tree	nodes
0	0	
for example some do better by building dom objects some setting all of it to the innerhtml of a single non-tree dom nodes then adding it to the tree etc
788881


height	width
7	0	
what would be perfect is keeping the percentheight and width while child width is smaller than parent a width
788997


value	field
5	5	
value types are created on the stack unless nested within a reference type there is something about field locations on the stack that the clr can t guarantee that they will be zeroed out contrary to field locations on the managed heap which are guaranteed to be zeroed out
789468


authorization	authentication
5	
authentication shall be separated from authorization
789764


linq	linq-to-sql
7	
if you are doing this with linq-to-sql within your applicaiton it isn t much different but in general linq is easier to write debatable of course
789784

php	python
1	
i am not familiar with python but if it is like php this will have no advantage over method 2
790749


cell	cells
0	
it would mean creating rows and cell to add to the table but it would give you more control over the layout
790773


authorization	authentication
5	
httpclient also supports handling basic authentication so the authorization header can be refactored out depending on how deep your changes go

791183


c++	python
7	
and python is slower above hundred times than c++ in execution time 100 1
791184


put	get
7	0	
this will work even if you are not root since it only fetch the source code to the app-name and put it in the current directory which is easier than having to track down the source and there is a better chance to get it work since you download the version that should work on your system
791382


asp.net-mvc	webforms
4	2	
i would choose asp.net-mvc over asp.net webforms for one reason testing
791382


asp.net-mvc	webforms
0	
testing asp.net-mvc is orders of magitude easier than webforms due to the ability to mock or replace parts of the core api
791395


swing	swt
7	
swt is an alternate toolkit for java that has slightly less cross-platform compatibility than swing but is still popular nonetheless
791509


atomicity	atomic
5	
is there a good rule of thumb for when nonatomicity properties should be used in objective-c on the desktop or on the iphone platform as opposed to the default atomicity properties
791853


integer	digits
5	
also be aware that single-digits integers in your lexer will not be matched as integer they will come out as digits
791858


selected	checkbox
4	
from xcode you can right-click the project and select add - existing files... when you have selected all your files click add then select the checkbox at the top copy files...
792139


encoding	decode
5	
if you call decode ... you try to interpret the characters as some encoding that still needs to be converted to unicode

792299


http	https
4	
could not find a base address that matches scheme http for the endpoint with binding basichttpbinding
792463


addition	add
7	
the udf approach has slightly better metadata and composability compared to stored procedure - for example you can add addition where skip take etc to a udf query and have it run at the database but last time i checked only linq-to-sql not entity framework supported udf usage
792661


xsd	xml

i reckon it s better than asp.net ajax for webforms
794349


installation	packaging
0	
the rubygems feature set is a little larger than just packaging in involves package distribution and installation
794403


order	add
7	
it could be doing the temp table renaming if you are trying to add a column to the beginning of the table as this is easier than altering the order
794414


hide	show
7	
an alternative would be to show the dialog hide it immediately show a topmost progress form instead and then hide that but i think showing a single dialog is more seamless an experience for the user
794679


base-class	inherited
5	
i would have thought the inherited class should call the base-class s count function
794801


put	get
7	
right now i would have to say the put method is better since it works and i could not get the webservice to work
794823


ruby	python
4	
whether that s perl or python or ruby or whatever i choose perl but that s not always for everyone it s just something that will allow you to bypass the shell for quoting
794848


order	add
4	
i strongly recommend named paramters as you can later add features by passing get params without having to worry about the order
795036


line	lines
0	
in c# i d almost certainly write it in more than 10 line even though it would be feasible in 10

hosts-file	hosts
0	
if you have more than one hosts header on your website in iis you need to have each one represented in the hostss-file
795805


tuples	any
4	
the return value can be used exactly as a tuples and has the same speed and memory properties so you don t lose any genericity
796128


line	lines
0	
you re looking for something easier than 5 line of code
796361


linq	linq-to-sql
5

796633


glib	valgrind
0	
the false positives may arise if you are using older valgrind with newer gcc and glib valgrind 3.3 with glib 2.9

contains	any
5	5	
you should create a dependencies it doesn t have to be called this folder within your solution thatcontains any pre-compiled dlls you require
797007


selection	selected
5	
either that or you can reload the page when theselectedion is made which is likely to be done in javascript anyway
797038


arrays	map
7	0	
or if you do ask why this is any better than having one big map hash table associative arrays to hold all entities in your app and lots of functions most of them duplicared cut and paste and out of date doing switch cases or rtti to figure out the real type of each entity
797047


nsmutablearray	nsarray
10	
in addition to the answers from mssrs information and mouviciel nsarray is faster than nsmutablearray
797504

is there an easier way with l2s than count before and count after and taking the difference
797803


radio-button	button
0	
if you ve got more than one radio-button which i m hoping you do then you really can t use getelementbyid without all this extra looping logic etc.
798046


integer	digits

7	
well i am catching the soapexception but when i display the message on the client end in a messagebox it shows more information than i really want to show
798536


templates	variadic-templates
1	
not possible with generics but with c++ cli s variadic-templates when it gets support for them you can do it
798763


contains	elements
5	
do note that the wanted elements will be produced in any desired order because we are using the xpath 2.0 sequence type vs the union in the xslt 1.0 solution which by definitioncontains items in any desired specified order
798765


jquery	.post
4	
but if you looking for an alternative to page.postback then i would recommend jquery but from the question it seems as if you re new to ajax so assuming you know javascript hopefully you know that first to understand how jquery works
798816


set	any
0	
another option would be to set a sort of fluctuation threshold where you don t do any recalculation until the speed changes by more than that threshold
799021


margin	margins
0	
found the solution turns out that the body should not be wider than the report size so for example if you have a standard letter page 8.5 x 11 than the body should be less than 8.5 pay special attention if you have margins since you have to subtract those inches too i want a one inch margin per side so left and right would sum up two inches
799142


udp	tcp
7	0	10	
udp has less overhead than tcp and is therefore faster
799245


window	active-window
10	
but this works better global bool variable appactive to keep track of active-window
799296


value	field
0	
one more caveat a sortable field must have no more than one value stored in each field
799515


json	xml
10	8	
but if it s just for sending data usually json is more compact than xml
800098


32-bit	64bit
1	
also you need to transfer these instructions to and from the cpu 64bit instructions are twice as big as 32-bit instructions which means more traffic to and from memory and the caches

mouse	click
2	
it should have a visual environment where one can use a point and click interface so that it is possible to select objects with mouse and move them around
801317


json	xml
10	
we already have xml why is json better apart from being native to javascript
801322


json	xml
0	
json is generally much smaller than its xml equivalent
801620


compression	streaming
0	
as the probability you mention will tend to many alternating streaming parts like 0101010 this will give you many streaming parts like 111111 which can usually be compressed better by usual compression algorithms
801669


mouse	keyboard
5	
or it could even be hooked to mouse or keyboard events so that when the user doesn t move the mouse or isn t using the keyboard the timer counts down until it reaches the log off time
801671


c++	python
0	7	
they show that python is up to about 400 times slower than c++ and with the exception of a single case python is more of a memory hog
801671


c++	python
0	
my experiences with python show the same definite trend that python is on the order of between 10 and 100 times slower than c++ when doing any serious number crunching
801686


c++	python
0	
is much shorter than either its python or c++ equivalents
801723


asp.net	asp.net-mvc

you may find that asp.net-mvc gives you more control over the html and hence more ability to meet any requirements
801740


binary-tree	tree
5	
what algorithms can be used to draw a binary-tree in the console
801783


c++	python

value change listener cannot be used to alter the values being changed fyi they are invoked in the validation phase
802573


cvs	git
7	
i have been happily using cvs for over 10 years and now i have been told that git is much better
802680


line	lines

if you have more than one cpu then one cpu reads the file and parses the data into lines the other cpu takes each line and processes it
802686


sql-server	mysql
0	5	
if your application does some computing that takes longer than the time period specified in net_write_timeout between two calls to mysql_fetch_row the mysql-server considers your connection to be timed out
802785


subclass	subclassing
7	
however the table per subclassing strategy n + 1 tables and n joined-subclassing elements in one mapping file makes more sense in my case because i want to put some constraints on the subclassing tables
802863


persistence	hibernate
5	
ejb3 defines jpa api and hibernate can be used as persistence provider for jpa
802881


groovy	scala
3	
in the future i might still write some parts of the application code in java but for the tests i would prefer using scala ruby groovy or similar language with a more flexible syntax

i had to do nothing more than selected the right answer in a couple of checkbox
803202


cookies	session-cookies
5	
i used to be one of the cookie module testers and i don t think there is any design reason this would behave differently although if you crash the session-cookies might be designed to live on when you restart...
803505


json	xml
0	
json s a text-based object serialization format that s more lightweight than xml and that directly integrates with javascript s object model
803580


request	http-request
7	
ajax is no more than a fancy name for a technology that allows javascript to make http-request to a server which usually implements some handlers that produce specialized light-weight content for the javascript caller comonly encoded as json
803580


request	http-request
7	7	0	
regarding replicate the page s behavior from c# using the webrequest webresponse - what you have to realize is that like i said earlier the javascript ajax call is nothing more than an http-request
803608


model	datamodel
4	
my goal is to load the results of the rest request into a traverse-able xml datamodel which i can then grab elements and their values from
804265


mouse	click
4	
basically the issue is i have a flash movie which contains a text box and if the user click in the text box and drags to select highlight text and they drag outside the flash movie and release the mouse then the flash move doesn t receive the mouse release event and even though the mouse is up moving the cursor around the page continues to change the selected text within the flash
804369


asp.net	asp.net-mvc
7	
in asp.net-mvc it is even easier - you just send the program object to the view as the model object and loop through its stakeholders and outcomes in a couple of nested for loops directly on the view
804449


aspect	aspects
5	
i guess an aspects could be fired upon any c r ud operation inserting a log row in this table
804518


mouse	keyboard
5	5	
save as uses the actual href value whereas selecting the link otherwise can be intercepted keyboard mouse down and up click to set the location to something else
804589


set	any
5	8	
static initializers can be used to set the value of any static variables in a class which should be more efficient than having an if somestaticvar null do stuff block of code at the start of each constructor
804589


set	any
10	
both of these cases assume that the code required to set these variables is more complex than simply var value as otherwise there wouldn t seem to be any reason to use an initializer instead of simply setting the value when declaring the variable
804738


oracle	oracle-xe
1	
the other thing i ll mention is that unless you need the full-blown oracle just stick with oracle-xe express edition
804738


linux	unix
5	
for high end platforms linux unix tends to be preferred over windows but that s probably not an issue for you
804738


oracle	oracle-xe
1	
if you re just developing and aren t yet comfortable with oracle make it as easy on yourself as possible and stick with windows and oracle-xe
804829


beautifulsoup	lxml
0	
lxml is supposed to be much faster and efficient and can do much more than beautifulsoup
804860


javascript	dom
7	
this is because json can be directly evaluated into a javascript object which is much easier to work with than the dom
804998


elementtree	celementtree
7	
elementtree is pure python and celementtree is the faster c implementation
805063


rubygems	gem
3	
most guides seem to recommend using macports to install ruby and rubygem then using rubygem from there on to install gem
805324


authorization	authentication
5	
i know on some web sites it will take you to a paypal site for the payment authentication - can this be done over http requests instead of forcing the user to another website which won t be available from the app
805392


http	ssl
10	10	
if you have a secure ftp sftp server or secure http ssl https server then curl can accept ssh keys although using an ssl key is more commonly accepted on the internet. it can use those keys to authenticate and establish a secure connection to the directories which have been made public to your user through the server
805431


margin	margins
0	
incidentally rather than setting the text width tw to some number of characters smaller than your window you could instead set the margins you want to leave on the right side of the window like so
805497


jquery	scriptaculous
0	0	
why does everyone like jquery more than prototype scriptaculous or mootools or whatever
805740


aspect	aspects
5	
you can for instance use a compile-time weaver like postsharp and create an aspects that can be applied to properties
805852


decrement	increment

this makes decrement loops more efficient than increment ones
805895


cookies	session-cookies

xsd	xml
5	
can anyone give me some advice on how i can validate marshalled xml to make sure it conforms to the xsd schema
806004


c++	python
7	
python has much better web tools and frameworks than c++ and its regex handling and standard libraries urllib email etc work very well
806037


c++	python
0	0	
using c++ is likely to result in a radically faster application than php perl or python and somewhat faster than c# or java - unless it spends most of its time waiting for the db in which case there won t be a difference
806055


inner-join	join
0	
left join are slower than inner-join though this is dependent on what you re doing exactly - can you accomplish what you re looking for with inner-join
806135


stl	boost
1	
with arrival of stl and development of boost parsing text happened to be extremely easy with c++
806151


md5	hash
5	
the hash is meant to be used for caching so i was thinking of md5 or sha1
806181


c++	python
7	
having a fastcgi web application no matter c++ php perl python ruby etc. gives you better initial startup time than a cgi application
806249

1	
as flexible as this solution is it requires a very deep knowledge of gtk cairo and everything else involved
806888


asp.net	asp.net-mvc
10	
asp.net-mvc which is way better both in terms of oop design and in terms of graphical informational design
806915

if you are stuck to nant try a nightly build if not i recommend msbuild for .net 2+ and 64 bit machines
807269


set	any
5	
when is set the webresource.axd handler will automatically set a long cache policy on resources retrieved via it so that the resource is only downloaded once to the client and cached there forever it will also be cached on any intermediate proxy servers
807317


command-line	cmd
5	
i don t know what equivalent to org.eclipse.jdt.core.jdtcompileradapter should be used for building outside of eclipse on the cmd-line
807323


atomicity	atomic
0	
this uses the knowledge that space precedes any digit in the ascii latin-1 unicode sort sequence and that atomicity numbers are not more than 3 digits
807323


numeric	digits
0	
assuming membercount is a numeric column and the values are not more than 4 digits long adjust appropriately if they are longer the query can be written
807387

if the memory is to be released by free in your or someone elses code it s pretty darn required to use malloc
808326


reflection	runtime
5	
in c# i ve found problems that couldn t be solved without reflection because of information i didn t have until runtime
808326


reflection	runtime
5	
one example when trying to manipulate some third-party code that generated proxies to silverlight objects running in another process i had to use reflection to invoke a specific strongly-typed generic version of a method because the marshalling required the caller to make an assumption about the type of the object in the other process was in order to extract the data we needed from it and c# doesn t allow the type of the generic method invocation to be specified at runtime except with reflection techniques
808342


extends	sealed
5	
this pattern would also be useful in the event that you want to extends a 3rd party s picturebox that is sealed in which case you would not be abel to extends from it
808569


reset	default
5	
the deselection .selected false was included to deselect the listviewitem in the .items collection just in case it may have been selected by default and thereforesetting it to true would have no effect
808716


request	http-request
10	
serve static content on a different domain or sub domain this allows more simultaneous http-request

silverlight is another possibility but there are quite major differences between wpf and silverlight and turning a wpf application into a silverlight application requires more rewriting than one might initially think
809544


asp.net-mvc	webforms
1	
it s certainly different than webforms -- and knowing webforms can actually be a hindrance in learning asp.net-mvc -- but i m not planning to go back
809797


quirks-mode	doctype
5	
if you don t have a proper doctype on your page it will be rendered in quirks-mode in ie which means that it uses an incorrect box model where the padding is not added to the size of the element
809842


security	web-services
5	
anyhow how would i given an account name of the format domain user find the relevant number for thier lookup id in the security of the site using only the web-services
810193


multiplication	addition
7	0	
well we know it is the first one because of precedence - the binary multiplication operator has higher precedence than the binary + addition operator and is resolved first
810491


editor	text-editor
4	
also the following topic appears to be related what s a windows text-editor that matches this criteria
810558


output	user-input
10	0	
mvp is a more modern variation of mvc that fits in better with environments such as windows where the view does user-input and output
810657


int	unsigned-integer
5	
the fact that i m using floats shouldn t matter since they can be considered as unsigned int after inverting the sign bit
810798


ref	out
4	
if you want to send a value in and out of the method one would choose ref
810922


asp.net-mvc	webforms
3	
personally i would recommend using asp.net-mvc as it is more intuiative and you have more control over your pages than with webforms
810947


asp.net	asp.net-mvc
7	
however there s no doubt in my mind that asp.net-mvc is the better option and you should use it as the default option for all future development
811147


line	lines
0	
i m sure it d turn into more than 10 line of code but have you considered a form based app where pressing the buttons does things like changing the colour of the background or changes the size of the text
811157


firefox	safari
7	
silverlight requires only the silverlight player which is available for ie firefox and safari and works on windows and osx and is much smaller than the full .net framework in terms of download size
811176


line	lines
5	
to go a step further that two line script can also be written in python though it takes eight lines still under the 10 line goal
811362


line	lines
5	
little play algorithms like minimax game tree search can be done in like three line
811801


haskell	sml
0	
i like using haskell much more than sml but i would still teach sml first
811801


haskell	sml
7	7	0	
because sml is eagerly evaluated the execution model is far easier to comprehend and debugging via printf works a lot better than in haskell
811820


iteration	elements
0	
in the next iteration you want the m-l-1 th elements of the n-l-1 floats that are bigger than the pivot
811937


testng	junit
7	
testng is much friendlier to this paradigm than junit though
812007


firebird	mysql
7	0	
i migrate from access to firebird very easily i think firebird is better than mysqlfor delphi
812035


integer	unsigned
0	
i ve now changed the methods to take and return uint unsigned 32-bit integer instead - this is also in greater accordance with the c++ rotl and rotr functions
812233


triggers	insert
5	
my question is is there some way i can be notified in java preferably including the data that changed by the database when a record is updated deleted insert using some sort of triggers semantics
812361


version-control	git
4	
i recommend git and subversion svn both as free open-source version-control systems that work very well
812468


while-loop	loops
3	
i would recommend reworking this to be based off a timer so it runs repeatedly on regular intervals instead of locked into a while-loops
812592


bazaar	git
0	
i use bazaar so this might be a slightly different answer than a git user would give but
812692


line	lines
5	
each api call can be hundred of line of code
813082


operators	parentheses
7	7	0	
we had to insert parentheses because the subscript operators binds better than the dereference operators and it would otherwise be read as which isn t what we want
813172


line	lines
0	
sorry that it is more than 10 line
813442


line	lines
0	
the database contains no more than 50 line of data in all entities it s a new project so it s not waiting on data
813458


output	cat
10	
the output of ls | cat which is significantly faster might not be enough because that one cannot distinguish files from directories
813574


integration	business-process
10	
if there s really a high chance of wasted work by user integration it s better to prevent it through the design of the business-process rather than database locks
813626


ruby	python
4	
java c perl python ruby php i prefer python but are there performance concerns
813646


haskell	sml
4	
much as i love haskell here are the reasons i would prefer sml for a class in discrete math and data structures and most other beginners classes
813872


solid-principles	principles
1	
there are good principles out there such as solid-principles that will allow you to design and build good meaningful classes
813941


pointers	double-pointer
5	
i feel that a double-pointers for the target string should be passed to this function which will be like passing the address of the pointers variable and not the pointers itself
813984


doc	rtf
7	0	
if the latter is what you want you could use rtf which is somewhat easier than the doc format
814049


line	lines
4	
based on your summary i had it match any group of 6 digits followed by any length of whitespace including new line then followed by an l and 7 digits
814134


asp.net	asp.net-mvc
7	0	
if you re silverlight solution is basic in terms of implementation - ie datagrid of data only - then asp.net-mvc is a better fit as this way you re not having to worry about deep linking etc as that comes free inside a native html based approach
814260


web-inspector	inspector
3	
i d recommend getting safari 4 public beta which has a brand new web-inspector that allows you to edit the dom real-time i m not sure whether you can actually edit a css file with it however
814333


line	lines
0	
it must be a property that prohibits adding text with more than x line but i can t see it
814342


required	checked
5	
of course you could change your pre-processor checked to be normal code checked which can obviously be switched as required
814350


line	lines
0	
it must be a property that prohibits adding text with more than x line but i can t see it
814462


buffering	streaming
4	
for transferring mass data i would usually recommend either just a stored procedure if the processing can be done in the database - or if you need richer code something like sqlbulkcopy hooked to an idatareader - this will allow you to streaming data from one table to the other with the minimum of buffering overhead
814612


vim	emacs
5	
if you install and use either of vim or emacs you will have a text editor that can be used on any major platform now and in the future and most of the minor ones too
814673


controllers	controller
4	
system.invalidoperationexception value name controllers does not match any of the values
814704


controllers	controller
7	
i m struggling to create a table view controllers that has anything more than just a table view in it
814764


delphi	vb.net
5	
this can be done with any language which supports com delphi vb6 vb.net c# c++ ...
814811


actionscript	mxml
10	10	
i would say pure actionscript is better for programming whether you use flash ide or flex ide is not that relevant and mxml is better for non-programmers to combine the components programmed in as
814865


tree	nodes
0	
an m-way tree can have more than one value per nodes but the theory is still the same
815127


arrays	loops
0	
sure - make options an arrays of strings and use .join rather than every time through loops
815390


ruby	python
1	
i am not familiar with python sorry ruby guy typing here however you could try a few things
815397


linq	linq-to-sql
10	
another problem linq-to-sql is more poco class linq to entities is too complex
815453


linq	linq-to-sql
8	
linq to entities the entity framework is a lot more complex than linq-to-sql - but it s more complex because it allows a lot more flexibility
815472


windows-server	windows
5	
a wikipedia link on ntfs symbolic links says the ntrights.exe tool that comes in windows-server 2003 resource kit tools can be used to grant this right on home edition
816329


droppable	draggable
5	
for example i used it to bind draggable and droppable to some dom elements which will be added through ajax
817265


constructor	copy-constructor
5	
in c++ the same could be done for copy-constructor and assignment operators
817278


subclass	subclassing
5	
this approach is a lot more brittle since the junit4 internal runners are unstable and can be changed from release to release but it has the advantage of being able to be inherited down a class hierarchy and be overridden in a subclassing
817327


xslt	xquery
4	2	
i use and recommend xquery over xslt
817674


command-line	cmd
3	
i would recommend using gcc and getting comfortable with the cmd-line if you plan on doing c for any extended amount of time
817690


cell	cells
4	
i want to be able to not only select rows and columns but also select cell in a diagonal direction
817728


updates	updating
5	
so in an example with multiple threads updating and reading a you won t ever be able to guarantee that the a you re reading is the same value as what you updates from some other thread may have changed the value
817976


listener	listeners
5	
now have a list of listener that will be notified on locale change by the first method
818226


processor	processors
5	
can mysql 5.4 beta be compiled for 32-bit processor under linux
818360


extraction	strip
5	
my app reads frames from video using pyglet extraction a strip region - full width by 1 to 6 video lines then pastes each strip appends it into an image that can later be written out an .png file
818424


datamapper	activerecord
4	
i d recommend datamapper for orm not only it s way faster than activerecord but it s also very modularly built and plugins are actual gems that you can easily install
818548


webrequest	httpwebrequest
2	
i set a break point at the first line above but for some reason i lose it after webrequest httpwebrequest webrequest.create server
818595


asp.net	asp.net-mvc
7	
if you start a new project then asp.net-mvc is a better choice
818604


tcp-ip	tcp
4	
in my install you select select enabled protocols then tcp-ip and properties
819029


jquery	dojo
4	1	
i recommend dojo -- i realize it s not quite as popular as jquery number of hits on google dojo 13 millions jquery 13.4 -- but it is better architected and designed
819423


cell	cells
2	
the copy paste works ok if the cells are continuos but if i select with ctrl the first and the third cell when i paste it to the textbox it will paste also the 2nd cell
819708


delphi	c++
5	
the resolution sholud be winapi no .net only as various languages can be used eg c++ delphi
819835


aspect	aspects
7	
a line of inheritance usually goes from the most common and general aspects all the way down to a point where it makes no more sense to be more specific
819850


decimal-point	digits
0	
1 i want to check if the amount has more than 2 digits after the decimal-point
819893


spring	wicket
4	
i prefer wicket with a twist of spring quartz etc. over all of the others
820018


.net	codedom
5	
does anyone know whether it is possible theoretically or in reality to use the codedom that seems to be provided in delphi s .net counterpart
820296


wordpress	wordpress-plugin
0	
if anyone would like to help develop a wordpress-plugin or class to do this i would be more than happy to have you on board
820503


category	categories
5	
however there are some items in the database that are not so sensitive lets say a list of categories that i want to be dynamic...i may then have users with admin privileges be allowed to add and delete a category and the delete could be permanent
820547


expression-blend	blend
8	
for those of you who are working with more complex applications with expression-blend what are your strategies for keeping your projects decoupled in an mvvm way yet at the same time structured in the expression-blend way where you can still see and edit whole parts of your application in a way that makes sense visually so that you can continue to edit them in the blend gui as they scale
820591


aspect	aspects
5	
i also thought about aspects programming insert tracing code in before and after methods but i don t think aspects programming could be allowed inside this project
820629


upgrade	versioning
5	
they will be forced to upgrade or maintain parrallel versioning of the project file
820701


aspect	aspects
4	
i recommend ironpython -- among its advantages is the excellent book ironpython in action which will lead you through every important aspects including testing
820744


openmpi	mpich
1	
openmp works in a fairly different way than message-passing libraries openmp uses multiple threads within the same process but mpich and openmpi use multiple processes
820791


doc	rtf
5	
i think i can use the rtf generation to create a doc-readable file that can then be edited using doc and re-saved
821290


sql-server	oracle
10	
another programmer suggested using decode in oracle or case statements in sql-server but this is a more general solution
821347


selected	button
5	
in my program after clicking on the button - selected listview entries should be copied to richtextbox
821670


datediff	date-difference
7	
this is a better solution because it correctly treats the datedifference as a time period measured in days or seconds in the case of the related time class since the event
822049


controllers	controller
0	
and therefore mvc for the web at least as regards interaction between client and server should be less complex with the controllers merely mediating between the client and server
822194


atomicity	atomic
0	
in addition to what s already been said about threadsafeness non-atomicity properties are faster than atomicity accessors
822456


types	strong-typing
7	
i know it s probably not as compact as you would like but what s needed to reduce this down effectively yet still retain the strong-typing is higher order generic typess called types classes in haskell a way of indicating that types parameters are themselves generic and can take types parameters
822666


storage	capacity
0	
in v6 the capacity was added to connect to non-openedge databases and in v8 to create openedge databases of more than one storage area
823007


linq	linq-to-sql
5	
local sequence cannot be used in linq-to-sql implementation of query operators except the
823226


c++	python
5	
several languages such as python can be embedded into c++ so that may be an option
823313


linq	linq-to-sql
5	
isn t there a simple way to tell linq-to-sql classes that a particular datetime property should be considered as utc having the kind property of the datetime type to be utc by default or is there a clean workaround
823371


http	https
1	
subversion works just fine over http https
823715


http-post	post
5	
if you are referring to a http-post only a post initiated it can also be initiated by javascript by a submit button from within the form will be posted to the server
824049


output	mode
5	
merely opening the ofstream in binary mode does not change the way that the operators work - they will always perfform formatted output
824241


version-control	git
1	
the consequence of that design for user is that importing existing sources into version-control is as simple as git init git add
824689


contains	any
4	
this will select rows where the labels fieldcontains any of the words in the criteria search string
824791


perl	php
8	
i find php a more disciplined and therefore sometimes more limiting language than perl
824870


mbunit	cruisecontrol.net
3	
that said if you are using only visual studio and will be doing ci builds using cruisecontrol.net or teamcity i d recommend using mbunit or nunit.net
824900


order	join
10	10	
typically when query cost gets order of magnitude more expensive it is because a loop or merge join is being used where a hash join is more appropriate
825100


specifications	w3c
5	
i ve looked at the w3c s html specifications and while they are very precise with what attributes can be used with elements and also some behavioural stuff such as exactly what gets included with form submission there s nothing about the behaviour of elements
825103


perl	php
0	
perl has massive frameworks available on cpan which can make it work as well or better than php even in a purely cgi environment
825203


32-bit	64bit
10	
this is somewhat crude but basically tells you whether the clr is running as 32-bit or 64bit which is more likely what you would need to know
825675


set	any
0	
are there any standardised set of diagrams or mathematical symbols used in the design of functional programs or are such programs best designed in short functional-pseudo code given that functions will be much shorter than imperative counterparts
825695


procedural	procedural-programming
0	
diagrams aren t as necessary because functional programming is somewhat simpler than procedural-programming
825920


line	lines
4	
this link is a nice tutorial on using regex to match line in a file using c#
826006


cell	cells
5	
this can be used with either div tags or table cell
826059


asp.net	asp.net-mvc
2	
if leveraging existing community is very important to you and or your project then i do recommend going with asp.net-mvc
826173


visitor	visitor-pattern
5	
i m not sure what could be accomplished with this approach that couldn t more easily be accomplished with the visitor-pattern as drew noted
826459


ref	out
5	
then you have a endxxx method which takes the iasyncresult returned by the beginxxx operation plus any ref and out arguments which is invoked when the call is to be completed either after callback waiting on event in the iasyncresult or by blocking
826616


abstract-methods	virtual-method
5	
the class itself can be marked abstract but all methods should be empty virtual-methods not abstract-methods
827594


haskell	ocaml
7	
haskell has fewer industrial users than ocaml and although it does have multicore support it is still being developed in a very unproductive direction
827826


constructor	copy-constructor
7	
firstly a copy-constructor is nothing more than
827859


ocaml	sml
5	
sml ocaml f# and haskell allow closed sealed algebraic types to be defined to strengthen static typing by conveying more specific constraints implicitly
827958


line	lines
1	
or if that seems like overkill or too difficult with bash tools you could have a heuristic of reading only 5 of the line 1 in every 20 to quickly get a close to exact answer and then refining that if desired
828233


base-class	subclassing
5	
2 sorting a list of base-class pointers where some of the objects may be derived subclassing you only have access to the base-class fields
828282


sine	cosine
8	
also hard coding a lookup table for say sine cosine values would probably be a lot more efficient than loading it from a file. but hard coding data purely for the sake of convenience is not a smart idea
828398


binary-tree	tree
5	
binary-tree can be created using dynamic arrays in which for each element in index n
828631


sqldatareader	sqlconnection
4	
it s much more difficult in 2.0 until you get your rythym down as previous poster i d recommend sqlconnection and sqldatareader etc
828695


having	select
4	
also having a serarate mysql user for your php scripts that can only select insert update and delete is probably a good idea.
828847


eclipse-rcp	rcp
4	
i would also recommend eclipse-rcp or have a look at netbeans rcp
829455


packets	packet
1	
is there anyway perhaps other than iptables rules to drop this packets before it is seen by libpcap tcpdump
829670


key	key-value
5	
but i want that when i press key the key-values should be displayed in toolbar textfield
829739


svn	visualsvn
4	
i also strongly recommend visualsvn server to setup your svn repository
829742


cell	cells
0	
consolidate some cell to have more than one row if you have a start date and end date put the start date on top and the end date on the bottom
829771


cvs	git
7	0	
in my opinion besides the endless git is better than subversion is better than cvs -discussion i don t think the differences between them is what matters
830314


project	project-management
7	
it might seem that the decision whether to invest into the scaffolding can be determined as the project-management science would have it by a simple cost-benefit analysis estimate the development cost compare to predicted benefits and if the value of scaffolding is greater than the cost there is a good point in building it
830581


linq	linq-to-sql
8	
is linq to entities more difficult than linq-to-sql
830592


backwards-compatibility	compatibility
7	0	
and the only reason i don t choose nullable types more often is the itchy feeling in the back of my head that makes me feel like it s more than backwards-compatibility that forces that extra
830676


line	lines
0	
however it will only highlight the characters that exceed the width and then only on line that are actually longer than the width
830718


line	lines
4	
the second reason is that you are attempting to match b at the end of a line and your test string only has one line that matches this requirement the first two lines end with
830892


ironpython	cpython
4	
for example cpython beats ironpython hands down start up time
831093


subclass	subclassing
5	
alternatively is the pattern of use wrong - it would be straightforward to subclassing the controller again to distinguish between the two and retain common code if that is a more appropriate solution
831132


for-loop	loops
0	
nesting another if then else inside a for-loops is actually harder to read and maintain later than a nice simple goto with a comment on the goto line saying something like read as continue for
831545


tcp-ip	tcp
5	
tcp-ip i get the message this version of microsoft sql server management studio can only be used to connect to sql server 2000 and sql server 2005 servers
831613


arrays	dictionary
10	
i wouldn t expect there to be a case in which the arrays search is faster than the dictionary lookup though
831623


xom	dom4j
0	
i like xom more than dom4j for its simplicity and correctness
831741


serialization	serializable
5	
the javascriptserializer doesn t require classes to be marked as serialization or as datacontract but the datacontractjsonserializer does
832134


mobile-safari	safari
1	
i haven t done very much with this sort of thing but i have seen differences between desktop and mobile-safari how do i make an element scale down to nothing using a css transition on the iphone
832168


tree	nodes
4	
then in a few lines you can parse your xhtml into a dom tree and reach down to pick out the list s nodes and do whatever you like with it
832226


glibc	glib
5	
if you compile with the highest optimization settings memcpy and memcmp might be replaced with intrinsics by the compiler and never call glib at all
832229


php	ruby
7	7	
shared hosting is stronger in ruby than java and since you excluded php which is hugely popular in shared hosting that one is going to lean you in ruby s direction
832269


uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller
5	
uiviewcontroller can be grouped by uinavigationcontroller or uitabcontroller both of which add navigation elements to navigate between different uiviewcontroller
832444


contains	any
4	
this will match any strings in which finger or knuckle are contains
832686


arrays	loops
5	
iterating over such an arrays would be done using nested for-loops and if you want to perform certain calculations on a per-dimension base you should alter the order of the loops accordingly
832714


tcp-ip	tcp
0	
varies per system and named pipes are slower than tcp-ip in many
832749


processor	processors
5	
leave requestcontext out altogether to not run any context processor
833633


expression-blend	blend
5	
mvvm base application that can be edited with expression-blend and visual studio
833669


trace	debugging
5	
i would expect console.out to be used when writing or debugging your tests whereas trace would be used to display trace output from the code under test
833873


arrays	loops
7	
i think that this is clearer than trying to write a loops for the variable names especially for the number of arrays you are maintaining
834032


adapter	adaptor
5	
your wifi adaptor may also have specific apps for creating the initial network device this is the case with madwifi which will create an athx x is numeric device which can be controlled be ifconfig and iwconfig
834161


ado	jet
10	0	0	
if more than one table the view trick doesn t extend beyond two tables afaik so you may just have to live with the poor performance or change technology dao is reported faster than ado sql server may be faster than ace jet etc
834674


alpha	alpha-transparency
7	
this is much older that alpha-transparency - think about a clock application you can make your window circular if you wanted even on windows 95
834777


aspect	aspects
1	
the other aspects to this is that javascript is sometimes used defensively against bots scrapers malware like keysniffers and so on etc for both your security and that of the site
835296


nsoperationqueue	nsoperation
5	
nsoperation and nsoperationqueue can be used for this
835390


value	field
5	
the date value from the text field can be fetched by jquery s .val method like
835479


oracle	oracle-xe
1	
if you are very familiar with oracle-xe you may want to use it but i would like to point out the following reasons for not using oracle
835479


sql-server	oracle
0	7	
oracle licenses are the most expensive in the business sql express might be better as sql-server is cheaper
835573


command-line	cmd
0	
it doesn t get much easier than using getopt to parse cmd-line parameters in c c++
835604


decode	encode
7	0	
is there away to do this that is better than having to html decode the string truncate and encode again
836075


controllers	controller
5	
all the actions of the controllers would be called from javascript
836137


google-chrome	firefox
1	
in the meanwhile i still stick with firefox over google-chrome for the simple reason that firefox is i non-profit and has a ii huge addon community
836586


stderr	stdout
5	
error messages should be written to stderr aka console.error and normal output to stdout aka console.out
836756


compression	streaming

these streaming support compression levels and deliver much better performance than the built-in classes
836824


environment	configuration
5	
typically i define my database connections in a configuration file which can easily be changed between environment development stage production
836856


addition	division
10	10	
also addition is faster than multiplication and multiplication is faster than division
836858


line	lines
10	
you might want to try the closest function- it sounds like it s more along the line of what you are trying to do
837492


sql-server	sql-server-express
7	
sql-server express is free faster and more capable .
837505


line	lines
5	
i m sure that someone must have done this since it is a very weird choice on behalf of the developer not to draw these line
837695


text-rendering	gdi
10	
the latter uses gdi which is more modern in terms of text-rendering
837831


asp.net-mvc	webforms
5	
the way i see it asp.net-mvc can be achieved in webforms by not including the runat in the form tag
837953


dedicated	dedicated-server
7	
i am not sure how much traffic that your ssrs can generate but i truly believe that a dedicated-server with 4gb ram is much more than enough to just handle 100 concurrent users
837976


time	subtract
5	
no matter what every ace should be counted to sum value as 11 then when the total sum has reached over 21 subtract 10 from hand but the thing is you must make sure you keep a count of how many time you subtract 10 and how many time you add 11 an ace
838009


tree	nodes
7	
as others note though most of the time it s easier just to traverse the tree directly as linkednodes
838300


hashmap	map
0	
a ternary trie may be faster than a hashmap for a smaller number of elements
838416


lan	wan
10	
svn is faster because it was meant for wan as opposed to vss which is for lan
838616


equals	tostring
5	
it could be done via reflection as some libraries already create the tostring orequals methods
838963


conventions	naming-conventions
1	
naming-conventions are not for the compiler to process the computer does not really mind names but rather for the programmer that is browsing the code to have as much information as possible with as little effort as required
839048


temporary	copy
5	
a similar structure might be used per line temporary when editing that line so you don t perform a copy on each key-press
839116


time	subtract
4	
if you need to compare add and or subtract time only values think about the possibility to use a int to store the time value and then to convert it to char when displaying the result
839169


set	any
7	
in order to stop any words wrapping i have to set letter spacing to 1px for example but this then causes the larger words to have a much bigger movie than they need and as the nav is horizontal this pushes the next item too far over to the right
839324


fgets	puts
5	
the functions fgets and puts aren t intended to be used with binary data like image files
839381


environment	building
10	
this is even more elegant because you can theoretically generate infrastructure for any supported building environment thus you are not bound to one specific ide and settings in the helper infrastructure paths etc. don t need to duplicate the main project settings
839545


asp.net	.net
5	
this will be developed in asp.net webforms c# .net 3.5
839620


json	xml
10	0	0	
you may want to consider json as the data protocol as the jquery library is far more accessible to developers and the time to productivity with the framework is far less than with xslt embedded javascript in tags awful syntax and all the other minutia that come with xml xpath xslt on the front end
839658


asp.net-mvc	webforms
0	
asp.net-mvc gives you a lot more control over your markup than plain-old webforms so it should be ideal for this
839664


subclass	subclassing
7	
for my understanding the superclass is always smaller less complex then the subclassing
839738


jquery	scriptaculous
5	
most commonly this can be accomplished using any popular javascript library such as jquery or prototype scriptaculous
839741


subclass	subclassing
0	
you are right about the fact that the subclassing will often take more space than the parent class
839832


sql-server	mysql
10	
plus sql-server 2005+ is way better than mysqlfor serious db stuff
840061


asp.net	.net
0	
i m the php guy that also does .net that is going to say all things being equal programmer skill with the chosen platform hardware bandwith etc. asp.net with sqlserver is going to be faster than php with mysql at runtime
840160


http	https
7	7	
checkout this guys answer wcf sessions with http
840161


for-loop	loops
7	0	
now within this for-loops you can see that elements are added until the total elements height +offset is greater than the listbox itself
840495


excel	worksheet
5	
within excel this would be accomplished by copying the worksheet to a new workbook not by creating a new workbook then adding the worksheet to it
840537


login	authentication
5	
in order to not have to prompt the user for a username and password every time they launch the application we will expose a login service that validates their username and password on initial launch and returns an authentication token that can be used for future web service requests for real data
840569


while-loop	loops
0	
i could write this easily with a while-loops but i would prefer not to use a while-loops because the real world application will have a lot more data than four records and will by called by multiple users many times per day
840648


arrays	linked-list
4	
so we can t flatly say that linked-lists always beat arrays for insert delete options
840730


svn2git	git-svn
0	
using svn2git might produce better results than git-svn if you have tags or branches.
842089


subclass	subclassing
5	
you should use inheritance when subclassing is-a super class both structurally and functionally when it can be used as superclass and you are going to use that
842225


request	http-request
5	
chunked can be used to send a http-request or response in multiple parts and send one part while subsequent parts are not available
842251


binary-tree	tree
0	
for most objects with simple comparisons a quick sort on 10 items will not be noticiably faster than a bubble sort a linear search on 100 items will probably be faster than a binary-tree and so on
842360


ruby	python
10	
there is a very good reason to use regular expressions in scripting languages such as ruby python perl javascript and lua parsing a string with carefully optimized regular expression executes faster than the equivalent custom while loop which scans the string character-by-character
842413


php	ruby
4	
there are many php frameworks so a lot of the issues of speed of coding diminish if not disappear altogether if you compare ruby on rails to php + some framework or frameworks with which you re equally familiar
842413


php	ruby
10	
ruby is slanted twoards prototype being integrated and the like whereas php is more open to any javascript framework which has advantages and disadvantages and both can do whatever in html and css
842512


perl	python
5	
and of course this splitting can be done with any of the standard text processing tools in unix perl python awk head tail combo
843250


selected	button
10	
even though the user experience may not be quite as nice the selected with a button degrades more gracefully both when the user does not have javascript and when the user is using accessibility technology
843324


inner-join	join
10	
otherwise you could use inner-join makes query more readable
843416


environment	configuration
0	
added bonus is that the user can execute groovy code to compute their configuration options much better over using properties files as well as being able to do different environment with ease
843547


firefox	gecko
1	
i don t agree with all those answers as there is some misinformation there such as firefox being the dictator of what happens in gecko it certainly influences but is not the deciding factor
843650


turbogears	django
4	
i usually prefer turbogears but django seems to be more smooth at the moment
844169


unmanaged	managed-code
5	
i m trying to learn how to use managed unmanaged-code interop but i ve hit a wall that 4 hours of googling wasn t able to get over
844432


decode	encode
5	
some of the data appears to have been encode as cp-1252 and not decode as such before being encode as utf-8 and stored in mysql
844454


spring	jsf
0	
to me jsf or spring sound like better options than struts these days
844519


tapestry	wicket
2	
beyond ones already suggested i would recommend checking out tapestry and wicket many developers like them
844570


request	http-request
5	
however in the web application everything seems to be oriented towards synchronization with the http-request
844670


private	instances
5	
it s a visibility modifier it means that instance variables declared as private can only be accessed by instances of the same class
845066


ironpython	cpython
0	
i am however no cpython guru and can get so much more out of ironpython than cpython as i can easily leverage the .net platform on which i am far more at home
845076


base-class	private-inheritance
0	0	
the standard states in 5.4.7 that c-style casts can actually do more than any sequence of new-style casts can do -- specifically including casting from a pointer-to-derived to pointer-to-base even when the base-class is inaccessible which is precisely what happens here with private-inheritance
845184


order	add
7	
also on the subject of dependencies it is probably best to drop tables first add a decode in your cursor that assigns a lower numeric value to this object type and order the cursor select by this value
845637


diagonal	weight
0	
if you want a more sensible path you need to tell the algorithm that some paths are more desirable than others effectively weight horizontal vertical as better than diagonal
845656


json	xml
0	
json is just a nice way to transmit data esp when sending to a webpage as it can be more compact than xml and javascript can parse json faster than xml since json is made for javascript
845688


conventions	naming-conventions
4	2	
there are more naming-conventions if you prefer underscores as private field prefix
845752


asp.net	asp.net-mvc
4	
if i were you i would either pick spring.net or just start building your own framework around asp.net-mvc and fluent nhibernate
846033


openssl	libcurl
5	
this needs to be linked against openssl -lssl but doesn t need libcurl at all
846095


c++	python
7	0	
there are no efficiency guarantees on python res any more than on any other part of the language c++ s standard library is the only widespread language standard i know that tries to establish such standards -- but there are no standards even in c++ specifying that say multiplying two ints must take constant time or anything like that
846116


jasper-reports	itext
10	
i think that itext is still better for report creation it is more straightforward i had some less than enough experience with jasper-reports and it seemed clumsy
846158


sql-server	sql-server-express
5	
instances of the dsl can therefore be stored in sql-server express or above
846231


ruby-on-rails	django
7	0	
the number of organizations working with ruby-on-rails is greater than django
846266


ruby-on-rails	django
1	
once you re thoroughly familiar with ruby-on-rails and have been working for a bit continue learning django
846356


innodb	myisam
10	
if you re using innodb tables for acid or just because at more than 30 million rows myisam tables tend to get crappy yes a straight one-table select is probably faster than in pg
846356


postgresql	mysql
10	
as i said postgresql is far superior and i hate mucking with mysqls bizarre bugs and i think that overall postgresql performance is probably better than mysqlfor any even slightly complicated query
846682


cell	cells
4	
i know there is trick to show the whole array in the spreadsheet by selecting a range of cell with the formula + f2 + ctrl+shift+enter but i would prefer vba to handle it all
846903

yes it is absolutely possible to have more than 1 asp.net-mvc application at same windows xp machine
848005


json	xml
5	
you just need to decorate your classes or methods with the attribute and they will automatically be exposed as json or xml depending on the client
848914


line	lines
5	
the data file which should be modified contains 1500000 line each of them are 800 chars long
849233


logging	trace
10	
debug is good for logging particular occasions of something while trace is better used for dumping method calls parameters and stuff like this
849645


windows-server	windows
5	
this can be done either with hardware or software os x linux windows-server etc
849746


controllers	controller
5	
however for my project i really need this error to be handled just like it is when a method is missing from the controllers class
850011


model	datamodel
4	
the easiest way to get the declaration and implementation right is to select the attributes in the datamodeler and choose copy objective-c 2.0 method declarations to clipboard from the design- datamodel menu the paste into your implementing classes .h file
850029


login	authentication
5	
some pages need to be excluded from authentication and authorisation checks such as the login page
850062


unmanaged	native-code
5	
i ve set it so that i can debug managed and unmanaged native-code as well as debug not my code but those settings don t seem to matter
850126


arguments	default
5	
the default constructor is the one that can be called without any arguments if there is one
850434


project	project-management
5	
the other approach could be the use of google email docs and calendar - a free friendly way of team interaction....i would shy away from issue bug tracking tools for project-management - they tend to have differ on focus pm tools on the entire project resource timeline and issue tracking tools for specific entered issues..
851210


min	max
7	
and during sometime i have a range where min and max is less than 1 and greater than 0
851385


processor	processors
0	0	
for what it s worth my recollection is that many developers had high hopes for stx to be much faster than xslt processor
851468


strcpy	strncpy
7	
concerning the problem your printpiglatin could use the existing function strcpy or better strncpy which is safer in regards to buffer overflows
851689


line	lines
5	
i am reading path from temp.txt file which has 500 lines each line is a path for specific file to be copied to location c opencascade
851760


arguments	default
7	
the following example shows where is used in the default arguments and implies the less than operator
851887


processor	processors
0	
some extra memory or a few extra processor can sometimes be more cost-effective than development time spent optimising depending on development costs and how much optimisation you are doing obviously .
852464


nhibernate	entity-framework
4	
rather than rolling what is basically your own orm i would recommend switching to one of the established orms such as nhibernate or entity-framework
852515


asp.net	asp.net-mvc
4	
personally i d rather know everything that s happening in my applications even if that sometimes means more work which is what makes me prefer asp.net-mvc
852525


asp.net-mvc	webforms
3	
having been using webforms for a while now i would recommend trying out asp.net-mvc its a good framework and simpler to use than it seems at first
852578


xslt	xsl-fo
5	5	
i have a working version of this doing xslt for-each for lookup table but i suspect it is suboptimal and would like to know if i should have used select key cr-lookup cr instead somhow
852645


controllers	controller
4	
i can right-click a controllers action and choose add view.
852676


expression	evaluation
5	
the first part of the boolean expression will evaluate to false and the call to method will thus not be attempted since evaluation the second part is redundant
853643


json	xml
0	
json keeps things compact and can be faster than xml
853656


security	web-services
5	
in point-to-point situations confidentiality and data integrity can also be enforced on web-services through the use of transport layer security tls for example by sending messages over https
853732


http	https
0	7	0	
so ws-security offers more protection than http would and soap offers a richer api than rest
854149


line	lines
7	0	
so when you see a class that imports most of the available namespace has 30 000 line and has more commits than the rest of the codebase combined chances are you re looking at a god object

tiled	tile
5	
theres no need for the technique to be restricted to zooming in and out of tile images
854658


widget	button
5	
when a user cklicks on the button i want a new window to be opened the window is a form with text areas buttons and other swt widget
855027


php	python
1	
i am very familiar with php and python and have written some websites in them
855465


sequence	numbers
0	
appending is o 1 amortized constant complexity however inserting into deleting from the middle of the sequence will require an o n linear complexity reordering which will get slower as the numbers of elements in your list
855794


set	any
5	
any portability to another os instruction set is lost and must be recompiled to execute
855864


set	any
5	
if a request in a session could be handled by any node then that would imply that you have all-to-all replication set up in the cluster meaning the session data of node1 is replcated to node2 node3 ... node n the session data of node2 is replicated to node1 node3 .
856020


asp.net-mvc	webforms
7	0	
you should use asp.net-mvc because you have a lot of more control about the generated client code than in webforms and is simpler than ashx handlers
856343


.net	wcf

5	
you have to create a blackberry archive or libs project or whatever it s called and add your libs to that then reference it from your application project
856536


windows-xp	windows
0	
in conclusion i believe that you would be better of with windows-xp embedded boards
856580


having	select
5	
vladiator s solution can be shortened by having the first part select records present in both and only in the first table and then adding those only present in the second table
857034


multiplication	addition
10	
this will allow you for example to do vector addition and matrix multiplication and for large arrays it is much faster than python lists
857124

according to what actionurl returned response can be an xml document a json object text etc.
857807


linq	linq-to-sql

is there any way to get linq-to-sql to issue one sql statement and use known types
857966


ruby	python
5	
yes there is a lot of awful php code out there but you know it was mostly written by people who would have written awful ruby or awful python
858289


decode	encode
7	0	
feedback means that you re not using echo cancellation line and or acoustic depending on whether it s working as a speakerphone or not or if you are the delay in your system jitter buffers network encode decode etc is greater than the echo canceller can handle
858352


sequence	numbers
5	
if neither column will ever be involved in any mathematical operations make them char or varchar as you will be dealing with a sequence of characters not numbers
858731


downcasting	downcast
5	
in order to assign it to a variable either you have to use the highest level type it could be list in this case or downcasting if you know it must be an arraylist
858827


default-value	default
5	
since you haven t specified a height for the body element it has its default-value of auto
859174


command-line	cmd
5	
since the iphone shouldn t really be used for processor intensive things such as audio conversion have you thought about transferring those files to your computer and running the conversion there using the cmd-line tool you mentioned
859317


php	ruby
7	0	
the choice to write rails in ruby isn t an indication that ruby is better than php which many could argue
859324


controllers	controller
10	
at the point that the form is submitted to the controllers the command object is no longer a new object but a persisted object that needs to be updated

upgrade	versioning
4	
bear in mind that you can buy upgrade editions of vs and upgrade from the express versioning or even eclipse
859820


atomicity	atomic
0	
in practice you can assume that int and other integer types no longer than int are atomicity
859923


glibc	glib
7	
also sctp support in glib is less than ideal in other words non-present -- you must use the libraries from lksctp and it s not entirely well-integrated into the normal sockets api
859995


cell	cells
4	
it will just match any letter-number sequence and ignores a 1 and a1 types of cell
860283


inner-join	join

i have an existing asp.net application that talks to load balanced wcf services iis hosted in-app pool running under account configured as serviceprincipalname etc.
861096


controllers	controller
10	
to me this looks more like a supervising controllers than classic mvc
861111


pre-increment	post-increment
5	
in c++ ++x is to be preferred over x++ because for classes with overloaded operators best practice is for post-increment to be implemented in terms of the pre-increment
861123


pre-increment	post-increment
10	8	
pre-increment is more efficient than post-increment because for post-increment the object must increment itself and then return a temporary containing its old value
861296


set	any
5	
i understand that only one instance of any object according to .equals is allowed in a set and that you shouldn t need to get an object from the set if you already have an equivalent object but i would still like to have a .get method that returns the actual instance of the object in the set or null given an equivalent object as a parameter
861800


set	contains
4	
i have some problem where i set 2 floated div elements one of div contains select element when the page loaded the divs didn t have the problem but as soon i click on of the element s on select box the div that positioned in right shift to bottom
861889


calloc	realloc
7	
c++ has stricter type checking so you might need to add a cast to each call to malloc realloc calloc
861906


global-variables	call
5	
also if main or another function call itself the local variables will be copied but global-variables will not
861962


set	any
0	
imho an advanced option for your user to set the connectiontimeout value would be better than any constant value you determine
862005


packets	packet

i have more familiarity with wxwidgets though its design is heavily geared towards the windows mfc paradigm of application design

union	union-all
7	0	
since those appear to be mutually exclusive statements in the unions i would suggest that union-all is a better choice than union
863578


arrays	linked-list
7	
now i know that arrays implementaion is easier than i thought but still i dont know how to implement the same using linked-lists
864277


login	authentication
5	
it seems technically possible in that when a user tried to login to outside.com through a client-side silverlight interface that the sl app could connect to the outside.com login service and be told to authentication that user against ldap.inside.com
864363


reflection	runtime
5	
reflection is useful for runtime configuration allowing parts of a system to be driven through external configuration
864659


rsa	des
0	
des code is 8 times larger than rsa
864860


boxing	equality
4	
to avoid boxing the best way to compare generics for equality is with
864942


postback	ajax
5	
i would like the state of certain things in the page loaded via ajax to be retained across postback
864978


selection	selected
0	
however you could pass in a callback function for start or selected events that cancels the selection if more than one element is selected
865810


syntax	syntax-error
5	
could be converted into this syntax-error by the preprocessor
865814


subclass	subclassing
5	
the cocoa design patterns encourage using a controller object to configure views but there s no reason why you can t subclassing like you re describing especially if you need to add functionality that can t be done any other way
865907


hide	show
5	
i think it depends on what you re planning on displaying if it s images then i d be tempted to hide them on page load and then show on hover but if it s just a block of text then i d probably be tempted in appending to the dom and then removing on hover out
865994


asp.net-mvc	webforms
4	
can asking a developer whether he prefers webforms or asp.net-mvc be a good indicator of his proficiency
866080


braces	curly-braces
10	
if construction of the real float i am assuming that since i is not really an int f may not be a float either is much more expensive than reassigning the value then the other solutions of encapsulating inside an extra pair of curly-braces to limit scope would be the best option
866179


linq	linq-to-sql
7	
also linq-to-sql has more or less been depreciated
866439


invoices	invoice
0	
kind of related to 3 you would typically see this as an invoice and payment type representation even if you don t issue invoices so that would imply that one payment could represent more than one order and vice-versa so that would imply a many to many relationship
866622


settimeout	setinterval
5	
also something similar to setinterval would be nice where it calls the callback every n seconds but that can be implemented using settimeout
866660


line	lines
0	
more than 20 line for a function is a code smell
866723


ms-access	sql-server
4	2	
given that in almost every case i choose sql-server over ms-access
866817


ruby	python
0	
try something newer such as c# ruby python and best care about design pattern and work methodology
866953


sql-server	sql-server-express
1	
this is a completely different product than sql-server express standard etc
866957


radio-button	button
4	
in future if things go haywire again head back to tools import and export settings... and this time choose import selected environment settings radio-button and next choose no just import new settings overwriting my current settings and next either choose the name of your .vssettings file from the list usually under the my settings folder or browse
867139


subclass	subclassing
5	
your dao layer and sessionfactory do not need to be adjusted except that you need to inject your subclassing of abstractroutingdatasource into the hibernate sessionfactory
867350


cocoa	carbon
7	
there are lots of ways to cause a cocoa program to execute its own code under you control carbon is harder
867388


serialization	serializable
5	
with some other databases this can be handled with serialization isolation state but at least with oracle postgre the phantom reads are prevented but as the result the table ends up with two distinct rows with same counter value
867442


getter	setter
1	
it would be nice if i could have a method which would take as a parameter method calls to setter and getter and call this for all fields but unfortunately this is not possible with java
867515


delphi	pascal
5	
- maybe this could be adjusted from php for delphi pascal
867537


profiling	debugging
5	
in some circumstances you can also use wct it s usually implmented by debuggingger s or profiling however it can be used from any code as the usual debuggingger requirement of being the thread which has the debugging port open is not a pre-requisit
867713


progress-bar	progress
5	
i think your progress-bar needs to be based on progress and not time
867917


logging	configuration
5	
how do i exclude the files that are free for view to be displayed without logging in while still maintaining the user to login for viewing other files in the same folder using just the configuration file
867980

869215


serialization	serializable
5	
if you are lucky the bouncycastle objects will be marked as serialization if not you will need some extra code
869593


value	field
0	
i want to find the first item in a sorted vector that has a field less than some value x
869712


json	xml
7	
also if you are establshing a web-services back-end is it better to use rest json vs rest xml vs soap xml...etc
869811


json	xml
7	8	
as for json vs xml obviously json is more lightweight which makes it a better candidate for the iphone generally but if your data requires a representation more complex than json can offer then go with xml
869836


contains	any
4	
this will match any string of any length that does not contains
869890


line	lines
1	
sqft makes about as much sense as line of code really.
870080


union	union-all
7	0	
also a union-all takes longer than a union distinct
870118


jquery	.post
0	
besides if you are doing anything more complex than loading some x html into an element you should probably use one of the more powerful jquery ajax methods get or .post or ajax
870443


.net	asp.net-mvc
1	
i gues i m not understanding why asp.net-mvc would be mutually exclusive with .net 3.0
870640


packaging	building
5	
there should be powerpoint and code samples to achieve automated building and packaging
870942


operators	conditional
10	
conditional operators can be made readable as multiline statements with the right indentation but if else syntax is much more familiar to most developers
870962


message	messagebox
10	
if on the other hand the assignment is done immediately before the messageboxes where the variable assignment is commented in the code above then the variables print a different value that is somewhat more like what is expected but not exactly typically the two variables are exactly the same or one is numeric when both are expected to be different alpha strings
871058


command-line	cmd
5	
it seems like there should be another way to do this but you can pass cmd to be executed as command-line parameters to cmd
871235


set	any
5	5	
any project is responsible for building and then versionning its set of files to be delivered jar war ear ...
871356


symfony	zend-framework
1	
once comfortable with php and javascript i d recommend looking at some javascript libraries such as jquery or yui and looking at the source of one you like then maybe take a look at something like the zend-framework or symfony for php
871372


union	union-all
7	0	
also a union-all takes longer than a union distinct
871716


processor	processors
0	
if you re on an iphone go libxml2 and don t look back - but if your target machine has two processor and more ram than god i d go nsxmlparser for easier to maintain code
871809


grid	gridview
5	
so when we run it then textbox should be shown in gridview and we can put value in it and my grid has 3 columns and i want to add new row in grid when i press tab on 3rd column of gridview
872076


aspect	aspects
5	5	
i ve decided that the membership would be kinda simple in this aspects that - the users would upon signing up be given a free account and would be allowed to upgrade their accounts for a set period the expiration of which they would be reset back to their basic accounts unless they choose to renew with a paid subscription
872106


asp.net	asp.net-mvc
0	
it is a lot more mature than asp.net-mvc so you shouldn t be disappointed
872214


editor	text-editor
0	
it s more than a text-editor though
872563


selection	selected
5	
note this isselectedion with replacement so the same word could be chosen every time
872580


for-loop	loops
5	
i was wondering if anyone has any prettier more economical more accurate means by which this could be done since this is being run inside of a for-loops to generate x numbers of rows defined elswhere and i d like if possible to reduce the load.
872684


arrays	loops
5	
you could create the target arrays then loops through the words determining the probability that it should be picked and replace the words in the arrays according to a random number
872808


sql-server	oracle
7	
this is probably because oracle is old older than me and sql-server is young compared to oracle
872850


sql-server	firebird
4	
i used ms sql-server in a big company i worked at a few years ago and i would choose firebird over ms sql-server
872904


set	contains
5	
we re currently building a website with a categorized mysql table contains various competences and we noticed that the nested set model would be optimized for this
872978


union	union-all
0	
note also that union-all will be much faster than union
873125


packets	packet
5	
perhaps you could require that appropriate packets filters be installed or maybe your application could install these filters itself
873234


show	next
5	
if it is show your tooltip and you d probably want to pass the mouse coordinates into the tooltip s show method instead of just passing in the textbox so that the tooltip can be positioned next to the link
873483


copy-paste	paste
0	
keep in mind that #include is nothing more than copy-paste and it happens before your program is compiled
873541


value	field
4	
onblur fires when a field loses focus while onchange fires when that field s value changes
873563


instances	destroy
5	
as long as all one of your user instances is not destroy those will retain the resource instances and so prevent it from being prematuraly deleted even though the global shared_ptr could have been destroy
873860


boost-serialization	boost
5	
many libraries have sections that need to be compiled separately like boost-serialization and program_options
873908


stax	sax
10	
if you are trying to just read in and turn the xml into an object then i would suggest stax as sax is faster than dom but too much coding stax is much nicer and you can learn more about it below
874032


malloc	calloc
0	
as to your comment on strncpy not nul-terminating the string which is true if you use calloc to allocate the string rather than malloc this won t be a problem if you allocate one byte more than you copy since calloc automatically sets all values including in this case the end to 0
874248


listbox	selected
5	
it can be an object with id and name properties so they can be accessed with listbox sselectededitem property
874350


orca	installshield
1	
i m somewhat familiar with orca the tool to manipulate .msi files as well as full blown installer applications like installshield but i would like to make this using only raw visual studio and other available open-source tools
874849


tree	children
1	
recursive ctes are ideal for very small trees but the branch operations get all children in this branch.. get very costly with deep large tree
874883


dedicated	dedicated-server
10	
if you are looking for reliable hosting or dedicated-server it is better to go for grid hosting providers such as media temple
874977


innodb	myisam
4	
for mysql performance you should probably choose myisam over innodb as the storage engine provided your definition of optimal doesn t include most reliable
875097


base-class	inherited
5	
you could make all your model types that you would pass into this partial inherited from a base-class interface that establishes the basic behavior that would be used by this partial view and accept any object of that class interface type or just have the view accept any type of object and then use reflection to base your partial view behavior off of
875110


cell	cells
5	
but when the table view is larger than the screen and cell have to be reused drawrect isn t called every time setneedsdisplay is
875432


getter	setter
5	
they as the name implies allow variables to be retrieved and set - specifically they are called getter and setter
875537


contains	any
4	
note that busexecutaservico is the class whichcontains the method enablefield for checking if the selected item matches any field on the database
875614


line	lines
0	
furthermore the code reflects a cleaner design with fewer line of code for each feature

i m not familiar with sql-server logs but i know oracle has a bunch of them and they re full of good stuff
875946


lua	python
7	0	
embedding lua is much easier than embedding python
875946


lua	python
0	
lua is about 20x smaller and simpler than python
876247


struct	typedef
5	
you seem to have forgotten to typedef the type m_data that you re using in the various methods and i don t understand why you want a separate tree_node struct rather than using the class itself
876294


http	https
5	
2 remember that all included images and files in your secure page must be loaded using http or users will see warnings about insecure contents on the page
876421


.net	compact-framework
2	
1 for gui design you can choose between c++ mfc and the .net compact-framework
876713


controllers	controller
5	
my set of ci addon s include display of menus that can be controlled via css role-bases access controll before controllers is invoked and other features
876774


delphi	pascal
10	
delphi users might want to look at free pascal s paralel implementation of libchm since a pascal solution makes it easier embeddable
877032


sorted	set
10	
for extremely small data sets which are frequently changed and or infrequently searched an un sorted list may be even faster since it avoids the overhead of doing the sort. as the data set becomes large the growth of the list s search time overshadows the fixed overhead of hashing and the hash table becomes faster
877222


line	lines
8	
simpler and still a tad more efficient than copying thousands of line from file to file write many but smaller log files
877299


line	lines
5	
you will want to save enough line in your design to divert interesting data to be inspected with external devices
878152


duplicates	elements
10	
as some time has passed since i initially wrote this answer the more disturbed recessed of my brain suggest that you could create a duplicates iframe position it below in z-space the first and when the onload event of the frame fires animate the opacity of the original iframe from 1 to 0 before removing the elements entirely
878199


collections	observablecollection
5	
if i have a dal created by subsonic 2.2 how do i convert the collections created by it to wpf observablecollection in code pref.vb.net to be consumed by wpf
878245


value	field
0	
i ve considered storing the original value for all the model s properties in a hidden form field and then writing a custom tryupdatemodel to only update the properties that have changed but this feels a little too like the viewstate we ve all been more than happy to leave behind by moving to mvc
878264


submission	submit
0	
the primary usage of this try-catch with main would be purely to prevent your program from crashing in very unusual circumstances and should do hardly any more than display a vaguely user-friendly fatal error message to the user as well as possibly logging the error somewhere and or submission a bug report
878293


web-applications	desktop-application
5	
resources lockout can be done with stateful desktop-applications but with web-applications any lockout scheme you try to implement may only minimize the damage but not prevent it
878944


perfmon	performance-monitor
5	
i had an app once that installed a performance-monitor counter that should have been shared by my app and perfmon when it was running so installing it should be just to make sure either app was closed
879120


asp.net	asp.net-mvc
5	
how can this be done in asp.net-mvc
879285


linux	freebsd
1	
this library works transparently with big- and little-endian elf files and runs just fine under linux despite its freebsd origins the usual . configure and make sequence is all you ll need to build it
879309


set	contains
5	
i could just manually implement hibernate lazy loading by dipping to hibernate and hydrating the hibernate object manually but the object graph for that object is huge contains hundreds of types that would need to be initialized and set
879389


set	any
5	
this script does so so the cookies you can set on this page will be sent to any page in the www.quirksmode.org domain though only this page has a script that searches for the cookies and does something with them
879542


linq	linq-to-sql
1	
linq-to-sql will essentially allow you to bring your set-based sql knowledge forward to the application domain and give you good performance to boot you can start with select from employees and add filters onto it successively such as where name smith which ultimately execute on the database
879984


substr	substring
10	
that unpack is faster thansubstring becausesubstring returns a lvalue so that you can operate on it as well
880116


int	primitive
5	
this compares only the ids - a primitive type like a int or a guid - and this can be transformed into sql
880142


cell	cells
0	
i ran into this problem a lot when using report headers where a company logo or report title was much longer than any of the fields of the report causing merged cell
880527


delphi	c++
1	
if you must use native code then i would strongly suggest rad studio from codegear embarcadero it s a studio product that ships with delphi the object oriented language that evolved from turbo pascal and c++ builder if you are already familiar with c++ then it s going to be very simple for you to pick it up
880663


squeak	gnu-smalltalk
1	
so can anyone either provide or point me towards a list or set of what features classes are or are not compatible between squeak and gnu-smalltalk
880821


beautifulsoup	lxml
10	
i ve found that even if lxml is faster than beautifulsoup for documents that size it s usually best to try to reduce the size to a few kb via regex or direct stripping and load that into bs as you are doing now
881218


http	https
5	
in particular they each have their own protocols which can be tunneled over ssh if you need security and they have http https access as well
881271


boost-asio	boost
1	
keep in mind that ace has had to support a large number of legacy platforms for long time so it doesn t utilize modern c++ features as much as boost-asio for example
881271


serialization	marshalling
5	
the boost serialization library can be used to marshalling data into a binary form as well as text
881415


daemons	systemd
10	
according to advanced programming in the unix environment by stephens and rago the second fork is more a recommendation and it is done to guarantee that the daemons does not acquire a controlling terminal on systemd v-based systemds
881457


category	categories
5	
yep the forum app of sct can be used for this - simply set it up and create multiple community groups these are similar to vhosts and map them to subdomains - each community group would have separate forum category can have separate templates separate user permissions etc
881661


outputstream	inputstream
5	
where output is some outputstream where the encrypted data will be saved and input is some inputstream where the plaintext data will be read
881670


windows-mobile	windows-ce
7	
so as i understand it windows-ce is more of a real windows for mobile devices while windows-mobile is somewhat trimmed down and targeted at those with less cpu power and memory
881682


installation	upgrade
4	
you should put all of your own plugins into vimfiles to make sure that when you upgrade your vim installation you don t lose any of the custom plugins or modifications
881746


security	cryptography
10	10	
public key cryptography needs a longer key than symmetric key cryptography to sustain the same level of security
881764


command-line	cmd
5	
php can be run via an interpreter on the cmd-line so any computation task can be done in php
881820


atomicity	atomic
5	
causes the processor s lock# signal to be asserted during execution of the accompanying instruction turns the instruction into an atomicity instruction
881857


json	xml
5	
configurations can be handled by xml or json files
881984


editor	text-editor
3	
i recommend using tinymce for a rich text-editor
882366


aspect	aspects
7	
the speed aspects of php has more to do with the user experience than with the performance itself
882616


controllers	controller
5	
and i figured out that adding a property such as this one to the controllers
882903


line	lines
0	
for one short is a 2 line method while some else will think that method with no more than 100 lines of code are pretty short
883160


append	input
7	
the mark allen comment on the other thread is suggesting that instead of append your new cloned input which ie doesn t give the selected file property to the other form you replace the old input with the new input which looks proper and then you put the old input on your upload form
883434


grouping	filtering
5	
this should also address if a user applies a filtering on the report you may or may not have given them this option. on a field other than thegroupinging
883626


silverlight	wpf
5	
note i am seeing my problem in silverlight but i am guessing that the exact same behavior can be seen with wpf
883665


managed-code	native-code
0	
on the other hand because managed-code in some scenarios is slower than native-code you might want to try unsafe code instead
883742


unmanaged	managed-code
7	
considering that the managed-code does bounds checking on the index of every array access which the unmanaged-code doesn t do i would say that the difference is smaller than i expected
883745


linq	linq-to-dataset
5	
linq to xml and linq-to-datasets rely on linq to objects which i guess could also be implemented for .net 2.0 but i haven t seen this done yet
883765


union	union-all
7	
in my own opinion the insert all is the better human-readable of the two while the union-all variant is the one taking less space when such an insert is automatically generated
883797


selection	selected
7	0	
haskell certainly has fewer libraries than .net but it does have a reasonableselectedion and the quality of the api design in many of them is very very high
883926


ruby	python
0	
the ruby interpreter can also be embedded within c programs and may be considered by some to be more object-oriented than python
883935


asp.net	asp.net-mvc
1	
i am not familiar with seaside but you can use many different view engines with asp.net-mvc nhaml
883989


rubygems	gem
5	
rubygem can be configured to install gem in the user s home directory instead of system wide which could work well on multi-user machines
884082


feed	feeds
5	
note that in this output all results must be of the form with no line feed to be considered valid output
884216


braces	curly-braces

i m writing a method to lift certain data out of an sql query string and i need to regex match any word inside of curly-braces only when it appears outside of single-quotes
884347


.net	.net-framework-version
5	
this was collected from various answers and linked documents especially the msdn article how to determine which versions and service pack levels of the microsoft .net framework are installed linked by dok . a full list with kb update versions and support retirement dates can be found on wikipedia list of .net-framework-versions
884697


subtraction	division
5	
the addition and subtraction is okay because the types of a and b force them to be performed using floating point arithmetic - but because division binds more tightly than addition and subtraction it s like using the brackets above only the immediate operands are considered
884753


processor	processors
0	
i know that this will result in 1 less threads than processors which is probably good it leaves a processor to manage the threads disk i o and other things happening on the computer
884785


authorization	authentication
8	
because i was less concerned with authentication authorization i don t know what to recommend as a best practice for dealing with binding certs to individual users and going more granular than machine-level my solution was windows service to windows service communication -- completely unattended
884995


attributes	properties
5	
if you want to support recomposition you d have to set the allowrecomposition properties of the import attributes to true then you can implement ipartimportssatisfiednotification on your class and the interface s onimportssatisfied method will be called whenever the imports have been set
885109


feed	atom-feed
10	
if this token is not found in the atom-feed there is no more
885257


required	checked
7	
i think git has better tools and a better toolchain and the fact that it doesn t required a central repo and a checked out repo is nice when you re working on small projects by yourself
885411


dfa	nfa
7	7	
build a basic finite automaton dfa nfa nfa-lambda for the language in the alphabet sigma 0 1 2 where the sum of the elements in the string is even and this sum is more than 3

uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
5	
in the latter case the uitabbarcontroller must be have been a uinavigationcontroller with a rootviewcontroller
886168


mouse	keyboard
0	
screensavers can do more than just display pretty pictures - i ve seen interactive screensavers before that used the mouse and keyboard to provide a simple game though i can t remember which version of windows i saw this running on.
886207


double	int
10	
using string int double etc is more expected and therefore more maintainable
886285


environment	building
0	
visual studio is really nothing more than an integrated development environment ide that enables you to edit debug building and run your code smoothly and easily
886328


getter-setter	getter
10	
when you have code in the header file for simple getter-setter methods it s more or less just fine because you either want to save some working time because of code maintenance typing same method in header and implementation file or because you actually want the method to be inline due to function call overhead in time critical places
886490


http	ssl
5	
http and ssl mutual authentication should be used for this because client already has at least corporate ca-signed certificate on its smart card stored
886721


updates	updating
10	
well linq is more about querying than updating so i ll still separate it into a linq query and then a foreach loop to do theupdates
887001


polymorphism	override

ps this is no longer virtual override relationship no polymorphism calls
887393


csv	xml
5	
i would like to test results to be saved as csv or xml file that i can analyze and plot them
887561


svn	revision
5	
that kind of revision metadata has to be stored elsewhere like trac or some other system that s built on top of the svn repository
887637


google-chrome	firefox
5	
the w3c specifications show that table cells should support onkeydown but this doesn t appear to be supported by firefox google-chrome currently you could try reporting this as a firefox bug through their website

keep writing the new line to the end of the file each at a time until the byte count of the remaining line is less than the byte count of the line at the beginning of the file it may be that this condition is true immediately in which case you don t need to write any more
887861


linq	linq-to-sql
4	
however you could grab linq-to-sql results by doing a .asenumerable and process the rest on client side
887954


category	categories
0	
one answer can belong to more than one category although for simplicity one can assume that categories are orthogonal exclusive
887983


udp	mtu
0	
3 you are sending messages that are bigger than the udp max message size 4 each device in your network has a max message size mtu so you might be exceeding a limit there
888028


set	any
5	5	
if the fetch request doesn t have any sort descriptors set to it explicitly will the objects be random every time or are they going to be spit out into an array in the order they were added to the managed object context initially
888080


profiling	debugging
5	
but if this is the case there is no auditing as it is a shared account and also our dev profiling which you will appreciate are vastly different from a shared one cannot be used to debugging production
888204


line	lines
10	
i was wondering is it more computationally expensive if i change the line that are used to create the provider to this.
888212


directory	folder
5	
this is because you do not know if the site will be deployed as root under a folder in root web or in a virtual directory
888231


remote-debugging	debugging
4	
just a month ago one of our dev leads was insisting on installing the bits necessary to do remote-debugging on a production server
888539


updates	updating
5	
with all the process above you minimize the amount of records to be updates to the minimum necessary and so the time the final table will be locked while updating
888671


triggers	insert
0	
make sure when you write the triggers that it handles the case where more than one row is being insert or updated at a time
888684


private	instances
5	
classes are friends of themselves in c++ terms private methods and fields of any instances of that class can be referenced from any method of the same class even static methods
888955


sorted	iteration
0	10	
the rational for this is that a std binary_search of a sorted vector with a custom comparitor is nearly as fast and sometimes faster than a map lookup and iteration is much faster
889120


aspect	aspects
4	
you just can t compare swing to winforms wpf in the performace startup time aspects
889218


linq	linq-to-sql
4	
i prefer linq-to-sql because i do not need to support non mssql db and its much lighter than ef
889264


line	lines
10	
that fewer line is better
889605


output	spaces
7	7	
converting from finger spaces to output spaces is even easier
889658


progress-bar	progress
5	
in this case i would have separated model component pairs for the progress-bar and handle them in a separate controller class
889855


sql-server	identity-column
0	
why does sql-server doesn t allow more than one identity-column in a table
889873


sql-server	identity-column
0	
so it s impossible for the sql-server to have more than one identity-column per table
890081


c++	python
0	
therefore c++ would be better than languages like php python ruby c#
890121


processor	processors
4	
for example if you need to match processor to the work load or match workers to their jobs
890151


generator	generator-expression
0	0	
pretty much anything you can do with lambda you can do better with either named functions or list and generator-expression
890318


revision	fossil
5	
i ve used it this way for preprocessing tasks that i might otherwise have delegated to awk or perl such as collecting details from the current fossil revision into my built project
890438


sorteddictionary	sortedlist
7	0	
sortedlist uses less memory than sorteddictionary
890870


32-bit	64bit
7	7	0	0	
the reason why this solution switches from uint64 u to unsigned long w and v in the middle is that the yyyymmdd and hhmmssiii fit to 32 bits and 32-bit division is faster than 64bit division on some systems
890913


line	lines
0	
for my application which reads a line from a text file and looks for data at certain offsets the java code ran about 3x faster than groovy
891026


lookup	any
4	
for complex lookup and any lookup essentially involving or i recommend django s q operator
891360


entity	transient
5	
i was expecting that the method will be called by hibernate to resolve entity name of a transient object when i save the object
891363


cassini	webdev.webserver
4	
basically if the debugger is currently running it will stop it then kill any processes named webdev.webserver which should be all the cassini instances and then starts the debugger again which will implicitly start cassini again
891429


copy-paste	paste
5	
what i should have done is copy-paste only this line
891682


serialization	deserialization
5	
the sql query is supposed to be generated by this linq query so i m thinking of it as a poor man s serialization deserialization of linq queries to t-sql format
891854


extends	super
7	
creating the super class is much harder when you have to think about how it can beextendsed
891904


contains	any
8	
as you ve realised .endswith will fail if there is anything after the en or if that varies but i don t think it s any more reliable than contains
892269


solaris	aix
1	
not familiar with aix but the following works on linux and solaris
892368


generics	type-safety
1	
i am quite comfortable with generics and such but in this special case i have a question concerning the type-safety unchecked cast from
892659


selection	selected
5	
hidden worksheets workbooks have some limitations to what can be done in vba code like most selected and selectedion statements and anything coming from activesheet but i can t seem to find any list of what the limitations are
892661


atomicity	atomic
7	
curiously if the value assigned is less than 256 the assignment is atomicity so there s no problem
892715


32-bit	64bit
5	
1 covert each of the dll into an exe which will be loaded in 32-bit and it can interact with my rest of 64bit application via com interfaces
893099


delay	interrupt
4	
also to avoid any sort ofdelaying or missing ticks choose this timer isr to be a high-prio interrupt the pic18 has two levels
893300


wmv	asf
4	
if compatibility supercedes compression i would recommend asf which is basically just a container for wma and wmv
893418


backwards-compatibility	deprecated
10	
if you read the windows user experience interaction guidelines specifically the section on confirmations you will notice that the question icon has been deprecated for a long time so it is only fitting that the task dialog does no longer provide it even though it is still supported for messagebox for reasons of backwards-compatibility
893959


http	https
5	
suppose i setup a simple php web server with a page that can be accessed by http
894378


svn	revision
5	
if you use svn then subwcrev from the tortoisesvn distribution could be used for this piece as well and could automatically use the revision number from your repository as the version string
894502


ruby	python
10	
i remember that at one point it was said that python is less object oriented than ruby since in ruby everything is an object
894541


ruby	python
10	8	
i m not sure that i buy the argument that ruby is more object-oriented than python
894584


c++	python
1	
how to go about that depends on your c++ needs as much as python
894692


ruby	python
10	
jian lin the answer is yes python is more object-oriented than when matz decided he wanted to create ruby and both languages now feature everything is an object
894784


perl	python
8	0	
i wanted a scripting language that was more powerful than perl and more object-oriented than python
894857


command-line	cmd
5	
it can be used to send any cmd to vim using the cmd-line
894865


asp.net-mvc	webforms
2	
do you think asp.net-mvc will compete with asp.net webforms
894954


height	width
7	
in the configuration above the modal popup is higher that it is wide - even though width is 800 andheight is 600
895432


http	https
10	
i suppose flex which is more common to users shoul have similar ways of validating http certificate from user s point of view
895456


php	python
5	
python can be used for web development but there isn t a special language extension or anything in the language that will handle all the html generation or that works like php
895597


line	lines
0	
i now use subversion even for test projects that are less than 100 line
895788


environment	building
5	
i regretfully wind up putting a lot of derived sources under source control because i work remotely with people who either can t be bothered to set up a proper building environment or who don t have the skills to set it up so that the derived sources are built exactly right
895947


puts	gets
1	
note scanf with unadorned s is as bad as gets because it puts no limit on the amount of data that will be slurped in
896139


hashmap	linked-list
0	
i do sometimes construct arraylist with an initial capcacity more than the default of 10 and a hashmap with more than the default buckets of 16 but i usually especially for business crud never see myself thinking hmmm...should i use a linked-list instead arraylist if i am just going to insert and iterate through the whole list
896407


java	groovy
7	7	0	
the groovy syntax is much terser than java it s much easier to do things in one line of groovy code that would take you several in java
896407


struts-1.x	struts
7	0	
simpler validation def simpler than struts-1.x username size 6..10 blank false specifies two validation rules for a username field to be of a specific length and non blank
896482


httpwebrequest	webclient
10	
use httpwebrequest instead of webclient it s slightly less convenient but not by very much and set the keepalive property to false
897015


pylons	django
4	
if you really don t want to delve into the frameworks - and you should i heartily recommend django or pylons - there s still need to go down the road of cgi
897132


line	lines
7	0	
it doesn t overly concern me that this is more line than the linq version
897183


.net	.net-framework-version
5	
when you want to install the exe on the client machine you should be installed .net framework on that mc because applications and controls written for the .net-framework-version 2.0 require the .net framework redistributable package version 2.0 to be installed on the computer where the application or control runs
897750


contains	any
4	
this returns results that match any of the search terms i would like to modify this so each resultcontains all of the search terms
897862


bazaar	git
7	0	
mercurial is significantly faster than bazaar it s slower than git though by a much smaller difference
897976


search-engine	seo
0	
so all i m saying is that search-engines are often brighter than seo consultants give them credit for.
898011


coverity	klocwork
4	
many companies see value and choose coverity or klocwork for a longer term solution although i see also running findbugs and pmd
898141


esx	vmware
1	
i ve read about the vmware-cmd tool but believe that is only available with vmware esx not workstation
898268


vmware	parallels
5	
i ve started looking into whether vmware or parallels can somehow be brought into this but there s not much that can be done without hacking the os
898283


asp.net-mvc	webforms
7	
asp.net-mvc provides a better separation of concerns than webforms however it does come with some overhead that is harder to justify on smaller projects
898360


login	authentication
5	
if so the authentication cookie may be expiring after leaving the app inactive for a long time and if you click the select button you re redirected to the login page but the login page itself may be having a problem that causes a redirection loop to occur which causes most browsers to display the this page cannot be displayed message after a couple of runs of the loop
898527


set	any
7	
i can t say i ve had any performance problems with either but cherokee is definitely easier to get set up
898592


json	xml
0	
json is usually a smaller payload than xml and many tests have show that it is easier for the browser to load it in
898622


pointers	stack
10	
i suspect that in stack frame at the top of stack my this object has been delete d i think this is no longer a valid pointers
898696


asp.net-mvc	webforms
10	
however if the website is more concerned with presenting content to the end user typical websites blogs e-commerce apps portals asp.net-mvc provides many advantages over webforms
898763


subtraction	division
0	0	
integer multiplication division and modulus are much slower than integer addition and subtraction
898911


set	any
5	
i ve been watching in profiler but that hasn t given any clues except for occasionally seeing set no_browsetable on set no_browsetable off statements occurring before and after the sp runs
898999


http	https
5	
what i would like to know is if there is an input parameter that can be passed to wsdl2java tool to generate client side code that communicates via http with the soap endpoint
899672


standard-library	c-standard-library
0	0	
also if you really are going to be doing some serious string handling i would recommend using the c standard-library rather than a string object library simply because you have better control over in-place substitution and so string copies become glaringly obvious in the code
899887


multiplication	division
10	
multiplication is faster than division so the second method is faster
899902


handshake	handshaking
5	
xmpp chat messages can be used for handshake and it has filesharing extensions to do the binary transfers
899926


controllers	controller
5	
in the controller tier helper methods defined on applicationcontroller should be marked as protected -- if they were private the other controllers would not be able to access them but if they are public rails will treat them as actions
899926


extend	methods
4	
because i use it often and coming out of my java days i favor protected for all helper methods to give freedom to anyone usually myself who wants to extend the class -- unless i m really really embarrassed about one then i mark it private
899929


multiplication	division
7	0	
if the latter yes floating point multiplication is generally faster than division
899947


authentication	impersonation
1	
i m not too familiar with windows authentication and impersonation and i know even less about was and how it handles security so i m hoping to find out if this is possible and where i might get started
899948


aspect	aspects
7	0	0	
the jvm looks better under this aspects
900301


double	int
2	
so for basic types char short int long float double you should always prefer pass by value unless you specifically need to use a reference to store a value for use after the function exits
900352


nested	order
5	
you said that the projects aren t secret public files should not be seen as nested projects but i m suggesting that you make this distinction in order to split them into two directories
900361


line	lines
0	
the class is probably less than 30 line code and i use it for quite a few places
900544


hex	decimal
5	
to locate files among a fixed set of directories alternatively use a fixed maximum-number-of-files n per directory and when you fill up go to the next one the k th photo should be stored at where aaaaaa floor k n formatted as decimal or hex and bbbb mod k n formatted as decimal or hex
900746


c++	lua
5	
you might also need to do something to make sure that the symbol is exported and wasn t name-mangled to a c++ name that will never be found by lua
900806


command-pattern	abstract-factory
8	
command-pattern is a little more complex than abstract-factory but is commonly used and powerful
901546


line	lines
0	
what would be the fastest without more than 30 line of code way to do this
901569


3g-network	wifi
5	
is there any inherent limitation of the us at t 3g-network that will block the nat traversal techniques would you be limited to wifi firewall nat traversal
901588


sharpdevelop	monodevelop
4	
n3 for web my preference will be vwd but for other stuff i ll prefer monodevelop and sharpdevelop
901733


php	ruby
10	8	7	0	
for example says java is more popular than php which is more popular than ruby
901733


ruby	python
0	
and the standard library of python is not so versatile the list and dict types have less methods than in ruby
901733


ruby	python
0	
so for someone new to perl ruby and python i d recommend spending a day with ruby one more day with python and choose which of these two to concentrate on learning
901738


integer	string-length
5	
we compare that with the string-length and if they differ then there must have been an integer
901815


arrays	loops
4	
is there anyway to compare arrays in php using an inbuilt function short of doing some sort of loops
901826


linux	ubuntu
7	7	
at home w ubuntu linux virtualbox is easier to maintain performs as well as i require and is free
902303


value	field
10	
if your input string is more complex than just a series of field and value its structured a more complex parser would likely be needed
902533


stringbuilder	string.format
0	
simple fact is that concatenations...when the number of string parts is known without limitation..you could concatenate a thousand parts...as long as you know its always 1000 parts ...are always faster than stringbuilder or string.format
902603


sql-server	oracle
1	
another grave misconception and this is primarily from the sql-server camp...i have very little experience with oracle is that stored procedures are the only thing that can be compiled and the execution plan cached
902686


subclass	subclassing
10	
alternatively you may be able to create a custom subclassing of application and store the mediaplayer there but using a service is considered better practice
903028


32-bit	16-bit
10	10	
i didn t get why it wrote it to memory twice though or why it was using 32-bit registers well actually my guess is that a 32-bit processor is way faster at working with 32-bit values than it is with 8 and 16-bit values but that s a totally uneducated guess so i tried rewriting it
903165


contains	any
5	
the params scope is a combination of url form get post fields and it will be printed out in the log as part of the normal output processing so you might not need your own dumping of it - any development or production logcontains the params dump at the top of the log line
903239


line	lines
5	
headers include other headers which include yet other headers so when you do a #include it could be adding tens of thousands of line of c++ into each cpp file or cxx c whatever all of which need to be compiled each time
903452


subclassing	abstract-class
5	
after all an abstract-class is just like anyclass except it can t be instsntiated requiring subclassing etc to complete the class
903548


bitvector	bitarray
8	
why is the bitvector 32 structure more efficient than bitarray
903566


boolean	int
8	
bitvector32 is more efficient than bitarray for boolean values and small int that are used internally
903579


boolean	int
8	
bitvector32 is more efficient than bitarray for boolean values and small int that are used internally
903666


ruby	python
4	2	
if you prefer ruby over python you could use rbot an irc bot written in ruby
903768


background-position	background-repeat
0	
if the image is smaller than the element you need to use the background-position style to place it to the right and to keep it from repeating and covering the entire background you use the background-repeat style
903768


transparency	background-color
0	
there is no way to specifically limit the background image to cover only part of the element so you have to make sure that the image is smaller than the element or that it has any transparency areas for the background-color to be visible
904173


asp.net-mvc	webforms
5	
the same approach can be used for webforms as well as asp.net-mvc
904203


ado	jet
10	
3 within an access application or any other vba vb application i should use dao as ado must go through a translation layer of the jet ole db provider while dao is more direct
904346


command-line	cmd
5	
it can be a cmd-line utility a c c++ objective-c or java code and will be used on osx 10.5
904502


controllers	controller
5

904818


aspect	aspects
5	
to the contrary it can be used to model pretty much any aspects of a software system almost at any level of abstraction
904913


jquery	jquery-dialog
5	
some have suggested using the blur event but this doesn t seem to be supported by jquery-dialog
905454


websphere	ibm
4	
as stated by martin service is a crucial part of why people purchase ibm websphere products and btw
905821


controllers	controller
7	
keeping this if-else condition in the controllers level is a better idea than moving into views
906092


getter	setter
5	10	
the idea is to have duplicated getter and setter for a field which is lazy loaded
906319


vb.net	vb6
1	
that said an awful lot of vb developers were annoyed when the classic vb was discontinued and vb.net was not compatible with vb6
906356


gridview	listview
1	
the reason to use listview would be if you need some special layout for example to create a table that places more than one item in the same row or to break free from table-based rendering altogether - which is not possible with gridview
906382


viewwillappear	viewdidload
5	
viewwillappear will be called every time your view is going to appear whereas viewdidload is called just once when the view is created
906443


processor	processors
5	
to which michael burr had replied saying in arm processor stack growth direction can be configured - either descending normal behaviour stack grows towards zero address lower address in memory or ascending stack grows towards higher address in memory
906613


command-line	cmd
5	
if you just want the relevant data to be displayed to stdout the terminal output if you re running from the cmd-line you can use p some_object
906652


integer	modulus
5	
modulus should only be used with integer
907312


openssl	libcurl
5	
what first appeared as a seemingly random failure to establish an ssl connection using libcurl in my application turned out to be caused by this but it took deploying debug versions of libcurl and openssl and stepping the customer through debugger script to finally figure it out
907458


key	key-value
7	
you can count the number of records where the value that you are sorting on has a lower value than the record that you know the key-value of
907701


set	any
5	
this position does not map back to any position in the table though unless the order by is on a set of clustered index columns but even then that position might be invalidated the next second
908140


unique-index	unique-constraint
1	
oracle doesn t even distinguish between unique-constraint and unique-index one command is just a synonym for another
908470


getter-setter	getter
5	
actionscript properties can in fact be backed by methods - so called getter-setter pairs
908571


javascript	dom
10	
this sounds more like you want to improve the dom interaction performance rather than javascript so in that vein
908571


firefox	safari
0	
oh for animations you should look at css animations and they perform much better than any js implementations but they re only present in safari and by proxy chrome and firefox 3.5 -- definitely not in ie -
908594


command-line	cmd
5	
you could use a cmd-line program that may be able to do it maybe it could be accomplished with sed awk grep etc
908683


8bit	128bit
5	
such extensions for hashing are supposed to be added in tr1 but as far as i am aware 128bit ints aren t supported my many compilers

environment	building
5	
building a java web app under tomcat 5.5 although a requirement is that it can be deployed anywhere like under a weblogic environment hence the loading resources as streams requirement
909349


webserver	host
5	
if you use a webserver such as cassini or iis to host your wcf service the base address will be provided from this server
909669


editor	text-editor
0	
there are some ides and plugins out there but nothing very complete so you might be better off with a text-editor and a command line build tool in the meantime
909825


processor	processors
0	
for parallelism you don t get much wider than shader language and the related opencl - typically 512 processor in parallel on a high-end desktop rather than erlang s 4 processor in parallel though with many scheduled processes

i recommend pushing building to this environment at least once a day or if you a really up to it with every good build from the build environment
910557


height	width
7	
then when an image is loaded the rectangle s style checks its triggers to see if the image has aheight or width that is less than 100px
910716


controllers	controller
5	
index is what will be passed to the controllers in the sidx query string parameter to indicate which column should be used for sorting when you click on that column header in the grid
911661


set	hashtable
7	
as other have said the stack allocation is very fast the speedup from not having to realloc each time is probably greater for more complex objects such as an arraylist or hashtable now list and dictionary in the generic world where there is construction code to run each time also if the capacities are not set correctly then you have unwanted reallocations each time the container reaches capacity and has to allocate new memory and copy the contents from old memory to new

push	pull
10	
why do you think that push is far more scalable then pull for starters
912545


set	any
4	
i would recommend either recreating resorting the treeset before searching it or my preference iterating through the set before the search and removing any of the objects that are too old
912825


order	join
0	
if we were to write this query as a join then we would return duplicate rows whenever an order had more than one line item.
913143

windows-vista	windows-ce
0	
if anything the thing that windows forms has going for it is that it s based on the technology that has existed for well over a decade and that inertia is not dying anytime soon the browser you are typing in is using gdi the taskbar is using gdi your instant messaging application is using gdi the new ribbon control in windows 7 is using gdi the 60 printer sitting your desk is using a gdi printer driver the windows-ce applications running on your phone run a port of windows forms and gdi the new event viewer in windows-vista is using windows forms and there is a large third-party component community behind the windows forms platform--wpf is a very small niche product that only exists in the managed world which is itself smaller than its unmanaged counterpart

hazelcast	jgroups
5	5	
you can achieve much higher performance with a custom solution which also might be simpler hazelcast jgroups are free you can add a node s which does the database synchronization so your main app doesn t slow down

having	select
7	10	
plain char having unspecified signed-ness allows compilers to select whichever representation is more efficient for the target architecture on some architectures zero extending a one-byte value to the size of int requires less operations thus making plain char unsigned while on others the instruction set makes sign-extending more natural and plain char gets implemented as signed

i assumed that because java is compiled and is generally considered to be faster than python i would see some big paybacks
918359


java	python
10	10	
how come my python implementation is faster than my java implementation
918359


java	python
0	
by that i mean that the java put call seems to be much slower than the python set s add
918359


java	python
0	
the java implementation of the production code is also about 2.5 - 3 times slower than the python version -- just like the above
918367


int	primitive
1	
i m not too familiar with python but i do know hashset can t contain primitive so when you say counts.add i the i there is getting autoboxed into a new int i call
918397


java	python
0	
it has generally been my experience that python programs run faster than java programs despite the fact that java is a bit lower level language
918456


java	python
7	7	0	7	
the java runtime is much bigger than python so takes longer to load from disk and takes up more memory which may be important if you are swapping
918527


.net	asp.net-mvc
5	
this means that every request to the server is parsed by the .net dll so that url s can be rewritten asp.net-mvc heavily relies on url rewriting
919034


stringbuilder	string.format
1	
is string.format as efficient as stringbuilder
919045


erlang	lua
1	
if i like ruby a lot is there a reason i should learn another language now such as lua or erlang

919201


web-applications	desktop-application

there doesn t seem to be any killer desktop-applications for ruby at the moment mostly because there is such a demand for web-applications and providing rich application experiences via the web is getting easier and easier
919231


hosting	web-hosting
5	
it could be recommended for web-hosting but i believe for small sites it is overkill
919542


php	python

919980


java	python
10	
how s that for python is faster than java

edit i m displaying it in the .net winforms control but it will also be exported to pdf and perhaps .doc xls etc.
921153


runtime-compilation	runtime
0	0	
another 3rd-party alternative is graniteds which does much the same thing as blaze but is spring-friendly out of the box and does quite a lot more than blaze runtime-compilation and generation of swf files from the webapp
921225


javascript	dom
1	
it claims that you can write arbitrarily complex queries against javascript arrays dom node lists or your own enumerable types which sounds like what you want

here is an example of a case to match gecko based browsers netscape 6+ mozilla firefox ...
921679


children	nodes
0	0	
so long as thenodes in general have more parents than children this direction will be much faster
921765


gridview	datalist

for displaying a list of things repeaters are typically faster than gridview datalist and their other counterparts
921813


javascript	dom
5	
1 created two javascript files one which defines all javascript functions dom manipulations as required by the site and second called messages.js this defines all the string literals that need to be localized something like var alert_msg alert message in english
922124


model	datamodel
5	
i use llblgen but it has to be refreshed when datamodel changes are made
922128


height	width
8	
let s say i have a size class which hasheight and width properties in reality the class is a bit more complex than this but size makes a good example
922128


controllers	controller
10	
in the case of a single size instance i could create the property in the controllers class containing it but this becomes more difficult when you have an array of sizes
922130


add-on	plugins
0	
to me a bloated application is full of to manny features not really belonging as i see it to the application that can not be turned off or at least hidden and would be better off as a plugins add-on
922318


copy-paste	paste
10	
the exported code is getting larger and we want to encourage users to do this more often so the copy-paste route is no longer desirable
922425


value	field
7	7	
storing value in a hidden field is no more of a hack than .net web forms itself is
922429


height	width
0	
it s close - i m finding ifheight is greater than width the left position of the rotated image is incorrect
922429


height	width
7	
similarly if width is greater thanheight the top position of the rotated image is incorrect
922723


tree	nodes
0	
so a really simple interpreter will basically have a tree with a nodes for the where loop with two children one less than expression for the conditional and one block for the body of the loop
922944


conventions	naming-conventions
1	
it s just different naming-conventions between simulator and i image ipod touch and iphone
923190

also in this case keyboard input is essential and more important than mouse interaction
923705


managed-code	c++-cli
5	
it is c++-cli - code that is written to be run as managed-code under the .net framework not regular c++ code
923918


persistence	hibernate

probably the line drawer was a bresenham modified to skip the points drawn unless they were greater than max or less than min
924400


command-line	cmd

cause widget is supposed to be located in layout i don t know which is current page therefore - can t get back on failed authentication even worse - i know nothing about page state changed fields selected items in checkbox etc.
925371


zero	digits
5	
if you use 0 in the formatting string those will be filled with zero of there are no significant digits there
925389


processor	processors
5	
note that x87 is effectively deprecated at this point and may be removed from future processor entirely
925477


quicksort	bubble-sort
7	
it uses the quicksortalgorithm not bubble-sort which is typically better anyway. even better it has an overload that takes a argument which means you can pass a lambda expression and make things very simple indeed
925518


cocoa	nsthread
5	
if you re developing using cocoa ie for the mac or iphone you have access to the nsthread class which can be used for multithreading
925673


specifications	w3c
0	
the browser vendors w3c whatwg etc have a hard enough time agreeing on a single specifications as it is can you imagine what would happen if there was more than one specifications
925708


line	lines
5	
main browser line comes with increased support for the standard but websites that use these features will be broken to any users in an earlier version
925848


.net	wcf
5	
to address the problem of maintenance nightmare of application config some standard like uddi or ws-discovery exist ws-discovery will be supported by wcf in .net 4.0
925872

how do i disable that so even if the pixmap is bigger than window it won t be moved by keyboard or mouse unless i use my events for that
926217


md5	hash
2	
create a hash md5 sha etc of the string password id you want to compare against maybe add a salt value to it
926562


asp.net-mvc	webforms
5	
now according to one speaker in order to test your behaviors you need to use mvc but on the other side its been said that tdd is an approach which can be adopted in any environment as the discussion surrounding asp.net-mvc or webforms
926685


line	lines
5	
the easiest way is to have a mapping of all the vob symbolic links that need to be created and put all necessary cleartool ln -s command line in a script to run once
926793


json	xml
5	
the search resource would have fields for color make model garaged status etc and could be specified in xml json or any other format
926808


command-line	cmd
0	
the idea is to speed up the whole versioning process not make it harder by having to do cmd-line
926868


visualsvn-server	visualsvn
4	
i personally use and recommend visualsvn-server and tortoisesvn for windows
926890


javascript	dom
5	
unfortunately i don t know of any tools but i would think this could be done using javascript using jquery prototype or other js framework to rip through the rendered dom and discover applied styles and create new html based on that
926981


fopen	fclose
0	
i ran a test a few years ago and dlmwrite was something like 5-10x slower than the fopen fprintf fclose solution
927166


compatibility	deprecated
5	
they are not present in any of the .net code base unless you count the vb6 compatibility layer library so should be considered deprecated and therefor ignored
927290


taglib	taglib-sharp
4	
may i recommend taglib-sharp for mp3 tag editing
927315


attributes	properties
5	
the leading space is important because the classname properties treats the css classes like a single string which ought to match the class attributes on html elements where multiple classes must be separated by spaces
927695


sql-server	sql-server-express
7	
and since sql-server express is the only sku that supports user instance databases the host will have to have express installed for you to use it as-is
928109


line	lines
0	
having a source control tool integrated with your development environment makes the whole process much easier than having to mess with command line
928110


c++	python
4	
if you need anything more complex than what read or zenity provides change to c++ is really the best method although i d recommend python ruby over c++ for such shell-script-replacement tasks
928133


parent	traversal
5	
specifically this tool would be used to traversal a set of objects that are different versions of a parent object
928170


pointers	stack
5	
in most vm languages variables can be conceptualized as pointers or references to memory in the heap even if the variable itself is on stack
928170


int	primitive
5	
for languages that have primitive types int and bool in java for example those may be stored on the stack as well but they can not be assigned new types dynamically
928219


serialization	serializable
5	
my question is though if i just mark the one class as serialization can i assume the entire class with be marked as serialization
928247


height	width
7	
meaning if theheight divided by width gives more than 1
928507


linq	linq-to-sql
5	
entities are the future not many enhancements will be made to linq-to-sql in the future
928523


oracle	mysql
4	
i prefer this approach to escaping because it works in oracle and mysqlas well as sql server
928554


var	this
5	
i m not sure why you d think the variable var would be known in this context
928784


rubinius	ironruby
1	
jruby is one of the most complete ruby implementations there are a lot other ones out there such as ironruby maglev rubinius xruby yarv macruby
928803


extends	implements
10	
this is clearly more complex than the record approach but retains the ability to work with enum values sets strings and can also beextendsed to implements additional meta data features where required
928902


height	font-size
7	0	
ie6 sets theheight of empty divs to your font-size if theheight specified in the css is less than the font-size
929010


.doc	xls
4	
i understand i could simply use xslt style sheets and output html but i prefer pdf xps xls or .doc output and want better formatting control
929273


constructor	object
5	
the constructor are marked private so they cannot be called except from inside the class and the factory method is marked as static so that it can be called without first having an object
929401


controllers	controller
5	
now i would like to know how other chart types like pie chart can be created in controllers
929489


serialization	serializable
5	
all objects used in object hierarchy must be maked as serialization
929539


vim	macvim
3	
if you are familiar with vim or got the time to learn a fairly complex text editor i would recommend checking out macvim
929548


emacs	aquamacs
10	10	
carbon emacs is closer to the unix emacs experience whereas the aquamacs people have put considerable effort into os x integration
929614


perl	php
7	
the php based tools are the easiest in my experience to get up and running and the perl tools more involved
930163


php	python
7	
php will have the most resources but python is a better choice
930411


textbox	button
0	
i m basically mimicking the share button feature on facebook with jquery and what im trying to do is when i click on the textbox area the textbox gets larger by height
930524


line	lines
5	
looks like a flash issue given that the inconsistency occurs when the number of line is different there s nothing to be done about this at this point
930565


serialization	serializable
5	
classes would just have to be marked serialization of course
930818


line	lines
5	
it is of course possible to require more lines to represent all addresses in the official format but commas can always be used as line separators meaning the information can still be captured
931185


managed-code	native-code
8	
a c++ cli assembly can contain native-code which has the potential to be more performant than managed-code
931521


controllers	controller
7	
doesn t that make a very fat controllers because of the tens of methods this model is overly simplified the car has many more parent-child relationships
931621


asp.net	.net
5	
the first three can be optional if for some reason you don t want one of them to be used although why you would want that i couldn t fathom. however the last one is the deserialization constructor and if you wish your exception to be supported in any kind of distributed environment .net remoting asp.net web services wcf etc. then its is pretty much essential
931742


margin	margins
7	
i have also found that separating the two leaves less margins for php errors if the html elements are separated from the php there is a smaller amount of php that can go wrong
931751


binary-tree	tree
7	
in binary-tree the right leaf is always smaller then the head and the left leaf is always bigger so you can search in sorted tree in o log n you just need to go right if if the key is smaller than head and to the left if bgger
931925


javascript	dom
0	
jquery website is a javascript framework that makes working with the dom easier by building lots of high level functionality that can be used to search and interact with the dom
931986


order	join
5	
join order makes no sense for merge join and cannot be forced in postgresql for hash join
931986


nested	order
4	
you can make some of the columns non-sargable and this will force postgresql to use intended join order in case the optimizer chooses nested loops
932228


tcp-ip	tcp
5	
this is because of the way nagle s algorithm causes data to be buffered over tcp-ip
932357


radio-button	button
5	
radio-button tend to be used for variables that have more that two values so rather than having three variables
932360


postgresql	mysql
4	
this blog does provide one reason to prefer postgresql you can have full-text search and still be transactional while in mysqlfull-text indexing only work on myisam tables not innodb except if you add sphinx of course also see this follow-on for a bit more on full-text search in postgresql and lucene
932502


bufferedimage	graphics2d
5	
the reason being a graphics2d object of the bufferedimage can be obtained in order to produce a better quality scaled image
932668


integer	digits
5	
remainders and integer parts greater than 9 must be converted to hex digits directly 10 becomes a 11 becomes b .
932717


constructor	object
5	
by instantiating the tip object you actually perform constructor call simple function call which handle and update the visual element accordingly but once this object is not referenced by any variable it supposed to be collected by garbage collector
932867


haskell	python
5	
some ffis make you write code in the target language like haskell where ffi code must be written in haskell and others make you write code in the source language like python where ffi code must be written in c
932940


height	width
5	5	
although both might be stored as numeric 10 2 aheight and a width column could not be compared without casting
932955


linq	linq-to-sql
8	
it s much more complex than linq-to-sql and has a steeper learning curve for example ef allows one class-multiple tables mapping
933047


subclass	subclassing
0	
you can t cast a superclass in a subclassing because the subclassing may have a bigger interface than the superclass means the subclassing can have functions like getunixtimestamp that the superclass doesn t have
933120


subclass	subclassing
5	
so you already can inherit and add properties fields methods to your subclassing that will all be handled by reflection if the dynamic path doesn t do the lookup
933508


rubygems	gem
5	
as mentioned above rubygem that have c extensions cannot be installed under jruby
933546


gpl	lgpl
5	
license it is lgpl when wt is gpl meaning cppcms may be used free in non open-source projects as well
933561


json	xml
4	
if you choose xml or json look into a serialization framework like xstream to serialize deserialize your javabeans into xml strings and back again
934130


value	field
5	
as can be seen every time getcallback is called it assigns a new value to static field callback
934327


linq	linq-to-sql
5	
i ve tried various things involving merging of multiple result sets but get the error local sequence cannot be used in linq-to-sql implementation of query operators except the contains operator
934386


command-line	cmd
7	
with a little tweak to the require test_helper line in my tests a single test execution is no more than a f5 away and the whole suite available from the cmd-line with a quick rake
934389


atomicity	atomic
5	
a plan may be scoped like a par or unscoped and may be atomicity meaning the lifecycle of its contents is tied atomicityally to the lifcycle of the plan like a par or non-atomicity
934451


line	lines
5	
you just need cat with the -s option which causes it to remove repeated empty line from its output
934523


line	lines
7	
ctags is easier to set up faster to run and if you only care about jumping one way it will show you less line
934930


constructor	private
5	
i am wondering since a lot of things can be done using reflection can i change a private readonly field after the constructor completed its execution
935150


api	account
5	
i found a solution that isn t as resource-heavy as retrieving all users the google reporting api can be used to get the total number of account in a google apps domain
935269


selected	button
4	
in the index page i have a list of client to select button or whatever and i would like to go to client home.mvc start in function of the client selected

32-bit	64bit
4	
i do not recommend 64bit workstations until exceeding the 32-bit memory limit for this reason
935466


line	lines

in the example above files greater than 1000 line are deleted
935510


visitor	visitor-pattern
10	
there s this thing called the visitor-pattern that works better
935624


set	any
5	
i thought i remembered a way to set a machine level flag so that all the any cpu .net dlls would be treated as 32-bit and not 64-bit by deafult but i can t seem to find it again
935722


http	https
5	
is there anything else that can be done with nsurlconnection via http
935833


line	lines
0	
it should take less than 10 line of code in php
935955


listener	listeners

this thread on the gwt forum gives better details on how this can be done outdated uses listener outdated the internals of dialogbox have been changed a lot since this thread - it doesn t work
936301


account	credentials
0	0	
after that you re as secure as the account is secure which is nothing to write home about but it s much better than having credentials passed around between processes
937260


sql-server	oracle
5	
if you haven t installed an oracle and a sql-server test server you probably haven t even started
937289


atomicity	atomic
0	
i am considering resorting to a do i have the semaphore global and removing the signal blocking but that is not 100 safe since acquiring the semaphore and setting the global isn t atomicity but might be better than blocking signals while waiting
937367


editor	text-editor
5	
check in the project and solution files with a text-editor for any paths that point to files that cannot be found - maybe there is a relative or absolute path that cannot be found

networkx	graphviz
4	
however if you know python then i would definitely recommend networkx and its cousin pygraphviz which is an interface to graphviz
938542


feedback	account
5	
what i would like to do is provide the user the option to give feedback on a programme which can then be taken into account during the generation of any subsequent programmes
938590


while-loop	loops
7	
and according to optimization reference manual for ia-32 function calls deeper than 16 can be very expensive so i would like to do this using a while-loops instead of recursive calls
938795


put	get
5	
for example if i perform a head request to your web service and one of the http headers in its response is www-authenticate ntlm then the credentials stored in defaultcredentials would be encrypted using ntlm and then sent up with the full get post put whatever
938903


show	next
10	
also i want to be able to track the position of the on-screen notifications so that if the next check finds more to show it knows where the last currently visible one is and the new ones are show below the others
939202


cell	cells
4	
it depends on whether or not you want to allow people to select cell or not
939297


key	key-value
5	5	
edit json key-value pairs can also be used like this -
939365


linq	linq-to-sql
1	
granted this isn t as easy as linq-to-sql s implementation
939429


asp.net	asp.net-mvc
0	
asp.net-mvc is helpful when you wish to have more control over the output and lifecyle of your application
939560


linq	linq-to-sql
7	
that said migrating from linq-to-sql is easier than from nhiberante or some other technology so if you need to go live tomorrow either take a chance with beta 1 of ef 4.0 or go with linq-to-sql
939831


processor	processors
4	
my next course of action is to allow each processor grab all available orders and just round robin the processors but i was hoping to simply make this section of code thread safe and allow the processors to grab records whenever they like
939944


editor	text-editor
7	
but if you don t need it then a text-editor is easier
939995


contains	elements
5	
the main thread is probably not guarenteed to be called main though - might be better to check for a stack trace elements thatcontains main
940171


splash-screen	splash
4	
if you are using wpf then simply load an image into the project right click properties and choose splash-screen
940192


subtract	add
10	
the idea i use in this is to extend the hours a day have from 24h to 27h +3 but only where cardeventtime is less or equal to 03 00 00 24h i add 24h and to cardeventdate subtract 1d
940216


templates	variadic-templates
5	
ugly but the boost preprocessor library can generate this code for us and in c++0x support for variadic-templates will be added so this ugliness is only temporary
940511


types	strong-typing
0	
strong-typing is your friend here since it allows you to track types and usages in a much better fashion than weak typing
940935


c++	lua
0	
c++ stl may help but it is going to be a lot more verbose than lua
941027


put	get
5	
but it can also be used to put and delete data as well as get header information etc
941298


jquery	thickbox
10	
it seems that when the for the thickbox control is injected into the dom after the initial load jquery is no longer able to do its magic and intercept the anchor link request
941325


quicksort	heapsort
0	
each iteration in quicksortis a lot simpler than heapsort
941340


binary-tree	tree
4	
for instance a linear search through an array of 100 integers will probably beat out a search through a binary-tree of 100 integers due to memory accesses even though the binary-tree will most likely require fewer operations
941529


http-post	post
5	
if a method is not marked with scriptmethodattribute the method will be called by using the http-post command and the response will be serialized as json
941570


invoices	invoice
2	
i prefer working with invoice rather than invoices because i m usually dealing with 1 record at a time
941603


32-bit	64bit
10	10	
also they are multiples of 4 which are more efficient for computers to handle due to the width of the internal data bus being 4 bytes or 32-bit 64bit is getting more prevalent now wide
941637


dialog	pop-up
4	
the filereference.save method will pop-up a dialog for the user to choose where to save the file so the filename given is just a suggested filename
941685


xna	spritebatch
0	
in xna when is it appropriate to render your game content using more than one spritebatch
941824


category	categories
10	
a generic issue when not falling under those other category is more often than not a representation of something reported by the end-user
942223


words	punctuation
4	
this matches words digits and a number of punctuation characters though by no means all
942361


osx	linux
4	
you can always use an off-the-shelf package such as graphviz win linux osx pajek win ucinet win or even visio win
942786


swing	swt
2	
depending on who you ask it is either wonderful or evil since it competes with swing and makes use of native os widgets swt
943494


ant	maven
7	
having said all of that i do think that maven is a very interesting and useful system i m not calling it a tool like ant is maven is broader than that for software development configuration and build management
943534


nunit	mbunit
5	
perhaps it can be found in nunit also but i found it in mbunit first
943558


windows-vista	windows
5	
that means that all of your boxes should likely be upgraded to windows-vista or windows 2008 server or windows 7 as it is running iis 7.5
943572


downcasting	downcast
5	
if the database wasn t configured correctly or the data was inserted without using the n prefix it won t be possible to get the correct data out since it will have been downcasting into the latin 1 ascii character set
943727


attributes	properties
5	
for example a properties of a type may be described either using an attributes or an element as long as its name can be interpreted correctly
943983


perl	python
10	10	
note that while python s regexp implementation and many others such as perl s can do this this is no longer a regular expression in the narrow sense of the word
944060


set	hashtable
7	
this is where the common functional convention on almost everything being immutable helps by doing this it becomes far easier to not care too much about the concrete implementation of the collection and think solely about it s externally visible behaviour a red balck tree for a set or a hashtable - it doesn t matter to consumers its just a set
944376


pointers	stack
7	7	0	
edit i ve noticed that the internal procedure doesn t take the pointers as parameter so forget that part _ anyway stack frame has more information than just the parameters of the function so it will be still more memory efficient and the main point was that the heap were the data stack is allocated is usually larger than the process stack
944592


set	any
7	
also is there any way to set a business rule like that is always checked without the try except finally so if at anytime throughout the code x is less than 0 an error is raised like if you set at the start of a function anywhere within the function where x becomes less then 0 an exception is raised
944751


min	max
0	
in your case the min and max values are exactly adjacent representable values so there can t be more than one partition
944786


put	get
5	
there is an add-on for wcf called the wcf rest starter kit which will also be included in wcf 4.0 with .net 4.0 which allows you to use get post put delete http commands to query wcf services and such
944983


visitor	visitor-pattern
1	
the visitor-pattern is a way to implement multiple dispatch in languages that do not do that automatically such as java
945050


contains	elements
5	
caveat is that other types of nodes will be ignored and xml document may contains diffrent elements so this might not work for every type of node encountered
945207


triggers	insert
5	
our ticketing system let s us read the database directly but updates need to be done either through a web service or an insert to a special staging table and then calling a web service to triggers the processing of their business logic
945285


asp.net	.net
0	
i am doing all the development in .net and know better silverlight than asp.net
945293


time	subtract
4	
that is what i do buy subtract 150000 time 15 00 00
945355


firefox	safari
10	
silverlight is cross browser compatible what you see in ie is what you ll get in firefox safari and the same on the apple mac versions of the browsers
945584


dbd	dbi
0	
i d like to know if it s possible to execute more than one sql statement within a single execute or do call using dbd oracle via perl dbi
945655


processor	processors
0	
now adding two ints will be faster than adding two longs on a 32bit processor because adding two longs requires more microops since you re working with numbers wider than the processors word
945692


testng	junit
4	
i would recommend switching from junit to testng
945789


line	lines
10	
note this answer is more to do with the abstract task of counting line in a string rather than to do with the gui side of things
945948


png	tiff
5	
so as you can see the name of the image is file.png and this works correctly it saves the image as png also works with jpeg tiff gif and it can be loaded with any image processing application
946059


callback	methods
5	5	
when the async operation is done it will fire the callback methods where you can handle the processing that needs to be done post sql execution
946689


stax	sax
5	
this can be done using dom sax or stax processing
946718


boolean	int
5	
boolean are meant to be used for specific purposes flags and shouldn t be mixed with int else the uses of variables can potentially become quite confusing
946719


line	lines
5	
edit i understand that the location of cell phones or voip line probably cannot be geocoded and this is fine by me
946736


cell	cells
4	
i would not recommend having the user control define how it should occupy table grid cell in a host
946753


asp.net	asp.net-mvc
5	
if you implement idisposable interface in your class derived from viewresult the dispose idisposable.dispose will not be invoked by asp.net-mvc framework
946925


csv	export
5	
i have used the rklib export library a few times to great effect this uses a memory stream and can be given any datatable which it will export as a csv download
946973


set	any
5	
image provides an abstract access to an arbitrary image it defines a set of methods that can loggically be applied upon any implementation of image
947036


controllers	controller
5	
calling back to the ui and showing the result in the ui can easily be reached by having the ui to subrscribe to events made available by the controllers
947389


adapter	adaptor
5	
should the mvc framework really be renamed to adaptor view controller
947473


profiling	debugging
4	
many people recommend this for the debugging project profiling
947630


http	https
5	
regarding the application hosting socket connections for clients to connect to i d double-check on what s allowed as i think only http and https connections are allowed to be made with azure
947637


min	average
7	
in more real situation if we have about 12 concurrent calls and default 1 min send timeout and if service calls process more than 10 seconds in average than we can easily get timeout exception with the last two calls 12 2 10 sec 60 sec because they will wait all others
947842


serialization	serializable
5	
the objects you provide as arguments as part of the service request must be marked with serialization and based on some of the answers posted before mine you also need to make sure your custom object does not contain any parameters in the constructor
948397


.when	ready
5	
the simple current and upstream modes are for those who want to push out a single branch after finishing work even .when the other branches are not yet ready to be pushed out
948540


double	int
5	
similarly this can be extended to int long float double types as well
948769


jquery	dojo
0	
dojo is currently slightly less popular than jquery has 8.4 million hits on google search vs 4.3 million for but that s still way popular enough to ensure it won t go away any time soon
948813


margin	margins
10	
of course your table will jump in position 1px when the border is added so maybe it s better to use margins or a white border when you are not hovering
948896


linq	linq-to-sql
5	
note that linq-to-sql required sql server while the other two can be used with any database
949583


extends	implements
5	
the question is is there a common design pattern that implements such a system or open source software that achieves a similar thing thaty could be used to create a generic solution that could be used for controllers or pc s and can beextendsed to allow any number of controllers to act as standby routines
949632


operators	conditional
5	
if conditional are needed then extension methods and arbitrary expressions can be used null-coalescing operators
949694


jar	executable
5	
there s no such thing as an executable jar equivalent to an exe file in windows in an executable jar you ll be only specifying the entry point your main class you want to be executed by default
949932


category	categories
0	
there is some overlap between words and categories such that some words could go into more than one category
950084


coalesce	nvl
1	
are there non obvious differences between nvl and coalesce in oracle
950171


linq	linq-to-sql
1	
i m not really familiar with linq but i m currently working on an asp.net project and using linq-to-sql as orm i m building a route planning application
950290


visualsvn-server	visualsvn
4	
i would highly recommend downloading visualsvn-server
950928


.net	wcf
5	
the .net framework provides these as a homogenous way to provide network credentials but with wcf this seems to have been thrown out in favour of a new incompatible system based on the unrelated system.servicemodel.description.clientcredentials class
951281


java	groovy
7	0	
as cesar said type checking is a run-time process one of the major reasons that groovy is slower than java not that that s really bad
951320


height	width
4	
edit the user can only pick either weight or dims on asp.net page and if user selected dims then they must supply length width andheight
952319


real-mode	protected-mode
5	
wsh can be run from either the protected-mode windows-based host wscript.exe or the real-mode command shell-based host cscript.exe
952342


look-and-feel	user-interface
7	7	
on the flip side i d say generally speaking complex stateful user-interface is easier in oo c# than functionalook-and-feel#
952648


ruby	python
5	
the thing is it has to be written in python or in ruby and have a verbose mode trace mode or very helpful debugging techniques
953781


polymorphism	parametric-polymorphism
10	
this is much more flexible than using inheritance because we can stay with the theme of using composition and parametric-polymorphism without locking down brittle hierarchies
953814


postgresql	mysql
7	
postgresql has more established support for this but mysqlhas played catch up in the last year or so and has a working method of this in the latest versions
953814


postgresql	mysql
0	
mysqls version is apparently marginally faster than postgresql but lacks some of the more advanced spatial features therefore it s pretty much limited to finding records that match a certain range of coordinates
953900


railo	coldfusion
5	
of course this means that some frameworks are going to have to be rewritten for railo since this breaks full compatibility with adobe coldfusion
953950


md5	hash
1	
this has to be unique and usually not sequential - examples are a uuid guid or a hash md5 of the integer id but be careful of characters that are not compatible with http
954040


firefox	safari
5	
html5 defines a contenteditable attribute that can be applied to any element including the body element it s supported in ie which i think invented the attribute safari 2.0 and firefox 3.x where x is at least 5
954807


command-line	cmd
7	
this is easier for a cmd-line application but for gui testing you would need to use a framework like others have mentioned
955154


asp.net-mvc	webforms
5	
the example below is for asp.net-mvc but a similar approach could be used with webforms
955176


conventions	naming-conventions
7	
this is simpler if you have consistent naming-conventions for your objects table names start t_ stored procedure names start usp_
955234


linq	linq-to-sql
10	8	
i also know this point has become more or less moot with linq-to-sql and its successor entity framework
955288


listener	listeners
5	
the advantage of phase listener is that they can be registered either globally in faces-config see spec or for specific views
955451


sql-server	oracle
0	
i have much more experience with oracle but very likely the same applies to sql-server as well
955508


authorization	authentication
7	
this is mainly due to the fact that authentication is much more application specific
955547


asp.net-mvc	webforms
1	
in webforms i would have just bound the control then inserted another item however it seems this is not possible with asp.net-mvc am i right in thinking i will need to add some javascript to the view to add this new item once the dropdownlist has been bound
955604


arm	powerpc
1	
not sure if this works for non x86 cpus as well such as powerpc or arm
956124


public	protected
5	
this cannot always be achieved with public protected private
956777


serialization	deserialization
0	
it sounds like you re more after just parsing rather than full xml serialization deserialization
956832


submission	submit
1	
ibrahim i m not entirely familiar with this but i know that if you use server.transfer it would keep your url as default.aspx i understand you are submission and not redirecting but if you could somehow redirect instead it would look like this
957004


line	lines
10	
this is tremendously more efficient than reading the entire file into memory as an array of line and then processing it one element at a time which is often--if not almost always--the wrong approach
957014


imagemagick	ghostscript
5	
imagemagick requires ghostscript to be installed in order for this to work
957139


sql-server	postgresql
4	
note i used sql-server to model test and then changed the syntax to match postgresql
957283


php	ruby
5	
if your service will need to be interoperable and be called from java ruby php or other clients you absolutely must catch all .net exceptions on the server side and turn them into soap faults which are the interoperable equivalent
957380


domain-object	repository
10	
for example if your repository is returning a domain layer object but your persistence is using l2s you might want to map the l2s data to the domain-object
957655


postgresql	mysql
7	
in general postgresql knows more tricks for how to optimize complicated queries than the mysqloptimizer does but it also relies heavily on your having given the optimizer enough data to work with
957862


dto	dao
7	
i think that dto + dao or domain object + repository is a better design most of times
957879


yui	yui-datatable
7	
i am working on an application using the yui-datatable and my result set is rather large 2 000+ rows which takes yahoo.lang.json.parse about 5-6 seconds to parse
958294


category	categories
4	
i would like to store the category ids in my table and be able to select rows based on the categories they belong to
958353


interpreter	runtime
5	
lua values cannot be created until there is a lua interpreter which requires calling lua_open which cannot be done until runtime
958639


php	ruby
7	0	
ruby is better than php
958678


cell	cells
0	
domains in published puzzles 4x4 or 6x6 typically have no more than 5 cell but again this does not seem to be a hard limit
958907


spring	seam
5	5	
is there anything that can be done in seam that can t be done in spring
958907


spring	seam
5	
anything in spring that can t be done in seam
959214


integer	digits
0	
you can t use a char to represent an integer longer than 1 digits so i m going to assume you did in fact mean char
959322


value	field
3	
although your code seems correct i always prefer using field names to get the value instead of index position that can be easily changed in a number of situations
960045


integer	digits
0	
if you re only looking at the last four digits you don t need anything larger than an integer
960480


silverlight	wpf
7	
if your xaml isn t hugely complex i d consider sl3 - but going from wpf to silverlight is trickier than the other way around - there are understandably big gaps
960955


controllers	controller
0	0	
then i added most of the code from j.biard i changed the rect to 50 50 100 100 left out the setdelegate out for now as i am just trying to get it working visually for now and i found that self.view addsubview view worked much better than self addsubview view to the end of the viewdidload method of the first view controllers that is displayed when the app fires up
961297


line	lines
0	
never been part of a project nor written anything longer than 500 line
961426


serialization	serializable
0	
it should never be visible outside of the transaction except that isolation levels lower than serialization allow it to some extent
961478


constructor	object
10	
if it needs 10 values then it isn t unheard of to pass 10 values into the constructor - but what you describe sounds more like an entity object
961662


quicksort	mergesort
0	10	10	
in most cases quicksortwill run faster than mergesort even though the worst-case execution time is longer
961817


vbscript	basic
5	
ruby and perl allow subroutines to be called without parentheses vbc-style languages visual basic vbscript do this too
962109


line	lines
4	
when you had no space between line numbers to add new lines you had to run a renumber utility which caused you to lose any mental anchors you had to what was where
962179


http-post	post
5	
all requests must be sent using http-post
962197


asp.net	asp.net-mvc
5	
it would be very hard to follow asp.net-mvc in classic asp.net if possible so i will reply based on mvp
962236


category	categories
10	
their is much detail behind those category but a useful heuristic to guide your intuition is if you can take the address of an expression such as a variable it is an lvalue there is much more to the story here but this is a good place to start
962358


request	http-request
5	
you can also set up .html extensions to be parsed as php files by apache so every http-request for an .html document is sent back with a header and a footer automagically included
962399


vbscript	jscript
7	0	
while there are certain things that work better with vbscript such as passing arrays back and forth from com objects is slightly easier although it is easier to pass event handlers into com components with jscript i am still surprised by the amount of coders that still use vbscript to script windows - i bet if they wrote the same program in both languages they would find that jscript works with you much more than vbscript because of jscript s native hash data types and closures
962399


vbscript	vba
0	
vb6 vba though a little better than vbscript in general still has many similar issues where for their domain they require much more boiler plate to do simple tasks than what i would like and have seen in other scripting languages
962545


line	lines
0	
the graph came out as two straight line with the c being 4ms faster than the java counterpart over 100 000 random integers
962610


stderr	stdout
5	
on windows use eclipsec.exe instead of eclipse.exe to have build output written to stdout stderr and so that the call blocks until completion
962758


put	get
0	
you just loop through your list and put all elements smaller than your pivot at the beginning and all others at the end - which is not enough to get a sorted list
963076


authorization	authentication
8	
karl fogel discusses this situation and several similar ones in his famous book producing open source software - how to run a successful free software project and comes to the same conclusion strict testing and code review are more helpful than strict authentication
963690


controllers	controller
4	
will it automatically pick this up if i add a new view and controllers method
963814


silverlight	wpf
7	
wpf does this better then silverlight though i don t know if there are improvements in sl3
964006


required	checked
4	
i always prefer checked for conditions that required a break or return rather than those that would need lengthy code execution
964010


static-assert	assert
5	
in c++ static-assert are either part of the standard c++0x or templates that need to be evaluated at compile-time so they can guarantee the assertion
964060


static-assert	assert
1	
there are no static-assert in c# because there are no templates in it generics looks similar to templates but there are a lot of difference and they are not as powerful as templates are
964072


popup	button
4	4	
i have a form consisting of one textbox and button.on clicking on button one popup appears which contains one datagrid from which i can select value such that value appears in textbox using javascript .in ie6 and ie7 i can select value from grid in popup but in ie8 mozilla and chrome iam not able to select.what may be the reason.can anybody help to solve this issue
964256


controllers	controller
5	
even the updates from the view is also send to controllers and it will be routed to model
964379


contains	elements
10	
also have a look at the java.nio package whichcontains faster i o elements than java.io
964541


value	field
8	
sometimes char type is more usable than int - fixed size char doesn t take much storage room and you can see enumerated value directly in database field
964575


inline	function-call
7	
as a side note - it makes sense to inline functions like this because overhead on function-call is bigger then function body although optimising compiler should do it without second thought
964784


proxy	ip-address
7	7	
we put logging on the session hijacking checks to see what was going on and found that these people would come in on one ip and their session would continue on another this wasn t a hijacking attempt however it was to do with how their proxy server worked as a result we amended our session hijacking code to ascertain the class of the ip-address and from there figure out the network portion of the ip-address and store just those parts of the ip-address this is slightly less secure in that session hijacking could theoretically come from inside the same network but caused all our false positives to go away
965313


imagemagick	libjpeg

coff	portable-executable
7	
coff object modules later became the defacto standard for all microsoft win32 development tools and gained an advantage in being much closer in format to portable-executable files - the native executable format for win32 a coff-format linker has much less work to create a 32-bit exe or dll from a coff file than from an omf format file

line	lines
8	
cohesion coupling and complexity are more important metrics than line of code
966858


vb.net	vba
1	
mostly c# followed by xslt xpath t-sql javascript vb.net when it s forced on me power shell vba and html and css if you re counting those
966891


line	lines
0	
of course at the start of small project i can generate many more than ten line of code per day but i tend not to think of the amount of code that i ve written only what it does and how well it does it
966951


line	lines
5	
brooks wasn t about to throw out some sort of arbitrary figure of productivity but he was working from data on real projects and for all i can remember they might have been 12 line day on the average
967679


kde	gnome
5	
b to be hosted in .net applications for automation similar to dcop in kde and how gnome is using corba
967777


hashmap	map
0	7	
however if it is purely a performance decision all other things being equal access pattern doesn t favor one way or the other good hash function sparse map etc. i would think hashmap key x y z would be faster than hashmap x map y z - i want to think that 1 lookup in a larger hashmap is faster than 2 lookups in smaller maps
967805


emacs	textmate
1	0	
i feel like emacs is so much better than textmate
967921


modulus	primes
10	
someone else in this thread makes a somewhat convincing argument that modulus a primes is better for detecting bit-swapping
967976


controllers	controller
5	
the jsp will only be used to display view any data provided by the controllers from the model view-model and to display input elements to allow the user to provide input
968616


asp.net	asp.net-mvc
4	
if you want granular control over your html xhtml output then i would recommend switching to asp.net-mvc
968640


bazaar	git
2	
as for the first tool to choose problem with git bazaar and mercurial is they are distributed vcs s
969073


subclass	subclassing
5	
table name should be passed in constructor or defined in subclassing so that every table has its corresponding dal object
969109


expression-blend	blend
3	
i d recommend using expression-blend
969342


hide	show
5	5	
another way to put it would be write a javascript functions show commonimageid nexttoimageid and hide commonimageid nexttoimageid that would be used like show correct draggable1
969492


ms-dos	windows
5	
but a simple hello world application that just uses the console as output can be compiled on windows linux vms as 400 smartphones freebsd ms-dos cp80 and almost any other system for which you can find a c++ compiler
969492


delphi	c++
2	
those developers often have to choose between delphi or c++ or else convince management to move to .net development
969562


internet-explorer	firefox
4	
i recommend this tool rather than simply using firebug and firefox because not all errors that occur in internet-explorer will occur in firefox and so performing any debugging in that browser may not yield any results
969592


submission	submit
5	
this way the value of the submit button will be ignored upon submission the form
969743


selection	selected
5	
the javascript will be used to populate a listbox based on theselectedion in another listbox
970271


authorization	authentication
5	
i know that the attribute is designed to be used for authorization purposes but is it also a best practice to use this attribute for authentication
970621


elementtree	lxml
4	
i would normally recommend lxml but since that uses a c-library libxml the alternative would have to be as aaron has already suggested elementtree as far as i know there is both a pure python and a c implementation of it available
970947


archive	backup
5	
its important to take a new backup now as old archive logs will not be able to be used with this db since you ve reset the logs
970960


java	python
0	
in other words python threads are really much less rich than java s -- not to mention that only one thread per process can in fact run python code others may be running c code or waiting
971052


sorted	set
0	
jason day my original implementation to this problem was to use a trie but the memory bloat with that was actually worse than the sorted set due to needing a large number of object references
971393


subclass	base-class
0	
unless there is good reason i d avoid having a subclass constructor with fewer parameters than the base-class .
971975


listener	listeners
8	
the main issue is that web applications are my there nature concurrent and multi user this doesn t lend it self to longer lived objects with listener and events etc
972231


cmake	autotools
2	
i did similar thing now but i was able to choose between autotools and cmake
972259


line	lines
0	
to a lesser extent loc has also been helpful as a relative measure if we see a class come in that has 20 more line than the average class. coupling has been less useful usually most helpful when looking at how many things we might break with a change
972380


expression-blend	blend
0	
now we are in the design phase for the project and feel comfortable enough to look forward to getting more work with expression-blend
972409


triggers	insert
5	
it sure would have been nice if the database design had worked such details into table triggers or else provided a stored procedure api for such operations as insert new records into these tables
972443


dialog	pop-up
4	
i have a dropdown with some products and i want to give the user the ability to add a new product so when they select add new it will pop-up a dialog and when they are done it will insert the new product into a table in the database
972552


jbpm	drools
0	
drools flow is at lot more sophisticated and powerful than both jbpm and osworkflow and development is moving at a faster pace than either
972589


entity	repository
1	
i m not very familiar with repository patterns but what if you delete the old entity from the database and put the new entity in the database with the same id
972652


postgresql	mysql
5	
the application is developped with php and zend framework database should be mysqlor postgresql
972679


commit	rollback
7	
furthermore as somebody else mentioned having smaller commit makes it easier to rollback a previous modification if you change your mind later
972822


maven	sbt
7	0	0	
its configuration is significantly cleaner than either maven s or sbt s and its startup time is orders of magnitude less when running under mri
973071


arrays	linked-list
0	
as you most likely know randomly accessing an element takes a bit more time with a linked-list as opposed to an arrays
973083


google-chrome	firefox
4	
you could also just recommend google-chrome or firefox
973476


trac	redmine
4	
i would recommend redmine similar with trac in many aspects
973506


linq	linq-to-sql
7	
the linq-to-sql seems better for poco would it
973690


shadow	opacity
7	
basically i need the opacity of the shadow elements 4 individual ones to start at 10 opacity and while the user hovers the type moves down this part is working and simultaneously the shadow becomes stronger increases to 60 opacity
973758


config	properties-file
5	
javassist cannot be used through xml config file of hibernate it requires hibernate.properties-file where the project i am working on used hibernate.cfg.xml
974312


json	xml
8	
i suspect json will be a bit more compact than xml although if they re compressing the data you may well find they end up taking the same bandwith as a lot of the bloat of xml is easily compressible
974347


json	xml
7	
note simplexml is the easier to work with xml lib but also parses the whole xml-file at once so in this case there s no benefit over json
974354


trace	debugging
5	
finally be warned that debugging access violations using windbg can be a fairly involed and complex process - if you can get a stack trace another way then you might want to try that first
974793


line	lines
4	
the -x option specifies that grep should match line rather than the whole text
974796


value	field
4	
join the table with the primary key to the rest of the tables or on any other field where field value of one table should match field value of other table
974798


cell	cells
5	
html table should be displayed in cell of excel sheet
974819


for-loop	loops
4	
i prefer this variant over the c-style for-loops
975479


linux	unix
5	
the easiest way to do that was in unix not entirely certain about the fsync in linux but you should be guaranteed that this wil happen eventually unless the system itself goes down
975520


inner-join	join
10	
so yes the inner-join is probably faster
975587


try-catch	exception-handling
7	
it depends - if it fails because something is definitely wrong then an exception-handling makes programming easier - you don t write a try-catch around each call you just let the exception-handling bubble up
975738


controllers	controller
5	
if you ever need to modify how this part of the model needs to be updated this is the controllers action to look for and update
976567


selected	button
4	
for instance i want a button or link to select this record and have the server send them an email or flag them in the database or even something as simple as changing the style of the selected row so as to bring the user s focus to it
976769


controllers	controller
3	
i would recommend using mpmovieplayer controllers as long as you are only doing simple streaming
976820


asp.net-mvc	wcf
1	0	
if so my testing says that asp.net-mvc with output caching turned on is very much faster than wcf
977339


aspect	aspects
3	
i nearly always favor using linq over standard looping constructs in my collections but the parallelization aspects changes things slightly
977404


c++	python
4	
a lot of people recommend either c++ with sdl or python with pygame
977439


tcp-ip	tcp
5	
assuming tcp-ip the socket could be configured to send a packet on every write instead of buffering output in the kernel until the buffer is full or the socket is explicitly flushed
977462


vim	emacs
10	8	10	
emacs is more powerful than vim it s scripting engine is far more flexible and there are far more scripts modes and the likes built around emacs
977462


vim	emacs
7	7	
maybe not productive in the same way - i d say vim is quicker for editing files emacs is better at doing everything else again i would personally say things like flymake-mode vcs bindings are such are quicker to use than the vim equivalent
977638


c++	python
5	
python is very easy to learn compared to c++ so you can be up to speed a lot quicker in doing basic programming tasks
977638


c++	python
5	
c++ has a lot of power but has many ways to shoot yourself in the foot compared to python not saying that can t be done in python
977676


constructor	private
10	
this is a more or less complicated design choice unless your class is a utility class in which case you should have only one private constructor
977880


ruby	python
5	
ruby and python s dynamism means that both are more amenable to metaprogramming than f# is types can be modified at runtime for instance
978207


relational-database	schema
5	5	
this is a coding horror relational-database schema should not be written like this
978210


key	key-value
7	
edit in reponse to your comment be aware that if you are trying to iterate over all key-value pairs in a map there is a better way than iterating over the key and calling get for each
978545


constructor	object
5	
i wanted something that needed to be created a runtime not while wiring up object that also had parameters to it s constructor
978590


webserver	web-services
10	
consuming the web-services is more efficient because there are a lot more things you can do to scale your web-services and webserver via caching etc.
978945


thin	passenger
10	
also with workling you don t have to use starling as the queue it also uses amqp stuff but this is more easily integrated into an environment that uses eventmachine like thin or evented mongrel so if you are using passenger it s a bit more difficult
979008


google-chrome	safari
10	
air is more like safari and google-chrome
979030


line	lines
7	0	
stop using complex base classes no base classes with more than 7 line should exist
979049


union	union-all
10	8	
but i think union-all is much more efficient than union
979454


default-value	default
5	
instead they should be assigned a default-value just before their use
979984


zero	digits
5	
# is in most languages used as an optional digits as opposed to 0 which is a mandatory digits to be used to get leading trailing zero
980170


relevance	scoring
0	
i believe your answers will have a much greater relevance than scoring a few so points so please contribute what you can even if the bounty has expired
980462


type-safety	primitive-types
4	
which means primitive-types get boxed and that we lose type-safety
980637


linux	unix
4	10	7	7	
i recommend intel compiler if your on linux unix it s got better support than gcc and produces faster smaller binaries i normally get a free 10 performance boost using it
980662


arrays	loops
7	
you can skip some comparisons when the arrays are sorted and start with the inner loops with the element after the last match and break it if the value is larger
980929


tcp-ip	tcp
7	7	
udp is great if you plan to have your client for the game account for missing information by using approximation most fps games do this as well as just about any game that requires very quick reflexes where tcp-ip is simpler will greatly reduce errors in transmission and be more prone to lag
980962


processor	processors
10	10	
on many processor integer multiplication is faster than integer division
981551


windows-mobile	symbian
4	
i have access to a bunch of phones but i would prefer symbian s60 or windows-mobile
982326


int	unsigned-integer
7	
rather than that approach and assuming that each of your version string elements is less than 255 you could just take each element as a byte in a 32 bit unsigned int
982437


richfaces	icefaces
7	7	7	
my personal experience with both richfaces mixed better with other jsf libs icefaces has more advanced ajax capabilities like server sided push kinda like comet the basic ajax functionality is easier to set up and use but plays difficult sometimes when you mix it with other jsf libs
982486


joystick	mouse
7	
you may want to use some movement controls such as a quadratic gradient to speedup slowdown the mouse movements the longer the joystick is pushed in one direction for instance
982891


scrollbars	scrollbar
7	
if the height is less than that the scrollbar disappear -- probably because there is not enough room to show the arrow icons
982912


binary-tree	tree
1	
i am somewhat familiar with tree like data structure and traversing a binary-tree using recursion
983313


category	categories
5	
you could separate the render part dynamically generated apart from what to render based on category
983324


non-ascii-characters	non-printing-characters
4	
this statement matches non-ascii-characters as well as ascii control non-printing-characters such as bell tab null and others
983555


dto	lazy-loading
5	
from a subjective point of view i would say that entities should be complete by definitions considering lazy-loading and could completely or partially be loaded to dto s to optimized the amount of data sent to clients
983666


nant	msbuild
5	
if you are on the latest versions of vs then the solution files can be built with msbuild which is basically a nant equivalent
984212


physics-engine	physx
5	
so far from seeing physx as the obvious choice for high-end game development i d say it should be avoided unless either you don t think people with amd cards make up a significant fraction of your player base highly unlikely or you have enough coding and qa manpower to test two physics-engines more plausible though if your company is that wealthy i ve heard good things about havok
984280


php	python
4	
i would normally recommend python as a good next language but here in brisbane there are 10x as many job opportunites if you know php
984603


stderr	stdout
1	
if you truly don t need stdout or stderr from the program being timed this is a fine way to do this and should be as efficient as any other method
984705


line	lines
7	0	
for example let s assume you can guarantee that each list element never occupies more than one line is always terminated with on the same line never contains any markup such as a list that contains a list then you can use awk to do this but you need to write a whole awk program that first finds lines that contain list elements then uses other awk commands to find just the substring you are interested in
985041


c++	python
7	
personally i m a c++ and python guy and i would probably go with c++ because this sounds like a relatively intensive project and i do most of my best high level design in c++ great for building fast flexible code base while i tend to use python for things like django where there is less application logic but being able to tune the function look and feel quickly is very important
985260


c++	python
10	8	
but python is certainly more productive than c++ in a given amount of time you will get more things done in python than in c++ unless you are a much better programmer in c++ than in python
985260


c++	python
8	
also if there is a need to interact with scientific people who are not programmers python will be more readable than c++
985284


sniffing	traffic
5	
sniffing the traffic would reveal the submission url and what variables needed to be passed in order to update the score
985393


controllers	controller
2	
ie the user selects option with value 123 when the form is returned from the post to the controllers the selected option is not re-selected via the jquery reload
985647


tcp-ip	tcp
7	7	
slow down each connection slightly the connection is being established over a dialup or the network is having a high-error retry rate - so the tcp-ip ack takes longer than ideal out of your control os level thing
986158


kernel	page-fault
7	
i guess the original conditions for which exceptions where raised for like page-faults and stack overflows were conditions noticed by the kernel that was informing the user mode of the condition and not exception the user code was throwing onto himself so the term makes more sense in that context
986203


emacs	nano
4	
a lot of people in the #python channel of freenode seem to prefer vim emacs nano and similar text editors in favor of ide s
986695


throw	throws
4	
while looking through the spring mvc framework i noticed that unless i misunderstand its developers favor throws exception instead of throw multiple exceptions
986860


asp.net-mvc	webforms
1	
the asp.net-mvc view objects are vastly different than asp.net webforms with server controls--you get straight up html
987041


web-config	app-config
4	
i want them to both be able to use the data access project but the data access app has to grab configuration from its configuration file...so web-config for the web project and app-config for the console service apps
987188


aspect	aspects
5	
data mining is an aspects of bi in that data mining can be used on massive amounts of data for knowledge discovery and predicition using tools that implement algorithms such as clustering neural networks etc
987239


http	https
10	
if i mix http and https it requires more coding cross domain problems
987240


throw	throws
1	
so since pretty much everything with spring is designed to make it as easy and lightweight for you to integrate with as possible it s easier for them to specify that the interface method merely throw exception
987469


malloc	free
1	
it really depends on the memory allocator you re using however i think by default malloc and free are non-reentrant as they maintain the list of blocks of memory in a static list
987505


line	lines
5	
on the other hand if i were to write this pattern over several line i would have used braces and indented the pattern
987771


ruby	python
7	
i can t answer for everything but the library support for scientific and mathematic libraries in python is much greater than that for ruby
987793


ruby	python
8	
python is in general a much more mature language than ruby in my opinion and as a result many more developers have been encouraged others to develop mature libraries
987793


ruby-on-rails	django
7	0	2	
conversely python is much more popular than ruby for doing just about everything else and is beginning to compete with ruby-on-rails with solutions like django as well as the google app engine
987794


ruby	python
8	
python in general is more mature than ruby ruby appeared in the englih-speking worlds only in this century but in terms of libraries one can only say it depends
987794


c++	python
10	10	
imho python is better for mathematical stuff and for working with c++ applications while ruby is better for everyday scripting and creating simple web applications
987923


line	lines
5	
here you can see the two relevant line of code which gave me huge performance increases using mootools but can be ported to jquery
987951


asp.net-mvc	webforms
5	
this can even be done in webforms and not just asp.net-mvc
988255


default-value	default
5	
if its value is true this is the default-value the module should be loaded at startup
988558


javascript	dom
1	
it is not possible with dom and javascript on web browser so you should use ajax or sth similar to process xml
988725


windows-vista	windows
5	
that behavior seems to be broken under windows-vista
989209


ant	maven
0	
i find the ant one much clearer than the maven one
989325


platform	target-platform
7	
unless you are willing to tie your code to a specific compiler and target-platform there is no better way
989499


static-class	static-classes
5	
2 static extension methods can only be added to static-classes
989576


processor	processors
5	
eventually we wont be able to get faster eventually we will be limited by space hence why you see newer processor under 3ghz and multi core
989640


c++	python
10	10	0	
well the truth is that c++ is faster than java is faster than pretty much everything else actually but sometimes c++ code can be poorly written and java may prevent beginners to make some mistakes resulting in many of the claims that java is as fast as c++ there are even claims that python psyco are as fast as c++ and faster than java
989711


command-line	cmd
4	
does anyone recommend any particular cmd-line svn client for windows
989767


cxf	saaj
0	
in general using saaj will be slower than cxf since it doesn t allow streaming which cxf would normally do
990022


arguments	default
5	
inspect.getargumentspec func returns a tuple with four items arguments vararguments varkw defaults len arguments is the primary arity but arity can be anything from that to infinity if you have vararguments and or varkw not none and some arguments may be omitted and default if defaults is not none
990043


controllers	controller
7	
supervising controllers is less work but less testable
990055


java	scala
1	
and last it seems like a very fast language nearly as fast as java and really close or beating the second fastest language on the jm scala
990095


records	procedure
4	
guys i am trying to write a stored procedure in t-sql sql server that will select records based on a date field keeping a variance of minutes in mind
990378


pycurl	urllib
10	
i ended up with my own retrieve implementation with the help of pycurl it supports more protocols than urllib urllib2 hope it can help other people
990394


set	any
4	
and the expressions mean to match any character other than those described in the character set
990413


single-table-inheritance	activerecord
5	
there are two activerecord constructs that could be used within this scenario they are single-table-inheritance and polymorphic inheritance
990658


linq	linq-to-sql
10	
use linq-to-sql it s no longer dead
990735


editor	text-editor
5	
i think this in my mind at least would work without requiring additional markup in the source files so users of plain text-editor wouldn t be disadvantaged by having all this extra markup cluttering the files
990780


innodb	myisam
10	
i heard myisam is faster but others say innodb can be fast also but it takes abit more to optimize it
990815


listview	listviewitem
0	
i have gotten advice to not return the items in question in the retrieve_item event that i do not want displayed but when i do not return anything less than a listview item cached from an array of listviewitems holding all my listview items in question i get an exception error saying that i must return a valid listviewitem in the retrievevirtualitem event like it reads in the msdn it will do
990822


progress-bar	progress
7	0	
this gives you more control over the upload process and you can display a progress-bar during upload more user-friendly
990830


innodb	myisam
7	
innodb is slower for read only databases because it has features acid compliant row level locking that myisam leaves out
990835


tcp-ip	tcp
0	
in a regular hosted environment on one of those cheap webhosters like dreamhost with around 1000 articles in joomla a couple of users and a few hundreds visitors a day would a sqlite database with a persistent connection sqlite_popen perform noticeable faster than the mysql equivalent with the tcp-ip overhead etc.
990985


editor	text-editor
8	
change to an editor that directly supports markdown a simple text-editor will do but you could go for a more advanced text-editor with markdown mode such as vim markdown mode
991211


asp.net	webforms
1	
you can also embrace standards such as xhtml 1.1 strict which is almost impossible with asp.net webforms due to the auto generated html
991255


asp.net-mvc	webforms
0	
the other things in already established mvp architecture with web forms in my app give me more flexibility than pure asp.net-mvc approach without webforms which i like although require a bit more code than ms asp.net-mvc examples never tried it for real project to see if it stays that way like in those examples in screencasts
991615


height	width
7	
when a user uploads an image get the dimensions of it then work out which is greater theheight or the width
991737


friend-function	argument-dependent-lookup
5	
i friend-function definitions within classes can only be found by argument-dependent-lookup when called from outside the class definition
992367


url-encoding	url
5	
look at the stringwithcontentsofurl-encoding error method of nsstring - it lets you pass in a url as an instance of nsurl which can easily be instantiated from nsstring and returns a string with the complete contents of the page at that url
992502


cell	cells
0	
but if i scroll more than 0.5 cell up or down the app will crash
993282


json	xml
10	
i m building classes that interface with the twitter api and i m wondering whether php s built-in xml or json parser is faster
993321


json	xml
10	
since json is only a description of nested string sequences without the need to offer a dom interface attributes parsing and other subtle stuff my guess is that a json parser is way faster that an xml parser
993495


arrays	loops

however neither is quite as rich as you require for example to present the same data as bytes or halfwords you need to copy it between two arrays the numpy third-party add-on is much more powerful for interpreting the same area of memory in several different ways and for example to display some bytes in hex there s nothing much bundled beyond a simple loops or list comprehension such as

cell	cells
0	
numpy s arrays are more compact than python lists -- a list of lists as you describe in python would take at least 20 mb or so while a numpy 3d array with single-precision floats in the cell would fit in 4 mb

hostname	ip-address

i would just use ocaml but haskell s syntax is so much better than ocaml s and haskell is pure and has cool features such as type classes

i need help here on how we need to decide a property can be converted to radio-button or list box etc

copy-paste	paste

ruby	python

why not python or ruby both of which have excellent web frameworks available and are much easier to learn than perl but much better-designed than php

it s almost certainly over-clever and should probably be separated into viewdidload and viewwillappear rather than two versions of viewwillappear

pipe	tail

this is less than ideal obviously because of the increase in disk io due to these temp files -- what i really would like is an enhanced tail -f that would terminate the pipe cleanly after a certain number of seconds

rational-numbers	digits
0	
which everyone knows has an infinite number of non-repeating digits in its decimal expression which means it cannot be expressed as a fraction so it will be left over and that means that the set of irrational-numbers is larger than the set of counting numbers
